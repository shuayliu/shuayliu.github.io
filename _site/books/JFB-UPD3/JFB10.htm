 <B>1. David had abode two days in Ziklag</B>--Though greatly reduced by the
 Amalekite incendiaries, that town was not so completely sacked and
 destroyed, but David and his six hundred followers, with their
 families, could still find some accommodation.</P>

 <B>2-12. a man came out of the camp from Saul</B>--As the narrative of Saul's
 death, given in the last chapter, is inspired, it must be considered
 the true account, and the Amalekite's story a fiction of his own,
 invented to ingratiate himself with David, the presumptive successor to
 the throne. David's question, "How went the matter?" evinces the
 deep interest he took in the war, an interest that sprang from feelings
 of high and generous patriotism, not from views of ambition. The
 Amalekite, however, judging him to be actuated by a selfish principle,
 fabricated a story improbable and inconsistent, which he thought would
 procure him a reward. Having probably witnessed the suicidal act of
 Saul, he thought of turning it to his own account, and suffered the
 penalty of his grievously mistaken calculation (compare

 <B>13-15. David said unto the young man .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Whence art thou?</B>--The man
 had at the outset stated who he was. But the question was now formally
 and judicially put. The punishment inflicted on the Amalekite may seem
 too severe, but the respect paid to kings in the West must not be
 regarded as the standard for that which the East may think due to royal
 station. David's reverence for Saul, as the Lord's anointed, was in his
 mind a principle on which he had faithfully acted on several occasions
 of great temptation. In present circumstances it was especially
 important that his principle should be publicly known; and to free
 himself from the imputation of being in any way accessory to the
 execrable crime of regicide was the part of a righteous judge, no less
 than of a good politician.</P>

 <B>17, 18. David lamented with this lamentation</B>--It has always been
 customary for Eastern people, on the death of great kings and warriors,
 to celebrate their qualities and deeds in funeral songs. This
 inimitable pathetic elegy is supposed by many writers to have become a
 national war song, and to have been taught to the young Israelites
 under the name of "The Bow," in conformity with the practice of Hebrew
 and many classical writers in giving titles to their songs from the
 principal theme 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:1,56:1,60:1,80:1,100:1">Ps 22:1; 56:1; 60:1; 80:1; 100:1</A>).

 Although the words "the use of" are a supplement by our translators,
 they may be rightly introduced, for the natural sense of this 
 parenthetical verse is, that David took immediate measures for 
 instructing the people in the knowledge and practice of archery, their 
 great inferiority to the enemy in this military arm having been the 
 main cause of the late national disaster.</P>

 the genial atmospheric influences which, in those anciently cultivated
 hills, seem to have reared plenty of first-fruits in the corn harvests,
 was specified as the greatest calamity the lacerated feelings of the
 poet could imagine. The curse seems still to lie upon them; for the
 mountains of Gilboa are naked and sterile.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away</B>--To cast away the shield
 was counted a national disgrace. Yet, on that fatal battle of Gilboa,
 many of the Jewish soldiers, who had displayed unflinching valor in
 former battles, forgetful of their own reputation and their country's
 honor, threw away their shields and fled from the field. This
 dishonorable and cowardly conduct is alluded to with exquisitely
 touching pathos.</P>

 <B>24-27. Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in
 scarlet, with other delights,</B> &c.--The fondness for dress, which
 anciently distinguished Oriental women, is their characteristic still.
 It appears in their love of bright, gay, and divers colors, in profuse
 display of ornaments, and in various other forms. The inmost depths of
 the poet's feeling are stirred, and his amiable disposition appears in
 the strong desire to celebrate the good qualities of Saul, as well as
 Jonathan. But the praises of the latter form the burden of the poem,
 which begins and ends with that excellent prince.</P>

 He knew his destination, but he knew also that the providence of God
 would pave the way. Therefore he would take no step in such a crisis of
 his own and the nation's history, without asking and obtaining the
 divine direction. He was told to go into Judah, and fix his
 headquarters in Hebron, whither he accordingly repaired with his now
 considerable force. There his interests were very powerful; for he was
 not only within his own tribe, and near chiefs with whom he had been
 long in friendly relations (see on

 <A HREF="JFB09.htm#1Sa30_26">1Sa 30:26</A>),

 but Hebron was the capital and center of Judah, and one of the
 Levitical cities; the inhabitants of which were strongly attached to 
 him, both from sympathy with his cause ever since the massacre at Nob, 
 and from the prospect of realizing in his person their promised 
 pre-eminence among the tribes.  The princes of Judah, therefore, 
 offered him the crown over their tribe, and it was accepted. More could 
 not, with prudence, be done in the circumstances of the country

 be no doubt that this message of thanks for their bold and dangerous
 enterprise in rescuing the bodies of Saul and his sons was an
 expression of David's personal and genuine feeling of satisfaction. At
 the same time, it was a stroke of sound and timely policy. In this view
 the announcement of his royal power in Judah, accompanied by the pledge
 of his protection of the men of Jabesh-gilead, should they be exposed to
 danger for their adventure at Beth-shan, would bear an important
 significance in all parts of the country and hold out an assurance that
 he would render them the same timely and energetic succor that Saul had
 done at the beginning of his reign.</P>

 <B>Abner</B>--was first cousin of Saul, commander of the forces, and held
 in high respect throughout the country. Loyalty to the house of his
 late master was mixed up with opposition to David and views of personal
 ambition in his originating this factious movement. He, too, was alive
 to the importance of securing the eastern tribes; so, taking
 Ish-bosheth across the Jordan, he proclaimed him king at Mahanaim, a
 town on the north bank of the Jabbok, hallowed in patriarchal times by
 the divine presence 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:2">Ge 32:2</A>).

 of Joab, to watch his movements.</P>

 little tilting match for diversion. Others suppose that, both parties
 being reluctant to commence a civil war, Abner proposed to leave the
 contest to the decision of twelve picked men on either side. This fight
 by championship instead of terminating the matter, inflamed the
 fiercest passions of the two rival parties; a general engagement
 ensued, in which Abner and his forces were defeated and put to flight.</P>

 <B>19-32. Asahel pursued after Abner</B>--To gain the general's armor was
 deemed the grandest trophy. Asahel, ambitious of securing Abner's, had
 outstripped all other pursuers, and was fast gaining on the retreating
 commander. Abner, conscious of possessing more physical power, and
 unwilling that there should be "blood" between himself and Joab,
 Asahel's brother, twice urged him to desist. The impetuous young
 soldier being deaf to the generous remonstrance, the veteran raised the
 pointed butt of his lance, as the modern Arabs do when pursued, and,
 with a sudden back thrust, transfixed him on the spot, so that he fell,
 and lay weltering in his blood. But Joab and Abishai continued the
 pursuit by another route till sunset. On reaching a rising ground, and
 receiving a fresh reinforcement of some Benjamites, Abner rallied his
 scattered troops and earnestly appealed to Joab's better feelings to
 stop the further effusion of blood, which, if continued, would lead to
 more serious consequences--a destructive civil war. Joab, while
 upbraiding his opponent as the sole cause of the fray, felt the force
 of the appeal and led off his men; while Abner probably dreading a
 renewal of the attack when Joab should learn his brother's fate, and
 vow fierce revenge, endeavored, by a forced march, to cross the Jordan
 that night. On David's side the loss was only nineteen men, besides
 Asahel. But of Ish-bosheth's party there fell three hundred and sixty.
 This skirmish is exactly similar to the battles of the Homeric
 warriors, among whom, in the flight of one, the pursuit by another, and
 the dialogue held between them, there is vividly represented the style
 of ancient warfare.</P>

 the wives and concubines of a king are the property of his successor to
 this extent, that for a private person to aspire to marry one of them
 would be considered a virtual advance of pretensions to the crown (see
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:17">1Ki 2:17</A>).

 It is not clear whether the accusation against Abner was well or ill
 founded. But he resented the charge as an indignity, and, impelled by 
 revenge, determined to transfer all the weight of his influence to the 
 opposite party. He evidently set a full value on his services, and 
 seems to have lorded it over his weak nephew in a haughty, overbearing 
 manner.</P>

 secret conviction, that in supporting Ish-bosheth he had been laboring
 to frustrate the divine purpose of conferring the sovereignty of the
 kingdom on David, this acknowledgment was no justification either of
 the measure he was now adopting, or of the motives that prompted it.
 Nor does it seem possible to uphold the full integrity and honor of
 David's conduct in entertaining his secret overtures for undermining
 Ish-bosheth, except we take into account the divine promise of the
 kingdom, and his belief that the secession of Abner was a means
 designed by Providence for accomplishing it. The demand for the
 restoration of his wife Michal was perfectly fair; but David's
 insisting on it at that particular moment, as an indispensable
 condition of his entering into any treaty with Abner, seems to have
 proceeded not so much from a lingering attachment as from an
 expectation that his possession of her would incline some adherents of
 the house of Saul to be favorable to his cause.</P>

 <B>17-21. Abner had communication with the elders of Israel</B>--He spoke the
 truth in impressing their minds with the well-known fact of David's
 divine designation to the kingdom. But he acted a base and hypocritical
 part in pretending that his present movement was prompted by religious
 motives, when it sprang entirely from malice and revenge against
 Ish-bosheth. The particular appeal of the Benjamites was a necessary
 policy; their tribe enjoyed the honor of giving birth to the royal
 dynasty of Saul; they would naturally be disinclined to lose that
 <I>prestige.</I> They were, besides, a determined people, whose contiguity
 to Judah might render them troublesome and dangerous. The enlistment of
 their interest, therefore, in the scheme, would smooth the way for the
 adhesion of the other tribes; and Abner enjoyed the most convenient
 opportunity of using his great influence in gaining over that tribe
 while escorting Michal to David with a suitable equipage. The mission
 enabled him to cover his treacherous designs against his master--to
 draw the attention of the elders and people to David as uniting in
 himself the double recommendation of being the nominee of Jehovah, no
 less than a connection of the royal house of Saul, and, without
 suspicion of any dishonorable motives, to advocate policy of
 terminating the civil discord, by bestowing the sovereignty on the
 husband of Michal. In the same character of public ambassador, he was
 received and feted by David; and while, ostensibly, the restoration of
 Michal was the sole object of his visit, he busily employed himself in
 making private overtures to David for bringing over to his cause those
 tribes which he had artfully seduced. Abner pursued a course unworthy
 of an honorable man and though his offer was accepted by David, the
 guilt and infamy of the transaction were exclusively his.</P>

 <B>24-27. Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?</B>--Joab's
 knowledge of Abner's wily character might have led him to doubt the
 sincerity of that person's proposals and to disapprove the policy of
 relying on his fidelity. But undoubtedly there were other reasons of a
 private and personal nature which made Joab displeased and alarmed by
 the reception given to Abner. The military talents of that general, his
 popularity with the army, his influence throughout the nation, rendered
 him a formidable rival. In the event of his overtures being carried
 out, the important service of bringing over all the other tribes to the
 king of Judah would establish so strong a claim on the gratitude of
 David, that his accession would inevitably raise a serious obstacle to
 the ambition of Joab. To these considerations was added the remembrance
 of the blood feud that existed between them since the death of his
 brother Asahel 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+2:23">2Sa 2:23</A>).

 Determined, therefore, to get Abner out of the way, Joab feigned some
 reason, probably in the king's name, for recalling him, and, going out 
 to meet him, stabbed him unawares; not within Hebron, for it was a city 
 of refuge, but at a noted well in the neighborhood.</P>

 funeral honors he appointed for Abner.

 open war 

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+2:23">2Sa 2:23</A>],

 Joab had not the right of the Goel. Besides, he had adopted a lawless
 and execrable method of obtaining satisfaction (see on

 <A HREF="JFB11.htm#1Ki2_5">1Ki 2:5</A>).

 The deed was an insult to the authority, as well as most damaging to
 the prospects of the king. But David's feelings and conduct on hearing 
 of the death, together with the whole character and accompaniments of 
 the funeral solemnity, tended not only to remove all suspicion of guilt 
 from him, but even to turn the tide of popular opinion in his favor, 
 and to pave the way for his reigning over all the tribes more honorably 
 than by the treacherous negotiations of Abner.</P>

 this place, which had hitherto remained in the hands of the natives. It
 was strongly fortified and deemed so impregnable that the blind and
 lame were sent to man the battlements, in derisive mockery of the
 Hebrew king's attack, and to shout, "David cannot come in hither." To

 The Chaldee version renders the words, "came to the place prepared for
 the reception of the ark," that is, near the city of David

 Fearing that the ark was in danger of being overturned, Uzzah, under
 the impulse of momentary feeling, laid hold of it to keep it steady. 
 Whether it fell and crushed him, or some sudden disease attacked him, 
 he fell dead upon the spot. This melancholy occurrence not only threw a 
 cloud over the joyous scene, but entirely stopped the procession; for 
 the ark was left where it then was, in the near neighborhood of the 
 capital. It is of importance to observe the proportionate severity of 
 the punishments attending the profanation of the ark. The Philistines 
 suffered by diseases, from which they were relieved by their oblations, 
 because the law had not been given to them

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+5:8-12">1Sa 5:8-12</A>];

 the Bethshemites also suffered, but not fatally

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:19">1Sa 6:19</A>];

 their error proceeded from ignorance or inadvertency. But Uzzah, who
 was a Levite, and well instructed, suffered death for his breach of the 
 law. The severity of Uzzah's fate may seem to us too great for the 
 nature and degree of the offense. But it does not become us to sit in 
 judgment on the dispensations of God; and, besides, it is apparent that 
 the divine purpose was to inspire awe of His majesty, a submission to 
 His law, and a profound veneration for the symbols and ordinances of 
 His worship.</P>

 dreading that the displeasure of God had been provoked by the removal
 of the ark, that the punishment would be extended to himself and
 people, and that they might fall into some error or neglect during the
 further conveyance of the ark. He resolved, therefore, to wait for more
 light and direction as to the path of duty. An earlier consultation by
 Urim would have led him right at the first, whereas in this perplexity

 discovery of his former error. Having learned that the ark was kept in
 its temporary resting-place not only without inconvenience or danger,
 but with great advantage, he resolved forthwith to remove it to the
 capital, with the observance of all due form and solemnity

 measuring-line, were put to death. Our version makes him put two-thirds

 one-half. This war usage was not, perhaps, usually practised by the
 people of God; but Jewish writers assert that the cause of this

 This kingdom was bounded on the east by the Euphrates, and it extended
 westward from that river, perhaps as far north as Aleppo. It was long 
 the chief among the petty kingdoms of Syria, and its king bore the 
 hereditary title of "Hadadezer" or "Hadarezer" ("Hadad," that is, 
 "helped").

 In the first campaign David signally defeated Hadadezer. Besides a
 great number of foot prisoners, he took from him an immense amount of 
 booty in chariots and horses. Reserving only a small number of the 
 latter, he hamstrung the rest. The horses were thus mutilated because 
 they were forbidden to the Hebrews, both in war and agriculture. So it 
 was of no use to keep them. Besides, their neighbors placed much 
 dependence on cavalry, but having, for want of a native breed, to 
 procure them by purchase, the greatest damage that could be done to 
 such enemies was to render their horses unserviceable in war. (See also

 A king of Damascene-Syria came to Hadadezer's succor; but David routed

 garrisons into their fortified towns, and made them tributary.</P>

 inquiry, Saul's land steward was found, who gave information that there
 still survived Mephibosheth, a son of Jonathan who was five years old
 at his father's death, and whom David, then wandering in exile, had
 never seen. His lameness 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+4:4">2Sa 4:4</A>)

 had prevented him from taking any part in the public contests of the

 crowned monarch has a preferable claim to the succession over the son 
 of a mere heir-apparent; and hence his name was never heard of as the 
 rival of his uncle Ish-bosheth. His insignificance had led to his being 
 lost sight of, and it was only through Ziba that David learned of his 
 existence, and the retired life he passed with one of the great 
 families in trans-jordanic Canaan who remained attached to the fallen 
 dynasty. Mephibosheth was invited to court, and a place at the royal 
 table on public days was assigned him, as is still the custom with 
 Eastern monarchs. Saul's family estate, which had fallen to David in

 Nahash, as his father showed kindness unto me</B>--It is probable that
 this was the Nahash against whom Saul waged war at Jabesh-gilead

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:11">1Sa 11:11</A>).

 David, on leaving Gath, where his life was exposed to danger, found an
 asylum with the king of Moab; and as Nahash, king of the Ammonites, was 
 his nearest neighbor, it may be that during the feud between Saul and 
 David, he, through enmity to the former, was kind and hospitable to 
 David.</P>

 Orientals, the curtailment of their garments must have given them an
 aspect of gross indelicacy and ludicrousness. Besides, a knowledge of
 the extraordinary respect and value which has always been attached, and
 the gross insult that is implied in any indignity offered, to the beard
 in the East, will account for the shame which the deputies felt, and
 the determined spirit of revenge which burst out in all Israel on
 learning the outrage. Two instances are related in the modern history
 of Persia, of similar insults by kings of haughty and imperious temper,
 involving the nation in war; and we need not, therefore, be surprised
 that David vowed revenge for this wanton and public outrage.</P>

 chastise those insolent and inhospitable Ammonites, who had violated
 the common law of nations, David sent a large army under the command of
 Joab, while they, informed of the impending attack, made energetic
 preparations to repel it by engaging the services of an immense number
 of Syrian mercenaries.

 the native troops covering the city, while the Syrian mercenaries lay
 at some distance encamped in the fields. In making the attack, Joab 
 divided his forces into two separate detachments--the one of which, 
 under the command of his brother, Abishai, was to concentrate its 
 attack upon the city, while he himself marched against the overwhelming 
 host of mercenary auxiliaries. It was a just and necessary war that had 
 been forced on Israel, and they could hope for the blessing of God upon 
 their arms.  With great judgment the battle opened against the 
 mercenaries, who could not stand against the furious onset of Joab, and 
 not feeling the cause their own, consulted their safety by flight. The 
 Ammonites, who had placed their chief dependence upon a foreign aid, 
 then retreated to entrench themselves within the walls of the town.</P>

 But alarmed at the increasing power and greatness of David, as well as
 being an ally of the Ammonites, he levied a vast army not only in 
 Syria, but in Mesopotamia, to invade the Hebrew kingdom.  Shobach, his 
 general, in pursuance of this design, had marched his troops as far as 
 Kelam, a border town of eastern Manasseh, when David, crossing the 
 Jordan by forced marches, suddenly surprised, defeated, and dispersed 
 them. As a result of this great and decisive victory, all the petty 
 kingdoms of Syria submitted and became his tributaries (see on

 the usual time of commencing military operations. This expedition took
 place the year following the war against the Syrians; and it was
 entered upon because the disaster of the former campaign having fallen
 chiefly upon the Syrian mercenaries, the Ammonites had not been

 in the East, from reports carried by the women from harem to harem.

 <B>Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam</B>--or Ammiel

 East, when they take a fancy for a woman, send an officer to the house
 were she lives, who announces it to be the royal pleasure she should
 remove to the palace. An apartment is there assigned to her; and if she
 is made queen, the monarch orders the announcement to be made that he
 has made choice of her to be queen. Many instances in modern Oriental
 history show the ease and despatch with which such secondary marriages
 are contracted, and a new beauty added to the royal seraglio. But David
 had to make a promise, or rather an express stipulation, to Bath-sheba,
 before she complied with the royal will 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:13,15,17,28">1Ki 1:13, 15, 17, 28</A>);

 for in addition to her transcendent beauty, she appears to have been a
 woman of superior talents and address in obtaining the object of her 
 ambition; in her securing that her son should succeed on the throne; in 
 her promptitude to give notice of her pregnancy; in her activity in 
 defeating Adonijah's natural expectation of succeeding to the crown; in 
 her dignity as the king's mother--in all this we see very strong 
 indications of the ascendency she gained and maintained over David, 
 who, perhaps, had ample leisure and opportunity to discover the 
 punishment of this unhappy connection in more ways than one [T<FONT

 the Hebrew king did the same. Whatever his secret suspicions might have
 been, Uriah's refusal to indulge in the enjoyment of domestic pleasure,
 and his determination to sleep "at the door of the king's house," arose
 from a high and honorable sense of military duty and propriety

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:11">2Sa 11:11</A>).

 up with their children, and which they address in terms of endearment.

 sincerity and depth of his penitent sorrow are evinced by the Psalms he
 composed

 He was pardoned, so far as related to the restoration of the divine
 favor. But as from his high character for piety, and his eminent rank 
 in society, his deplorable fall was calculated to do great injury to 
 the cause of religion, it was necessary that God should testify His 
 abhorrence of sin by leaving even His own servant to reap the bitter 
 temporal fruits. David was not himself doomed, according to his own 
 view of what justice demanded

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:5">2Sa 12:5</A>);

 <B>8. I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives</B>--The
 phraseology means nothing more than that God in His providence had
 given David, as king of Israel, everything that was Saul's. The history
 furnishes conclusive evidence that he never actually married any of the
 wives of Saul. But the harem of the preceding king belongs, according

 his crimes, tended, in the natural course of things, to diminish the
 respect of his family, to weaken the authority of his government, and
 to encourage the prevalence of many disorders throughout his kingdom.</P>

 visible chastisement inflicted on David appeared on the person of that
 child which was the evidence and monument of his guilt. His domestics
 were surprised at his conduct, and in explanation of its singularity,
 it is necessary to remark that the custom in the East is to leave the
 nearest relative of a deceased person to the full and undisturbed
 indulgence of his grief, till on the third or fourth day at farthest

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:17">Joh 11:17</A>).

 Then the other relatives and friends visit him, invite him to eat, lead
 him to a bath, and bring him a change of dress, which is necessary from 
 his having sat or lain on the ground. The surprise of David's servants, 
 then, who had seen his bitter anguish while the child was sick, arose 
 apparently from this, that when he found it was dead, he who had so 
 deeply lamented arose of himself from the earth, without waiting for 
 their coming to him, immediately bathed and anointed himself, instead 
 of appearing as a mourner, and after worshiping God with solemnity, 
 returned to his wonted repast, without any interposition of others.</P>

 <B>28. encamp against the city, and take it</B>--It has always been
 characteristic of Oriental despots to monopolize military honors; and
 as the ancient world knew nothing of the modern refinement of kings
 gaining victories by their generals, so Joab sent for David to command
 the final assault in person. A large force was levied for the purpose.
 David without much difficulty captured the royal city and obtained
 possession of its immense wealth.

 himself the crown, which was of rarest value. Its great weight makes it

 Amnon spoke of Tamar as "his sister," a term artfully designed to

 prevailed with him to desist from his infamous purpose. In bidding him,

 <B>19, 20. Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers
 colours .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. laid her hand on her head, and went on crying</B>--that is,
 sobbing. Oriental manners would probably see nothing beyond a strong
 sense of the injury she had sustained, if Tamar actually rent her
 garments. But, as her veil is not mentioned, it is probable that Amnon
 had turned her out of doors without it, and she raised her hand with
 the design to conceal her face. By these signs, especially the rending
 of her distinguishing robe, Absalom at once conjectured what had taken
 place. Recommending her to be silent about it and not publish her own and
 her family's dishonor, he gave no inkling of his angry feelings to
 Amnon. But all the while he was in secret "nursing his wrath to keep
 it warm," and only "biding his time" to avenge his sister's wrongs, and
 by the removal of the heir-apparent perhaps further also his ambitious
 designs.</P>

 <B>2-21. And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman</B>--The
 king was strongly attached to Absalom; and having now got over his
 sorrow for the violent death of Amnon, he was desirous of again
 enjoying the society of his favorite son, who had now been three long
 years absent. But a dread of public opinion and a regard to the public
 interests made him hesitate about recalling or pardoning his guilty
 son; and Joab, whose discerning mind perceived this struggle between
 parental affection and royal duty, devised a plan for relieving the
 scruples, and, at the same time, gratifying the wishes, of his master.
 Having procured a countrywoman of superior intelligence and address, he
 directed her to seek an audience of the king, and by soliciting his
 royal interposition in the settlement of a domestic grievance,
 convinced him that the life of a murderer might in some cases be saved.
 Tekoah was about twelve miles south of Jerusalem, and six south of
 Beth-lehem; and the design of bringing a woman from such a distance was
 to prevent either the petitioner being known, or the truth of her story
 easily investigated. Her speech was in the form of a parable--the
 circumstances--the language--the manner--well suited to the occasion,
 represented a case as like David's as it was policy to make it, so as
 not to be prematurely discovered. Having got the king pledged, she
 avowed it to be her design to satisfy the royal conscience, that in
 pardoning Absalom he was doing nothing more than he would have done in
 the case of a stranger, where there could be no imputation of
 partiality. The device succeeded; David traced its origin to Joab; and,
 secretly pleased at obtaining the judgment of that rough, but generally
 sound-thinking soldier, he commissioned him to repair to Geshur and
 bring home his exiled son.</P>

 restoration of Absalom, whose criminality is not greater than my son's,
 since he killed his brother in similar circumstances of provocation.
 Absalom has reason to complain that he is treated by his own father
 more sternly and severely than the meanest subject in the realm; and
 the whole nation will have cause for saying that the king shows more
 attention to the petition of a humble woman than to the wishes and
 desires of a whole kingdom. The death of my son is a private loss to my
 family, while the preservation of Absalom is the common interest of all
 Israel, who now look to him as your successor on the throne.</P>

 <B>22. To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy
 sight</B>--Joab betrayed not a little selfishness amid his professions
 of joy at this act of grace to Absalom, and flattered himself that he
 now brought both father and son under lasting obligations. In
 considering this act of David, many extenuating circumstances may be
 urged in favor of it; the provocation given to Absalom; his being now
 in a country where justice could not overtake him; the risk of his
 imbibing a love for heathen principles and worship; the safety and
 interests of the Hebrew kingdom; together with the strong predilection
 of the Hebrew people for Absalom, as represented by the stratagem of
 Joab--these considerations form a plausible apology for David's grant
 of pardon to his bloodstained son. But, in granting this pardon, he
 was acting in the character of an Oriental despot rather than a
 constitutional king of Israel. The feelings of the father triumphed
 over the duty of the king, who, as the supreme magistrate, was bound to
 execute impartial justice on every murderer, by the express law of God

 only from his high spirit and courtly manners, but from his uncommonly 
 handsome appearance. One distinguishing feature, seemingly an object of 
 great admiration, was a profusion of beautiful hair. Its extraordinary 
 luxuriance compelled him to cut it "at every year's end;" lit., "at 
 times," "from time to time," when it was found to weigh two hundred 
 shekels--equal to one hundred twelve ounces troy; but as "the weight 
 was after the king's shekel," which was less than the common shekel,

 of Absalom, he displayed great prudence and command over his feelings
 afterwards--for his son was not admitted into his father's presence but
 was confined to his own house and the society of his own family. This
 slight severity was designed to bring him to sincere repentance, on
 perceiving that his father had not fully pardoned him, as well as to
 convince the people of David's abhorrence of his crime. Not being
 allowed to appear at court, or to adopt any state, the courtiers kept
 aloof; even his cousin did not deem it prudent to go into his society.
 For two full years his liberty was more restricted, and his life more
 apart from his countrymen while living in Jerusalem, than in Geshur;
 and he might have continued in this disgrace longer, had he not, by a
 violent expedient, determined

 <B>2-6. Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the
 gate</B>--Public business in the East is always transacted early in the
 morning--the kings sitting an hour or more to hear causes or receive
 petitions, in a court held anciently, and in many places still, in the
 open air at the city gateway; so that, as those whose circumstances led
 them to wait on King David required to be in attendance on his morning
 levees, Absalom had to rise up early and stand beside the way of the
 gate. Through the growing infirmities of age, or the occupation of his
 government with foreign wars, many private causes had long lain
 undecided, and a deep feeling of discontent prevailed among the people.
 This dissatisfaction was artfully fomented by Absalom, who addressed
 himself to the various suitors; and after briefly hearing their tale,
 he gratified everyone with a favorable opinion of his case. Studiously
 concealing his ambitious designs, he expressed a wish to be invested
 with official power, only that he might accelerate the course of
 justice and advance the public interests. His professions had an air of
 extraordinary generosity and disinterestedness, which, together with
 his fawning arts in lavishing civilities on all, made him a popular
 favorite. Thus, by forcing a contrast between his own display of public
 spirit and the dilatory proceedings of the court, he created a growing
 disgust with his father's government, as weak, careless, or corrupt,
 and seduced the affections of the multitude, who neither penetrated the
 motive nor foresaw the tendency of his conduct.</P>

 justifiable cause for this ebullition of rude insults and violence. He
 upbraided David as an ambitious usurper, and charged him, as one whose 
 misdeeds had recoiled upon his own head, to surrender a throne to which 
 he was not entitled. His language was that of a man incensed by the 
 wrongs that he conceived had been done to his house. David was 
 guiltless of the crime of which Shimei accused him; but his conscience 
 reminded him of other flagrant iniquities; and he, therefore, regarded 
 the cursing of this man as a chastisement from heaven. His answer to 
 Abishai's proposal evinced the spirit of deep and humble 
 resignation--the spirit of a man who watched the course of Providence, 
 and acknowledged Shimei as the instrument of God's chastening hand. One 
 thing is remarkable, that he acted more independently of the sons of 
 Zeruiah in this season of great distress than he could often muster 
 courage to do in the days of his prosperity and power.</P>

 councillor. The adoption of his advice would have extinguished the
 cause of David; and it affords a dreadful proof of the extremities to
 which the heartless prince was, to secure his ambitious objects,
 prepared to go, that the parricidal counsel "pleased Absalom well, and
 all the elders of Israel." It was happily overruled, however, by the
 address of Hushai, who saw the imminent danger to which it would expose
 the king and the royal cause. He dwelt upon the warlike character and
 military experience of the old king--represented him and his adherents
 as mighty men, who would fight with desperation; and who, most
 probably, secure in some stronghold, would be beyond reach, while the
 smallest loss of Absalom's men at the outset might be fatal to the
 success of the conspiracy. But his dexterity was chiefly displayed in
 that part of his counsel which recommended a general levy throughout
 the country; and that Absalom should take command of it in
 person--thereby flattering at once the pride and ambition of the
 usurper. The bait was caught by the vainglorious and wicked prince.</P>

 <B>1, 2. David numbered the people that were with him</B>--The hardy
 mountaineers of Gilead came in great numbers at the call of their
 chieftains, so that, although without money to pay any troops, David
 soon found himself at the head of a considerable army. A pitched battle
 was now inevitable. But so much depending on the life of the king, he
 was not allowed to take the field in person; and he therefore divided
 his forces into three detachments under Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, the
 commander of the foreign guards.</P>

 <B>5. Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom</B>--This
 affecting charge, which the king gave to his generals, proceeded not
 only from his overwhelming affection for his children, but from his
 consciousness that this rebellion was the chastisement of his own
 crimes, Absalom being merely an instrument in the hand of retributive
 Providence;--and also from his piety, lest the unhappy prince should

 trees; and when the hair is worn in large locks floating down the back,
 as was the case with a young man of the party to which I belonged, any
 thick boughs interposing in the path might easily dislodge a rider from
 his seat, and catch hold of his flowing hair"
 [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ARTLEY</FONT>]. Some, however,
 think that the sacred historian points not so much to the hair, as to
 the <I>head</I> of Absalom, which, being caught while running between two
 branches, was enclosed so firmly that he could not disengage himself
 from the hold, nor make use of his hands.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the mule that was under him went away</B>--The Orientals, not having
 saddles as we do, do not sit so firmly on the beasts they ride. Absalom

 thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle</B>--that is, would have raised
 him from the ranks to the status of a commissioned officer. Besides a
 sum of money, a girdle, curiously and richly wrought, was among the
 ancient Hebrews a mark of honor, and sometimes bestowed as a reward of
 military merit. This soldier, however, who may be taken as a fair
 sample of David's faithful subjects, had so great a respect for the
 king's wishes, that no prospect of reward would have tempted him to lay
 violent hands on Absalom. But Joab's stern sense of public duty, which
 satisfied him that there could be neither safety to the king, nor peace
 to the kingdom, nor security to him and other loyal subjects, so long
 as that turbulent prince lived, overcame his sensibilities, and looking
 upon the charge given to the generals as more befitting a parent than a
 prince, he ventured to disobey it.</P>

 to the king, nor was it ever forgotten

 temperate policy of his conduct. However harsh and unfeeling to the
 king Joab may appear, there can be no doubt that he acted the part of a
 wise statesman in regarding the peace and welfare of the kingdom more
 than his master's private inclinations, which were opposed to strict
 justice as well as his own interests. Absalom deserved to die by the

 Jerusalem, is a tomb or cenotaph, said to be this "pillar" or monument:
 it is twenty-four feet square, dome-topped, and reaches forty feet in

 along with another, are variously stated by commentators--but they are
 of no importance. Yet the alacrity of the messengers, as well as the

 Mahanaim may have been so situated, with the regard to the battlefield,

 on which a sentinel was posted, as in times of war, to notify every
 occurrence. The delicacy of Ahimaaz' communication was made up by the
 unmistakable plainness of Cushi's. The death of Absalom was a heavy
 trial, and it is impossible not to sympathize with the outburst of
 feeling by which David showed that all thoughts of the victory he had
 won as a king were completely sunk in the painful loss he had sustained
 as a father. The extraordinary ardor and strength of his affection for
 this worthless son break out in the redundancy and vehemence of his
 mournful ejaculations.</P>

 seeing thee. Joab's remonstrance was right and necessary, but it was
 made with harshness. He was one of those persons who spoil their
 important services by the insolence of their manners, and who always
 awaken a feeling of obligation in those to whom they render any

 <B>9-11. all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of

 three different parties are represented in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:9,10">2Sa 19:9, 10</A>:

 the royalists, the adherents of Absalom who had been very numerous, and
 those who were indifferent to the Davidic dynasty. In these 
 circumstances the king was right in not hastening back, as a conqueror, 
 to reascend his throne. A re-election was, in some measure, necessary. 
 He remained for some time on the other side of Jordan, in expectation 
 of being invited back. That invitation was given without, however, the 
 concurrence of Judah. David, disappointed and vexed by his own tribe's 
 apparent lukewarmness, despatched the two high priests to rouse the 
 Judahites to take a prominent interest in his cause. It was the act of 
 a skilful politician. Hebron having been the seat of the rebellion, it 
 was graceful on his part to encourage their return to allegiance and 
 duty; it was an appeal to their honor not to be the last of the tribes. 
 But this separate message, and the preference given to them, occasioned 
 an outburst of jealousy among the other tribes that was nearly followed 
 by fatal consequences [see

 policy. David was fully alive to the importance, for extinguishing the
 rebellion, of withdrawing from that cause the only leader who could
 keep it alive; and he, therefore, secretly intimated his intention to
 raise Amasa to the command of the army in the place of Joab, whose
 overbearing haughtiness had become intolerable. The king justly
 reckoned, that from natural temper as well as gratitude for the royal
 pardon, he would prove a more tractable servant; and David, doubtless,
 intended in all sincerity to fulfil this promise. But Joab managed to
 retain his high position

 <B>He had neither dressed his feet</B>--not taken the bath,

 (see on

 <A HREF="JFB03.htm#Le13_45">Le 13:45</A>), 

 and cheeks, but carefully cherished it on the chin from ear to ear.  
 Besides dyeing it black or red colors, which, however, is the 
 exception, and not the rule in the East, there are various modes of 
 trimming it: they train it into a massy, bushy form, swelling and 
 round; or they terminate it like a pyramid, in a sharp point. Whatever 
 the mode, it is always trimmed with the greatest care; and they usually 
 carry a small comb for the purpose. The neglect of this attention to 
 his beard was an undoubted proof of the depth of Mephibosheth's grief.  
 The king seems to have received him upbraidingly, and not to have been 
 altogether sure either of his guilt or innocence.  It is impossible to 
 commend the cavalier treatment, any more than to approve the partial 
 award, of David in this case. If he were too hurried and distracted by 
 the pressure of circumstances to inquire fully into the matter, he 
 should have postponed his decision; for if by "dividing the land"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:29">2Sa 19:29</A>)

 he meant that the former arrangement should be continued by which
 Mephibosheth was acknowledged the proprietor, and Ziba the farmer, it 
 was a hardship inflicted on the owner to fix him with a tenant who had 
 so grossly slandered him. But if by "dividing the land," they were now 
 to share alike, the injustice of the decision was greatly increased. In 
 any view, the generous, disinterested spirit displayed by Mephibosheth 
 was worthy a son of the noble-hearted Jonathan.</P>

 impatience to move on or from some other cause, David did not wait till
 all the tribes had arrived to conduct him on his return to the capital.
 The procession began as soon as Amasa had brought the Judahite escort,
 and the preference given to this tribe produced a bitter jealousy,
 which was nearly kindling a civil war fiercer than that which had just
 ended. A war of words ensued between the tribes--Israel resting their
 argument on their superior numbers; "they had ten parts in the king,"
 whereas Judah had no more than one. Judah grounded their right to take
 the lead, on the ground of their nearer relationship to the king. This
 was a claim dangerous to the house of David; and it shows the seeds
 were already sown for that tribal dissension which, before long, led to
 the dismemberment of the kingdom.</P>

 <B>1. Sheba .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a Benjamite</B>--Though nothing is known of this man, he
 must have been a person of considerable power and influence, before he
 could have raised so sudden and extensive a sedition. He belonged to
 the tribe of Benjamin, where the adherents of Saul's dynasty were still
 numerous; and perceiving the strong disgust of the other tribes with
 the part assumed by Judah in the restoration, his ill-designing heart
 resolved to turn it to the overthrow of David's authority in Israel.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>every man to his tents</B>--This proverbial expression may have had its
 foundation in the fact, that many of the Israelite peasantry adhered to
 the custom of the patriarchs who tilled land, and yet lived in tents,
 as Syrian peasants often do still. This was the usual watchword of
 national insurrection, and from the actual temper of the people, it was
 followed by effects beyond what he probably anticipated.</P>

 <B>2. from Jordan even to Jerusalem</B>--The quarrel had broken out shortly
 after the crossing of the Jordan, between Judah and the other tribes,
 who withdrew; so that Judah was left nearly alone to conduct the king
 to the metropolis.</P>

 <B>3. the king took the ten women his concubines</B>--Jewish writers say that
 the widowed queens of Hebrew monarchs were not allowed to marry again
 but were obliged to pass the rest of their lives in strict seclusion.
 David treated his concubines in the same manner after the outrage
 committed on them by Absalom. They were not divorced, for they were
 guiltless; but they were no longer publicly recognized as his wives;
 nor was their confinement to a sequestered life a very heavy doom, in a
 region where women have never been accustomed to go much abroad.</P>

 <A NAME="2Sa20_4"> </A>

 <B>4. Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within 
 three days</B>--Amasa is now installed in the command which David had 
 promised him. The revolt of the ten tribes, probably, hastened the 
 public declaration of this appointment, which he hoped would be popular 
 with them, and Amasa was ordered within three days to levy a force from 
 Judah sufficient to put down the insurrection. The appointment was a 
 blunder, and the king soon perceived his error. The specified time 
 passed, but Amasa could not muster the men. Dreading the loss of time, 
 the king gave the commission to Abishai, and not to Joab--a new 
 affront, which, no doubt, wounded the pride of the stern and haughty
 old general. But he hastened with his attached soldiers to go as second 
 to his brother, determined to take the first opportunity of wreaking 
 his vengeance on his successful rival.</P>

 march overtook the expedition at Gibeon, and assumed the place of
 commander; in which capacity, he was saluted, among others, by Joab.

 <B>a sword .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and as he went forth it fell out</B>--that is, out of the
 scabbard. According to J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>, he let it drop on purpose as he was
 accosting Amasa, that stooping, as it were accidentally, to pick it up,
 he might salute the new general with the naked sword in his hand,
 without exciting any suspicion of his design.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>He went forth</B>--in a ceremonious manner to meet Amasa, now
 commander-in-chief, in order to seem to render to that officer, whom he
 considered as usurping his post, a conspicuous honor and homage.</P>

 <B>9. took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him</B>--This act,
 common with two friends on meeting when one of them returns from a
 journey, indicates respect as well as kindliness, and the performance
 of it evinced the deep hypocrisy of Joab, who thereby put Amasa off his
 guard. No wonder, then, that while this act of friendly gratulation
 after long absence occupied Amasa's attention, he did not perceive the
 sword that was in Joab's <I>left</I> hand. The action of Joab was indeed a
 high compliment, but neither suspicious nor unusual and to this
 compliment, Amasa paying attention and no doubt returning it with
 suitable politeness, he could little expect the fatal event that Joab's
 perfidy produced.</P>

 over the army, that with this villainous murder perpetrated before their
 eyes they unanimously followed him as their leader in pursuit of Sheba.
 A soldier conjoined his name with David's, and such a magic spell was in
 the word "Joab," that all the people "went on"--Amasa's men as well as
 the rest. The conjunction of these two names is very significant. It
 shows that the one could not afford to do without the other--neither
 Joab to rebel against David, nor David to get rid of Joab, though hating
 him.</P>

 prescribes that he should offer peace to strangers, much more then to
 Israelitish cities; and if he do this, we shall soon bring things to an 
 amicable agreement, for we are a peaceable people. The answer of Joab 
 brings out the character of that ruthless veteran as a patriot at 
 heart, who, on securing the author of this insurrection, was ready to 
 put a stop to further bloodshed and release the peaceable inhabitants

 <B>1. the Lord answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because

 time or the reason of this massacre. Some think that they were
 sufferers in the atrocity perpetrated by Saul at Nob 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+22:19">1Sa 22:19</A>),

 <B>2. in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah</B>--Under pretense of
 a rigorous and faithful execution of the divine law regarding the
 extermination of the Canaanites, he set himself to expel or destroy
 those whom Joshua had been deceived into sparing. His real object seems
 to have been, that the possessions of the Gibeonites, being forfeited
 to the crown, might be divided among his own people (compare
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+22:7">1Sa 22:7</A>).

 At all events, his proceeding against this people was in violation of a
 solemn oath, and involving <I>national</I> guilt. The famine was, in 
 the wise and just retribution of Providence, made a <I>national</I> 
 punishment, since the Hebrews either assisted in the massacre, or did 
 not interpose to prevent it; since they neither endeavored to repair 
 the wrong, nor expressed any horror of it; and since a general 
 protracted chastisement might have been indispensable to inspire a 
 proper respect and protection to the Gibeonite remnant that 
 survived.</P>

 <B>6. Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang
 them up unto the Lord in Gibeah of Saul</B>--The practice of the Hebrews,
 as of most Oriental nations, was to slay first, and afterwards to
 suspend on a gibbet, the body not being left hanging after sunset. The
 king could not refuse this demand of the Gibeonites, who, in making it,
 were only exercising their right as blood-avengers; and, although
 through fear and a sense of weakness they had not hitherto claimed
 satisfaction, yet now that David had been apprised by the oracle of the
 cause of the long-prevailing calamity, he felt it his duty to give the
 Gibeonites full satisfaction--hence their specifying the number seven,
 which was reckoned full and complete. And if it should seem unjust to
 make the descendants suffer for a crime which, in all probability,
 originated with Saul himself, yet his sons and grandsons might be the
 instruments of his cruelty, the willing and zealous executors of this
 bloody <I>raid.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the king said, I will give them</B>--David cannot be charged with doing
 this as an indirect way or ridding himself of rival competitors for the
 throne, for those delivered up were only collateral branches of Saul's
 family, and never set up any claim to the sovereignty. Moreover, David
 was only granting the request of the Gibeonites as God had bidden him
 do.</P>

 their intention was to let the bodies hang until God, propitiated by
 this offering, should send rain upon the land, for the want of it had 
 occasioned the famine. It was a heathen practice to gibbet men with a 
 view of appeasing the anger of the gods in seasons of famine, and the 
 Gibeonites, who were a remnant of the Amorites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:2">2Sa 21:2</A>),

 though brought to the knowledge of the true God, were not, it seems,
 free from this superstition. God, in His providence, suffered the 
 Gibeonites to ask and inflict so barbarous a retaliation, in order that 
 the oppressed Gibeonites might obtain justice and some reparation of 
 their wrongs, especially that the scandal brought on the name of the 
 true religion by the violation of a solemn national compact might be 
 wiped away from Israel, and that a memorable lesson should be given to

 The song contained in this chapter is the same as the eighteenth Psalm,
 where the full commentary will be given
 [see on

 <A HREF="JFB19.htm#Ps18_1">Ps 18:1</A>, 

 &c.]. It may be sufficient simply to remark that Jewish writers have 
 noticed a great number of very minute variations in the language of the 
 song as recorded here, from that embodied in the Book of Psalms--which 
 may be accounted for by the fact that this, the first copy of the poem, 
 was carefully revised and altered by David afterwards, when it was set 
 to the music of the tabernacle. This inspired ode was manifestly the 
 effusion of a mind glowing with the highest fervor of piety and 
 gratitude, and it is full of the noblest imagery that is to be found 
 within the range even of sacred poetry. It is David's grand tribute of 
 thanksgiving for deliverance from his numerous and powerful enemies, 
 and establishing him in the power and glory of the kingdom.</P>

 <B>1. Now these be the last words of David</B>--Various opinions are 
 entertained as to the precise meaning of this statement, which, it is 
 obvious, proceeded from the compiler or collector of the sacred canon.  
 Some think that, as there is no division of chapters in the Hebrew

 everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure</B>--"the light of
 the morning," that is, the beginning of David's kingdom, was unlike the
 clear brilliant dawn of an Eastern day but was overcast by many black
 and threatening clouds; neither he nor his family had been like the
 tender grass springing up from the ground and flourishing by the united
 influences of the sun and rain; but rather like the grass that
 withereth and is prematurely cut down. The meaning is: although David's
 house had not flourished in an uninterrupted course of worldly
 prosperity and greatness, according to his hopes; although great crimes
 and calamities had beclouded his family history; some of the most
 promising branches of the royal tree had been cut down in his lifetime
 and many of his successors should suffer in like manner for their
 personal sins; although many reverses and revolutions may overtake his
 race and his kingdom, yet it was to him a subject of the highest joy
 and thankfulness that God will inviolably maintain His covenant with
 his family, until the advent of his greatest Son, the Messiah, who was
 the special object of his desire, and the author of his salvation.</P>

 wicked enemies and persecutors of this kingdom of righteousness. They
 resemble those prickly, thorny plants which are twisted together, whose
 spires point in every direction, and which are so sharp and strong that
 they cannot be touched or approached without danger; but hard
 instruments and violent means must be taken to destroy or uproot them.
 So God will remove or destroy all who are opposed to this kingdom.</P>

 (that is, of Jashobeam the Hachmonite), who was chief among the
 captains, the same is Adino the Eznite; he lift up his spear against
 eight hundred, whom he slew at one time. The text is corrupt in this
 passage; the number eight hundred should be three hundred
 [D<FONT SIZE=-1>AVIDSON</FONT>, <I>Hermeneutics</I>].
 Under Joab he was chief or president of the
 council of war. The first or highest order was composed of him and his
 two colleagues, Eleazar and Shammah. Eleazar seems to have been left
 to fight the Philistines alone; and on his achieving the victory, they
 returned to the spoil. In like manner Shammah was left to stand alone
 in his glory, when the Lord, by him, wrought a great victory. It is not
 very easy to determine whether the exploits that are afterwards
 described were performed by the first or the second three.</P>

 <B>15, 16. the well of Beth-lehem</B>--An ancient cistern, with four or five
 holes in the solid rock, at about ten minutes distance to the north of
 the eastern corner of the hill of Beth-lehem, is pointed out by the
 natives as Bir-Daoud; that is, David's well.
 Dr. R<FONT SIZE=-1>OBINSON</FONT> doubts the
 identity of the well; but others think that there are no good grounds
 for doing so. Certainly, considering this to be the ancient well,
 Beth-lehem must have once extended ten minutes further to the north,
 and must have lain in times of old, not as now, on the summit, but on
 the northern rise of the hill; for the well is <I>by</I> or 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+11:7">1Ch 11:7</A>)
 
 <I>at</I> the gate. I find in the description of travellers, that the
 common opinion is, that David's captains had come from the southeast,
 in order to obtain, at the risk of their lives, the so-much-longed-for
 water; while it is supposed that David himself was then in the great
 cave that is not far to the southeast of Beth-lehem; which cave is
 generally held to have been that of Adullam. But 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:35">Jos 15:35</A>)

 Adullam lay "in the valley"; that is, in the undulating plain at the
 western base of the mountains of Judea and consequently to the 
 southwest of Beth-lehem. Be this as it may, David's <I>men</I> had in 
 any case to break through the host of the Philistines, in order to 
 reach the well; and the position of Bir-Daoud agrees well with this

 <B>19-39. the first three</B>--The mighty men or champions in David's military
 staff were divided into three classes--the highest, Jashobeam, Eleazar,
 and Shammah; the second class, Abishai, Benaiah, and Asahel; and the
 third class, the thirty, of which Asahel was the chief. There are
 thirty-one mentioned in the list, including Asahel; and these added to
 the two superior orders make thirty-seven. Two of them, we know, were
 already dead; namely, Asahel 

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:30">2Sa 3:30</A>]

 we might suppose a legion of honor, consisting of the definite number
 thirty, where the vacancies, when they occurred, were replaced by fresh
 appointments.</P>

 <B>1-4. again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he
 moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah</B>--"Again"
 carries us back to the former tokens of His wrath in the three years'
 famine 

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:1">2Sa 21:1</A>].
 
 God, though He cannot tempt any man

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:13">Jas 1:13</A>),

 is frequently described in Scripture as doing what He merely permits to 
 be done; and so, in this case, He permitted Satan to tempt David. Satan 
 was the active mover, while God only withdrew His supporting grace, and 
 the great tempter prevailed against the king.  (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:13,1Sa+26:19,2Sa+16:10,Ps+105:25,Isa+7:17">Ex 7:13;
 1Sa 26:19; 
 2Sa 16:10; 
 Ps 105:25; 
 Isa 7:17</A>,

 by religious scruples, did not fail to present, in strong terms (see on

 <A HREF="JFB13.htm#1Ch21_3">1Ch 21:3</A>), 

 the sin and danger of this measure. He used every argument to dissuade
 the king from his purpose. The sacred history has not mentioned the 
 objections which he and other distinguished officers urged against it 
 in the council of David. But it expressly states that they were all 
 overruled by the inflexible resolution of the king.</P>

 opposition.

 <B>the river of Gad</B>--"Wady" would be a better term. It extends over a
 course estimated at about sixty miles, which, though in summer almost
 constantly dry, exhibits very evident traces of being swept over by an
 impetuous torrent in winter (see

 amount here stated, compared with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:5">1Ch 21:5</A>,

 gives a difference of three hundred thousand. The discrepancy is only
 apparent, and admits of an easy reconciliation; thus (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+27:1-15">1Ch 27:1-15</A>),

 there were twelve divisions of generals, who commanded monthly, and
 whose duty was to keep guard on the royal person, each having a body of 
 troops consisting of twenty-four thousand men, which, together, formed 
 an army of two hundred eighty-eight thousand; and as a separate 
 detachment of twelve thousand was attendant on the twelve princes of 
 the twelve tribes mentioned in the same chapter, so both are equal to 
 three hundred thousand. These were not reckoned in this book, because 
 they were in the actual service of the king as a regular militia. But

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:5">1Ch 21:5</A>
 
 joins them to the rest, saying, "all those of Israel were one million,
 one hundred thousand"; whereas the author of Samuel, who reckons only
 the eight hundred thousand, does not say, "all those of Israel," but
 barely "and Israel were," &c. It must also be observed that,
 exclusive of the troops before mentioned, there was an army of
 observation on the frontiers of the Philistines' country, composed of
 thirty thousand men, as appears from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:1">2Sa 6:1</A>;

 which, it seems, were included in the number of five hundred thousand
 of the people of Judah by the author of Samuel. But the author of 
 Chronicles, who mentions only four hundred seventy thousand, gives the 
 number of that tribe exclusive of those thirty thousand men, because 
 they were not all of the tribe of Judah, and therefore he does not say, 
 "all those of Judah," as he had said, "all those of Israel," but only, 
 "and those of Judah." Thus both accounts may be reconciled [D<FONT

 And David said unto the Lord, I have sinned</B>--The act of numbering the
 people was not in itself sinful; for Moses did it by the express
 authority of God. But David acted not only independently of such order
 or sanction, but from motives unworthy of the delegated king of Israel;
 from pride and vainglory; from self-confidence and distrust of God;
 and, above all, from ambitious designs of conquest, in furtherance of
 which he was determined to force the people into military service, and
 to ascertain whether he could muster an army sufficient for the
 magnitude of the enterprises he contemplated. It was a breach of the
 constitution, an infringement of the liberties of the people, and
 opposed to that divine policy which required that Israel should
 continue a separate people. His eyes were not opened to the heinousness
 of his sin till God had spoken unto him by His commissioned prophet.</P>
