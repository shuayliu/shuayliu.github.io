 <B>1. Now after the death of Moses</B>--Joshua, having been already appointed
 and designated leader of Israel 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:18-23">Nu 27:18-23</A>),

 in all probability assumed the reins of government <I>immediately</I>
 "after the death of Moses."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the servant of the Lord</B>--This was the official title of Moses as
 invested with a special mission to make known the will of God; and it
 conferred great honor and authority.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the Lord spake unto Joshua</B>--probably during the period of public
 mourning, and either by a direct revelation to the mind of Joshua, or
 by means of Urim and Thummim 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:21">Nu 27:21</A>).

 This first communication gave a pledge that the divine instructions
 which, according to the provisions of the theocracy, had been imparted 
 to Moses, would be continued to the new leader, though God might not 
 perhaps speak to him "mouth to mouth"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:8">Nu 12:8</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Joshua</B>--The original name, Oshea, 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:8">Nu 13:8</A>),

 which had been, according to Eastern usage, changed like those of Abram
 and Sarai

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:5-15">Ge 17:5-15</A>)

 into Jehoshua or Joshua (that is, "God's salvation") was significant of
 the services he was to render, and typified those of a greater Saviour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:8">Heb 4:8</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Moses' minister</B>--that is, his official attendant, who, from being
 constantly employed in important services and early initiated into the
 principles of the government, would be well trained for undertaking the
 leadership of Israel.</P>

 <A NAME="Jos1_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2-9. now therefore arise, go over this Jordan</B>--Joshua's mission was
 that of a military leader. This passage records his call to begin the
 work, and the address contains a literal repetition of the promise made
 to Moses 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+11:24,25,31:6-8,23">De 11:24, 25; 31:6-8, 23</A>).</P>

 <A NAME="Jos1_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3, 4. Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon that
 have I given you</B>--meaning, of course, not universal dominion, but only
 the territory comprised within the boundaries here specified
 (see on

 <A HREF="JFB05.htm#De19_8">De 19:8</A>).</P>

 <A NAME="Jos1_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4. all the land of the Hittites</B>--These occupied the southern
 extremities and were the dominant tribe of Canaan. Their superior power
 and the extent of their dominions are attested by the mention of them
 under the name of Khita, on the Assyrian inscriptions, and still more
 frequently on the Egyptian inscriptions of the eighteenth and
 nineteenth Dynasties. What life and encouragement must have been
 imparted to Joshua by the assurance that his people, who had been
 overwhelmed with fear of that gigantic race, were to possess "all the
 land of the Hittites"!</P>

 <A NAME="Jos1_5"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>5-9. There shall not any man be able to stand before thee</B>--Canaan was
 theirs by a divine grant; and the renewed confirmation of that grant to
 Joshua when about to lead the people into it, intimated not only a
 certain but an easy conquest. It is remarkable, however, that his
 courage and hope of victory were made to depend
 (see on

 <A HREF="JFB05.htm#De17_18">De 17:18</A>)
 
 on his firm and inflexible adherence to the law of God, not only that
 regarding the extirpation of the Canaanites, but the whole divine code.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>10-18. Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people</B>--These
 were the Shoterim
 (see on

 <A HREF="JFB02.htm#Ex5_6">Ex 5:6</A>;

 <A HREF="JFB05.htm#De20_5">De 20:5</A>).</P>

 <A NAME="Jos1_11"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>11-13. command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals</B>--not manna,
 which, though it still fell, would not keep; but corn, sheep, and
 articles of food procurable in the conquered countries.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan</B>--that is, the
 third day, according to <I>Hebrew</I> idiom--the time allotted for getting
 ready before the encampment in Abel-Shittim broke up and they removed
 to the desert bank of the river where no victuals were available. At
 the same time Joshua himself convened the two and a half tribes which
 had settled east of Jordan, to remind them of their promise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:1-42">Nu 32:1-42</A>)

 to assist their brethren in the conquest of western Canaan. Their
 readiness to redeem their pledge and the terms in which they answered 
 the appeal of Joshua displayed to great advantage their patriotic and 
 pious feelings at so interesting a crisis.</P>

 five leaders in the old and approved caravan order
 (see on

 <A HREF="JFB02.htm#Ex13_18">Ex 13:18</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>all the mighty men of valour</B>--The words are not to be interpreted
 strictly as meaning the whole, but only the flower or choice of the
 fighting men (see on

 <B>1. Joshua .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sent .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. two men to spy secretly</B>--Faith is manifested
 by an active, persevering use of means 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:22">Jas 2:22</A>);

 and accordingly Joshua, while confident in the accomplishment of the
 divine promise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:3">Jos 1:3</A>),

 adopted every precaution which a skilful general could think of to
 render his first attempt in the invasion of Canaan successful. Two 
 spies were despatched to reconnoitre the country, particularly in the 
 neighborhood of Jericho; for in the prospect of investing that place, 
 it was desirable to obtain full information as to its site, its 
 approaches, the character, and resources of its inhabitants. This 
 mission required the strictest privacy, and it seems to have been 
 studiously concealed from the knowledge of the Israelites themselves, 
 test any unfavorable or exaggerated report, publicly circulated, might 
 have dispirited the people, as that of the spies did in the days of 
 Moses.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Jericho</B>--Some derive this name from a word signifying "<I>new moon,</I>"
 in reference to the crescent-like plain in which it stood, formed by an
 amphitheater of hills; others from a word signifying "<I>its scent,</I>" on
 account of the fragrance of the balsam and palm trees in which it was
 embosomed. Its site was long supposed to be represented by the small
 mud-walled hamlet Er-Riha; but recent researches have fixed on a spot
 about half an hour's journey westward, where large ruins exist about
 six or eight miles distant from the Jordan. It was for that age a
 strongly fortified town, the key of the eastern pass through the deep
 ravine, now called Wady-Kelt, into the interior of Palestine.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>they .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. came into an harlot's house</B>--Many expositors, desirous of
 removing the stigma of this name from an ancestress of the Saviour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:5">Mt 1:5</A>),

 have called her a hostess or tavern keeper. But Scriptural usage

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+21:7-14,De+23:18,Jdg+11:1,1Ki+3:16">Le 21:7-14;
 De 23:18;
 Jud 11:1; 
 1Ki 3:16</A>), 

 the authority of the <I>Septuagint,</I> followed by the apostles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:31,Jam+2:25">Heb 11:31;
 Jas 2:25</A>), 

 and the immemorial style of Eastern khans, which are never kept by
 women, establish the propriety of the term employed in our version. Her 
 house was probably recommended to the spies by the convenience of its 
 situation, without any knowledge of the character of the inmates. But a 
 divine influence directed them in the choice of that lodging-place.</P>

 <A NAME="Jos2_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2, 3. it was told the king</B>--by the sentinels who at such a time of
 threatened invasion would be posted on the eastern frontier and whose
 duty required them to make a strict report to headquarters of the
 arrival of all strangers.</P>

 <A NAME="Jos2_3"> </A>

 <A NAME="Jos2_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4-6. the woman took the two men, and hid them</B>--literally, "him," that
 is, each of them in separate places, of course previous to the
 appearance of the royal messengers and in anticipation of a speedy
 search after her guests. According to Eastern manners, which pay an
 almost superstitious respect to a woman's apartment, the royal
 messengers did not demand admittance to search but asked her to bring
 the foreigners out.</P>

 <A NAME="Jos2_5"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>5. the time of shutting of the gates</B>--The gates of all Oriental
 cities are closed at sunset, after which there is no possibility either
 of admission or egress.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the men went out</B>--This was a palpable deception. But, as lying is a
 common vice among heathen people, Rahab was probably unconscious of its
 moral guilt, especially as she resorted to it as a means for screening
 her guests; and she might deem herself bound to do it by the laws of
 Eastern hospitality, which make it a point of honor to preserve the
 greatest enemy, if he has once eaten one's salt. Judged by the divine
 law, her answer was a sinful expedient; but her infirmity being united
 with faith, she was graciously pardoned and her service accepted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:25">Jas 2:25</A>).</P>

 <A NAME="Jos2_6"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>6. she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with
 the stalks of flax</B>--Flax, with other vegetable productions, is at a
 certain season spread out on the flat roofs of Eastern houses to be
 dried in the sun; and, after lying awhile, it is piled up in numerous
 little stacks, which, from the luxuriant growth of the flax, rise to a
 height of three or four feet. Behind some of these stacks Rahab
 concealed the spies.</P>

 <A NAME="Jos2_7"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>7. the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords</B>--That
 river is crossed at several well-known fords. The first and second
 immediately below the sea of Galilee; the third and fourth immediately
 above and below the pilgrims' bathing-place, opposite Jericho.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the
 gate</B>--This precaution was to ensure the capture of the spies, should
 they have been lurking in the city.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>8-13. she came up unto them upon the roof and said</B>--Rahab's dialogue is
 full of interest, as showing the universal panic and consternation of
 the Canaanites on the one hand 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:11,De+2:25">Jos 24:11;
 De 2:25</A>),

 and her strong convictions on the other, founded on a knowledge of the
 divine promise, and the stupendous miracles that had opened the way of 
 the Israelites to the confines of the promised land. She was convinced 
 of the supremacy of Jehovah, and her earnest stipulations for the 
 preservation of her relatives amid the perils of the approaching 
 invasion, attest the sincerity and strength of her faith.</P>

 <B>14. the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our
 business</B>--This was a solemn pledge--a virtual oath, though the name of
 God is not mentioned; and the words were added, not as a condition of
 their fidelity, but as necessary for her safety, which might be
 endangered if the private agreement was divulged.</P>

 <A NAME="Jos2_15"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>15. her house was upon the town wall</B>--In many Oriental cities houses
 are built on the walls with overhanging windows; in others the town
 wall forms the back wall of the house, so that the window opens into
 the country. Rahab's was probably of this latter description, and the
 cord or rope sufficiently strong to bear the weight of a man.</P>

 <A NAME="Jos2_16"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>16-21. she said</B>--rather "she had said," for what follows must have
 been part of the previous conversation.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Get you to the mountain</B>--A range of white limestone hills extends on
 the north, called Quarantania (now Jebel Karantu), rising to a height
 of from twelve hundred to fifteen hundred feet, and the sides of which
 are perforated with caves. Some one peak adjoining was familiarly known
 to the inhabitants as "the mountain." The prudence and propriety of the
 advice to flee in that direction rather than to the ford, were made
 apparent by the sequel.</P>

 <B>21. she bound the scarlet line in the window</B>--probably soon after the
 departure of the spies. It was not formed, as some suppose, into
 network, as a lattice, but simply to hang down the wall. Its red color
 made it conspicuous, and it was thus a sign and pledge of safety to
 Rahab's house, as the bloody mark on the lintels of the houses of the
 Israelites in Egypt to that people.</P>

 <B>1. Joshua rose early in the morning</B>--On the day following that on which
 the spies had returned with their encouraging report. The camp was
 broken up in "Shittim" (the acacia groves), and removed to the eastern
 bank of the Jordan. The duration of their stay is indicated 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:2">Jos 3:2</A>),
 
 being, according to <I>Hebrew</I> reckoning, only one entire day, including
 the evening of arrival and the morning of the passage; and such a time
 would be absolutely necessary for so motley an assemblage of men, women,
 and children, with all their gear and cattle to make ready for going
 into an enemy's country.</P>

 <A NAME="Jos3_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3, 4. When ye see the ark .&nbsp;.&nbsp;., and the priests the Levites bearing
 it</B>--The usual position of the ark, when at rest, was in the center
 of the camp; and, during a march, in the middle of the procession. On
 this occasion it was to occupy the van, and be borne, not by the
 Kohathite Levites, but the priests, as on all solemn and extraordinary
 occasions (compare

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>then ye shall .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. go after it. Yet there shall be a space between you
 and it</B>--These instructions refer exclusively to the advance into the
 river. The distance which the people were to keep in the rear of the
 ark was nearly a mile. Had they crowded too near the ark, the view
 would have been intercepted, and this intervening space, therefore, was
 ordered, that the chest containing the sacred symbols might be
 distinctly visible to all parts of the camp, and be recognized as their
 guide in the untrodden way.</P>

 "to-morrow," the address must have been made previous to the day of
 crossing, and the sanctification was in all probability the same as
 Moses had commanded before the giving of the law, consisting of an
 outward cleansing 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:10-15">Ex 19:10-15</A>)

 great a manifestation should be witnessed.</P>

 <B>6. Joshua spake unto the priests</B>--This order to the priests would be
 given privately, and involving as it did an important change in the
 established order of march, it must be considered as announced in the
 name and by the authority of God. Moreover, as soon as the priests
 stepped into the waters of Jordan, they were to stand still. The ark
 was to accomplish what had been done by the rod of Moses.</P>

 Israelites had no intimation how they were to cross the river till
 shortly before the event. The premonitory address of Joshua, taken in
 connection with the miraculous result exactly as he had described it,
 would tend to increase and confirm their faith in the God of their
 fathers as not a dull, senseless, inanimate thing like the idols of the
 nations, but a Being of life, power, and activity to defend them and
 work for them.</P>

 <B>14-16. And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents,</B>
 &c.--To understand the scene described we must imagine the band of
 priests with the ark on their shoulders, standing on the depressed edge
 of the river, while the mass of the people were at a mile's distance.
 Suddenly the whole bed of the river was dried up; a spectacle the more
 extraordinary in that it took place in the time of harvest,
 corresponding to our April or May--when "the Jordan overfloweth all its
 banks." The original words may be more properly rendered "fills all its
 banks." Its channel, snow-fed from Lebanon, was at its greatest
 height--brimful; a translation which gives the only true description of
 the state of Jordan in harvest as observed by modern travellers. The
 river about Jericho is, in ordinary appearance, about fifty or sixty
 yards in breadth. But as seen in harvest, it is twice as broad; and in
 ancient times, when the hills on the right and left were much more
 drenched with rain and snow than since the forests have disappeared,
 the river must, from a greater accession of water, have been broader
 still than at harvest-time in the present day.</P>

 The river was thus dried up as far as the eye could reach. This was a
 stupendous miracle; Jordan takes its name, "the Descender," from the 
 force of its current, which, after passing the Sea of Galilee, becomes 
 greatly increased as it plunges through twenty-seven "horrible rapids 
 and cascades," besides a great many lesser through a fall of a thousand 
 feet, averaging from four to five miles an hour [L<FONT

 a vastly accelerated current.

 pass over before the ark and deposit the stones in the place of next

 memory of important transactions, especially among the nomadic people
 of the East. Although there be no inscription engraved on them, the
 history and object of such simple monuments are traditionally preserved

 was another memento of the miraculous event, a duplicate of the former,
 set up in the river itself, on the very spot where the ark had rested.
 This heap of stones might have been a large and compactly built one and
 visible in the ordinary state of the river. As nothing is said where
 these stones were obtained, some have imagined that they might have
 been gathered in the adjoining fields and deposited by the people as
 they passed the appointed spot.

 <B>10. the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan</B>--This
 position was well calculated to animate the people, who probably
 crossed <I>below</I> the ark, as well as to facilitate Joshua's execution of
 the minutest instructions respecting the passage 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:21-23">Nu 27:21-23</A>).

 The unfaltering confidence of the priests contrasts strikingly with the
 conduct of the people, who "hasted and passed over." Their faith, like 
 that of many of God's people, was, through the weakness of nature, 
 blended with fears. But perhaps their "haste" may be viewed in a more 
 favorable light, as indicating the alacrity of their obedience, or it 
 might have been enjoined in order that the the whole multitude might 
 pass in one day.</P>

 <A NAME="Jos4_11"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>11. the ark of the Lord passed over, and the priests, in the presence
 of the people</B>--The ark is mentioned as the efficient cause; it had
 been the first to move--it was the last to leave--and its movements
 arrested the deep attention of the people, who probably stood on the
 opposite bank, wrapt in admiration and awe of this closing scene. It
 was a great miracle, greater even than the passage of the Red Sea in
 this respect: that, admitting the fact, there is no possibility of
 rationalistic insinuations as to the influence of natural causes in
 producing it, as have been made in the former case.</P>

 of march was departed from; but these are honorably mentioned to show
 that, in pursuance of their promise

 the river flowed with as full a current as before.</P>

 the omnipotence of God, while at the same time it would teach an
 important lesson in religion to the young and rising Israelites in

 <B>the Lord said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives</B>--Stone knives,
 collect and make them ready. Flints have been used in the early times
 of all people; and although the use of iron was known to the Hebrews in
 the days of Joshua, probably the want of a sufficient number of
 metallic implements dictated the employment of flints on this occasion
 (compare

 <B>circumcise again the children of Israel the second time</B>--literally,
 "return and circumcise." The command did not require him to repeat the
 operation on those who had undergone it, but to resume the observance
 of the rite, which had been long discontinued. The language, however,
 evidently points to a general circumcising on some previous occasion,
 which, though unrecorded, must have been made before the celebration of
 the passover at Sinai (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:48,Nu+9:5">Ex 12:48;

 circumcise the children born in the wilderness might have been owing to
 the incessant movements of the people; but it is most generally thought
 that the true cause was a temporary suspension of the covenant with the
 unbelieving race who, being rejected of the Lord, were doomed to perish
 in the wilderness, and whose children had to bear the iniquity of their
 fathers 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:33">Nu 14:33</A>),

 <B>8. when they had done circumcising all the people</B>--As the number of
 those born in the wilderness and uncircumcised must have been immense,
 a difficulty is apt to be felt how the rite could have been performed
 on such a multitude in so short a time. But it has been calculated that
 the proportion between those already circumcised (under twenty when the
 doom was pronounced) and those to be circumcised, was one to four, and
 consequently the whole ceremony could easily have been performed in a
 day. Circumcision being the sign and seal of the covenant, its
 performance was virtually an investment in the promised land, and its
 being delayed till their actual entrance into the country was a wise
 and gracious act on the part of God, who postponed this trying duty
 till the hearts of the people, animated by the recent astonishing
 miracle, were prepared to obey the divine will.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>they abode in their places .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. till they were whole</B>--It is calculated
 that, of those who did not need to be circumcised, more than fifty
 thousand were left to defend the camp if an attack had been then made
 upon it.</P>

 <I>nationally</I> rejected by God by the cessation of circumcision and the
 renewal of that rite was a practical announcement of the restoration of
 the covenant [K<FONT SIZE=-1>EIL</FONT>].

 <B>Gilgal</B>--No trace either of the name or site is now to be found; but

 this whole proceeding was obviously to impress the Canaanites with a
 sense of the divine omnipotence, to teach the Israelites a memorable
 lesson of faith and confidence in God's promises, and to inspire
 sentiments of respect and reverence for the ark as the symbol of His
 presence. The length of time during which those circuits were made
 tended the more intensely to arrest the attention, and to deepen the 
 impressions, both of the Israelites and the enemy. The number seven was 
 among the Israelites the symbolic seal of the covenant between God and

 procession was made in deep and solemn silence, conforming to the
 instructions given to the people by their leader at the outset, that
 they were to refrain from all acclamation and noise of any kind until
 he should give them a signal. It must have been a strange sight; no
 mound was raised, no sword drawn, no engine planted, no pioneers
 undermining--here were armed men, but no stroke given; they must walk

 When such a ban was pronounced against a hostile city, the men and
 animals were killed--no booty was allowed to be taken. The idols and 
 all the precious ornaments on them were to be burned

 compare 1Ch 14:12</A>).

 Everything was either to be destroyed or consecrated to the sanctuary.
 Joshua pronounced this ban on Jericho, a great and wealthy city, 
 evidently by divine direction.  The severity of the doom, accordant 
 with the requirements of a law which was holy, just, and good, was 
 justified, not only by the fact of its inhabitants being part of a race 
 who had filled up their iniquities, but by their resisting the light of 
 the recent astonishing miracle at the Jordan. Besides, as Jericho seems 
 to have been defended by reinforcements from all the country

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:11">Jos 24:11</A>),

 its destruction would paralyze all the rest of the devoted people, and
 thus tend to facilitate the conquest of the land; showing, as so 
 astounding a military miracle did, that it was done, not by man, but by 
 the power and through the anger, of God.</P>

 given by Joshua, and on the Israelites' raising their loud war cry, the
 walls fell down, doubtless burying multitudes of the inhabitants in the
 ruins, while the besiegers, rushing in, consigned everything animate
 and inanimate to indiscriminate destruction

 Jewish writers mention it as an immemorial tradition that the city fell
 on the Sabbath. It should be remembered that the Canaanites were 
 incorrigible idolaters, addicted to the most horrible vices, and that 
 the righteous judgment of God might sweep them away by the sword, as 
 well as by famine or pestilence. There was mercy mingled with judgment 
 in employing the sword as the instrument of punishing the guilty 
 Canaanites, for while it was directed against one place, time was 
 afforded for others to repent.</P>

 of human infirmity and to be wanting in that reverence and submission
 he owed to God. But, although apparently breathing a spirit of bold
 remonstrance and complaint, it was in reality the effusion of a deeply
 humbled and afflicted mind, expressing his belief that God could not,
 after having so miraculously brought His people over Jordan into the
 promised land, intend to destroy them, to expose them to the insults of
 their triumphant enemies, and bring reproach upon His own name for
 inconstancy or unkindness to His people, or inability to resist their

 chastisements for sin are often made to pave the way for the bestowment
 of those temporal benefits, which, on account of sin, have been
 withdrawn, or withheld for a time. Joshua, who had been greatly
 dispirited, was encouraged by a special communication promising him (see
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:6,De+31:6-8">Jos 1:6;
 De 31:6-8</A>) 

 success in the next attempt, which, however, was to be conducted on
 different principles.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai</B>--The
 number of fighting men amounted to six hundred thousand, and the whole
 force was ordered on this occasion, partly because the spies, in their
 self-confidence, had said that a few were sufficient to attack the
 place 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:3">Jos 7:3</A>),

 partly to dispel any misgivings which the memory of the late disaster
 might have created, and partly that the circumstance of the first spoil 
 obtained in Canaan being shared among all, might operate both as a 
 reward for obedience in refraining from the booty of Jericho, and as an 
 incentive to future exertions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:10">De 6:10</A>).

 The rest of the people, including the women and children, remained in
 the camp at Gilgal. Being in the plains of Jericho, it was an ascent to 
 Ai, which was on a hill.

 <B>I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his

 themselves in the immediate precincts of the town, in order to seize

 Joshua himself took up his position on the north side of "the
 ravine"--the deep chasm of the wady El-Murogede; "<I>that</I> night"--means,
 while it was dark, probably after midnight, or very early in the
 morning

 it a lucky hour 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:38">Jud 20:38</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the
 city</B>--It is evident that this king and his subjects were little
 experienced in war; otherwise they would have sent out scouts to
 reconnoitre the neighborhood; at all events, they would not have left
 their town wholly unprotected and open. Perhaps an ambuscade may have
 been a war stratagem hitherto unknown in that country, and among that
 people.</P>

 <B>15-17. Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before
 them</B>--the pretended flight in the direction of the wilderness; that
 is, southeast, into the Ghor, the desert valley of the Jordan, decoyed
 all the inhabitants of Ai out of the city, while the people of Beth-el
 hastened to participate in the expected victory. It is supposed by some,
 from "the city," and not "cities," being spoken of, that the effective
 force of Beth-el had been concentrated in Ai, as the two places were
 closely contiguous, and Ai the larger of the two. (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+12:9">Jos 12:9</A>).

 It may be remarked, however, that the words, "or Beth-el," are not in
 the <I>Septuagint,</I> and are rejected by some eminent scholars, as an 
 interpolation not found in the most ancient manuscripts.</P>

 to render it the more conspicuous from the height where he stood. At
 the sight of this understood signal the ambush nearest the city,
 informed by their scouts, made a sudden rush and took possession of the
 city, telegraphing to their brethren by raising a smoke from the walls.
 Upon seeing this, the main body, who had been reigning a flight, turned
 round at the head of the pass upon their pursuers, while the
 twenty-five thousand issuing from their ambuscade, fell back upon their
 rear. The Ai-ites surprised, looked back, and found their situation now
 desperate.</P>

 taken prisoners, were usually executed. The Israelites were obliged, by
 the divine law, to put them to death. The execution of the king of Ai
 would tend to facilitate the conquest of the land, by striking terror
 into the other chiefs, and making it appear a judicial process, in
 which they were inflicting the vengeance of God upon His enemies.

 <B>30, 31. Then Joshua built an altar unto the Lord God of Israel in
 mount Ebal</B>--(See on

 <A HREF="JFB05.htm#De27_11">De 27:11</A>).

 This spot was little short of twenty miles from Ai. The march through a
 hostile country and the unmolested performance of the religious 
 ceremonial observed at this mountain, would be greatly facilitated, 
 through the blessing of God, by the disastrous fall of Ai. The solemn 
 duty was to be attended to at the first convenient opportunity after 
 the entrance into Canaan

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:2">De 27:2</A>);
 
 and with this in view Joshua seems to have conducted the people through
 the mountainous region that intervened though no details of the journey
 have been recorded. Ebal was on the north, opposite to Gerizim, which
 was on the south side of the town Sichem (Nablous).</P>

 <A NAME="Jos8_31"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>31. an altar of whole stones</B>--according to the instructions given to
 Moses

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>over which no man hath lifted up any iron</B>--that is, iron tool. The
 reason for this was that every altar of the true God ought properly to
 have been built of earth 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:24">Ex 20:24</A>);

 and if it was constructed of stone, rough, unhewn stones were to be
 employed that it might retain both the appearance and nature of earth, 
 since every bloody sacrifice was connected with sin and death, by which 
 man, the creature of earth, is brought to earth again [K<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>EIL</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the Lord, and sacrificed
 peace offerings</B>--This had been done when the covenant was established

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:5">Ex 24:5</A>);
 
 and by the observance of these rites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:6">De 27:6</A>),

 the covenant was solemnly renewed--the people were reconciled to God by
 the burnt offering, and this feast accompanying the peace or thank 
 offering, a happy communion with God was enjoyed by all the families in 
 Israel.</P>

 <A NAME="Jos8_32"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>32. he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of
 Moses</B>--(See on

 <A HREF="JFB05.htm#De27_2">De 27:2, 3, 5</A>);

 that is, the blessings and curses of the law.  Some think that the
 stones which contained this inscription were the stones of the altar: 
 but this verse seems rather to indicate that a number of stone pillars 
 were erected alongside of the altar, and on which, after they were 
 plastered, this duplicate of the law was inscribed.</P>

 <A NAME="Jos8_33"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>33. all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges,
 stood on this side the ark and on that side</B>--One half of Israel was
 arranged on Gerizim, and the other half on Ebal--along the sides and
 base of each.

 <B>35. There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read
 not</B>--It appears that a much larger portion of the law was read on this
 occasion than the brief summary inscribed on the stones; and this must
 have been the essence of the law as contained in Deuteronomy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:44,6:9,27:8">De 4:44; 6:9; 27:8</A>).

 It was not written on the stones, but on the plaster. The immediate
 design of this rehearsal was attained by the performance of the act 
 itself. It only related to posterity, in so far as the record of the 
 event would be handed down in the Book of Joshua, or the documents 
 which form the groundwork of it [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGSTENBERG</FONT>]. 
 Thus faithfully did Joshua execute the instructions given by Moses. How 
 awfully solemn must have been the assemblage and the occasion! The eye 
 and the ear of the people being both addressed, it was calculated to 
 leave an indelible impression; and with spirits elevated by their 
 brilliant victories in the land of promise, memory would often revert 
 to the striking scene on mounts Ebal and Gerizim, and in the vale of 
 Sychar.</P>

 of their oath; and, although the popular clamor was loud against them, 
 caused either by disappointment at losing the spoils of Gibeon, or by 
 displeasure at the apparent breach of the divine commandment, they 
 determined to adhere to their pledge, "because they had sworn by the 
 Lord God of Israel." The Israelitish princes acted conscientiously; 
 they felt themselves bound by their solemn promise; but to prevent the 
 disastrous consequences of their imprudent haste, they resolved to 
 degrade the Gibeonites to a servile condition as a means of preventing 
 their people from being ensnared into idolatry, and thus acted up, as 
 they thought, to the true spirit and end of the law.</P>

 But the intelligence of so formidable a combination among the native
 princes seems to have depressed his mind with the anxious and
 dispiriting idea that it was a chastisement for the hasty and
 inconsiderate alliance entered into with the Gibeonites. It was
 evidently to be a struggle of life and death, not only to Gibeon, but
 to the Israelites. And in this view the divine communication that was
 made to him was seasonable and animating. He seems to have asked the

 <B>chased them along the way that goeth up to Beth-horon</B>--that is, "the
 House of Caves," of which there are still traces existing. There were
 two contiguous villages of that name, upper and nether. Upper
 Beth-horon was nearest Gibeon--about ten miles distant, and approached
 by a gradual ascent through a long and precipitous ravine. This was the
 first stage of the flight. The fugitives had crossed the high ridge of
 Upper Beth-horon, and were in full flight down the descent to Beth-horon
 the Nether. The road between the two places is so rocky and rugged that
 there is a path made by means of steps cut in the rock
 [R<FONT SIZE=-1>OBINSON</FONT>]. Down
 this pass Joshua continued his victorious rout. Here it was that the
 Lord interposed, assisting His people by means of a storm, which,
 having been probably gathering all day, burst with such irresistible
 fury, that "they were more which died with hailstones than they whom
 the children of Israel slew with the sword." The Oriental hailstorm is
 a terrific agent; the hailstones are masses of ice, large as walnuts,
 and sometimes as two fists; their prodigious size, and the violence
 with which they fall, make them always very injurious to property, and
 often fatal to life. The miraculous feature of <I>this</I> tempest, which
 fell on the Amorite army, was the entire preservation of the Israelites
 from its destructive ravages.</P>

 <B>12-15. Then spake Joshua to the Lord .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he said in the
 sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and thou, Moon</B>--The
 inspired author here breaks off the thread of his history of this
 miraculous victory to introduce a quotation from an ancient poem, in
 which the mighty acts of that day were commemorated. The passage, which
 is parenthetical, contains a <I>poetical</I> description of the victory
 which was miraculously gained by the help of God, and forms an extract
 from "the book of Jasher," that is, "the upright"--an anthology, or
 collection of national songs, in honor of renowned and eminently pious
 heroes. The language of a poem is not to be literally interpreted; and
 therefore, when the sun and moon are personified, addressed as
 intelligent beings, and represented as standing still, the explanation
 is that the light of the sun and moon was supernaturally prolonged by
 the same laws of refraction and reflection that ordinarily cause the
 sun to appear above the horizon, when it is in reality below it
 [K<FONT SIZE=-1>EIL</FONT>,
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>USH</FONT>].
 Gibeon ("a hill") was now at the back of the Israelites,
 and the height would soon have intercepted the rays of the setting sun.
 The valley of Ajalon ("stags") was before them, and so near that it was
 sometimes called "the valley of Gibeon" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:21">Isa 28:21</A>).

 It would seem, from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:14">Jos 10:14</A>,

 that the command of Joshua was in reality a prayer to God for the
 performance of this miracle; and that, although the prayers of 
 eminently good men like Moses often prevailed with God, never was there 
 on any other occasion so astonishing a display of divine power made in 
 behalf of His people, as in answer to the prayer of Joshua.

 determined struggle against the invaders; and "it was the use of these
 which seems to have fixed the place of rendezvous by the lake Merom
 (now Huleh), along whose level shores they could have full play for
 their force." A host so formidable in numbers, as well as in military

 Houghing the horses is done by cutting the sinews and arteries of their

 <B>1. Now Joshua was old and stricken in years</B>--He was probably above a
 hundred years old; for the conquest and survey of the land occupied
 about seven years, the partition one; and he died at the age of one
 hundred ten years 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:29">Jos 24:29</A>).

 The distribution, as well as the conquest of the land, was included in
 the mission of Joshua; and his advanced age supplied a special reason 
 for entering on the immediate discharge of that duty; namely, of 
 allocating Canaan among the tribes of Israel--not only the parts 
 already won, but those also which were still to be conquered.</P>

 <B>2-6. This is the land that yet remaineth</B>--that is, to be acquired.
 This section forms a parenthesis, in which the historian briefly
 notices the districts yet unsubdued; namely, first, the whole country
 of the Philistines--a narrow tract stretching about sixty miles along
 the Mediterranean coast, and that of the Geshurites to the south of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+27:8">1Sa 27:8</A>).

 Both included that portion of the country "from Sihor, which is before
 Egypt," a small brook near El-Arish, which on the east was the southern 
 boundary of Canaan, to Ekron, the most northerly of the five chief 
 lordships or principalities of the Philistines.</P>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:23">De 2:23</A>),

 <B>that is beside the Sidonians</B>--a mountainous region of Upper Galilee,
 remarkable for its caves and fastnesses.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>unto Aphek</B>--now Afka; eastward, in Lebanon.

 territory that had belonged to Og. The third district that remained
 unsubdued:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>5. all the land of the Giblites</B>--Their capital was Gebal or Bylbos
 (<I>Greek</I>), on the Mediterranean, forty miles north of Sidon.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>all Lebanon, toward the sunrising</B>--that is, Anti-libanus; the eastern
 ridge, which has its proper termination in Hermon.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>entering into Hamath</B>--the valley of Baalbec.</P>

 <A NAME="Jos13_6"> </A>

 Misrephoth-maim</B>--(See on

 --that is, "all the Sidonians and Ph&oelig;nicians."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>them will I drive out</B>--The fulfilment of this promise was conditional.
 In the event of the Israelites proving unfaithful or disobedient, they
 would not subdue the districts now specified; and, in point of fact,
 the Israelites never possessed them though the inhabitants were
 subjected to the power of David and Solomon.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance</B>--The
 parenthetic section being closed, the historian here resumes the main
 subject of this chapter--the order of God to Joshua to make an
 immediate allotment of the land. The method of distribution by lot was,
 in all respects, the best that could have been adopted, as it prevented
 all ground of discontent, as well as charges of arbitrary or partial
 conduct on the part of the leaders; and its announcement in the life of
 Moses 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+33:54">Nu 33:54</A>),

 as the system according to which the allocations to each tribe should
 be made, was intended to lead the people to the acknowledgment of God 
 as the proprietor of the land and as having the entire right to its 
 disposal. Moreover, a solemn appeal to the lot showed it to be the 
 dictate not of human, but divine, wisdom. It was used, however, only in 
 determining the part of the country where a tribe was to be 
 settled--the extent of the settlement was to be decided on a different 
 principle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:54">Nu 26:54</A>).

 The overruling control of God is conclusively proved because each tribe
 received the possession predicted by Jacob

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:3-28">Ge 49:3-28</A>)

 <B>8. With whom</B>--<I>Hebrew,</I> "him." The antecedent is evidently to
 Manasseh, not, however, the half-tribe just mentioned, but the other
 half; for the historian, led, as it were, by the sound of the word,
 breaks off to describe the possessions beyond Jordan already assigned
 to Reuben, Gad, and the half of Manasseh
 (see on

 <A HREF="JFB04.htm#Nu32_1">Nu 32:1</A>;

 It may be proper to remark that it was wise to put these boundaries on
 record. In case of any misunderstanding or dispute arising about the 
 exact limits of each district or property, an appeal could always be 
 made to this authoritative document, and a full knowledge as well as 
 grateful sense obtained of what they had received from God

 of the allocation of the land west of Jordan, or Canaan proper, to the
 nine tribes and a half. It was also made by lot in presence of a select
 number of superintendents, appointed according to divine directions
 given to Moses
 (see on

 <A HREF="JFB04.htm#Nu34_16">Nu 34:16</A>). 

 In everything pertaining to civil government, and even the division of
 the land, Joshua was the acknowledged chief. But in a matter to be

 Though the general survey of the country had not been completed, some
 rough draft or delineation of the first conquered part must have been 
 made, and satisfactory evidence obtained that it was large enough to 
 furnish three cantons, before all the tribes cast lots for them; and 
 they fell to Judah, Ephraim, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. The lot of 
 Judah came first, in token of the pre-eminence of that tribe over all 
 the others; and its destined superiority thus received the visible 
 sanction of God. The territory, assigned to it as a possession, was 
 large and extensive, being bounded on the south by the wilderness of 
 Zin, and the southern extremity of the Salt Sea

 she resolved herself to speak out. Taking advantage of the
 parting scene when a parent's heart was likely to be tender, she begged
 (as her marriage portion consisted of a field which, having a southern
 exposure, was comparatively an arid and barren waste) he would add the
 adjoining one, which abounded in excellent springs. The request being
 reasonable, it was granted; and the story conveys this important lesson
 in religion, that if earthly parents are ready to bestow on their

 allotments; and the country having been in a great measure subdued, the
 camp was removed to Shiloh (now Seilun). It was twenty or twenty-five
 miles north of Jerusalem, twelve north of Beth-el, and ten south of
 Shechem, and embosomed in a rugged and romantic glen. This sequestered
 spot in the heart of the country might have been recommended by the
 dictates of convenience. There the allotment of the territory could be
 most conveniently made, north, south, east, and west, to the different
 tribes. But "the tabernacle of the congregation was also set up there,"
 and its removal therefore must have been made or sanctioned by divine
 intimation

 <B>2. there remained .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. seven tribes, which had not yet received their
 inheritance</B>--The selection of Shiloh for the seat of worship, together
 with the consequent removal of the camp thither, had necessarily
 interrupted the casting of lots, which was commenced by fixing
 localities for the tribes of Judah and Joseph. Various causes led to a
 long delay in resuming it. The satisfaction of the people with their
 change to so pleasant and fertile a district, their preference of a
 nomad life, a love of ease, and reluctance to renew the war, seem to
 have made them indifferent to the possession of a settled inheritance.
 But Joshua was too much alive to the duty laid on him by the Lord to
 let matters continue in that state; and accordingly, since a general
 conquest of the land had been made, he resolved to proceed immediately
 with the lot, believing that when each tribe should receive its
 inheritance, a new motive would arise to lead them to exert themselves
 in securing the full possession.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4-9. Give out from among you three men for each tribe</B>--Though the lot
 determined the part of the country where each tribe was to be located,
 it could not determine the extent of territory which might be required;
 and the dissatisfaction of the children of Joseph with the alleged
 smallness of their possession gave reason to fear that complaints might
 arise from other quarters, unless precautions were taken to make a
 proper distribution of the land. For this purpose a commission was
 given to twenty-one persons--three chosen from each of the seven tribes
 which had not yet received their inheritance, to make an accurate
 survey of the country.</P>

 its value, and the worth of the cities which it contained, into seven

 learning and intelligence which they or their instructors had, in all
 probability, brought with them out of Egypt. Accordingly,
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT> says

 tribe and its situation, well proves it to have been the work of no

 <B>1. the second lot came forth to Simeon</B>--The next lot that was drawn
 at Shiloh, gave the tribe of Simeon his inheritance within the
 territory, which had been assigned to that of Judah. The knowledge of
 Canaan possessed by the Israelites, when the division of the land
 commenced, was but very general, being derived from the rapid sweep they
 had made over it during the course of conquest; and it was on the ground
 of that rough survey alone that the distribution proceeded, by which
 Judah received an inheritance. Time showed that this territory was too
 large 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:9">Jos 19:9</A>),

 either for their numbers, however great, to occupy and their arms to
 defend, or too large in proportion to the allotments of the other 
 tribes. Justice therefore required (what kind and brotherly feeling 
 readily dictated) a modification of their possession; and a part of it 
 was appropriated to Simeon. By thus establishing it within the original 
 domain of another tribe, the prophecy of Jacob in regard to Simeon was 
 fulfilled

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:7">Ge 49:7</A>);

 The command here recorded was given on their going to occupy their
 allotted settlements. The sanctuaries were not temples or altars, as in 
 other countries, but inhabited cities; and the design was not to screen 
 criminals, but only to afford the homicide protection from the 
 vengeance of the deceased's relatives until it should have been 
 ascertained whether the death had resulted from accident and momentary 
 passion, or from premeditated malice. The institution of the cities of

 enemy being in so dispirited and isolated a condition that each tribe,
 by its own resources or with the aid of its neighboring tribe, was able
 to repress any renewed hostilities, the auxiliary Israelites from the
 eastern side of the Jordan were now discharged from service. Joshua
 dismissed them with high commendations for their fidelity and earnest
 admonitions to cultivate perpetual piety in life. The redundancy of the

 <B>10. when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of
 Canaan, the children of Reuben .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. built there an altar by
 Jordan</B>--This altar was probably an immense pile of stones and
 earth. The generality of our translators supposes that it was reared on
 the banks of the Jordan, within the limits of Canaan proper. But a
 little closer examination seems to make the conclusion irresistible
 that its position was on the eastern side of the river, for these two
 reasons; first, because it is said 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+22:11">Jos 22:11</A>)

 to have been built "over against," or in the sight of the land of
 Canaan--not within it; and secondly, because the declared motive of the 
 trans-jordanic Israelites in erecting it was to prevent their brethren 
 in Canaan ever saying, "in time to come, What have ye to do with the 
 Lord God of Israel? For the Lord hath made Jordan a border between us 
 and you," &c.

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+22:24,25">Jos 22:24, 25</A>].

 Such a taunt would be obviously prevented or confuted by the two tribes
 and a half having on the eastern side of Jordan, within their own land, 
 a facsimile of the altar at Shiloh, as a witness that they acknowledged 
 the same God and practised the same rites of worship as the brethren in 
 Canaan.</P>

 <B>11-29. and the children of Israel heard say</B>--Fame speedily spread
 intelligence of what the trans-jordanic tribes had done. The act being
 suspected of some idolatrous design, the tribes rose in a mass, and
 repairing to the tabernacle at Shiloh, resolved to declare war against
 the two tribes and a half as apostates from God. On calmer and more
 mature consideration, however, they determined, in the first instance,
 to send a deputation consisting of the son of the high priest, and ten
 eminent persons from each tribe, to make inquiry into this rumored
 rebellion against God 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:13-15">De 13:13-15</A>).

 The quality of the deputies evinced the deep solicitude that was felt
 on the occasion to maintain the purity of the divine worship throughout 
 Israel. In the presumptive belief that the two tribes and a half had 
 really built an altar, the deputies expressed astonishment at their so 
 soon falling into such a heinous crime as that of violating the unity 
 of divine worship

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:24,Le+17:8,9,De+12:5-13">Ex 20:24; 
 Leviticus 17:8, 9;
 De 12:5-13</A>).

 They reminded their eastern brethren of the disastrous consequences
 that were entailed on the nation at large by the apostasy at Peor and 
 by the sin of Achan, and finally exhorted them, if they felt the want 
 of the tabernacle and altar and repented of their rash choice in 
 preferring worldly advantages to religious privileges, to remove to the 
 western side of the Jordan, where all the tribes would form a united 
 and obedient community of worshippers.</P>

 died</B>--L<FONT SIZE=-1>IGHTFOOT</FONT> computes that he lived seventeen,
 others twenty-seven years, after the entrance into Canaan. He was
 buried, according to the Jewish practice, within the limits of his own
 inheritance. The eminent public services he had long rendered to Israel
 and the great amount of domestic comfort and national prosperity he had
 been instrumental in diffusing among the several tribes, were deeply
 felt, were universally acknowledged; and a testimonial in the form of a
 statue or obelisk would have been immediately raised to his honor, in
 all parts of the land, had such been the fashion of the times. The
 brief but noble epitaph by the historian is, Joshua, "the servant of
 the Lord."</P>

 <B>31. Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua</B>--The high and
 commanding character of this eminent leader had given so decided a tone
 to the sentiments and manners of his contemporaries and the memory of
 his fervent piety and many virtues continued so vividly impressed on
 the memories of the people, that the sacred historian has recorded it
 to his immortal honor. "Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua,
 and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua."</P>

 <B>32. the bones of Joseph</B>--They had carried these venerable relics with
 them in all their migrations through the desert, and deferred the
 burial, according to the dying charge of Joseph himself, till they
 arrived in the promised land. The sarcophagus, in which his mummied
 body had been put, was brought thither by the Israelites, and probably
 buried when the tribe of Ephraim had obtained their settlement, or at
 the solemn convocation described in this chapter.

 silver</B>--<I>Kestitah</I> translated, "piece of silver," is supposed to mean
 "a lamb," the weights being in the form of lambs or kids, which were, in
 all probability, the earliest standard of value among pastoral people.
 The tomb that now covers the spot is a Mohammedan <I>Welce,</I> but there
 is no reason to doubt that the precious deposit of Joseph's remains may
 be concealed there at the present time.</P>
