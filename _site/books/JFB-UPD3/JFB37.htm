 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT> name <I>Haggai</I> means "my feast"; given, 
 according to C<FONT SIZE=-1>OCCEIUS</FONT>, in anticipation of the 
 joyous return from exile. He probably was one of the Jewish exiles (of 
 the tribes Judah, Benjamin, and Levi) who returned under Zerubbabel,
 the civil head of the people, and Joshua, the high priest, 536 <FONT
 SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, when Cyrus (actuated by the striking prophecies as
 to himself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:28,45:1">Isa 44:28; 45:1</A>)

 granted them their liberty, and furnished them with the necessaries for
 restoring the temple

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:23,Ezr+1:1,2:2">2Ch 36:23;
 Ezr 1:1; 2:2</A>). 

 The work of rebuilding went on under Cyrus and his successor Cambyses
 (called Ahasuerus in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:6">Ezr 4:6</A>)

 in spite of opposition from the Samaritans, who, when their offers of
 help were declined, began to try to hinder it. These at last obtained 
 an interdict from the usurper Smerdis the Magian (called Artaxerxes in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:7-23">Ezr 4:7-23</A>),

 whose suspicions were easy to rouse. The Jews thereupon became so
 indifferent to the work that when Darius came to the throne (521 <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>), virtually setting aside the prohibitions of the 
 usurper, instead of recommencing their labors, they pretended that as 
 the prophecy of <I>the seventy years</I> applied to the temple as well 
 as to the captivity in Babylon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:2">Hag 1:2</A>),

 they were only in the sixty-eighth year of it [H<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ENDERSON</FONT>]; so that, the proper time not having yet 
 arrived, they might devote themselves to building splendid mansions for 
 themselves. Haggai and Zechariah were commissioned by Jehovah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:1">Hag 1:1</A>)

 in the second year of Darius (Hystaspes), 520 <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, sixteen years after the return under Zerubbabel, 
 to rouse them from their selfishness to resume the work which for 
 fourteen years had been suspended. Haggai preceded Zechariah in the 
 work by two months.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The dates of his four distinct prophecies are accurately given: (1)
 The first 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:1-15">Hag 1:1-15</A>),

 on the first day of the sixth month of the second year of Darius, 520 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, reproved the people for their apathy in 
 allowing the temple to lie in ruins and reminded them of their ill 
 success in everything because of their not honoring God as to His 
 house. The result was that twenty-four days afterwards they commenced 
 building under Zerubbabel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:12-15">Hag 1:12-15</A>).

 (2) The second, on the twenty-first day of the seventh month

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:1-9">Hag 2:1-9</A>),

 predicts that the glory of the new temple would be greater than that of 
 Solomon's, so that the people need not be discouraged by the 
 inferiority in outward splendor of the new, as compared with the old 
 temple, which had so moved to tears the elders who had remembered the 
 old

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:12,13">Ezr 3:12, 13</A>).

 Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel had implied the same prediction, whence 
 some had doubted whether they ought to proceed with a building so 
 inferior to the former one; but Haggai shows wherein the superior glory 
 was to consist, namely, in the presence of Him who is the "desire of 
 all nations"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:7">Hag 2:7</A>).

 (3) The third, on the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:10-19">Hag 2:10-19</A>),

 refers to a period when building materials had been collected, and the 
 workmen had begun to put them together, from which time forth God 
 promises His blessing; it begins with removing their past error as to 
 the efficacy of mere outward observances to cleanse from the taint of 
 disobedience as to the temple building. (4) The fourth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:20-23">Hag 2:20-23</A>),

 on the same day as the preceding, was addressed to Zerubbabel, as the 
 representative of the theocratic people, and as having asked as to the 
 national revolutions spoken of in the second prophecy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:7">Hag 2:7</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophecies are all so brief as to suggest the supposition that
 they are only a summary of the original discourses. The space occupied
 is but three months from the first to the last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Jews' adversaries, on the resumption of the work under
 Zerubbabel, Haggai, and Zechariah, tried to set Darius against it; but
 that monarch confirmed Cyrus' decree and ordered all help to be given
 to the building of the temple 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:3,6:1">Ezr 5:3,
 &c.; Ezr 6:1</A>,

 &c.).

 So the temple was completed in the sixth year of Darius' reign 516-515
 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:14">Ezr 6:14</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The style of Haggai is consonant with his messages: pathetic in
 exhortation, vehement in reproofs, elevated in contemplating the
 glorious future. The repetition of the same phrases (for example,
 "saith the Lord," or "the Lord of hosts,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:2,5,7">Hag 1:2, 5, 7</A>;

 and thrice in one verse,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:4">Hag 2:4</A>;
 
 so "the spirit," thrice in one verse,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:14">Hag 1:14</A>)

 gives a simple earnestness to his style, calculated to awaken the 
 solemn attention of the people, and to awaken them from their apathy, 
 to which also the interrogatory form, often adopted, especially tends. 
 Chaldaisms occur

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:3,2:6,2:16">Hag 2:3; 2:6; 2:16</A>),

 as might have been expected in a writer who was so long in Chaldea.
 Parts are purely prose history; the rest is somewhat rhythmical, and 
 observant of poetic parallelism.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Haggai is referred to in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:1,6:14">Ezr 5:1; 6:14</A>;

 and in the New Testament

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:26">Heb 12:26</A>;
 
 compare

 <B>1. second year of Darius</B>--Hystaspes, the king of Medo-Persia, the
 second of the world empires, Babylon having been overthrown by the
 Persian Cyrus. The Jews having no king of their own, dated by the reign
 of the world kings to whom they were subject. Darius was a common name
 of the Persian kings, as Pharaoh of those of Egypt, and C&aelig;sar of those
 of Rome. The name in the cuneiform inscriptions at Persepolis is written
 <I>Daryawus,</I> from the root <I>Darh,</I> "to preserve," the <I>Conservator</I>
 [L<FONT SIZE=-1>ASSEN</FONT>].
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ERODOTUS</FONT> [6.98] explains it <I>Coercer.</I> Often opposite
 attributes are assigned to the same god; in which light the Persians
 viewed their king.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:24">Ezr 4:24</A>

 harmonizes with Haggai in making this year the date of the resumption 
 of the building.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>sixth month</B>--of the Hebrew year, not of Darius' reign (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:7,7:1,3,8:19">Zec 1:7; 7:1, 3; 8:19</A>).

 Two months later ("the eighth month,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:1">Zec 1:1</A>)

 Zechariah began to prophesy, seconding Haggai.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the Lord</B>--<I>Hebrew,</I>
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>EHOVAH</FONT>: God's covenant title, implying His
 unchangeableness, the guarantee of His faithfulness in keeping His
 promises to His people.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>by Haggai</B>--<I>Hebrew,</I> "in the hand of Haggai"; God being the real
 speaker, His prophet but the instrument (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:35,Ga+3:19">Ac 7:35;
 Ga 3:19</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Zerubbabel</B>--called also Shesh-bazzar in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:8,5:14,16">Ezr 1:8; 5:14, 16</A>,

 where the same work is attributed to Shesh-bazzar that in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:8">Ezr 3:8</A>

 is attributed to Zerubbabel. Shesh-bazzar is probably his 
 <I>Chaldean</I> name; as Belteshazzar was that of Daniel. Zerubbabel, 
 his <I>Hebrew</I> name, means "one born in Babylon."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>son of Shealtiel</B>--or Salathiel. But

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+3:17,19">1Ch 3:17, 19</A>

 makes Pedaiah his father. Probably he was adopted by his <I>uncle</I> 
 Salathiel, or Shealtiel, at the death of his father (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:12,Lu+3:27">Mt 1:12;
 Lu 3:27</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>governor of Judah</B>--to which office Cyrus had appointed him. The
 <I>Hebrew Pechah</I> is akin to the original of the modern Turkish <I>Pasha;</I> one ruling a region of the Persian empire of less extent than that under
 a satrap.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Joshua</B>--called Jeshua 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:2">Ezr 2:2</A>);
 
 so the son of Nun in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:17">Ne 8:17</A>.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Josedech</B>--or Jehozadak 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:15">1Ch 6:15</A>),

 one of those carried captive by Nebuchadnezzar. Haggai addresses the 
 civil and the religious representatives of the people, so as to have 
 them as his associates in giving God's commands; thus priest, prophet, 
 and ruler jointly testify in God's name.</P>

 <A NAME="Hag1_2"> </A>

 and therefore requiring implicit obedience.

 <B>This people</B>--"This" sluggish and selfish "people." He does not say,
 <I>My</I> people, since they had neglected the service of God.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>The time</B>--the proper time for building the temple. Two out of the
 seventy predicted years of captivity (dating from the destruction of the
 temple, 558 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+25:9">2Ki 25:9</A>)

 were yet unexpired; this they make their plea for delay [H<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ENDERSON</FONT>]. The seventy years of captivity were completed 
 long ago in the first year of Cyrus, 536 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:10">Jer 29:10</A>);
 
 dating from 606 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, Jehoiakim's captivity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:6">2Ch 36:6</A>).

 The seventy years to the completion of the temple

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:12">Jer 25:12</A>)

 were completed this very year, the second of Darius [V<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ATABLUS</FONT>]. Ingenious in excuses, they pretended that the 
 interruption in the work caused by their enemies proved it was <I>not 
 yet the proper time;</I> whereas their real motive was selfish dislike 
 of the trouble, expense, and danger from enemies. "God," say they, 
 "hath interposed many difficulties to punish our rash haste" [C<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>]. Smerdis' interdict was no longer in force, now 
 that Darius the rightful king was on the throne; therefore they had no 
 real excuse for not beginning at once to build.  A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>UBERLEN</FONT> denies that by "Artaxerxes" in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:7-22">Ezr 4:7-22</A>

 is meant Smerdis. Whether Smerdis or Artaxerxes Longimanus be meant, 
 the interdict referred only to the rebuilding of the <I>city,</I> which 
 the Persian kings feared might, if rebuilt, cause them trouble to 
 subdue; not to the rebuilding of the <I>temple.</I> But the Jews were 
 easily turned aside from the work. Spiritually, like the Jews, men do 
 not say they will never be religious, but, It is not time yet. So the 
 great work of life is left undone.</P>

 time not only to <I>build,</I> but to "dwell" at ease in your own 
 houses?

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>you, O ye</B>--rather, for "you, you"; the repetition marking the shameful
 contrast between their concern for <I>themselves,</I> and their unconcern
 for God [M<FONT SIZE=-1>AURER</FONT>]. Compare a similar repetition in

 Zec 7:5</A>.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>ceiled</B>--rather, "wainscoted," or "paneled," referring to the walls as
 well as the ceilings; furnished not only with comfort but luxury, in sad
 contrast to God's house not merely unadorned, but the very walls not
 raised above the foundations. How different David's feelings

 God. The punishment corresponds to the sin. They thought to escape
 poverty by not building, but keeping their money to themselves; God
 brought it on them <I>for</I> not building

 Instead of cheating God, they had been only cheating themselves.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>ye clothe .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. none warm</B>--through insufficiency of clothing;
 as ye are unable through poverty from failure of your crops to purchase
 sufficient clothing. The verbs are infinitive, implying a
 <I>continued state:</I> "Ye have sown, and <I>been bringing in</I> but little;
 ye have <I>been eating,</I> but not to <I>being satisfied;</I> ye have
 <I>been drinking,</I> but not to <I>being filled;</I> ye have been <I>putting</I> on clothes, but not to <I>being warmed</I>"
 [M<FONT SIZE=-1>OORE</FONT>]. Careful consideration
 of God's dealings with us will indicate God's will regarding us. The
 events of life are the hieroglyphics in which God records His feelings
 towards us, the key to which is found in the Bible
 [M<FONT SIZE=-1>OORE</FONT>].

 <B>wood</B>--Haggai specifies this as being the first necessary; not to 
 the exclusion of other materials. <I>Stones</I> also were doubtless 
 needed.  That the old walls were not standing, as the Hebrew

 neglecting the temple. The greater was your greediness, the more bitter 
 your disappointment in being poorer than ever.

 Messiah, "the desire of all nations" [M<FONT SIZE=-1>OORE</FONT>]. The

 The kingdoms of the world are but the scaffolding for God's spiritual

 [M<FONT SIZE=-1>OORE</FONT>]. The Jews in Haggai's times hesitated
 about going forward with the work, through dread of the world power, 
 Medo-Persia, influenced by the craft of Samaria. The prophet assures 
 them this and all other world powers are to fall before Messiah, who is 
 to be associated with this temple; therefore they need fear naught. So

 met such under the Old Testament. At the establishment of the Sinaitic 
 covenant, only the earth was shaken to introduce it, but now heaven and 
 earth and all things are to be shaken, that is, along with prodigies in 
 the world of nature, all kingdoms that stand in the way of Messiah's 
 kingdom, "which cannot be shaken," are to be upturned

 He brings these objections to applying "the desire of all nations" to
 Messiah: (1) The <I>Hebrew</I> means the <I>quality,</I> not the 
 <I>thing</I> desired, namely, its <I>desirableness</I> or beauty, But 
 the abstract is often put for the concrete. So "a man of desires," that 
 is, <I>one desired</I> or <I>desirable</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:23,10:11">Da 9:23; 10:11</A>,
 
 <I>Margin;</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:3">Da 10:3</A>,

 <I>Margin</I>). (2) Messiah was not desired by all nations, but "a root
 out of a dry ground," having "no beauty that we should <I>desire</I> 
 Him"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:2">Isa 53:2</A>).

 But what is implied is not that the nations definitely desired 
 <I>Him,</I> but that He was the only one to satisfy the yearning 
 desires which all felt unconsciously for a Saviour, shown in their 
 painful rites and bloody sacrifices. Moreover, while the Jews as a 
 nation desired Him not (to which people

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:2">Isa 53:2</A>

 refers), the Gentiles, who are plainly pointed out by "all nations," 
 accepted Him; and so to them He was peculiarly desirable. (3) The verb, 
 "shall come," is <I>plural,</I> which requires the noun to be 
 understood in the <I>plural,</I> whereas if Messiah be intended, the 
 noun is <I>singular.</I> But when two nouns stand together, of which 
 one is governed by the other, the verb agrees sometimes <I>in 
 number</I> with the latter, though it really has the former as its 
 nominative, that is, the <I>Hebrew</I> "come" is made <I>in number</I> 
 to agree with "nations," though really agreeing with "the desire." 
 Besides, Messiah may be described as realizing in Himself at His coming 
 "<I>the desires</I> (the noun expressing collectively the 
 <I>plural</I>) of all nations"; whence the verb is <I>plural.</I> So in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:16">So 5:16</A>,

 "He is altogether lovely," in the <I>Hebrew</I> the same word as here, 
 "all <I>desires,</I>" that is, altogether desirable, or the object of 
 desires. (4)

 "The silver is mine," &c.; accords with the translation, "the choice

 harmonizes quite as well with <I>English Version</I> of

 [<I>Alcibiades,</I> 2] shows the yearning of the Gentiles after a 
 spiritual deliverer: "It is therefore necessary," says Alcibiades on 
 the subject of acceptable worship, "to wait until One teach us how we 
 ought to behave towards the gods and men." Alcibiades replies, "When 
 shall that time arrive, and who shall that Teacher be?  For most glad

 The inward glory of New Testament redemption far exceeds the outward

 silver, but He bestows far better treasures, the possession of which

 cannot impart its sanctity to any thing beyond, as "bread," &c.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:27">Le 6:27</A>).

 This is cited to illustrate the principle, that a sacrifice, holy, as 
 enveloping divine things (just as the "skirt" is "holy" which envelops 
 "holy" flesh), cannot by its inherent or <I>opus operatum</I> efficacy 
 make holy a person whose disobedience, as that of the Jew while 
 neglecting God's house, made him unholy.</P>

 Here he applies the two cases just stated. By the first case, "this
 people" is not made "holy" by their offerings "there" (namely, on the 
 altar built in the open air, under Cyrus,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:3">Ezr 3:3</A>);

 though the ritual sacrifice can ordinarily sanctify outwardly so far as 
 it reaches

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:13">Heb 9:13</A>),

 as the "holy flesh" sanctified the "skirt," yet it cannot make the 
 offerers in their persons and all their works acceptable to God, 
 because lacking the spirit of obedience

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:22">1Sa 15:22</A>)

 so long as they neglected to build the Lord's house. On the contrary, 
 by the second case, they made "unclean" their very <I>offerings</I> by 
 being unclean through "dead works" (disobedience), just as the person 
 unclean by contact with a dead body imparted his uncleanness to all 
 that he touched (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:14">Heb 9:14</A>).

 This all applies to them as they had been, not as they are now that 
 they have begun to obey; the design is to guard them against falling 
 back again. The "there" points to the altar, probably in view of the 
 audience which the prophet addressed.</P>
