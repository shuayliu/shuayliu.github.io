 This is the shortest book in the Old Testament. The name means "servant 
 of Jehovah." Obadiah stands fourth among the minor prophets according
 to the Hebrew arrangement of the canon, the fifth according to the 
 Greek. Some consider him to be the same as the Obadiah who 
 superintended the restoration of the temple under Josiah, 627 <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+34:12">2Ch 34:12</A>).
 
 But

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:11-16,20">Ob 11-16, 20</A>

 imply that Jerusalem was by this time overthrown by the Chaldeans, and 
 that he refers to the cruelty of Edom towards the Jews on that 
 occasion, which is referred to also in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:21,22,Eze+25:12-14,35:1-15,Ps+137:7">La 4:21, 22;
 Eze 25:12-14; 35:1-15;
 Ps 137:7</A>.

 From comparing 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:5,Jer+49:9">Ob 5
 with Jer 49:9</A>,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:6,Jer+49:10">Ob 6
 with Jer 49:10</A>,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:8,Jer+49:7">Ob 8
 with Jer 49:7</A>,

 it appears that Jeremiah embodied in his prophecies part of Obadiah's,
 as he had done in the case of other prophets also (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+15:1-16:14,Jer+48:1-47">Isa 15:1-16:14
 with Jer 48:1-47</A>).

 The reason for the present position of Obadiah before other of the
 minor prophets anterior in date is: Amos at the close of his prophecies 
 foretells the subjugation of Edom hereafter by the Jews; the arranger 
 of the minor prophets in one volume, therefore, placed Obadiah next, as 
 being a fuller statement, and, as it were, a commentary on the 
 foregoing briefer prophecy of Amos as to Edom [M<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>AURER</FONT>]. (Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+1:11">Am 1:11</A>).

 The date of Obadiah's prophecies was probably immediately after the 
 taking of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, 588 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT> 
 Five years afterwards (583 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>) Edom was
 conquered by Nebuchadnezzar. Jeremiah must have incorporated part of
 Obadiah's prophecies with his own immediately after they were uttered, 
 thus stamping his canonicity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> makes him contemporary with Hosea, Joel, and Amos. It is an
 argument in favor of this view that Jeremiah would be more likely to
 insert in his prophecies a portion from a preceding prophet than from a
 contemporary. If so, the allusion in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:11-14">Ob 11-14</A>

 will be to one of the former captures of Jerusalem: by the Egyptians 
 under Rehoboam

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:25,26,2Ch+12:2">1Ki 14:25, 26;
 2Ch 12:2</A>, 

 &c.), or that by the Philistines and Arabians in the reign of Joram

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+21:16,17">2Ch 21:16, 17</A>);

 or that by Joash, king of Israel, in the reign of Amaziah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:22,23">2Ch 25:22, 23</A>);

 or that in the reign of Jehoiakim

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:1">2Ki 24:1</A>,

 &c.); or that in the reign of Jehoiachin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:8-16">2Ki 24:8-16</A>).

 On all occasions the Idumeans were hostile to the Jews; and the terms 
 in which that enmity is characterized are not stronger in Obadiah than 
 in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:19,Ob+1:10,Am+1:11,12">Joe 3:19
 (compare Ob 10);
 Am 1:11, 12</A>.

 The probable capture of Jerusalem alluded to by Obadiah is that by
 Joash and the Israelites in the reign of Amaziah. For as, a little 
 before, in the reign of the same Amaziah, the Jews had treated harshly 
 the Edomites after conquering them in battle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:11-23">2Ch 25:11-23</A>),

 it is probable that the Edomites, in revenge, joined the Israelites in
 the attack on Jerusalem [J<FONT SIZE=-1>AEGER</FONT>].</P>

 [D<FONT SIZE=-1>RUSIUS</FONT>]. This view agrees with the context,
 which speaks of false friends <I>deceiving</I> Edom: that is, failing to
 give help in need (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:14,15">Job 6:14, 15</A>).

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+41:9">Ps 41:9</A>,

 which seems to have been before Obadiah's mind, as his words were
 before Jeremiah's.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>have laid a wound under thee</B>--"laid" implies that their intimacy 
 was used as a <FONT SIZE=-1>SNARE</FONT> <I>laid</I> with a view to 
 wound; also, these guest friends of Edom, instead of the cushions 
 ordinarily <I>laid</I> under guests at table, <I>laid</I> snares to 
 wound, that is, had a secret understanding with Edom's foe for that 
 purpose.  M<FONT SIZE=-1>AURER</FONT> translates, "a snare." But 
 <I>English Version</I> agrees with the <I>Hebrew,</I> which means, 
 literally, "a bandage for a wound."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>none understanding</B>--none of the wisdom for which Edom was famed (see

 to extricate him from his perilous position.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 translates, "on account of the
 slaughter," namely, that inflicted on Judea by Edom (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:14">Ob 14</A>).

 The <I>Septuagint, Syriac,</I> and <I>Vulgate</I> connect these 
 words with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:10">Ob 10</A>,

 "for the slaughter, for the violence (of which thou art guilty) against
 thy brother Jacob." <I>English Version,</I> "cut off <I>by 
 slaughter</I>" (that is, an <I>utter</I> cutting off), answers well to 
 "cut off <I>for ever</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:10">Ob 10</A>).

 However, the arrangement of the <I>Septuagint</I> gives a better
 parallelism in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:10">Ob 10</A>.

 "For the <I>slaughter</I>" (1) being balanced in just retribution by
 "thou shalt be <I>cut off</I> for ever" (4); as "For thy 
 <I>violence</I> (not so bad as <I>slaughter</I>) against thy brother 
 Jacob" (2) is balanced by "<I>shame</I> (not so bad as being <I>cut 
 off</I>) shall cover thee" (3). Shame and extinction shall repay 
 violence and slaughter
