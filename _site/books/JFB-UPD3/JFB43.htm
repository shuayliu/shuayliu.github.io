 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT> author of the Fourth Gospel was the younger of the two sons of
 Zebedee, a fisherman on the Sea of Galilee, who resided at Bethsaida,
 where were born Peter and Andrew his brother, and Philip also. His
 mother's name was Salome, who, though not without her imperfections

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:20-28">Mt 20:20-28</A>),

 was one of those dear and honored women who accompanied the Lord on one
 of His preaching circuits through Galilee, ministering to His bodily 
 wants; who followed Him to the cross, and bought sweet spices to anoint 
 Him after His burial, but, on bringing them to the grave, on the 
 morning of the First Day of the week, found their loving services 
 gloriously superseded by His resurrection ere they arrived.  His 
 father, Zebedee, appears to have been in good circumstances, owning a 
 vessel of his own and having hired servants

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:20">Mr 1:20</A>).

 Our Evangelist, whose occupation was that of a fisherman with his
 father, was beyond doubt a disciple of the Baptist, and one of the two 
 who had the first interview with Jesus. He was called while engaged at 
 his secular occupation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:21,22">Mt 4:21, 22</A>),
 
 and again on a memorable occasion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:1-11">Lu 5:1-11</A>),
 
 and finally chosen as one of the Twelve Apostles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:2">Mt 10:2</A>).

 He was the youngest of the Twelve--the "Benjamin," as D<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>A</FONT> C<FONT SIZE=-1>OSTA</FONT> calls him--and he and James 
 his brother were named in the native tongue by Him who knew the heart, 
 "Boanerges," which the Evangelist Mark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:17">Mr 3:17</A>)

 explains to mean "Sons of thunder"; no doubt from their natural 
 <I>vehemence</I> of <I>character.</I> They and Peter constituted that 
 select triumvirate of whom see on

 <A HREF="JFB42.htm#Lu9_28">Lu 9:28</A>.
 
 But the highest honor bestowed on this disciple was his being admitted
 to the bosom place with his Lord at the table, as "the disciple whom
 Jesus loved" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:23,20:2,21:7,Joh+20:24">Joh 13:23; 20:2; 21:7, 20:24</A>),

 and to have committed to him by the dying Redeemer the care of His
 mother

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:26,27">Joh 19:26, 27</A>).
 
 There can be no reasonable doubt that this distinction was due to a
 sympathy with His own spirit and mind on the part of John which the
 all-penetrating Eye of their common Master beheld in none of the rest;
 and although this was probably never seen either in his life or in his
 ministry by his fellow apostles, it is brought out wonderfully in his
 writings, which, in Christ-like spirituality, heavenliness, and love,
 surpass, we may freely say, all the other inspired writings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After the effusion of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, we find
 him in constant but silent company with Peter, the great spokesman and
 actor in the infant Church until the accession of Paul. While his love
 to the Lord Jesus drew him spontaneously to the side of His eminent
 servant, and his chastened vehemence made him ready to stand
 courageously by him, and suffer with him, in all that his testimony to
 Jesus might cost him, his modest humility, as the youngest of all the
 apostles, made him an admiring listener and faithful supporter of his
 brother apostle rather than a speaker or separate actor. Ecclesiastical
 history is uniform in testifying that John went to Asia Minor; but it
 is next to certain that this could not have been till after the death
 both of Peter and Paul; that he resided at Ephesus, whence, as from a
 center, he superintended the churches of that region, paying them
 occasional visits; and that he long survived the other apostles.
 Whether the mother of Jesus died before this, or went with John to
 Ephesus, where she died and was buried, is not agreed. One or two
 anecdotes of his later days have been handed down by tradition, one at
 least bearing marks of reasonable probability. But it is not necessary
 to give them here. In the reign of Domitian (<FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 81-96) he was
 banished to "the isle that is called Patmos" (a small rocky and then
 almost uninhabited island in the &AElig;gean Sea), "for the word of God and
 for the testimony of Jesus Christ" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:9">Re 1:9</A>).
 
 I<FONT SIZE=-1>REN&AElig;US</FONT> and
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>
 say that this took place about the end of Domitian's reign. That he was
 thrown into a cauldron of boiling oil, and miraculously delivered, is
 one of those legends which, though reported by T<FONT SIZE=-1>ERTULLIAN</FONT> and
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT>,
 is entitled to no credit. His return from exile took place during the
 brief but tolerant reign of Nerva; he died at Ephesus in the reign of
 Trajan [E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>,
 <I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 3.23], at an age above
 ninety, according to some; according to others, one hundred; and even
 one hundred twenty, according to others still. The intermediate number
 is generally regarded as probably the nearest to the truth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As to the <I>date</I> of this Gospel, the arguments for its having been
 composed before the destruction of Jerusalem (though relied on by some
 superior critics) are of the slenderest nature; such as the expression
 in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:2">Joh 5:2</A>,

 "there <I>is</I> at Jerusalem, by the sheep-gate, a pool," &c.; there
 being no allusion to Peter's martyrdom as having occurred according to 
 the prediction in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:18">Joh 21:18</A>

 --a thing too well known to require mention. That it was composed long
 after the destruction of Jerusalem, and after the decease of all the 
 other apostles, is next to certain, though the precise time cannot be 
 determined. Probably it was before his banishment, however; and if we 
 date it between the years 90 and 94, we shall probably be close to the 
 truth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As to the <I>readers</I> for whom it was more immediately designed, that
 they were Gentiles we might naturally presume from the lateness of the
 date; but the multitude of explanations of things familiar to every Jew
 puts this beyond all question.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 No doubt was ever thrown upon the genuineness and authenticity of
 this Gospel till about the close of the eighteenth century; nor were
 these embodied in any formal attack upon it till B<FONT SIZE=-1>RETSCHNEIDER</FONT>,
 in 1820, issued his famous treatise [<I>Probabilia</I>], the conclusions of
 which he afterwards was candid enough to admit had been satisfactorily
 disproved. To advert to these would be as painful as unnecessary;
 consisting as they mostly do of assertions regarding the Discourses of
 our Lord recorded in this Gospel which are revolting to every spiritual
 mind. The Tubingen school did their best, on their peculiar mode of
 reasoning, to galvanize into fresh life this theory of the
 post-Joannean date of the Fourth Gospel; and some Unitarian critics
 still cling to it. But to use the striking language of V<FONT SIZE=-1>AN</FONT>
 O<FONT SIZE=-1>OSTERZEE</FONT>
 regarding similar speculations on the Third Gospel, "Behold, the feet
 of them that shall carry it out dead are already at the door"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:9">Ac 5:9</A>).

 Is there one mind of the least elevation of spiritual discernment that
 does not see in this Gospel marks of historical truth and a surpassing 
 glory such as none of the other Gospels possess, brightly as they too 
 attest their own verity; and who will not be ready to say that if not 
 historically true, and true <I>just as it stands,</I> it never could 
 have been by mortal man composed or conceived?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Of the peculiarities of this Gospel, we note here only two. The one
 is its <I>reflective</I> character. While the others are purely
 <I>narrative,</I> the Fourth Evangelist, "pauses, as it were, at every
 turn," as D<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> C<FONT SIZE=-1>OSTA</FONT> says
 [<I>Four Witnesses,</I> p. 234], "at one time to
 give a reason, at another to fix the attention, to deduce consequences,
 or make applications, or to give utterance to the language of praise."
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:20,21,23-25,4:1,2,7:37-39,11:12,13,49-52,21:18,19,22,23">Joh
 2:20, 21, 23-25; 4:1, 2; 7:37-39; 11:12, 13, 49-52; 21:18, 19, 22, 23</A>.

 The other peculiarity of this Gospel is its <I>supplementary</I>
 character.  By this, in the present instance, we mean something more
 than the studiousness with which he omits many most important 
 particulars in our Lord's history, for no conceivable reason but that 
 they were already familiar as household words to all his readers, 
 through the three preceding Gospels, and his substituting in place of 
 these an immense quantity of the richest matter not found in the other 
 Gospels. We refer here more particularly to the <I>nature</I> of the 
 additions which distinguish this Gospel; particularly the notices of 
 the different Passovers which occurred during our Lord's public 
 ministry, and the record of His teaching at Jerusalem, without which it 
 is not too much to say that we could have had but a most imperfect 
 conception either of the duration of His ministry or of the plan of it. 
 But another feature of these additions is quite as noticeable and not 
 less important. "We find," to use again the words of D<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>A</FONT> C<FONT SIZE=-1>OSTA</FONT> [<I>Four Witnesses,</I> pp. 
 238, 239], slightly abridged, "only six of our Lord's miracles recorded 
 in this Gospel, but these are all of the most remarkable kind, and 
 surpass the rest in depth, specialty of application, and fulness of 
 meaning. Of these six we find only one in the other three Gospels--the 
 multiplication of the loaves. That miracle chiefly, it would seem, on 
 account of the important instructions of which it furnished the 
 occasion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:1-71">Joh 6:1-71</A>),

 is here recorded anew. The five other tokens of divine power are
 distinguished from among the many recorded in the three other Gospels 
 by their furnishing a still higher display of power and command over 
 the ordinary laws and course of nature. Thus we find recorded here the 
 first of all the miracles that Jesus wrought--the changing of water 
 into wine

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:1-11">Joh 2:1-11</A>),

 the cure of the nobleman's son <I>at a distance</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:43-54">Joh 4:43-54</A>);

 of the numerous cures of the lame and the paralytic by the word of
 Jesus, only one--of the man impotent for <I>thirty and eight years</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:1-9">Joh 5:1-9</A>);

 of the many cures of the blind, one only--of the man <I>born blind</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:1-12">Joh 9:1-12</A>);

 the restoration of Lazarus, not from a deathbed, like Jairus' daughter,
 nor from a bier, like the widow of Nain's son, but <I>from the 
 grave,</I> and after lying there four days, and there sinking into 
 corruption

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:1-44">Joh 11:1-44</A>);

 and lastly, after His resurrection, the miraculous draught of fishes on
 the Sea of Tiberias

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:5-11">Joh 21:5-11</A>).

 But these are all recorded chiefly to give occasion for the record of
 those astonishing discourses and conversations, alike with friends and 
 with foes, with His disciples and with the multitude which they drew 
 forth."</P>

 On the <I>origin</I> of this most lofty and now for ever consecrated

 writings of this seraphic apostle.

 <B>was with God</B>--having a conscious personal existence
 <I>distinct from God</I> (as one is from the person he is "with"), but

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>was God</B>--in substance and essence G<FONT SIZE=-1>OD</FONT>;
 or was possessed of essential
 or proper divinity. Thus, each of these brief but pregnant statements is
 the complement of the other, correcting any misapprehensions which the
 others might occasion. Was the Word <I>eternal?</I> It was <I>not</I> the
 eternity of "<I>the Father,</I>" but of a conscious personal existence
 <I>distinct from Him and associated with Him.</I> Was the Word thus "with
 God?" It was not the distinctness and the fellowship of
 <I>another being,</I> as if there were <I>more Gods than one,</I> but of One
 who was <I>Himself God</I>--in such sense that the <I>absolute unity</I> of
 the God head, the great principle of all religion, is only transferred
 from the region of shadowy abstraction to the region of essential life
 and love. But why all this definition? Not to give us any
 <I>abstract information</I> about certain mysterious distinctions in the
 Godhead, but solely to let the reader know <I>who it was that</I> in the
 fulness of time "<I>was made flesh.</I>" After each verse, then, the reader
 must say, "It was He who is thus, and thus, and thus described, who was

 "Coming into the world" is a superfluous and quite unusual description

 the enigmatic form in which it is couched, startling the reader and
 setting his ingenuity a-working to solve the stupendous enigma of
 <I>Christ ignored in His own world.</I> "The world," in the first two
 clauses, plainly means the <I>created</I> world, <I>into</I> which <I>He</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:9">Joh 1:9</A>;

 "<I>in</I> it He was," says this verse.  By His Incarnation, He became

 Him"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:3-5">Joh 1:3-5</A>).

 "The world that knew Him not"

 Taking the first two clauses as one statement,
 we try to apprehend it by thinking of the infant Christ conceived in the
 womb and born in the arms of His own creature, and of the Man Christ
 Jesus breathing His own air, treading His own ground, supported by
 substances to which He Himself gave being, and the Creator of the very
 men whom He came to save. But the most vivid commentary on this entire
 verse will be got by tracing (in His matchless history) Him of whom it
 speaks walking amidst all the elements of nature, the diseases of men
 and death itself, the secrets of the human heart, and "the rulers of the
 darkness of this world" in all their number, subtlety, and malignity,
 not only with absolute ease, as their conscious Lord, but, as we might
 say, with full consciousness on their part of the presence of their
 Maker, whose will to one and all of them was law. And this is He of whom
 it is added, "the world knew Him not!"</P>

 In His Person all that Grace and Truth which had been floating so long 
 in shadowy forms, and darting into the souls of the poor and needy its 
 broken beams, took everlasting possession of human flesh and filled it 
 full. By this Incarnation of Grace and Truth, the teaching of thousands

 marriage He wrought His first miracle--the noblest sanction that could
 be given to that God-given institution. (2) As the miracle did not make
 <I>bad good,</I> but <I>good better,</I> so Christianity only redeems,
 sanctifies, and ennobles the beneficent but abused institution of
 marriage; and Christ's whole work only turns the water of earth into the
 wine of heaven. Thus "this beginning of miracles" exhibited the
 character and "manifested forth the glory" of His entire Mission. (3) As
 Christ countenanced our seasons of <I>festivity,</I> so also that greater

 familiar with the symbolical application of water, in every variety of
 way and form of expression, this language was fitted to show that the
 thing intended was no other than a
 <I>thorough spiritual purification by the operation of the Holy Ghost.</I>

 together in a glorious evangelical prediction of Ezekiel

 which Nicodemus might have been reminded of had such spiritualities not 
 been almost lost in the reigning formalism.  Already had the symbol of 
 water been embodied in an initiatory ordinance, in the baptism of the 
 Jewish expectants of Messiah by the Baptist, not to speak of the 
 baptism of Gentile proselytes before that; and in the Christian Church 
 it was soon to become the great visible door of entrance into "the 
 kingdom of God," <I>the reality being the sole work of the Holy

 him, but the nature of it and how it is brought about
 [L<FONT SIZE=-1>UTHARDT</FONT>]. "From

 Nicodemus was culpable in being ignorant of it.</I> Nor is it merely
 as something that should be experienced <I>under the Gospel</I> that the Old
 Testament holds it forth--as many distinguished critics allege, denying
 that there was any such thing as regeneration before Christ. For our
 Lord's proposition is universal, that no fallen man is or can be
 spiritual without a regenerating operation of the Holy Ghost, and the
 necessity of a <I>spiritual obedience</I> under whatever name, in opposition
 to mere mechanical services, is proclaimed throughout all the Old

 language--"No one has gone up but He that came down, even He who is at
 once both up and down." Doubtless it was intended to startle and
 constrain His auditor to think that there must be mysterious elements in
 His Person. The old Socinians, to subvert the doctrine of the
 pre-existence of Christ, seized upon this passage as teaching that the
 man Jesus was secretly caught up to heaven to receive His instructions,
 and then "came down from heaven" to deliver them. But the sense
 manifestly is this: "The perfect knowledge of God is not obtained by any
 man's going up from earth to heaven to receive it--no man hath so
 ascended--but He whose <I>proper habitation,</I> in His essential and
 eternal nature, is heaven, hath, by taking human flesh, descended as the
 Son of man to disclose the Father, whom He knows by immediate gaze alike
 in the flesh as before He assumed it, being essentially and unchangeably
 'in the bosom of the Father'"

 <B>14-16. And as Moses,</B> &c.--Here now we have the "heavenly things,"
 as before the "earthly," but under a veil, for the reason mentioned in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:12">Joh 3:12</A>.

 The crucifixion of Messiah is twice after this veiled under the same 
 lively term--"<I>uplifting,</I>"

 Here it is still further veiled--though to us who know what it means,
 rendered vastly more instructive--by reference to the brazen serpent.  
 The venom of the fiery serpents, shooting through the veins of the 
 rebellious Israelites, was spreading death through the camp--lively 
 emblem of the perishing condition of men by reason of sin. In both 
 cases the remedy was divinely provided. In both the way of cure 
 strikingly resembled that of the disease. Stung by serpents, by a 
 serpent they are healed. By "fiery serpents" bitten--serpents, 
 probably, with skin spotted fiery red [K<FONT SIZE=-1>URTZ</FONT>]--the 
 instrument of cure is a serpent of brass or copper, having at a 
 distance <I>the same appearance.</I> So in redemption, as by man came 
 death, by Man also comes life--Man, too, "<I>in the likeness of sinful 
 flesh</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:3">Ro 8:3</A>),

 differing in nothing <I>outward</I> and <I>apparent</I> from those who, 
 pervaded by the poison of the serpent, were ready to perish. But as the 
 uplifted serpent had none of the venom of which the serpent-bitten 
 people were dying, so while the whole human family were perishing of 
 the deadly wound inflicted on it by the old serpent, "the Second Man," 
 who arose over humanity with healing in His wings, was without spot or 
 wrinkle, or any such thing. In both cases the remedy is 
 <I>conspicuously displayed;</I> in the one case on a pole, in the other 
 on the cross, to "draw all men unto Him"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:32">Joh 12:32</A>).

 In both cases it is by <I>directing the eye to the uplifted Remedy</I> 
 that the cure is effected; in the one case the bodily eye, in the other 
 the gaze of the soul by "believing in Him," as in that glorious ancient 
 proclamation--"<I>Look</I> unto me and be ye saved, all the ends of the 
 earth," &c.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:22">Isa 45:22</A>).

 Both methods are stumbling to human reason. What, to any thinking 
 Israelite, could seem more unlikely than that a deadly poison should be 
 dried up in his body by simply looking on a reptile of brass? Such a 
 stumbling-block to the Jews and to the Greeks foolishness was faith in 
 the crucified Nazarene as a way of deliverance from eternal perdition. 
 Yet was the warrant in both cases to expect a cure equally rational and 
 well grounded. As the serpent was <I>God's ordinance</I> for the cure 
 of every bitten Israelite, so is Christ for the salvation of every 
 perishing sinner--the one however a purely <I>arbitrary</I> ordinance, 
 the other divinely <I>adapted</I> to man's complicated maladies. In 
 both cases the efficacy is the same. As one simple look at the serpent, 
 however distant and however weak, brought an instantaneous cure, even 
 so, real faith in the Lord Jesus, however tremulous, however 
 distant--be it but <I>real</I> faith--brings certain and instant 
 healing to the perishing soul. In a word, the consequences of 
 disobedience are the same in both. Doubtless many bitten Israelites, 
 galling as their case was, would <I>reason</I> rather than <I>obey,</I> 
 would <I>speculate</I> on the absurdity of expecting the bite of a 
 living serpent to be cured by looking at a piece of dead metal in the 
 shape of one--speculate thus <I>till they died.</I> Alas! is not 
 salvation by a crucified Redeemer subjected to like treatment? Has the 
 offense of the cross" yet ceased? (Compare

 obedience to the call, flying as a cloud, and as doves to their windows?
 Whose is the Bride but the Bridegroom's? Enough for me to be the

 from <I>His proper element,</I> the region of those "heavenly things" which
 He came to reveal, and so, although mingling with men and things on the
 earth, is not "of the earth," either in Person or Word. The servants, on
 the contrary, springing of earth, are of the earth, and their testimony,
 even though divine in authority, partakes necessarily of their own
 earthiness. (So strongly did the Baptist feel this contrast that the
 last clause just repeats the first). It is impossible for a sharper line
 of distinction to be drawn between Christ and all human teachers, even
 when divinely commissioned and speaking by the power of the Holy Ghost.
 And who does not perceive it? The words of prophets and apostles are
 undeniable and most precious truth; but in the words of Christ we hear a
 voice as from the excellent Glory, the Eternal Word making Himself heard
 in our own flesh.</P>

 entire fulness of divine life and divine power. The present tense

 <B>19, 20. Sir, I perceive,</B> &c.--Seeing herself all revealed, does 
 she now break down and ask what hopes there might be for one so guilty? 
 Nay, her convictions have not reached that point yet. She ingeniously 
 shifts the subject from a personal to a public question. It is not, 
 "Alas, what a wicked life am I leading!" but "Lo, what a wonderful 
 prophet I got into conversation with! He will be able to settle that 
 interminable dispute between us and the Jews. Sir, you must know all 
 about such matters--our fathers hold to this mountain here," pointing 
 to <I>Gerizim</I> in Samaria, "as the divinely consecrated place of 
 worship, but ye Jews say that <I>Jerusalem</I> is the proper 
 place--which of us is right?" How slowly does the human heart submit to 
 <I>thorough</I> humiliation! (Compare the <I>prodigal;</I> see on

 Doubtless our Lord saw through the fetch; but does He say, "That 
 question is not the point just now, but have you been living in the way 
 described, yea or nay? Till this is disposed of I cannot be drawn into 
 theological controversies." The Prince of preachers takes another 
 method: He humors the poor woman, letting her take her own way, 
 allowing her to lead while He follows--but thus only the more 
 effectually gaining His object. He answers her question, pours light 
 into her mind on the <I>spirituality</I> of all true worship, as of its 
 glorious Object, and so brings her insensibly to the point at which He 
 could disclose to her wondering mind whom she was all the while

 not have been <I>safe</I> among them was safe enough with her, whose

 let her go without exchanging a word with her in the hearing of others.
 Their interview was too sacred, and the effect on the woman too
 overpowering (not to speak of His own deep emotion) to allow of its
 being continued. But this one artless touch--that she "left her
 water-pot"--speaks volumes. The living water was already beginning to
 spring up within her; she found that man doth not live by bread nor by
 water only, and that there was a water of wondrous virtue that raised
 people above meat and drink, and the vessels that held them, and all
 human things. In short, she was transported, forgot everything but One,

 beauty of this language is only surpassed by the glow of holy emotion in
 the Redeemer's own soul which it expresses. It refers to the
 <I>ripeness</I> of these Sycharites for accession to Him, and the joy of
 this great Lord of the reapers over the anticipated ingathering. Oh,
 could we but <I>so,</I> "lift up our eyes and look" upon many fields abroad
 and at home, which to dull sense appear unpromising, as <I>He</I> beheld

 accessions to Christ, as yet seemingly far distant, might we not discern
 as quite near at hand, and thus, amidst difficulties and discouragements

 the joy of having such a harvest to gather in--the joy of "gathering
 fruit unto life eternal."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>rejoice together</B>--The blessed issue of the whole ingathering is the
 interest alike of the sower as of the reaper; it is no more the fruit of
 the last operation than of the first; and just as there can be no
 reaping without previous sowing, so have those servants of Christ, to
 whom is assigned the pleasant task of merely reaping the spiritual
 harvest, no work to do, and no joy to taste, that has not been prepared
 to their hand by the toilsome and often thankless work of their
 predecessors in the field. <I>The joy,</I> therefore,
 <I>of the great harvest festivity will be the common joy of all who have taken any part in the work from the first operation to
 the last.</I> (See

 one confirmation. "<I>When</I> began he to amend? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yesterday, at the

 <B>1. a feast of the Jews</B>--<I>What feast?</I> No question has more divided
 the Harmonists of the Gospels, and the duration of our Lord's ministry
 may be said to hinge on it. For if, as the majority have thought (until
 of late years) it was a <I>Passover,</I> His ministry lasted three and a
 half years; if not, probably a year less. Those who are dissatisfied
 with the Passover-view all differ among themselves what other feast it
 was, and some of the most acute think there are no grounds for deciding.
 In our judgment the evidence is in favor of its being a <I>Passover,</I>

 <B>4. an angel,</B> &c.--This miracle differed in two points from all
 other miracles recorded in Scripture: (1) It was not one, but a
 succession of miracles periodically wrought: (2) As it was only wrought
 "when the waters were troubled," so only upon one patient at a time, and
 that the patient "who first stepped in after the troubling of the
 waters." But this only the more undeniably fixed its miraculous
 character. We have heard of many waters having a medicinal virtue; but
 what water was ever known to cure <I>instantaneously</I> a single disease?
 And who ever heard of any water curing all, even the most diverse
 diseases--"blind, halt, withered"--alike? Above all, who ever heard of
 such a thing being done "only at a certain season," and most singularly
 of all, doing it only to the first person who stepped in after the
 moving of the waters? Any of these peculiarities--much more all taken
 together--must have proclaimed the supernatural character of the cures
 wrought. (If the text here be genuine, there can be no doubt of the
 miracle, as there were multitudes living when this Gospel was published
 who, from their own knowledge of Jerusalem, could have exposed the
 falsehood of the Evangelist, if no such cure had been known there. The
 want of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:3">Joh 5:3</A>

 passage, are more easily accounted for than the evidence in their favor 
 if they were not originally in the text. Indeed

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:7">Joh 5:7</A>

 <B>Wilt thou be made whole?</B>--Could anyone doubt that a sick man would
 like to be made whole, or that the patients came thither, and this man
 had returned again and again, just in hope of a cure? But our Lord asked
 the question. (1) To fasten attention upon Himself; (2) By making him
 detail his case to deepen in him the feeling of entire helplessness; (3)
 By so singular a question to beget in his desponding heart the hope of a
 cure. (Compare

 <B>7. Sir, I have no man,</B> &c.--Instead of <I>saying</I> he wished to be
 cured, he just tells with piteous simplicity how fruitless had been all
 his efforts to obtain it, and how <I>helpless</I> and all but <I>hopeless</I>
 he was. Yet not quite. For here he is at the pool, waiting on. It seemed
 of no use; nay, only tantalizing,

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>while I am coming, another steppeth down before me</B>--the fruit was
 snatched from his lips. Yet he will not go away. He may get nothing by
 staying, he may drop into his grave ere he get into the pool; but by
 going from the appointed, divine way of healing, he can get nothing.
 Wait therefore he will, wait he does, and when Christ comes to heal him,
 lo! he is waiting his turn. <I>What an attitude for a sinner</I> at Mercy's
 gate! The man's hopes seemed low enough ere Christ came to him. He
 might have said, just before "Jesus passed by that way," "This is no
 use; I shall never get in; let me die at home." Then all had been lost.
 But he <I>held on,</I> and his perseverance was rewarded with a glorious
 cure. Probably some rays of hope darted into his heart as he told his
 tale before those Eyes whose glance measured his whole case. But the
 word of command consummates his preparation to receive the cure, and
 instantaneously works it.</P>

 parried the thrust, asking him, not who had "made him whole"--that 
 would have condemned themselves and defeated their purpose--but who had 
 bidden him "take up his bed and walk," in other words, who had dared to 
 order a breach of the sabbath?  It is time we were looking after

 hypocritical religionists was the doing of the most glorious and
 beneficent miracles, compared with the atrocity of doing them on the
 sabbath day! Having given them this handle, on purpose to raise the
 first public controversy with them, and thus open a fitting opportunity
 of laying His claims before them, He rises at once to the whole height
 of them, in a statement which for grandeur and terseness exceeds almost
 anything that ever afterwards fell from Him, at least to His enemies.</P>

 right to act as His Father did in the like high sphere, and by the same
 law of ceaseless activity in that sphere. And as, instead of instantly
 disclaiming any such meaning--as He must have done if it was false--He
 positively sets His seal to it in the following verses, merely
 explaining how consistent such claim was with the prerogatives of His
 Father, it is beyond all doubt that we have here an assumption of
 <I>peculiar personal Sonship,</I> or participation in the Father's
 essential nature.</P>

 whose interests are one, even as their nature, that the Father

 clear: (1) The <I>personal distinctions</I> in the Godhead. (2) Unity

 <B>22-24.</B> These verses are a little involved, from the Evangelist's desire
 to mention every circumstance, however minute, that might call up the
 scene as vividly to the reader as it stood before his own view.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>The day following</B>--the miracle of the loaves, and the stormy night;
 the day on which they landed at Capernaum.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the people which stood on the other side of the sea</B>--not the whole
 multitude that had been fed, but only such of them as remained over
 night about the shore, that is, on the <I>east</I> side of the lake; for we
 are supposed to have come, with Jesus and His disciples in the ship, to
 the <I>west</I> side, to Capernaum.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>saw that there was none other boat there,</B> &c.--The meaning is, the
 people had observed that there had been only one boat on the east side
 where they were; namely, the one in which the disciples had crossed at
 night to the other, the west side, and they had also observed that Jesus
 had not gone on board that boat, but His disciples had put off without
 Him:</P>

 <A NAME="Joh6_23"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>23. Howbeit,</B> &c.--"Howbeit," adds the Evangelist, in a lively
 parenthesis, "there came other boats from Tiberias" (which lay near the
 southwest coast of the lake), whose passengers were part of the
 multitude that had followed Jesus to the east side, and been
 miraculously fed; these boats were fastened somewhere (says the
 Evangelist)

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had
 given thanks</B>--thus he refers to the glorious "miracle of the
 loaves"--and now they were put in requisition to convey the people back
 again to the west side. For when "the people saw that Jesus was not
 there, neither His disciples, they also took shipping [in these boats]
 and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus."</P>

 <A NAME="Joh6_24"> </A>

 <B>25. when they had found him on the other side</B>--at Capernaum.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>they said,</B> &c.--astonished at His <I>being</I> there, and wondering
 <I>how</I> He could have accomplished it, whether by land or water, and
 <I>when</I> He came; for being quite unaware of His having walked upon the
 sea and landed with the disciples in the ship, they could not see how,
 unless He had travelled all night round the head of the lake alone, He
 could have reached Capernaum, and even then, how He could have arrived
 before themselves.</P>

 <A NAME="Joh6_26"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>26. Ye seek me,</B> &c.--Jesus does not put them through their 
 difficulty, says nothing of His treading on the waves of the sea, nor 
 even notices their question, but takes advantage of the favorable 
 moment for pointing out to them how forward, flippant, and superficial 
 were their views, and how low their desires. "Ye seek Me not because ye 
 saw the miracles"--literally, "the <I>signs,</I>" that is, supernatural 
 tokens of a higher presence, and a divine commission, "but because ye 
 did eat of the loaves and were filled." From this He proceeds at once
 to that <I>other Bread,</I> just as, with the woman of Samaria, to that 
 <I>other Water</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:9-15">Joh 4:9-15</A>).

 we gather that they had probably met about the door of the 
 synagogue--"for that was the day in which they assembled in their 
 synagogues" [L<FONT SIZE=-1>IGHTFOOT</FONT>]--and that on being asked, 
 at the close of the service, if He had any word of exhortation to the 
 people, He had taken the two breads, the <I>perishing</I> and the 
 <I>living</I> bread, for the subject of His profound and extraordinary 
 discourse.</P>

 <A NAME="Joh6_30"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>30. What sign showest thou,</B> &c.--But how could they ask "a sign,"
 when many of them scarce a day before had witnessed such a "sign" as had
 never till then been vouchsafed to men; when after witnessing it, they
 could hardly be restrained from making Him a king; when they followed
 Him from the one side of the lake to the other; and when, in the opening
 words of this very discourse, He had chided them for seeking Him, "not
 because they <I>saw the signs,</I>" but for the loaves? The truth seems to
 be that they were confounded by the <I>novel claims</I> which our Lord had
 just advanced. In proposing to make Him a king, it was for far other
 purposes than dispensing to the world the bread of an everlasting life;
 and when He seemed to raise His claims even higher still, by
 representing it as the grand "work of God," that they should believe
 <I>on Himself</I> as His Sent One, they saw very clearly that He was making
 a demand upon them beyond anything they were prepared to accord to Him,
 and beyond all that man had ever before made. Hence their question,
 "What dost Thou <I>work?</I>"</P>

 daily throughout their wilderness journey."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>37-40. All that,</B> &c.--This comprehensive and very grand passage is
 expressed with a peculiar artistic precision. The opening general
 statement 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:37">Joh 6:37</A>)

 consists of two members: (1) "A<FONT SIZE=-1>LL THAT THE</FONT> F<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ATHER</FONT> G<FONT SIZE=-1>IVETH ME SHALL COME TO 
 ME</FONT>"--that is, "Though ye, as I told you, have no faith in Me, My 
 errand into the world shall in no wise be defeated; for all that the 
 Father giveth Me shall infallibly come to Me." Observe, what is 
 <I>given</I> Him by the Father is expressed in the <I>singular</I> 
 number and <I>neuter</I> gender--literally, "everything"; while those 
 who <I>come to</I> Him are put in the <I>masculine</I> gender and 
 <I>singular</I> number--"every one." The <I>whole mass,</I> so to 
 speak, is gifted by the Father to the Son as a <I>unity,</I> which the 
 Son evolves, one by one, in the execution of His trust. So

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:2">Joh 17:2</A>,

 "that He should give eternal life to <I>all that which</I> Thou hast 
 given Him" [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]. This "<I>shall</I>" expresses 
 the glorious <I>certainty</I> of it, the Father being pledged to see to 
 it that the gift be no empty mockery.  (2) "A<FONT SIZE=-1>ND HIM THAT 
 COMETH TO ME</FONT>I <FONT SIZE=-1>WILL IN NO WISE CAST OUT</FONT>." As 
 the former was the <I>divine,</I> this is just the <I>human</I> side of 
 the same thing. True, the "coming" ones of the second clause are just 
 the "given" ones of the first. But had our Lord merely said, "<I>When 
 those</I> that have been given Me of My Father shall come to Me, I will 
 receive them"--besides being very flat, the impression conveyed would 
 have been quite different, sounding as if there were <I>no other laws 
 in operation,</I> in the movement of sinners to Christ, but such as are 
 wholly <I>divine</I> and <I>inscrutable</I> to us; whereas, though He 
 does speak of it as a sublime certainty which men's <I>refusals</I> 
 cannot frustrate, He speaks of that certainty as taking effect only by 
 men's <I>voluntary advances</I> to Him and acceptance of Him--"Him that 
 cometh to Me," "whosoever will," throwing the door wide open. Only it 
 is not the simply <I>willing,</I> but the actually <I>coming,</I> whom 
 He will not cast out; for the word here employed usually denotes 
 <I>arrival,</I> as distinguished from the ordinary word, which rather 
 expresses the <I>act of coming</I> (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:42">Joh 8:42</A>,

 <I>Greek</I>), [W<FONT SIZE=-1>EBSTER</FONT> and W<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ILKINSON</FONT>]. "In no wise" is an emphatic negative, to meet 
 the fears of the timid (as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:27">Re 21:27</A>,

 to meet the presumption of the hardened). These, then, being the two 
 members of the general opening statement, what follows is meant to take 
 in both,</P>

 <A NAME="Joh6_38"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>38. For I came down from heaven not to do Mine own will</B>--to play an
 independent part.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but</B>--in respect to both the foregoing things, the <I>divine</I> and the
 <I>human</I> side of salvation.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the will of Him that sent Me</B>--What this twofold will of Him that sent
 Him is, we are next sublimely told 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:39,40">Joh 6:39, 40</A>):</P>

 <A NAME="Joh6_39"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>39. And this</B>--in the <I>first</I> place.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>is the will of Him that sent me, that of all</B>--everything.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>which He hath given Me</B>--(taking up the identical words of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:37">Joh 6:37</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day</B>--The
 meaning is not, of course, that He is charged to keep the objects
 entrusted to Him <I>as He received them,</I> so as they should merely
 suffer nothing in His hands. For as they were just "perishing"
 <I>sinners</I> of Adam's family, to let "nothing" of such "be lost," but
 "raise them up at the last day," must involve, <I>first,</I> giving His
 flesh for them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:51">Joh 6:51</A>),

 that they "might not perish, but have everlasting life"; and 
 <I>then,</I> after "keeping them from falling," raising their sleeping 
 dust in incorruption and glory, and presenting them, body and soul, 
 perfect and entire, wanting nothing, to Him who gave them to Him, 
 saying, "Behold I and the children which God hath given Me." So much 
 for the <I>first</I> will of Him that sent Him, the <I>divine</I> side 
 of man's salvation, whose every stage and movement is inscrutable to 
 us, but infallibly certain.</P>

 <A NAME="Joh6_40"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>40. And this</B>--in the <I>second</I> place.

 <B>is the will of Him that sent Me, that every one which seeth the Son
 and believeth on Him</B>--seeing the Son believeth on Him.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>may have everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last 
 day</B>--This is the <I>human</I> side of the same thing as in the 
 foregoing verse, and answering to "<I>Him that cometh unto Me I will in 
 no wise cast out</I>"; that is, I have it expressly in charge that 
 everyone that so "beholdeth" (so vieweth) the Son as to believe on Him 
 shall have everlasting life; and, that <I>none</I> of Him be lost, "I 
 will raise him up at the last day." (See on

 throws in a parenthetical explanation; stating, as explicitly as words
 could do it, how totally different the two cases were, and that only He
 who is "from God" hath this naked, immediate access to the Father. (See

 Here, for the first time in this high discourse, our Lord
 explicitly introduces His sacrificial <I>death</I>--for only rationalists
 can doubt this not only as that which constitutes Him the Bread of life
 to men, but as THAT very element <FONT SIZE=-1>IN</FONT>
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>IM WHICH POSSESSES THE LIFE-GIVING VIRTUE</FONT>.--"From
 this time we hear no more (in this discourse) of "Bread";
 this figure is dropped, and the reality takes its place" [S<FONT SIZE=-1>TIER</FONT>]. The
 words "I will <I>give</I>" may be compared with the words of institution at

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:19">Lu 22:19</A>),

 <A NAME="Joh6_52"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>52. Jews strove among themselves</B>--arguing the point together.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>How can,</B> &c.--that is, Give us His flesh to eat? Absurd.</P>

 <A NAME="Joh6_53"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>53-58. Except ye eat the flesh .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and drink the blood 
 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no life,</B> &c.--The harshest word He had yet uttered 
 in their ears. They asked how it was <I>possible</I> to eat His flesh. 
 He answers, with great solemnity, "It is <I>indispensable.</I>" Yet 
 even here a thoughtful hearer might find something to temper the 
 harshness. He says they must not only "eat His <I>flesh</I>" but "drink 
 His <I>blood,</I>" which could not but suggest the idea of His 
 <I>death</I>--implied in the separation of one's flesh from his blood. 
 And as He had already hinted that it was to be something very different
 from a <I>natural</I> death, saying, "My flesh I will give for the life 
 of the world"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:51">Joh 6:51</A>),

 it must have been pretty plain to candid hearers that He meant
 something above the gross idea which the bare terms expressed. And 
 farther, when He added that they "had no <I>life</I> in them unless 
 they thus ate and drank," it was impossible they should think He meant 
 that the <I>temporal</I> life they were then living was dependent on 
 their eating and drinking, in this gross sense, His flesh and blood. 
 Yet the whole statement was certainly confounding, and beyond doubt was 
 meant to be so. Our Lord had told them that in spite of all they had 
 "seen" in Him, they "did not believe"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:36">Joh 6:36</A>).

 For <I>their</I> conviction therefore he does not here lay Himself out; 
 but having the ear not only of them but of the more <I>candid and 
 thoughtful</I> in the crowded synagogue, and the miracle of the loaves 
 having led up to the most exalted of all views of His Person and 
 Office, He takes advantage of their very difficulties and objections to 
 announce, for all time, those most profound truths which are here 
 expressed, regardless of the disgust of the unteachable, and the 
 prejudices even of the most sincere, which His language would seem only 
 designed to deepen. The <I>truth</I> really conveyed here is no other 
 than that expressed in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:51">Joh 6:51</A>,

 though in more emphatic terms--that He Himself, in the virtue of His 
 sacrificial death, is the spiritual and eternal life of men; and that 
 unless men voluntarily appropriate to themselves this death, in its 
 sacrificial virtue, so as to become the very life and nourishment of 
 their inner man, they have no spiritual and eternal life at all. Not as 
 if His death were the <I>only</I> thing of value, but it is what gives 
 all else in Christ's Incarnate Person, Life, and Office, their whole 
 value <I>to us sinners.</I></P>

 Lord, instead of softening down His figurative sublimities, or even
 putting them in naked phraseology, leaves the great truths of His Person
 and Office, and our participation of Him and it, enshrined for all time
 in those glorious forms of speech, so when we attempt to strip the truth
 of these figures, figures though they be, it goes away from us, like
 water when the vessel is broken, and our wisdom lies in raising our own
 spirit, and attuning our own ear, to our Lord's chosen modes of
 expression. (It should be added that although this discourse has nothing
 to do with the Sacrament of the Supper, the Sacrament has everything to
 do with it, as <I>the visible embodiment</I> of these figures, and, to the

 in, our own endurance has been severely tried, nor have we been able to
 stop short of the question, Shall <I>we</I> follow the rest, and give it
 up? But when it came to this, our light returned, and our hearts were
 reassured. For as soon as we thought of going away, there arose upon us
 that awful question, 'T<FONT SIZE=-1>O WHOM</FONT> shall we go?' To the lifeless formalism
 and wretched traditions of the elders? to the gods many and lords many
 of the heathen around us? or to blank unbelief? Nay, Lord, we are shut
 up. <I>They</I> have none of that '<FONT SIZE=-1>ETERNAL LIFE</FONT>' to offer us whereof Thou
 hast been discoursing, in words rich and ravishing as well as in words
 staggering to human wisdom. That life we cannot want; that life we have
 learnt to crave as a necessity of the deeper nature which Thou hast
 awakened: '<I>the words</I> of that eternal life' (the authority to

 Peter seems to have added this not merely--probably not so much--as an 
 assurance <I>to his Lord</I> of his heart's belief in Him, as for the 
 purpose of fortifying <I>himself</I> and his faithful brethren against 
 that <I>recoil</I> from his Lord's harsh statements which he was 
 probably struggling against with difficulty at that moment. 
 <I>Note.</I>--There are seasons when one's faith is tried to the 
 utmost, particularly by speculative difficulties; the spiritual eye 
 then swims, and all truth seems ready to depart from us. At such 
 seasons, a clear perception that to abandon the faith of Christ is 
 <I>to face black desolation, ruin and death;</I> and on recoiling from 
 this, to be able to fall back, not merely on <I>first principles and 
 immovable foundations,</I> but on <I>personal experience of a Living 
 Lord in whom all truth is wrapt up and made flesh for our very 
 benefit</I>--this is a relief unspeakable. Under that blessed Wing 
 taking shelter, until we are again fit to grapple with the questions 
 that have staggered us, we at length either find our way through them, 
 or attain to a calm satisfaction in the discovery that they lie beyond 
 the limits of present apprehension.</P>

 probably, a tincture of <I>vanity</I> in it. "Thou hast many disciples

 <B>37-39. the last day, that great day of the feast</B>--the eighth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:39">Le 23:39</A>).

 It was a sabbath, the last feast day of the year, and distinguished by 
 very remarkable ceremonies. "The generally joyous character of this 
 feast broke out on this day into loud jubilation, particularly at the 
 solemn moment when the priest, as was done on every day of this 
 festival, brought forth, in golden vessels, water from the stream of 
 Siloah, which flowed under the temple-mountain, and solemnly poured it 
 upon the altar. Then the words of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+12:3">Isa 12:3</A>

 were sung, <I>With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of 
 Salvation,</I> and thus the symbolical reference of this act, intimated 
 in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:39">Joh 7:39</A>,

 was expressed" [O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT>]. So ecstatic was the 
 joy with which this ceremony was performed--accompanied with sound of 
 trumpets--that it used to be said, "Whoever had not witnessed it had 
 never seen rejoicing at all" [L<FONT SIZE=-1>IGHTFOOT</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Jesus stood</B>--On this high occasion, then, He who had already drawn all
 eyes upon Him by His supernatural power and unrivalled teaching--"J<FONT SIZE=-1>ESUS</FONT>
 stood," probably in some elevated position.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and cried</B>--as if making proclamation in the audience of all the
 people.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink!</B>--What an offer!
 The deepest cravings of the human spirit are here, as in the Old
 Testament, expressed by the figure of "<I>thirst,</I>" and the eternal
 satisfaction of them by "<I>drinking.</I>" To the woman of Samaria He had
 said almost the same thing, and in the same terms 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:13,14">Joh 4:13, 14</A>).

 But what to her was simply affirmed to her as a <I>fact,</I> is here 
 turned into a world-wide <I>proclamation;</I> and whereas there, the 
 <I>gift</I> by Him of the living water is the most prominent idea--in 
 contrast with her hesitation to give Him the perishable water of 
 Jacob's well--here, the prominence is given to <I>Himself</I> as the 
 Well spring of all satisfaction.  He had in Galilee invited all the 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>WEARY AND HEAVY-LADEN</FONT> of the human family to come 
 under His wing and they should find <FONT SIZE=-1>REST</FONT>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:28">Mt 11:28</A>),
 
 which is just the same deep want, and the same profound relief of it,
 under another and equally grateful figure. He had in the synagogue of
 Capernaum 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:36">Joh 6:36</A>)

 announced Himself, in every variety of form, as "the B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>READ</FONT> of Life," and as both able and authorized to 
 appease the "<FONT SIZE=-1>HUNGER</FONT>," and quench the "<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>THIRST</FONT>," of all that apply to Him. There is, and there 
 can be, nothing beyond that here. But what was on all those occasions 
 uttered in private, or addressed to a provincial audience, is here 
 sounded forth in the streets of the great religious metropolis, and in 
 language of surpassing majesty, simplicity, and grace. <I>It is just 
 Jehovah's ancient proclamation now sounding forth through human 
 flesh,</I> "H<FONT SIZE=-1>O, EVERY ONE THAT THIRSTETH, COME YE TO THE 
 WATERS, AND HE THAT HATH NO</FONT> M<FONT SIZE=-1>ONEY</FONT>!" &c.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:1">Isa 55:1</A>).

 In this light we have but two alternatives; either to say with Caiaphas 
 of Him that uttered such words, "<I>He is guilty of death,</I>" or 
 falling down before Him to exclaim with Thomas, " M<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>Y</FONT> L<FONT SIZE=-1>ORD</FONT> AND MY G<FONT

 Him.

 opens up this spring of living waters in the human spirit 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:6">Joh 3:6</A>),

 man, entirely <I>at the service of Christ,</I> as His Agent, so it is

 Spirit.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for the Holy Ghost was not yet <I>given</I></B>--Beyond all doubt the word
 "given," or some similar word, is the right supplement. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:7">Joh 16:7</A>

 the Holy Ghost is represented not only as the <I>gift of Christ,</I> 
 but a gift the communication of which was <I>dependent upon His own 
 departure to the Father.</I> Now as Christ was <I>not yet gone,</I> so 
 the Holy Ghost <I>was not yet given.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Jesus not yet glorified</B>--The word "<I>glorified</I>" is here used
 advisedly, to teach the reader not only that the <I>departure</I> of Christ
 to the Father was <I>indispensable</I> to the giving of the Spirit, but
 that this illustrious Gift, direct from the hands of the ascended
 Saviour, was God's intimation to the world that He whom it had cast out,
 crucified, and slain, was "His Elect, in whom His soul delighted," and
 that it was through the smiting of that Rock that the waters of the
 Spirit--for which the Church was waiting, and with pomp at the feast of
 tabernacles proclaiming its expectation--had gushed forth upon a thirsty
 world.</P>

 teaching, but there was that in it which by its mysterious grandeur and
 transparent purity and grace, held them spellbound. No doubt it was of
 God that they should so feel, that their arm might be paralyzed, as
 Christ's hour was not yet come; but even in human teaching there has
 sometimes been felt such a divine power, that men who came to kill them

 may not even thus early have taken place; it might have been the Lord's 
 ordinary custom from the beginning to leave the brilliant misery of the 
 city every night, that so He might compose His sorrowful and 
 interceding heart, and collect His energies for new labors of love; 
 preferring for His resting-place Bethany, and the <I>Mount of

 stoning her, wondering at the <I>skill</I> with which her accusers had been
 dispersed, and the <I>grace</I> of the few words addressed to herself, she
 would be disposed to listen, with a reverence and teachableness before
 unknown, to our Lord's admonition. "And Jesus said unto her, Neither do
 I condemn thee, go and sin no more." He pronounces no pardon upon the
 woman (such as, "Thy sins are forgiven thee" [compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:28,7:48">Lu 5:28; 7:48</A>]

 leaves the matter where it was. He meddles not with the magistrate's
 office, nor acts the <I>Judge</I> in any sense

 who undoubtedly believed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:14">Joh 5:14</A>),

 more is probably implied than expressed. If brought suddenly to 
 conviction of sin, admiration of her Deliverer, and a willingness to be 
 admonished and guided by Him, this call to begin a new life may have 
 carried with it what would ensure and naturally bring about a permanent 
 change. (This whole narrative is wanting in some of the earliest and 
 most valuable manuscripts, and those which have it vary to some extent. 
 The internal evidence in its favor is almost overpowering. It is easy

 lamps, lighted after the evening sacrifice (probably every evening 
 during the feast of tabernacles), diffusing their brilliancy, it is 
 said, over all the city.  Around these the people danced with great 
 rejoicing. Now, as amidst the festivities of the <I>water</I> from

 illumination, He proclaims, "I <FONT SIZE=-1>AM THE</FONT> L<FONT

 <B>33. They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage
 to any man,</B> &c.--Who said this? Not surely the very class just spoken
 of as won over by His divine words, and exhorted to continue in them.
 Most interpreters seem to think so; but it is hard to ascribe such a
 petulant speech to the newly gained disciples, even in the lowest sense,
 much less persons <I>so</I> gained as they were. It came, probably, from
 persons mixed up with them in the same part of the crowd, but of a very
 different spirit. The <I>pride</I> of the Jewish nation, even now after
 centuries of humiliation, is the most striking feature of their
 character. "Talk of freedom to <I>us?</I> Pray when or to whom were we ever
 in bondage?" This bluster sounds almost ludicrous from such a nation.
 Had they forgotten their long and bitter bondage in Egypt? their dreary
 captivity in Babylon? their present bondage to the Roman yoke, and their
 restless eagerness to throw it off? But probably they saw that our Lord
 pointed to something else--freedom, perhaps, from the leaders of sects
 or parties--and were not willing to allow their subjection even to
 these. Our Lord, therefore, though He knew what slaves they were in this
 sense, drives the ploughshare somewhat deeper than this, to a bondage
 they little dreamt of.</P>

 <B>is the servant of sin</B>--that is, the <I>bond-servant,</I> or <I>slave</I> of
 it; for the question is not about free service, but who are in <I>bondage.</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:19,Re+6:16">2Pe 2:19;
 Re 6:16</A>). 

 The great truth here expressed was not unknown to heathen moralists;
 but it was applied only to vice, for they were total strangers to what 
 in revealed religion is called <I>sin.</I> The thought of <I>slaves</I> 
 and <I>freemen</I> in the house suggests to our Lord a wider idea.</P>

 <A NAME="Joh8_35"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>35. And the servant abideth not in the house for ever, but the Son
 abideth ever</B>--that is, "And if your connection with the family of God

 ye have no <I>natural tie</I> to the house; your
 tie is essentially <I>uncertain and precarious.</I> But the
 S<FONT SIZE=-1>ON'S</FONT> relationship
 to the F<FONT SIZE=-1>ATHER</FONT> is a <I>natural and essential</I> one; it is an indefeasible
 tie; His abode in it is <I>perpetual</I> and <I>of right:</I> That is My

 family made <I>real, rightful, permanent,</I> ye must by the Son be

 <B>he saw <I>it,</I> and <I>was</I> glad</B>--he <I>actually</I> beheld it, to his joy.
 If this mean no more than that he had a prophetic foresight of the
 gospel-day--the second clause just repeating the first--how could the
 Jews understand our Lord to mean that He "had seen Abraham?" And if it
 mean that Abraham was <I>then beholding,</I> in his disembodied spirit, the
 incarnate Messiah [S<FONT SIZE=-1>TIER</FONT>,
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>, &c.], the words seem very unsuitable
 to express it. It expresses something <I>past</I>--"he <I>saw</I> My day, and
 <I>was</I> glad," that is, surely <I>while he lived.</I> He seems to refer to
 the familiar intercourse which Abraham had with <I>God,</I> who is once and
 again in the history called "<I>the Angel of the Lord,</I>" and whom Christ
 here identifies with Himself. On those occasions, Abraham "saw ME"
 (O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT>, though he thinks the reference is to some unrecorded scene).

 is not that <I>Christ came into existence before Abraham did</I> (as Arians
 affirm is the meaning), but that He never <I>came</I> into being at all, but

 period for work had definite termination, so by letting any one service
 pass by its allotted time, the whole would be disarranged, marred, and
 driven beyond its destined period for completion; (5) that He acted ever
 under the impulse of these considerations, as man--"the night cometh

 say another word; but waxing bolder in defense of his Benefactor, and
 his views brightening by the very courage which it demanded, he puts it
 to them how they could pretend inability to tell whether one who opened
 the eyes of a man born blind was "of God" or "a sinner"--from above or
 from beneath--and proceeds to argue the case with remarkable power. So
 irresistible was his argument that their rage burst forth in a speech of
 intense Pharisaism, "Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou
 teach us?"--<I>thou,</I> a base-born, uneducated, impudent youth, teach
 <I>us,</I> the trained, constituted, recognized guides of the people in the

 <B>31. they cast him out</B>--judicially, no doubt, as well in fact. The
 allusion to his being "born in sins" seems a tacit admission of his
 being blind from birth--the very thing they had been so unwilling to
 own. But rage and enmity to truth are seldom consistent in their
 outbreaks. The friends of this excommunicated youth, crowding around him
 with their sympathy, would probably express surprise that One who could
 work such a cure should be unable to protect his patient from the
 persecution it had raised against him, or should possess the power
 without using it. Nor would it be strange if such thoughts should arise
 in the youth's own mind. But if they did, it is certain, from what
 follows, that they made no lodgment there, conscious as he was that
 "whereas he was blind, now he saw," and satisfied that if his Benefactor
 "were not of God, He could do nothing" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:33">Joh 9:33</A>).

 There was a word for him too, which, if whispered in his ear from the 
 oracles of God, would seem expressly designed to describe his case, and 
 prepare him for the coming interview with his gracious Friend. "Hear 
 the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at His word. <I>Your brethren 
 that hated you, that cast you out for My name's sake, said, Let the 
 Lord be glorified;</I> <FONT SIZE=-1>BUT</FONT> H<FONT SIZE=-1>E SHALL

 But how was He engaged to whom such noble testimony had been given, and 
 for whom such persecution had been borne? Uttering, perhaps, in secret, 
 "with strong crying and tears," the words of the prophetic psalm, "Let 
 not them that wait on Thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for my 
 sake; let none that seek Thee be confounded for my sake, O God of 
 Israel; because for Thy sake I have borne reproach .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  and

 and unfailing exuberance. What a claim! Yet it is only an echo of all
 His teaching; and He who uttered these and like words must be either a
 blasphemer, all worthy of the death He died, or "God with us"--there can
 be no middle course.</P>

 said of literal shepherds, who, even for their brute flock, have, like
 David, encountered "the lion and the bear" at the risk of their own
 lives, and still more of faithful pastors who, like the early bishops of
 Rome, have been the foremost to brave the fury of their enemies against
 the flock committed to their care; yet here, beyond doubt, it points to
 the struggle which was to issue in the willing surrender of the
 Redeemer's own life, to save His sheep from destruction.</P>

 is the <I>effect</I> of His. "The Redeemer's knowledge of us is the
 <I>active</I> element, penetrating us with His power and life; that of believers is
 the <I>passive</I> principle, the reception of His life and light. In this
 reception, however, an assimilation of the soul to the sublime object of
 its knowledge and love takes place; and thus an activity, though a
 derived one, is unfolded, which shows itself in obedience to His
 commands" [O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT>]. From this mutual knowledge Jesus rises to another

 following the lofty claim of the preceding clause! It is the riches and
 the poverty of "the Word made flesh"--one glorious Person reaching at
 once up to the Throne and down even to the dust of death, "that we might
 live through Him." A candid interpretation of the words,
 "<I>for the sheep,</I>" ought to go far to establish the special relation of
 the vicarious death of Christ to the Church.</P>

 its highest justification, in that sublimest and most affecting of all

 <B>18. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down myself: I have power to
 lay it down, and I have power to take it again</B>--It is impossible for
 language more plainly and emphatically to express the
 <I>absolute voluntariness</I> of Christ's death, such a voluntariness as it
 would be manifest presumption in any mere <I>creature</I> to affirm of his
 own death. It is beyond all doubt the language of One who was conscious
 that <I>His life was His own</I> (which no creature's is), and therefore
 His to surrender or retain <I>at will.</I> Here lay the glory of His
 sacrifice, that it was <I>purely</I> voluntary. The claim of "power to take
 it again" is no less important, as showing that His resurrection, though
 ascribed to the Father, in the sense we shall presently see, was
 nevertheless <I>His own assertion of His own right to life</I> as soon as
 the purposes of His voluntary death were accomplished.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>This commandment</B>--to "lay down His--life, that He might take it again."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>have I received of my Father</B>--So that Christ died at once by "command"
 of His Father, and by such a voluntary obedience to that command as has
 made Him (so to speak) infinitely dear to the Father. The <I>necessity</I> of
 Christ's death, in the light of these profound sayings, must be
 manifest to all but the superficial student.</P>

 obstinately prejudiced. The one saw in Him only "a devil and a madman";
 the other revolted at the thought that <I>such words</I> could come from

 more than <I>two months</I> after the feast of tabernacles, during which
 intermediate period our Lord seems to have remained in the neighborhood
 of Jerusalem. It was instituted by Jude Maccabeus, to commemorate the
 purification of the temple from the profanations to which it had been
 subjected by Antiochus Epiphanes 165 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, and kept for eight days, from
 the twenty-fifth Chisleu (December), the day on which Judas began the

 general expression of an admitted truth, and what follows shows for what
 purpose it was uttered, "and none is able to pluck them out of My
 Father's hand." The impossibility of true believers being lost, in the
 midst of all the temptations which they may encounter, does not consist
 in their fidelity and decision, but is founded upon the
 <I>power of God.</I> Here the doctrine of predestination is presented in
 its sublime and sacred aspect; there is a predestination of the holy,
 which is taught from one end of the Scriptures to the other; not,
 indeed, of such a nature that an "irresistible grace" <I>compels</I> the
 opposing will of man (of course not), but so that that will of man
 which receives and loves the commands of God is <I>produced</I> only by
 God's grace (O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT>--a testimony all the more valuable, being given
 in spite of <I>Lutheran</I> prejudice).</P>

 <B>30. I and my Father are one</B>--Our language admits not of the precision
 of the original in this great saying. "<I>Are</I>" is in the <I>masculine</I>
 gender--"we (two persons) are"; while "<I>one</I>" is
 <I>neuter</I>--"<I>one thing.</I>" Perhaps "<I>one interest</I>" expresses, as
 nearly as may be, the purport of the saying. There seemed to be some
 contradiction between His saying they had been given by His Father into
 <I>His own</I> hands, out of which they could not be plucked, and then
 saying that none could pluck them out of <I>His Father's</I> hands, as if
 they had not been given out of them. "<I>Neither have they,</I>" says He;
 "though He has given them to Me, they are as much in His own almighty
 hands as ever--they <I>cannot be,</I> and when given to Me they are not,
 given away from Himself; for H<FONT SIZE=-1>E AND</FONT> I

 be seen, that, though <I>oneness of essence</I> is not the precise thing
 here affirmed, that truth is <I>the basis of what is affirmed,</I> without
 which it would not be true. And A<FONT SIZE=-1>UGUSTINE</FONT> was right in
 saying the "<I>We are</I>" condemns the <I>Sabellians</I>

 <B>35, 36. If he called them gods unto whom the word of God came .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
 Say ye of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world,
 Thou blasphemest</B>--The whole force of this reasoning, which has been
 but in part seized by the commentators, lies in what is said of the two
 parties compared. The <I>comparison</I> of Himself with mere men, divinely
 commissioned, is intended to show (as N<FONT SIZE=-1>EANDER</FONT> well expresses it) that
 the idea of a communication of the Divine Majesty to human nature was by
 no means foreign to the revelations of the Old Testament; but there is
 also a <I>contrast</I> between Himself and all merely human representatives
 of God--the one "<I>sanctified by the Father and sent into the world</I>";
 the other, "<I>to whom the word of God</I> (merely) <I>came,</I>" which is
 expressly designed to prevent His being massed up with them as only one
 of many human officials of God. <I>It is never said of Christ</I> that "the
 word of the Lord came to Him"; whereas this is the well-known formula by
 which the divine commission, even to the highest of <I>mere men,</I> is
 expressed, as John the Baptist 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:2">Lu 3:2</A>).

 The reason is that given by the Baptist himself (see on

 <A HREF="#Joh3_31">Joh 3:31</A>). 

 The contrast is between those "to whom the word of God came"--men of 
 the earth, earthy, who were merely privileged to get a divine 
 <I>message</I> to utter (if prophets), or a divine <I>office</I> to 
 discharge (if judges)--and "Him whom (not being of the earth at all) 
 <I>the Father sanctified</I> (or set apart), and <I>sent into the 
 world,</I>" an expression <I>never used of any merely human messenger 
 of God,</I> and <I>used only of Himself.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>because, I said, I am the Son of God</B>--It is worthy of special notice
 that our Lord <I>had not said,</I> in so many words, that He was the Son of
 God, on this occasion. But He had said what beyond doubt amounted to
 it--namely, that He gave His sheep eternal life, and none could pluck
 them out of His hand; that He had got them from His Father, in whose
 hands, though given to Him, they still remained, and out of whose hand
 none could pluck them; and that they were
 <I>the indefeasible property of both,</I> inasmuch as "He and His Father
 were one." Our Lord considers all this as just saying of Himself, "I am
 the Son of God"--<I>one nature</I> with Him, yet mysteriously <I>of Him.</I> The parenthesis 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:35">Joh 10:35</A>),

 "and the Scripture cannot be broken," referring to the terms used of 
 magistrates in the eighty-second Psalm, has an important bearing on the 
 <I>authority</I> of the living oracles.  "The Scripture, as the 
 expressed will of the unchangeable God, is itself unchangeable and 
 indissoluble" [O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT>].  (Compare

 unable to resist

 let things come to their worst, in order to display His glory. But how
 trying, meantime, to the faith of his friends, and how unlike the way in
 which love to a dying friend usually shows itself, on which it is plain
 that Mary reckoned. But the ways of <I>divine</I> are not as the ways of
 <I>human</I> love. Often they are the reverse. When His people are sick,
 in body or spirit; when their case is waxing more and more desperate
 every day; when all hope of recovery is about to expire--just then and
 therefore it is that
 "<I>He abides two days still in the same place where He is.</I>" Can they
 still hope against hope? Often they do not; but "this is their
 infirmity." For it is His chosen style of acting. We have been well
 taught it, and should not <I>now</I> have the lesson to learn. From the

 Lazarus" [L<FONT SIZE=-1>AMPE</FONT>]. Our Lord had been told only
 that Lazarus was "sick." But the change which his two days' delay had 
 produced is here tenderly alluded to. Doubtless, His spirit was all the 
 while with His dying, and now dead "friend." The symbol of "sleep" for 
 <I>death</I> is common to all languages, and familiar to us in the Old 
 Testament. In the New Testament, however, a higher meaning is put into 
 it, in relation to believers in Jesus (see on

 could not have resisted the importunities of the sisters, but because,
 in presence of the personal Life, death could not have reached His
 friend [L<FONT SIZE=-1>UTHARDT</FONT>]. "It is beautifully congruous to the divine decorum

 Him "joyous"; the sequel shows it was "grievous"; but <I>for them</I> it

 Here, however, though alleged by many interpreters there is nothing of 
 the sort. He perceives clearly how this journey to Judea will end, as 
 respects his Master, and not only sees in it peril to themselves, as 
 they all did, but feels as if he could not and cared not to survive his 
 Master's sacrifice to the fury of His enemies. It was that kind of

 death? Could these <I>effects</I> move Him without suggesting the

 the miracle on the blind man; but "if (as everybody says) He did that,
 why could He not also have kept Lazarus alive?" As to the restoration of

 According to the Talmudists, it was forbidden to open a grave after the
 stone was placed upon it. Besides other dangers, they were apprehensive
 of legal impurity by contact with the dead. Hence they avoided coming
 nearer a grave than four cubits [M<FONT SIZE=-1>AIMONIDES</FONT> in

 touched the leper, and the bier of the widow of Nain's son, rises here
 also above these Judaic memorials of evils, every one of which He had
 come to roll away.
 <I>Observe here what our Lord did Himself, and what He made others do.</I>
 As Elijah himself repaired the altar on Carmel, arranged the wood, cut
 the victim, and placed the pieces on the fuel, but made the by-standers
 fill the surrounding trench with water, that no suspicion might arise
 of fire having been secretly applied to the pile 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:30-35">1Ki 18:30-35</A>);
 
 so our Lord would let the most skeptical see that, without laying a
 hand on the stone that covered His friend, He could recall him to life.
 But what could be done by human hand He orders to be done, reserving
 only to Himself what transcended the ability of all creatures.

 the dead, a large number of persons was assembled. In two instances, the
 resurrection of the widow's son and of Lazarus, these were all witnesses
 of the miracle; in the third (of Jairus' daughter) they were necessarily
 cognizant of it. Yet this important circumstance is in each case only
 incidentally noticed by the historians, not put forward or appealed to
 as a proof of their veracity. In regard to this miracle, we observe a
 greater degree of preparation, both in the provident arrangement of
 events, and in our Lord's actions and words than in any other. The
 preceding miracle (cure of the man born blind) is distinguished from all

 <B>24. Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth
 alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit</B>--The <I>necessity</I>
 of His death is here brightly expressed, and its proper operation and
 fruit--<I>life springing forth out of death</I>--imaged forth by a beautiful
 and deeply significant law of the vegetable kingdom. For a double
 reason, no doubt, this was uttered--to explain what he had said of His
 death, as the hour of His own glorification, and to sustain His own
 Spirit under the agitation which was mysteriously coming over it in the
 view of that death.</P>

 <A NAME="Joh12_25"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>25. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his 
 life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal</B>--(See on

 <A HREF="JFB42.htm#Lu9_24">Lu 9:24</A>).

 Did our Lord mean to exclude Himself from the operation of the great 
 principle here expressed--<I>self-renunciation, the law of 
 self-preservation;</I> and its converse, <I>self-preservation, the law 
 of self-destruction?</I> On the contrary, as He became Man to exemplify 
 this fundamental law of the Kingdom of God in its most sublime form, so 
 the very utterance of it on this occasion served to sustain His own 
 Spirit in the double prospect to which He had just alluded.</P>

 <A NAME="Joh12_26"> </A>

 <B>26. If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there
 shall also my servant be: If any man serve me, him will my Father
 honour</B>--<I>Jesus here claims the same absolute subjection to Himself,
 as the law of men's exaltation to honor, as He yielded to the Father.</I></P>

 <A NAME="Joh12_27"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>27, 28. Now is my soul troubled</B>--He means at the prospect of His death,
 just alluded to. Strange view of the Cross this, immediately after
 representing it as the hour of His glory! 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:23">Joh 12:23</A>).

 But the two views naturally meet, and blend into one. It was the 
 Greeks, one might say, that troubled Him. Ah! they shall see Jesus, but 
 <I>to Him</I> it shall be a costly sight.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and what shall I say?</B>--He is in a strait betwixt two. The death of the
 cross was, and could not but be, appalling to His spirit. But to shrink
 from absolute subjection to the Father, was worse still. In asking
 Himself, "What shall I say?" He seems as if thinking aloud, feeling His
 way between two dread alternatives, looking both of them sternly in the
 face, measuring, weighing them, in order that the choice actually made
 might be seen, <I>and even by himself the more vividly felt,</I> to be a
 profound, deliberate, spontaneous election.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Father, save me from this hour</B>--To take this as a question--"Shall I
 say, Father, save me," &c.--as some eminent editors and interpreters
 do, is unnatural and jejune. It is a real petition, like that in
 Gethsemane, "Let this cup pass from Me"; only whereas <I>there</I> He
 prefaces the prayer with an "If it be possible," <I>here</I> He follows it
 up with what is tantamount to that--"Nevertheless for this cause came I
 unto this hour." The sentiment conveyed, then, by the prayer, in both
 cases, is twofold: (1) that only one thing could reconcile Him to the
 death of the cross--its being His Father's will He should endure it--and
 (2) that in this view of it He yielded Himself freely to it.
 <I>What He recoils from is not subjection to His Father's will: but to show
 how tremendous a self-sacrifice that obedience involved,</I> He first
 asks the Father to save Him from it, and then signifies how perfectly He
 knows that He is there for the very purpose of enduring it. Only by
 letting these mysterious words speak their full meaning do they become
 intelligible and consistent. As for those who see
 <I>no bitter elements in the death of Christ</I>--nothing beyond mere
 dying--what can they make of such a scene? and when they place it over
 against the feelings with which thousands of His adoring followers have
 welcomed death for His sake, how can they hold Him up to the admiration
 of men?</P>

 considered as a vast and complicated kingdom of Satan, breathing his

 by its hands irrevocably sealed.

 <B>now shall the prince of this world be cast out</B>--How differently is
 that fast-approaching "hour" regarded in the kingdoms of darkness and of
 light! "The hour of relief; from the dread Troubler of our peace--how
 near it is! Yet a little moment, and the day is ours!" So it was
 calculated and felt in the one region. "Now shall the prince of this
 world be cast out," is a somewhat different view of the same event. We
 know who was right. Though yet under a veil, He sees the triumphs of
 the Cross in unclouded and transporting light.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>32. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto

 ejected prince. "If lifted up," means not only
 <I>after that I have been lifted up,</I> but,
 <I>through the virtue of that uplifting.</I> And truly, the death of the
 Cross, in all its significance, revealed in the light, and borne in
 upon the heart, by the power of the Holy Ghost, possesses an attraction
 over the wide world--to civilized and savage, learned and illiterate,
 alike--which breaks down all opposition, assimilates all to itself, and
 forms out of the most heterogeneous and discordant materials a kingdom
 of surpassing glory, whose uniting principle is adoring subjection "to
 Him that loved them." "Will draw all men 'UNTO ME,'" says He. What lips
 could venture to utter such a word but His, which "dropt as an
 honeycomb," whose manner of speaking was evermore in the same spirit of
 conscious equality with the Father?</P>

 holding Himself up as <I>the Christ</I> and

 with mingled majesty and tenderness, against trifling with their last 
 brief opportunity, and entreats them to let in the Light while they 
 have it in the midst of them, that they themselves might be "light in 
 the Lord." In this case, all the clouds which hung around His Person 
 and Mission would speedily be dispelled, while if they continued to 
 hate the light, bootless were all His answers to their merely

 struggling "in the world" after He had "departed out of it to the

 the "<I>my,</I>" which, by bringing them together, the original expresses,
 for it is not good English to say, "Lord, <I>Thou my</I> feet dost wash?"
 But <I>every word</I> of this question is emphatic. Thus far, and in the
 question itself, there was nothing but the most profound and beautiful
 astonishment at a condescension to him quite incomprehensible.
 Accordingly, though there can be no doubt that already Peter's heart
 rebelled against it as a thing not to be tolerated, Jesus ministers no
 rebuke as yet, but only bids him wait a little, and he should understand
 it all.</P>

 consolation.</P>

 <A NAME="Joh13_8"> </A>

 <B>8. Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash,</B> &c.--more
 emphatically, "Never shalt Thou wash my feet": that is, "That is an
 incongruity to which I can never submit." How like the man!

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me</B>--What Peter could 
 not submit to was, that the Master should serve His servant. But <I>the 
 whole saving work of Christ was one continued series of such services, 
 ending with and consummated by the most self-sacrificing and 
 transcendent of all services:</I> T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT> S<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ON OF</FONT> M<FONT SIZE=-1>AN CAME</FONT> <I>not to be

 <A HREF="JFB41.htm#Mr10_45">Mr 10:45</A>). 

 If Peter then could not submit to let his Master go down so low as to 
 wash his feet, <I>how should he suffer himself to be served by Him at 
 all?</I> This is couched under the one pregnant word "wash," which 
 though applicable to the <I>lower</I> operation which Peter resisted, 
 is the familiar scriptural symbol of that <I>higher</I> cleansing, 
 which Peter little thought he was at the same time virtually putting 
 from him. <I>It is not humility to refuse what the Lord deigns to do
 for us, or to deny what He has done,</I> but it is self-willed 
 presumption--<I>not rare, however, in those inner circles of lofty 
 religious profession and traditional spirituality, which are found 
 wherever Christian truth has enjoyed long and undisturbed 
 possession.</I> The truest humility is to receive reverentially, and 
 thankfully to own, the gifts of grace.</P>

 of my speech, I tread upon it; and if to be washed of Thee have such
 significance, then not my feet only, but hands, head, and all, be
 washed!" This artless expression of clinging, life-and-death attachment
 to Jesus, and felt dependence upon Him for his whole spiritual
 well-being, compared with the similar saying in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:68,69">Joh 6:68, 69</A>

 here the former word is resumed, meaning to wash <I>the hands or feet</I>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but is clean every whit</B>--as a whole. This sentence is singularly
 instructive. Of the <I>two cleansings,</I> the one points to that which
 takes place at the <I>commencement</I> of the Christian life, embracing
 <I>complete absolution from sin as a guilty state,</I> and
 <I>entire deliverance from it as a polluted life</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:5,1Co+6:11">Re 1:5;
 1Co 6:11</A>)

 --or, in the language of theology, <I>Justification</I> and 
 <I>Regeneration.</I> This cleansing is effected <I>once for all,</I> 
 and is never repeated. The other cleansing, described as that of "the 
 feet," is <I>such as one walking from a bath quite cleansed still 
 needs, in consequence of his contact with the earth.</I> (Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:18,19">Ex 30:18, 19</A>).

 It is the <I>daily</I> cleansing which we are taught to seek, when in 
 the spirit of adoption we say, "Our Father which art in heaven

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:9,12">Mt 6:9, 12</A>);

 and, when burdened with the sense of manifold shortcomings--as what 
 tender spirit of a Christian is not?--is it not a relief to be 
 permitted thus to wash our feet after a day's contact with the earth? 
 This is not to call in question the completeness of our past 
 justification. Our Lord, while graciously insisting on washing Peter's 
 feet, refuses to extend the cleansing farther, that the symbolical 
 instruction intended to be conveyed might not be marred.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and ye are clean</B>--in the first and <I>whole</I> sense.

 <B>but not all</B>--important, as showing that Judas, instead of being

 one of those scenes in which the parallel of his story with that of His 
 great Antitype is exceedingly striking. "The eating bread derives a 
 fearful meaning from the participation in the sacramental supper, a 
 meaning which must be applied for ever to all unworthy communicants, as 
 well as to all betrayers of Christ who eat the bread of His Church"

 <B>21. When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and 
 testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, One of you shall
 betray me</B>--The announcement of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:18">Joh 13:18</A>

 seems not to have been plain enough to be quite apprehended, save by
 the traitor himself. He will therefore speak it out in terms not to be 
 misunderstood. But how much it cost Him to do this, appears from the 
 "trouble" that came over His "spirit"--visible emotion, no 
 doubt--before He got it uttered. What wounded susceptibility does this 
 disclose, and what exquisite delicacy in His social intercourse with 
 the Twelve, to whom He cannot, without an effort, break the 
 subject!</P>

 <A NAME="Joh13_22"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>22. the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he
 spake</B>--Further intensely interesting particulars are given in the 
 other Gospels: (1) "They were exceeding sorrowful"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:22">Mt 26:22</A>).

 (2) "They began to inquire among themselves which of them it was that
 should do this thing"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:23">Lu 22:23</A>).

 (3) "They began to say unto Him one by one, Is it I, and another, Is it 
 I?"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:19">Mr 14:19</A>).

 Generous, simple hearts! They abhorred the thought, but, instead of
 putting it on others, each was only anxious to purge <I>himself</I> and 
 know if <I>he</I> could be the wretch. Their putting it at once to 
 Jesus Himself, as knowing doubtless who was to do it, was the best, as 
 it certainly was the most spontaneous and artless evidence of their 
 innocence. (4) Jesus, apparently while this questioning was going on, 
 added, "The Son of man goeth as it is written of Him, but woe unto that 
 man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It had been good for that man 
 if he had not been born"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:24">Mt 26:24</A>).

 (5) "Judas," <I>last of all,</I> "answered and said, <I>Lord, is it 
 I?</I>" evidently feeling that when all were saying this, if he held 
 his peace, that of itself would draw suspicion upon him. To prevent 
 this the question is wrung out of him, but perhaps, amidst the stir and 
 excitement at the table, in a half-suppressed tone as we are inclined 
 to think the answer also was--"Thou hast said"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:25">Mt 26:25</A>),
 
 or possibly by little more than a sign; for from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:28">Joh 13:28</A>

 discovered.</P>

 reclining next to Jesus at the table.

 to Peter perhaps from behind.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>He .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to whom I shall give a sop when I have dipped it</B>--a piece of
 the bread soaked in the wine or the sauce of the dish; one of the
 ancient ways of testifying peculiar regard; compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:18">Joh 13:18</A>,
 
 "<I>he that eateth bread with Me.</I>"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>And when he had dipped .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he gave it to Judas,</B> &c.--Thus the sign
 of Judas' treachery was an affecting expression, and the last, of the
 Saviour's wounded love!</P>

 <A NAME="Joh13_27"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>27-30. after the sop Satan entered into him</B>--Very solemn are these
 brief hints of the successive steps by which Judas reached the climax of
 his guilt. "The devil had already put it into his heart to betray his
 Lord." Yet who can tell what struggles he went through ere he brought
 himself to carry that suggestion into effect? Even after this, however,
 his compunctions were not at an end. With the thirty pieces of silver
 already in his possession, he seems still to have quailed--and can we
 wonder? When Jesus stooped to wash his feet, it may be the last struggle
 was reaching its crisis. But that word of the Psalm, about "one that ate
 of his bread who would lift up his heel against Him" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+41:9">Ps 41:9</A>)

 probably all but turned the dread scale, and the still more explicit 
 announcement, that one of those sitting with Him at the table should 
 betray Him, would beget the thought, "I am detected; it is now too late 
 to draw back." At that moment the sop is given; offer of friendship is 
 once more made--and how affectingly! But already "Satan has <I>entered 
 into him,</I>" and though the Saviour's act might seem enough to recall 
 him even yet, hell is now in his bosom, and he says within himself, 
 "The die is cast; now let me go through with it"; fear, begone!" (See 
 on

 <A HREF="JFB40.htm#Mt12_43">Mt 12:43</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly</B>--that is, Why
 linger here? Thy presence is a restraint, and thy work stands still;
 thou hast the wages of iniquity, go work for it!</P>

 <B>31. when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man

 moment our Lord had spoken <I>under a painful restraint,</I> the 
 presence of a traitor within the little circle of His holiest 
 fellowship on earth preventing the free and full outpouring of His 
 heart; as is evident, indeed, from those oft-recurring clauses, "Ye are 
 not all clean," "I speak not of you all," &c. "Now" the restraint is 
 removed, and the embankment which kept in the mighty volume of living 
 waters having broken down, they burst forth in a torrent which only 
 ceases on His leaving the supper room and entering on the next stage of 
 His great work--the scene in the Garden. But with what words is the
 silence first broken on the departure of Judas? By no reflections on 
 the traitor, and, what is still more wonderful, by no reference to the 
 dread character of His own approaching sufferings. He does not even 
 name them, save by announcing, as with a burst of triumph, that the 
 hour of His <I>glory</I> has arrived! And what is very remarkable, in 
 five brief clauses He repeats this word "glorify" <I>five times,</I> as 
 if to His view a coruscation of glories played at that moment about the 
 Cross. (See on

 <A HREF="#Joh12_23">Joh 12:23</A>).

 employed by Paul

 life a ransom for them was altogether new, and consequently as a Model 
 and Standard for theirs to one another. It is not, however, something 
 transcending the great moral law, which is "the <I>old</I> commandment"

 We now come to that portion of the evangelical history which we may with
 propriety call its <I>Holy of Holies.</I> Our Evangelist, like a
 consecrated priest, alone opens up to us the view into this sanctuary.
 It is the record of the last moments spent by the Lord in the midst of
 His disciples before His passion, when words full of heavenly thought
 flowed from His sacred lips. All that His heart, glowing with love, had
 still to say to His friends, was compressed into this short season. At
 first (from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:31">Joh 13:31</A>)

 the intercourse took the form of conversation; sitting at table, they 
 talked familiarly together. But when

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:31">Joh 14:31</A>)

 the repast was finished, the language of Christ assumed a loftier 
 strain; the disciples, assembled around their Master, listened to the 
 words of life, and seldom spoke a word (only

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:17,29">Joh 16:17, 29</A>).

 "At length, in the Redeemer's sublime intercessory prayer, His full 
 soul was poured forth in express petitions to His heavenly Father on 
 behalf of those who were His own. It is a peculiarity of these last 
 chapters, that they treat almost exclusively of the most profound 
 relations--as that of the Son to the Father, and of both to the Spirit, 
 that of Christ to the Church, of the Church to the world, and so forth. 
 Moreover, a considerable portion of these sublime communications 
 surpassed the point of view to which the disciples had at that time 
 attained; hence the Redeemer frequently repeats the same sentiments in 
 order to impress them more deeply upon their minds, and, because of 
 what they still did not understand, points them to the Holy Spirit, who 
 would remind them of all His sayings, and lead them into all truth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:26">Joh 14:26</A>)"
 
 [O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT>].</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>1. Let not your heart be troubled,</B> &c.--What myriads of souls have
 not these opening words cheered, in deepest gloom, since first they were
 uttered!

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>ye believe in God</B>--absolutely.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>believe also in me</B>--that is, Have the <I>same trust</I> in Me.
 What less, and what else, can these words mean? And if so, what a 
 demand to make by one sitting familiarly with them at the supper table! 
 Compare the saying in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:17">Joh 5:17</A>,

 for which the Jews took up stones to stone Him, as "making himself
 equal with God"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:18">Joh 14:18</A>).

 But it is no <I>transfer of our trust from its proper Object;</I> it is 
 but <I>the concentration of our trust in the Unseen and Impalpable One 
 upon His Own Incarnate Son,</I> by which that trust, instead of the 
 distant, unsteady, and too often cold and scarce real thing it 
 otherwise is, acquires a conscious reality, warmth, and power, which 
 makes all things new. <I>This is Christianity in brief.</I></P>

 astonishment, if not horror, were he to reply,
 "<I>Because my Father is greater than I?</I>" Does not this strange speech
 from Christ's lips, then, <I>presuppose such teaching</I> on His part as
 would make it extremely difficult for them to think He could gain
 anything by departing to the Father, and make it necessary for Him to
 say expressly that there was a sense in which He <I>could</I> do so? Thus,
 this startling explanation seems plainly intended to correct such
 misapprehensions as might arise from the emphatic and reiterated
 teaching of <I>His proper equality with the Father</I>--as if so Exalted a
 Person were incapable of any accession by transition from this dismal
 scene to a cloudless heaven and the very bosom of the Father--and by
 assuring them that this was <I>not</I> the case, to make them forget their

 which seems clearly to intimate that they then only left the upper 
 room. But what do the words mean if not this? We think it was the 
 dictate of that saying of earlier date, "I have a baptism to be 
 baptized with, and <I>how am I straitened till it be 
 accomplished!</I>"--a spontaneous and irrepressible expression of the 
 deep eagerness of His spirit to get into the conflict, and that if, as 
 is likely, it was responded to somewhat too literally by the guests who 
 hung on His lips, in the way of a movement to depart, a wave of His 
 hand, would be enough to show that He had yet more to say ere they 
 broke up; and that disciple, whose pen was dipped in a love to his 
 Master which made <I>their</I> movements of small consequence save when 
 essential to the illustration of <I>His</I> words, would record this 
 little outburst of the Lamb hastening to the slaughter, in the very 
 midst of His lofty discourse; while the effect of it, if any, upon His 
 hearers, as of no consequence, would naturally enough be passed 
 over.</P>

 <B>8. And when he is come, he will,</B> &c.--This is one of the passages
 most pregnant with thought in the profound discourses of Christ; with a
 few great strokes depicting all and every part of the ministry of the
 Holy Ghost in the world--His operation with reference to individuals as
 well as the mass, on believers and unbelievers alike [O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he will reprove</B>--This is too weak a word to express what is meant.
 <I>Reproof</I> is indeed implied in the term employed, and doubtless the
 word begins with it. But <I>convict</I> or <I>convince</I> is the thing
 intended; and as the one expresses the work of the Spirit on the
 <I>unbelieving</I> portion of mankind, and the other on the
 <I>believing,</I> it is better not to restrict it to either.</P>

 <A NAME="Joh16_9"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>9. Of sin, because they believe not on me</B>--As all sin has its root
 in unbelief, so the most aggravated form of unbelief is the rejection of
 Christ. The Spirit, however, in fastening this truth upon the
 conscience, does not <I>extinguish,</I> but, on the contrary, does
 <I>consummate and intensify, the sense of all other sins.</I></P>

 <A NAME="Joh16_10"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>10. Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no
 more</B>--Beyond doubt, it is <I>Christ's personal righteousness</I> which
 the Spirit was to bring home to the sinner's heart. The evidence of this
 was to lie in the great <I>historical fact,</I> that He had "gone to His
 Father and was no more visible to men":--for if His claim to be the Son
 of God, the Saviour of the world, had been a lie, how should the Father,
 who is "a jealous God," have raised such a blasphemer from the dead and
 exalted him to His right hand? But if He was the "Faithful and True
 Witness," the Father's "Righteous Servant," "His Elect, in whom His soul
 delighted," then was His departure to the Father, and consequent
 disappearance from the view of men, but the fitting consummation, the
 august reward, of all that He did here below, the seal of His mission,
 the glorification of the testimony which He bore on earth, by the
 reception of its Bearer to the Father's bosom. This triumphant
 vindication of Christ's <I>rectitude</I> is to us divine evidence, bright
 as heaven, that He is indeed the Saviour of the world, God's Righteous
 Servant to justify many, because He bare their iniquities 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:11">Isa 53:11</A>).
 
 Thus the Spirit, in this clause, is seen convincing men that there is in
 Christ perfect relief under the sense of <I>sin</I> of which He had before
 convinced them; and so far from mourning over His absence from us, as an
 irreparable loss, we learn to glory in it, as the evidence of His
 perfect acceptance on our behalf, exclaiming with one who understood
 this point, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is
 God that justifieth: Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died;
 <I>yea, rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God,</I>"
 &c.

 <A NAME="Joh16_11"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>11. Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged</B>--By
 supposing that the <I>final judgment</I> is here meant, the point of this
 clause is, even by good interpreters, quite missed. The statement, "The
 prince of this world is <I>judged,</I>" means, beyond all reasonable doubt,
 the same as that in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:31">Joh 12:31</A>,

 "Now shall the prince of this world be <I>cast out</I>"; and both mean 
 that his dominion over men, or his power to enslave and so to ruin 
 them, is destroyed. The death of Christ "judged" or judicially 
 overthrew him, and he was thereupon "cast out" or expelled from his 
 usurped dominion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:14,1Jo+3:8,Col+2:15">Heb 2:14;
 1Jo 3:8; 
 Col 2:15</A>).

 Thus, then, the Spirit shall bring home to men's conscience: (1) the
 sense of <I>sin,</I> consummated in the rejection of Him who came to 
 "take away the sin of the world"; (2) the sense of perfect relief in 
 the <I>righteousness</I> of the Father's Servant, now fetched from the 
 earth that spurned Him to that bosom where from everlasting He had 
 dwelt; and (3) the sense of emancipation from the fetters of Satan, 
 whose <I>judgment</I> brings to men liberty to be holy, and 
 transformation out of servants of the devil into sons and daughters of 
 the Lord Almighty. To one class of men, however, all this will carry 
 <I>conviction</I> only; they "will not come to Christ"--revealed though 
 He be to them as the life-giving One--that they may have life. Such, 
 abiding voluntarily under the dominion of the prince of this world, are 
 <I>judged in his judgment,</I> the visible consummation of which will 
 be at the great day. To another class, however, this blessed teaching 
 will have another issue--translating them out of the kingdom of 
 darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son.</P>

 He hears," what is given Him to communicate.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he will show you things to come</B>--referring specially to those

 <B>14. He shall glorify me; for he shall receive of mine and show it unto
 you</B>--Thus the whole design of the Spirit's office is to glorify
 Christ--not in His own Person, for this was done by the Father when He
 exalted Him to His own right hand--but in the view and estimation of
 men. For this purpose He was to "<I>receive of Christ</I>"--<I>all the
 truth relating to Christ</I>--"<I>and show it unto them,</I>" or
 make them to discern it in its own light. The <I>subjective</I> nature of
 the Spirit's teaching--the discovery to the souls of men of what is
 Christ <I>outwardly</I>--is here very clearly expressed; and, at the same
 time, the vanity of looking for revelations of the Spirit which shall do
 anything beyond throwing light in the soul upon what Christ Himself is,
 and taught, and did upon earth.</P>

 <A NAME="Joh16_15"> </A>

 it to us. We have here a wonderful glimpse into the

 world at their not seeing Him seems to show that His removal from them
 by <I>death</I> was what He meant; and in that case, their joy at again
 seeing Him points to their transport at His reappearance amongst them on
 His <I>Resurrection,</I> when they could no longer doubt His identity. At
 the same time the sorrow of the widowed Church in the absence of her
 Lord in the heavens, and her transport at His personal return, are
 certainly here expressed.</P>

 there was One who would not forsake Him, was to Him matter of ineffable
 support and consolation; but that He should be without all <I>human</I>

 not have exclaimed, Oh, to have been within hearing of such a prayer as 
 that must have been, which wound up the whole of His past ministry and

 previous sanctification, since nothing but what is holy can be presented

 thee, that they may be one in us</B>--<I>The indwelling Spirit of the Father and the Son</I> is the one perfect
 bond of union, knitting up into a living unity, first all believers
 amongst themselves; next, this unity into one still higher, with the
 Father and the Son. (Observe, that Christ <I>never mixes Himself up with His
 disciples as He associates Himself with the Father,</I> but says I in
 <FONT SIZE=-1>THEM</FONT> and
 <FONT SIZE=-1>THEY</FONT> in
 <FONT SIZE=-1>US</FONT>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>that the world may believe that thou hast sent me</B>--sentest me. So
 the grand impression upon the world at large, that the mission of Christ
 is divine, is to be made by <I>the unity of His disciples.</I> Of course,
 then, it must be something that shall be <I>visible</I> or perceptible to
 the world. What is it, then? Not certainly a merely formal, mechanical
 unity of ecclesiastical machinery. For as that may, and to a large
 extent does, exist in both the Western and Eastern churches, with little
 of the Spirit of Christ, yea much, much with which the Spirit of Christ
 cannot dwell so instead of convincing the world <I>beyond its own pale</I>
 of the divinity of the Gospel, it generates infidelity to a large extent
 within its own bosom. But the Spirit of Christ, illuminating,
 transforming, and reigning in the hearts of the genuine disciples of
 Christ, drawing them to each other as members of one family, and
 prompting them to loving co-operation for the good of the world--this is
 what, when sufficiently glowing and extended, shall force conviction
 upon the world that Christianity is divine. Doubtless, the more that
 differences among Christians disappear--the more they can agree even in
 minor matters--the impression upon the world may be expected to be
 greater. But it is not <I>dependent</I> upon this; for living and loving
 oneness in Christ is sometimes more touchingly seen even amidst and in
 spite of minor differences, than where no such differences exist to try
 the strength of their deeper unity. Yet till this living brotherhood in
 Christ shall show itself strong enough to destroy the sectarianism,
 selfishness, carnality, and apathy that eat out the heart of
 Christianity in all the visible sections of it, in vain shall we expect
 the world to be overawed by it. It is when "the Spirit shall be poured
 upon us from on high," as a Spirit of truth and love, and upon all parts
 of the Christian territory alike, melting down differences and heart
 burnings, kindling astonishment and shame at past unfruitfulness,
 drawing forth longings of catholic affection, and yearnings over a world
 lying in wickedness, embodying themselves in palpable forms and active
 measures--it is then that we may expect the effect here announced to be
 produced, and then it will be irresistible. <I>Should not Christians ponder
 these things? Should not the same mind be in them which was also in Christ
 Jesus about this matter? Should not His prayer be theirs?</I></P>

 Lamb to the slaughter. "No man taketh My life from Me, but I lay it
 down of Myself" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:18">Joh 10:18</A>).

 Besides, the scene which was to fill up the little breathing-time, the 
 awful interval, between the Supper and the Apprehension--like the 
 "silence in heaven for about the space of half an hour" between the 
 breaking of the Apocalyptic Seals and the peal of the Trumpets of war

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+8:1">Re 8:1</A>)

 --the <FONT SIZE=-1>AGONY</FONT>--would have been too terrible for the 
 upper room; nor would He cloud the delightful associations of the 
 <I>last Passover</I> and the <I>first Supper</I> by pouring out the 
 anguish of His soul there. The garden, however, with its amplitude, its 
 shady olives, its endeared associations, would be congenial to His 
 heart. Here He had room enough to retire--first, from eight of them, 
 and then from the more favored three; and here, when that mysterious 
 scene was over, the stillness would only be broken by the tread of the 
 traitor.</P>

 <B>3. Judas then</B>--"He that was called Judas, one of the Twelve," says
 Luke 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:47">Lu 22:47</A>),

 in language which brands him with peculiar infamy, as <I>in</I> the 
 sacred circle while in no sense <I>of</I> it.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>a band of men</B>--"the <I>detachment</I> of the Roman cohort on duty at
 the festival for the purpose of maintaining order" [W<FONT SIZE=-1>EBSTER</FONT> and
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>ILKINSON</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>officers from the chief priests and Pharisees</B>--captains of the
 temple and armed Levites.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>lanterns and torches</B>--It was full moon, but in case He should have
 secreted Himself somewhere in the dark ravine, they bring the means of
 exploring its hiding-places--little knowing whom they had to do with.
 "Now he that betrayed Him had given them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I
 shall kiss, that same is He, hold Him fast" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:48">Mt 26:48</A>).

 The cold-bloodedness of this speech was only exceeded by the deed 
 itself. "And Judas went before them

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:47">Lu 22:47</A>],

 and forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Master, and kissed Him"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:49">Mt 26:49</A>;
 
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:27,18:7,Lu+7:45">Ex 4:27; 18:7;
 Lu 7:45</A>). 

 The impudence of this atrocious deed shows how thoroughly he had by
 this time mastered all his scruples. If the dialogue between our Lord 
 and His captors was <I>before</I> this, as some interpreters think it 
 was, the kiss of Judas was purely gratuitous, and probably to make good 
 his right to the money; our Lord having presented Himself unexpectedly 
 before them, and rendered it unnecessary for any one to point Him out. 
 But a comparison of the narratives seems to show that our Lord's 
 "coming forth" to the band was <I>subsequent</I> to the interview of 
 Judas. "And Jesus said unto him, Friend"--not the endearing term 
 "friend" (in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:15">Joh 15:15</A>),

 but "companion," a word used on occasions of remonstrance or rebuke (as 
 in

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:50">Mt 26:50</A>).

 "Betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss"--imprinting upon the 
 foulest act the mark of tenderest affection? What <I>wounded
 feeling</I> does this express! Of this Jesus showed Himself on various 
 occasions keenly susceptible--as all generous and beautiful natures 
 do.</P>

 <B>10, 11. Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and smote the high
 priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was
 Malchus</B>--None of the other Evangelists mention the name either of the
 ardent disciple or of his victim. John being "known to the high priest"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:15">Joh 18:15</A>),

 the mention of the servant's name by <I>him</I> is quite natural, and 
 an interesting mark of truth in a small matter. As to the <I>right</I> 
 ear, specified both here and in Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:50">Lu 22:50</A>),

 the man was "likely foremost of those who advanced to seize Jesus, and 
 presented himself in the attitude of a combatant; hence his right side 
 would be exposed to attack. The blow of Peter was evidently aimed 
 vertically at his head" [W<FONT SIZE=-1>EBSTER</FONT> and W<FONT

 <B>Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given 
 me, shall I not drink it?</B>--This expresses <I>both the feelings</I> 
 which struggled in the Lord's breast during the Agony in the 
 garden--<I>aversion to the cup</I> viewed <I>in itself,</I> but, <I>in 
 the light of the Father's will,</I> perfect <I>preparedness to drink 
 it.</I> (See on

 <A HREF="JFB42.htm#Lu22_39">Lu 22:39-46</A>).

 Matthew adds to the address to Peter the following:--"For all they that 
 take the sword shall perish by the sword"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:52">Mt 26:52</A>)

 --that is, 'Those who take the sword must run all the risks of human 
 warfare; but Mine is a warfare whose weapons, as they are not carnal, 
 are attended with no such hazards, but carry certain victory.' 
 "Thinkest thou that I cannot now"--even after things have proceeded so 
 far--"pray to My Father, and He shall presently give Me"--rather, 
 "place at My disposal"--"more than twelve legions of angels"; with 
 allusion, possibly, to the one angel who had, in His agony, "appeared 
 to Him from heaven strengthening Him"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:43">Lu 22:43</A>);

 and in the precise number, alluding to the <I>twelve</I> who needed the 
 help, Himself and His eleven disciples. (The full complement of a 
 legion of Roman soldiers was six thousand). "But how then shall the 
 scripture be fulfilled that thus it must be?"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:53,54">Mt 26:53, 54</A>).

 He could not suffer, according to the Scripture, if He allowed Himself 
 to be delivered from the predicted death. "And He touched his ear and 
 healed him"

 and probably now, on the way to judgment, when the crowds were pressing 
 upon Him, "said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a 
 thief, with swords and staves, for to take Me"--expressive of the 
 indignity which He felt to be thus done to Him--"I sat daily with you 
 in the temple, and ye laid no hold on Me. But this" (adds

 These two statements are extremely interesting. His wishing to "see the

 drawn closer; it is a cold night, and why should not he take advantage 
 of the fire as well as others? Besides, in the talk of the crowd about

 translators so render the words, understanding that the foregoing 
 interview took place before <I>Caiaphas;</I> Annas, declining to meddle 
 with the case, having sent Him to Caiaphas <I>at once.</I> But the 
 words here literally are, "Annas sent Him [not '<I>had</I> sent Him'] 
 to Caiaphas"--and the "now" being of doubtful authority. Thus read, the 
 verse affords no evidence that He was sent to Caiaphas <I>before</I> 
 the interview just recorded, but implies rather the contrary. We take 
 this interview, then, with some of the ablest interpreters, to be a 
 preliminary and non-official one with <I>Annas,</I> at an hour of the 
 night when Caiaphas' Council could not convene; and one that ought not 
 to be confounded with that solemn one recorded by the other 
 Evangelists, when all were assembled and witnesses called. But <I>the 
 building in which both met with Jesus appears to have been the same, 
 the room only being different, and the court, of course, in that case,

 him, and this enabled him to identify Peter. "Sad reprisals!" [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>].
 The other Evangelists make his detection to turn upon his <I>dialect.</I> "After a while
 ['about the space of one hour after' 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:59">Lu 22:59</A>)]

 <B>the cock crew</B>--As Mark is the only Evangelist who tells us that our

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:30">Mr 14:30</A>),

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:72">Mr 14:72</A>).

 The other Evangelists, who tell us merely that our Lord predicted that
 "before the cock should crow he would deny Him thrice"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:34,Lu+22:34,Joh+13:38">Mt 26:34;
 Lu 22:34; 
 Joh 13:38</A>), 

 mention only <I>one actual</I> crowing, which was Mark's last. This is
 something affecting in this Evangelist--who, according to the earliest 
 tradition (confirmed by internal evidence), derived his materials so 
 largely from Peter as to have been styled his "<I>interpreter,</I>" 
 being the <I>only one</I> who gives both the sad prediction and its 
 still sadder fulfilment <I>in full.</I> It seems to show that Peter 
 himself not only retained through all his after-life the most vivid 
 recollection of the circumstances of his fall, but that he was willing 
 that others should know them too. The immediately <I>subsequent</I> 
 acts are given in full only in Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:61,62">Lu 22:61, 62</A>):

 "And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter," from the hall of judgment 
 to the court, in the way already explained. But who can tell what 
 lightning flashes of wounded love and piercing reproach shot from that 
 "look" through the eye of Peter into his heart! "And Peter remembered 
 the word of the Lord, how He had said unto him, Before the cock crow, 
 thou shalt deny Me thrice. And Peter went out and wept bitterly." How 
 different from the sequel of Judas' act! Doubtless the hearts of the 
 two men towards the Saviour were perfectly different from the first; 
 and the treason of Judas was but the consummation of the wretched man's 
 resistance of the blaze of light in the midst of which he had lived for 
 three years, while Peter's denial was but a momentary obscuration of 
 the heavenly light and love to his Master which ruled his life. But the 
 immediate cause of the revulsion, which made Peter "weep bitterly," 
 was, beyond all doubt, this heart-piercing "look" which his Lord gave 
 him. And remembering the Saviour's own words at the table, "Simon, 
 Simon, Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat, 
 <I>but I have prayed</I> [rather, 'I prayed'] <I>for thee that thy 
 faith fail not</I>" (see on

 <A HREF="JFB42.htm#Lu22_31">Lu 22:31, 32</A>),

 may we not say that <I>this prayer fetched down all that there was in
 that 'look'</I> to pierce and break the heart of. Peter, to keep it 
 from despair, to work in it "repentance unto salvation not to be 
 repented of," and at length, under other healing touches, to "restore 
 his soul?" (See on

 an <I>evening</I> meal, how ceremonial defilement contracted in the
 <I>morning</I> would unfit them for partaking of it, as after six o'clock it

 immense research and learned treatises. But as the usages of the Jews

 are among the not very important questions which probably will never be

 matter: As <I>they</I> state it, I cannot decide the point; tell me, then,

 <B>is my kingdom not from hence</B>--Our Lord only says whence His kingdom
 is <I>not</I>--first simply affirming it, next giving proof of it, then
 reaffirming it. This was all that Pilate had to do with. The <I>positive</I>
 nature of His kingdom He would not obtrude upon one who was as little
 able to comprehend it, as entitled officially to information about it.
 (It is worthy of notice that the "<FONT SIZE=-1>MY</FONT>," which occurs <I>four</I> times in

 <B>37. Art thou a king then?</B>--There was no sarcasm or disdain in this
 question (as T<FONT SIZE=-1>HOLUCK</FONT>,
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>, and others, allege), else our Lord's
 answer would have been different. Putting emphasis upon "<I>thou,</I>" his
 question betrays a mixture of <I>surprise</I> and <I>uneasiness,</I> partly at
 the possibility of there being, after all, something dangerous under the
 claim, and partly from a certain awe which our Lord's demeanor probably
 struck into him.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Thou sayest that I am a king</B>--It is even so.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>To this end was I</B>--"have I been."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>born and for this cause came I</B>--am I come.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>into the world, that I may bear witness to the truth</B>--His 
 <I>birth</I> expresses His manhood; His <I>coming into the world,</I> 
 His existence before assuming humanity: The truth, then, here affirmed, 
 though Pilate would catch little of it, was that <I>His Incarnation was 
 expressly in order to the assumption of Royalty in our nature.</I> Yet, 
 instead of saying, He came to be a King, which is His meaning, He says 
 He came to <I>testify to the truth.</I> Why this? Because, in such 
 circumstances it required a noble courage not to flinch from His royal 
 claims; and our Lord, <I>conscious that He was putting forth that 
 courage,</I> gives a turn to His confession expressive of it. It is to 
 this that Paul alludes, in those remarkable words to Timothy: "I charge 
 thee before God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus,
 who, <I>in the presence</I> of Pontius Pilate, witnessed <I>the good 
 confession</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:13">1Ti 6:13</A>).

 This one act of our Lord's life, His courageous witness-bearing before
 the governor, was selected as an encouraging example of the 
 <I>fidelity</I> which Timothy ought to display. As the Lord (says 
 O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT> beautifully) owned Himself <I>the Son of 
 God</I> before the most exalted theocratic council, so He confessed His 
 <I>regal dignity</I> in presence of the representative of the highest 
 political authority on earth.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice</B>--Our Lord here not
 only affirms that His word had in it a self-evidencing,
 self-recommending power, but gently insinuated the
 <I>true secret of the growth and grandeur of His kingdom</I>--as
 <FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT>
 K<FONT SIZE=-1>INGDOM OF TRUTH</FONT>,
 in its highest sense, into which all souls who have learned
 to live and count all things but loss for the truth are, by a most
 heavenly attraction, drawn as into their proper element;

 the question of questions, which the thoughtful of every age have asked,
 but never man yet answered."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>And when he had said this</B>--as if, by putting such a question, he was
 getting into interminable and unseasonable inquiries, when this business
 demanded rather prompt action.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he went out again unto the Jews</B>--thus missing a noble opportunity for
 himself, and giving utterance to that consciousness of the want of all
 intellectual and moral certainty, which was the feeling of every
 thoughtful mind at that time. "The only certainty," says the elder
 P<FONT SIZE=-1>LINY</FONT>, "is that nothing is certain, nor more miserable than man, nor
 more proud. The fearful laxity of morals at that time must doubtless be
 traced in a great degree to this skepticism. The revelation of the
 eternal truth alone was able to breathe new life into ruined human
 nature, and that in the apprehension of complete redemption"

 <B>I find in him no fault</B>--no crime. This so exasperated "the chief
 priests and elders" that, afraid of losing their prey, they poured forth
 a volley of charges against Him, as appears from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:4,5">Lu 23:4, 5</A>:

 on Pilate's affirming His innocence, "they were <I>the more fierce,</I> 
 saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, 
 beginning from Galilee to this place." They see no hope of getting 
 Pilate's sanction to His death unless they can fasten upon Him a charge 
 of conspiracy against the government; and as <I>Galilee</I> was noted 
 for its turbulence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:1,Ac+5:37">Lu 13:1;

 to give color to their charge. "And the chief priests accused Him of 
 <I>many things,</I> but He answered nothing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:3">Mr 15:3</A>).

 Then said Pilate unto Him, Hearest Thou not how many things they

 The return of the prisoner only deepened the perplexity of Pilate, who, 
 "calling together the chief priests, rulers, and people," tells them 
 plainly that not one of their charges against "this man" had been made 
 good, while even Herod, to whose jurisdiction he more naturally 
 belonged, had done nothing to Him: He "will therefore chastise and 
 release him"

 But Pilate thought he had yielded quite enough to them; and having
 intended expressly to spite and insult them by this title, for having
 got him to act against his own sense of justice, he peremptorily refused
 them. And thus, amidst the conflicting passions of men, was proclaimed,

 That a prediction so exceedingly specific--distinguishing one piece of
 dress from others, and announcing that while <I>those</I> should be 
 parted amongst several, <I>that</I> should be given by lot to one 
 person--that such a prediction should not only be fulfilled to the 
 letter, but by a party of heathen military, without interference from 
 either the friends of the enemies of the Crucified One, is surely 
 worthy to be ranked among the wonders of this all-wonderful scene. Now 
 come the <I>mockeries,</I> and from four different quarters:--(1) "And 
 <I>they that passed by</I> reviled Him, wagging their heads" in 
 ridicule

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:7,109:25">Ps 22:7; 109:25</A>;
 
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:16,La+2:15">Jer 18:16;
 La 2:15</A>). 

 "Ah!"--"Ha," an exclamation here of derision. "Thou that destroyest the
 temple, and buildest it in three days, save Thyself and come down from 
 the cross"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:39,40,Mk+15:29,30">Mt 27:39, 40;
 Mr 15:29, 30</A>). 

 "It is evident that our Lord's saying, or rather this <I>perversion</I>
 of it (for He claimed not to <I>destroy,</I> but to <I>rebuild</I> the 
 temple destroyed by them) had greatly exasperated the feeling which the 
 priests and Pharisees had contrived to excite against Him. It is 
 referred to as the principal fact brought out in evidence against Him 
 on the trial (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:13,14">Ac 6:13, 14</A>),

 as an offense for which He deserved to suffer. And it is very 
 remarkable that now <I>while it was receiving its real fulfilment,</I> 
 it should be made more public and more impressive by the insulting 
 proclamation of His enemies. Hence the importance attached to it after
 the resurrection,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:22">Joh 2:22</A>"

 [W<FONT SIZE=-1>EBSTER</FONT> and W<FONT SIZE=-1>ILKINSON</FONT>]. (2) 
 "Likewise also the <I>chief priests,</I> mocking Him, <I>with the 
 scribes and elders,</I> said, He saved others, Himself He cannot save"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:41,42">Mt 27:41, 42</A>).

 There was a deep truth in this, as in other taunts; for <I>both</I> He 
 could not do, having "come to give <I>His</I> life a ransom for 
 <I>many</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:28,Mk+10:45">Mt 20:28;
 Mr 10:45</A>). 

 No doubt this added an unknown sting to the reproach. "If He be the
 king of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will 
 believe Him"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:42">Mt 27:42</A>).

 <I>No, they would not;</I> for those who resisted the evidence from the 
 resurrection of Lazarus, and from His own resurrection, were beyond the 
 reach of any amount of merely <I>external</I> evidence. "He trusted in 
 God that He would deliver him; let Him deliver Him now if He will have 
 Him [or 'delight in Him,' compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:19,De+21:14">Ps 18:19;
 De 21:14</A>]; 
 
 for He said, I am the Son of God"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:41-43">Mt 27:41-43</A>).

 We thank you, O ye chief priests, scribes, and elders, for this triple 
 testimony, unconsciously borne by you, to our Christ: first to <I>His 
 habitual trust in God,</I> as a feature in His character so marked and 
 palpable that even ye found upon it your impotent taunt; next, <I>to 
 His identity with the Sufferer of the twenty-second Psalm,</I> whose 
 very words

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:8">Ps 22:8</A>)

 ye unwittingly appropriate, thus <I>serving yourselves heirs</I> to the 
 dark office and impotent malignity of Messiah's enemies; and again, to 
 the true sense of that august title which He took to Himself, "T<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>HE</FONT> S<FONT SIZE=-1>ON OF</FONT> G<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OD</FONT>," which He rightly interpreted at the very first (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:18">Joh 5:18</A>)

 as a claim to that <I>oneness of nature</I> with Him, and <I>dearness 
 to Him,</I> which a son has to his father. (3) "And <I>the soldiers</I> 
 also mocked Him, coming to Him and offering Him vinegar, and saying, If 
 thou be the king of the Jews, save Thyself"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:36,37">Lu 23:36, 37</A>).

 They insultingly offer to share with Him their own vinegar, or sour 
 wine, the usual drink of Roman soldiers, it being about the time of 
 their midday meal. In the taunt of the soldiers we have one of those 
 <I>undesigned coincidences</I> which so strikingly verify these 
 historical records. While the ecclesiastics deride Him for calling 
 Himself, "the <I>Christ,</I> the <I>King of Israel,</I> the 
 <I>Chosen,</I> the <I>Son of God,</I>" the soldiers, to whom all such 
 phraseology was mere Jewish jargon, make sport of Him as a pretender to 
 <I>royalty</I> ("<FONT SIZE=-1>KING</FONT> of the Jews"), an office and 
 dignity which it belonged to them to comprehend. "<I>The thieves</I> 
 also, which were crucified with Him, cast the same in His teeth"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:44,Mk+15:32">Mt 27:44;
 Mr 15:32</A>).

 Not <I>both</I> of them, however, as some commentators unnaturally
 think we must understand these words; as if some sudden change came 
 over the <I>penitent</I> one, which turned him from an unfeeling railer 
 into a trembling petitioner. The plural "thieves" need not denote more 
 than the <I>quarter</I> or <I>class</I> whence came this last and 
 cruelest taunt--that is, "Not only did scoffs proceed from the 
 <I>passers-by,</I> the <I>ecclesiastics,</I> the <I>soldiery,</I> but 
 even from His <I>fellow-sufferers,</I>" a mode of speaking which no one 
 would think necessarily meant both of them. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:20">Mt 2:20</A>,

 "<I>They</I> are dead which sought the child's life," meaning
 <I>Herod;</I> and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:1">Mr 9:1</A>,

 "There be <I>some</I> standing here," where it is next to certain that
 only John, the youngest and last survivor of the apostles, is meant. 
 And is it conceivable that this penitent thief should have first 
 himself reviled the Saviour, and then, on his views of Christ suddenly 
 changing, he should have turned upon his fellow sufferer and fellow 
 reviler, and rebuked him not only with dignified sharpness, but in the 
 language of <I>astonishment</I> that he should be capable of such 
 conduct? Besides, there is a deep calmness in all that he utters, 
 extremely unlike what we should expect from one who was the subject of 
 a mental revolution so sudden and total. On the scene itself, see on

 words!

 See on

 <A HREF="JFB40.htm#Mt13_55">Mt 13:55</A>. 

 Now occurred the supernatural <I>darkness,</I> recorded by all the 
 other Evangelists, but not here. "Now from the sixth hour (twelve 
 o'clock, noon) there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth 
 hour"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:45">Mt 27:45</A>).

 No ordinary eclipse of the sun could have occurred at this time, it 
 being then <I>full moon,</I> and this obscuration lasted about 
 <I>twelve times</I> the length of any ordinary eclipse. (Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:21,23">Ex 10:21, 23</A>).

 Beyond doubt, the divine intention of the portent was to invest this 
 darkest of all tragedies with a gloom expressive of its real character. 
 "And about the ninth hour Jesus cried, E<FONT SIZE=-1>LI</FONT>, E<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LI</FONT>, L<FONT SIZE=-1>AMA</FONT> S<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ABACHTHANI</FONT> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <I>My God, My God, why hast
 Thou forsaken Me?</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:46">Mt 27:46</A>).

 As the darkness commenced at the sixth hour, the second of the Jewish 
 hours of prayer, so it continued till the ninth hour, <I>the hour of 
 the evening sacrifice,</I> increasing probably in depth, and 
 <I>reaching its deepest gloom at the moment of this mysterious cry,</I> 
 when the flame of the one great "Evening Sacrifice" was burning 
 fiercest. The words were made to His hand. They are the opening words 
 of a Psalm

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:1">Ps 22:1</A>)

 full of the last "sufferings of Christ and the following glories"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:11">1Pe 1:11</A>).

 "F<FONT SIZE=-1>ATHER</FONT>," was the cry in the first prayer which He 
 uttered on the cross, for matters had not then come to the worst. 
 "Father" was the cry of His last prayer, for matters had then passed 
 their worst. But at this crisis of His sufferings, "Father" does not 
 issue from His lips, for the light of a Father's countenance was then 
 mysteriously eclipsed. He falls back, however, on a title expressive of 
 His <I>official</I> relation, which, though lower and more distant in 
 itself, yet when grasped in pure and naked faith was mighty in its 
 claims, and rich in psalmodic associations. And what deep earnestness 
 is conveyed by the redoubling of this title! But as for the cry itself, 
 it will never be fully comprehended. An absolute desertion is not 
 indeed to be thought of; but a total eclipse of the <I>felt</I> sense 
 of God's presence it certainly expresses. It expre'sses 
 <I>surprise,</I> as under the experience of something not only <I>never 
 before known,</I> but <I>inexplicable</I> on the footing which had till 
 then subsisted between Him and God. <I>It is a question which the lost
 cannot utter.</I> They are forsaken, but they know why. Jesus is 
 forsaken, but <I>does not know and demands to know why.</I> It is thus 
 <I>the cry of conscious innocence, but of innocence</I> unavailing to 
 draw down, at that moment, the least token of approval from the unseen 
 Judge--innocence whose only recognition at that moment lay in the thick 
 surrounding gloom which but reflected the horror of great darkness that 
 invested His own spirit. <I>There was indeed a cause for it,</I> and He 
 knew it too--the "why" must not be pressed so far as to exclude this.
 <I>He must taste this bitterest of the wages of sin</I> "<I>who did no 
 sin</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:22">1Pe 2:22</A>).

 But that is not the point now. In Him there was no cause at all

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:30">Joh 14:30</A>)

 and He takes refuge in the glorious fact. When no ray from above
 shines in upon Him, He strikes a light out of His own breast. If God 
 will not own Him, He shall own Himself. On the rock of His unsullied 
 allegiance to Heaven He will stand, till the light of Heaven returns to 
 His spirit. And it is near to come. While He is yet speaking, the 
 fierceness of the flame is beginning to abate. One incident and insult 
 more, and the experience of one other predicted element of suffering, 
 and the victory is His. The incident, and the insult springing out of 
 it, is the misunderstanding of the cry, for we can hardly suppose that 
 it was anything else. "Some of them that stood there, when they heard 
 that, said, This man calleth for Elias"

 state of His frame occasioned

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>hyssop, and put it to his mouth</B>--Though a stalk of this plant does
 not exceed eighteen inches in length, it would suffice, as the feet of
 crucified persons were not raised high. "The rest said, Let be"--[that
 is, as would seem, 'Stop that officious service'] "let us see whether
 Elias will come to save Him" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:49">Mt 27:49</A>).

 This was the last cruelty He was to suffer, but it was one of the most 
 unfeeling. "And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:46">Lu 23:46</A>).

 This "<I>loud voice,</I>" noticed by three of the Evangelists, does not 
 imply, as some able interpreters contend, that our Lord's strength was 
 so far from being exhausted that He needed not to die then, and 
 surrendered up His life sooner than Nature required, merely because it 
 was the appointed time. It was indeed the appointed time, but time
 that He should be "crucified <I>through weakness</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:4">1Co 13:4</A>),

 and Nature was now reaching its utmost exhaustion. But just as even His 
 own dying saints, particularly the martyrs of Jesus, have sometimes had 
 such gleams of coming glory immediately before breathing their last, as 
 to impart to them a strength to utter their feelings which has amazed 
 the by-standers, so this <I>mighty voice</I> of the expiring Redeemer 
 was nothing else but the exultant spirit of the Dying Victor, receiving 
 the fruit of His travail just about to be embraced, and nerving the 
 organs of utterance to an ecstatic expression of its sublime feelings 
 (not so much in the <I>immediately</I> following words of tranquil 
 surrender, in Luke, as in the <I>final</I> shout, recorded only by 
 John): "F<FONT SIZE=-1>ATHER, INTO</FONT> T<FONT SIZE=-1>HY 
 HANDS</FONT> I <FONT SIZE=-1>COMMEND</FONT> M<FONT SIZE=-1>Y 
 SPIRIT</FONT>!"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:46">Lu 23:46</A>).

 Yes, the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth. His soul has 
 emerged from its mysterious horrors; "<I>My God</I>" is heard no more, 
 but in unclouded light He yields sublime into His <I>Father's</I> hands 
 the infinitely precious spirit--using here also the words of those 
 matchless Psalms

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:5">Ps 31:5</A>)

 which were ever on His lips. "As the Father receives the spirit of

 but is intended to call attention both to the fulfilment of Scripture 
 in these particulars, and to the undeniable evidence he was thus 
 furnishing of the <I>reality</I> of Christ's death, and consequently of 
 His resurrection; perhaps also to meet the growing tendency, in the 
 Asiatic churches, to deny the reality of our Lord's body, or that

 ordinance, we shall, on searching deeper, see in it
 <I>a remarkable divine interposition to protect the sacred body of Christ
 from the last indignity after He had finished the work given Him to do.</I>
 Every
 imaginable indignity had been permitted <I>before that,</I> up to the
 moment of His death. But no sooner is that over than an Unseen hand is
 found to have provided against the clubs of the rude soldiers coming in
 contact with that temple of the Godhead. Very different from such
 violence was that <I>spear-thrust,</I> for which not only doubting Thomas
 would thank the soldier, but intelligent believers in every age, to
 whom the certainty of their Lord's death and resurrection is the life

 Zechariah means to <I>thrust through</I> with spear, javelin, sword, or 
 any such weapon. In that sense it is used in all the ten places, 
 besides this, where it is found. How suitable this was to express the 
 action of the Roman soldier, is manifest; and our Evangelist uses the 
 exactly corresponding word, which the <I>Septuagint</I> certainly does 
 not. Very <I>different is the other word</I> for "<I>pierce</I>" in

 this required. The act would without doubt identify him <I>for the

 is, that one who while Jesus was yet alive merely refrained from 
 condemning Him, not having the courage to espouse His cause by one 
 positive act, should, now that He was dead, and His cause apparently 
 dead with Him, summon up courage to go in personally to the Roman 
 governor and ask permission to take down and inter the body. But if 
 this be the first instance, it is not the last, that <I>a seemingly 
 dead Christ has wakened a sympathy which a living one had failed to 
 evoke. The heroism of faith is usually kindled by desperate 
 circumstances, and is not seldom displayed by those who before were the
 most timid, and scarce known as disciples at all.</I> "And Pilate

 --Pilate could hardly credit what Joseph had told him, that He had been
 dead "some time," and, before giving up the body to His friends, would 
 learn how the fact stood from the centurion, whose business it was to 
 oversee the execution. "And when he knew it of the centurion"

 body to Joseph"; struck, possibly, with the rank of the petitioner and
 the dignified boldness of the petition, in contrast with the spirit of
 the other party and the low rank to which he had been led to believe all
 the followers of Christ belonged. Nor would he be unwilling to Show that
 he was not going to carry this black affair any farther. But, whatever
 were Pilate's motives, two most blessed objects were thus secured: (1)
 <I>The reality of our Lords death was attested</I> by the party of all
 others most competent to decide on it, and certainly free from all
 bias--the officer in attendance--in full reliance on whose testimony
 Pilate surrendered the body: (2) The dead Redeemer, thus delivered out
 of the hands of His enemies, and committed by the supreme political
 authority to the care of His friends, was thereby protected from all
 further indignities; a thing most befitting indeed, now that His work
 was done, but impossible, so far as we can see, if His enemies had been
 at liberty to do with Him as they pleased. How wonderful are even the
 minutest features of this matchless History!</P>

 one could conceive them mistaken, could anyone have lain thus enveloped 
 for the period during which He was in the grave, and life still

 <I>their</I> part, dictated by the double circumstance that it was so near
 at hand, and by its belonging to a friend of the Lord; and as there was
 need of haste, even they would be struck with the providence which thus
 supplied it. "There laid they Jesus therefore, because of the Jew's
 preparation day, for the sepulchre was nigh at hand." But there was one
 recommendation of it which probably would not strike them; but God had
 it in view. Not its being "hewn out of a rock"

 eyes. The younger disciple outruns the older; love haply supplying

 <B>Except I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my linger 
 into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will 
 not believe</B>--The very form of this speech betokens the strength of 
 the unbelief. "It is not, <I>If I shall see I shall believe,</I> but, 
 <I>Unless I shall see I will not believe;</I> nor does he expect to 
 see, although the others tell him they had" [B<FONT

 "He upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because

 whence sprang this pertinacity of resistance in <I>such</I> minds? Not 
 certainly from reluctance to believe, but as in Nathanael (see on

 <B>11. Peter went up</B>--into the boat; went aboard.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty
 and three; and for all there were so many, yet was not the net
 broken</B>--The manifest reference here to the former miraculous draught

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:1-11">Lu 5:1-11</A>)

 furnishes the key to this scene. There the draught was 
 <I>symbolical</I> of the success of their future ministry: While "Peter 
 and all that were with him were astonished at the draught of the fishes 
 which they had taken, Jesus said unto him, Fear not, from henceforth 
 thou shalt catch men." Nay, when first called, in the act of "casting 
 their net into the sea, for they were fishers," the same 
 <I>symbolic</I> reference was made to their secular occupation: "Follow 
 Me, and I will make you fishers of men"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:18,19">Mt 4:18, 19</A>).

 Here, then, if but the same symbolic reference be kept in view, the 
 design of the whole scene will, we think, be clear. The 
 <I>multitude</I> and the <I>size</I> of the fishes <I>they</I> caught 
 symbolically foreshadowed the vast success of their now fast 
 approaching ministry, and this only as a beginning of successive 
 draughts, through the agency of a Christian ministry, till, "as the 
 waters cover the sea, the earth should be full of the knowledge of the 
 Lord." And whereas, at the first miraculous draught, the net "was 
 breaking" through the weight of what it contained--expressive of <I>the 
 difficulty with which, after they had 'caught men,' they would be able 
 to retain, or keep them from escaping back into the world</I>--while 
 here, "for all they were so many, yet was not the net broken," are we 
 not reminded of such sayings as these

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:28">Joh 10:28</A>):

 "I give unto My sheep eternal life, and they shall never perish, 
 neither shall any pluck them out of My hand" [L<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>UTHARDT</FONT>]? But it is not through the agency of a 
 Christian ministry that all true disciples are gathered. Jesus Himself, 
 by unseen methods, gathers some, who afterwards are recognized by the 
 constituted fishers of men, and mingle with the fruit of their labors. 
 And are not these symbolized by that portion of our Galilean repast 
 which the fishers found, in some unseen way, made ready to their 
 hand?</P>

 more confirmed; and on <I>theirs,</I> from reverential shrinking to speak

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:33">Mt 26:33</A>),

 and intending by this allusion to bring the whole scene vividly before 
 his mind and put him to shame.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee</B>--He adds not, "more than
 these," but prefixes a touching appeal to the Saviour's own omniscience
 for the truth of his protestation, which makes it a totally different
 kind of speech from his former.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>He saith unto him, Feed my lambs</B>--It is surely wrong to view this
 term as a mere diminutive of affection, and as meaning the same thing as
 "the sheep" [W<FONT SIZE=-1>EBSTER</FONT> and
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>ILKINSON</FONT>]. It is much more according to usage
 to understand by the "lambs," <I>young and tender</I> disciples, whether in
 age or Christian standing

 and by the "sheep" the more <I>mature.</I> Shall we say (with many)
 that Peter was here reinstated in office? Not exactly, since he was not 
 actually excluded from it. But after such conduct as his, the deep 
 wound which the honor of Christ had received, the stain brought on his 
 office, the damage done to his high standing among his brethren, and 
 even his own comfort, in prospect of the great work before him, 
 required some such renewal of his call and re-establishment of his 
 position as this.</P>

 <A NAME="Joh21_16"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>16. He saith to him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the second time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
 lovest thou me,</B>
 &c.--In this repetition of the question, though the wound was meant to
 be reopened, the words "<I>more than these</I>" are not repeated; for
 Christ is a <I>tender</I> as well as <I>skilful</I> Physician, and Peter's
 silence on that point was confession enough of his sin and folly. On
 Peter's repeating his protestation in the same words, our Lord rises
 higher in the manifestation of His restoring grace.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Feed</B>--keep.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>my sheep</B>--It has been observed that the word here is studiously
 changed, from one signifying simply to <I>feed,</I> to one signifying to
 <I>tend</I> as a shepherd, denoting the <I>abiding</I> exercise of that
 vocation, and in its highest functions.</P>

 <A NAME="Joh21_17"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>17. He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou
 me? Peter was grieved because he said the <I>third</I> time,</B> &c.--This
 was the Physician's deepest incision into the wound, while yet smarting
 under the two former probings. Not till now would Peter discern the
 object of this succession of thrusts. The third time reveals it all,
 bringing up such a rush of dreadful recollections before his view, of
 his "<I>thrice</I> denying that he knew Him," that he feels it to the
 quick. It was fitting that he should; it was meant that he should. But
 this accomplished, the painful dialogue concludes with a delightful
 "Feed My sheep"; as if He should say, "Now, Simon, the last speck of the
 cloud which overhung thee since that night of nights is dispelled:
 Henceforth thou art to Me and to My work as if no such scene had ever
 happened."</P>

 <A NAME="Joh21_18"> </A>

 the verge of old age.

 <B>thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest</B>--wast thine
 own master.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>when .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. old thou shalt stretch forth thine hands</B>--to be bound for
 execution, though not necessarily meaning <I>on a cross.</I> There is no
 reason, however, to doubt the very early tradition that Peter's death
 was by crucifixion.</P>

 <A NAME="Joh21_19"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>19. This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God</B>--not,
 therefore, a mere prediction of the manner of his <I>death,</I> but of the
 <I>honor</I> to be conferred upon him by dying for his Master. And, indeed,
 beyond doubt, this prediction was intended to follow up his triple
 restoration:--"Yes, Simon, thou shall not only feed My lambs, and feed
 My sheep, but after a long career of such service, shalt be counted
 worthy to die for the name of the Lord Jesus."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me</B>--By thus
 connecting the utterance of this prediction with the invitation to
 follow Him, the Evangelist would indicate the deeper sense in which the
 call was understood, not merely to go along with Him at that moment, but
 to come after Him, "<I>taking up his cross.</I>"</P>

 <A NAME="Joh21_20"> </A>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on
 Jesus' breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth
 thee?</B>--The Evangelist makes these allusions to the peculiar
 familiarity to which he had been admitted on the most memorable of all
 occasions, perhaps lovingly to account for Peter's somewhat forward
 question about him to Jesus; which is the rather probable, as it was at
 Peter's suggestion that he put the question about the traitor which he
 here recalls

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>22, 23. Jesus saith to him, If I will that he tarry fill I come, what
 is that to thee? follow thou me</B>--From the fact that John alone of the
 Twelve survived the destruction of Jerusalem, and so witnessed the
 commencement of that series of events which belongs to "the last days,"
 many good interpreters think that this is a virtual prediction of fact,
 and not a mere supposition. But this is very doubtful, and it seems
 more natural to consider our Lord as intending to give
 <I>no positive indication</I> of John's fate at all, but to signify that
 this was a matter which belonged to the Master of both, who would
 disclose or conceal it as He thought proper, and that Peter's part was
 to mind his own affairs. Accordingly, in "follow thou Me," the word
 "<I>thou</I>" is emphatic. Observe the absolute disposal of human life
 which Christ claims: "<I>If I will</I> that he tarry till I come," &c.</P>

 <A NAME="Joh21_23"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>23. Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple
 should not die</B>--into which they the more easily fell from the prevalent
 expectation that Christ's second coming was then near at hand.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die</B>--The Evangelist is
 jealous for His Master's honor, which his death might be thought to
 compromise if such a misunderstanding should not be corrected.</P>

 <B>24. This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote
 these things</B>--thus identifying the author of this book with all that
 it says of this disciple.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>we know that his testimony is
 true</B>--(Compare

 <B>25. And there are many other things which Jesus did</B>--(Compare

 <B>if .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. written every one, I suppose</B>--an expression used to show

 <B>even the world itself would not hold the books,</B> &c.--not a <I>mere</I>
 hyperbolical expression, unlike the sublime simplicity of this writer,
 but intended to let his reader know that, even now that he had done, he
 felt his materials so far from being exhausted, that he was still
 running over, and could multiply "Gospels" to almost any extent within
 the strict limits of what "Jesus did." But in the <I>limitation</I> of
 these matchless histories, in point of number, there is as much of that
 divine wisdom which has presided over and pervades the living oracles,
 as in their <I>variety</I> and <I>fulness.</I></P>
