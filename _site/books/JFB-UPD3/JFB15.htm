 <B>1. in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia</B>--The Persian empire,
 including Persia, Media, Babylonia, and Chaldea, with many smaller
 dependencies, was founded by Cyrus, 536 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT> [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ALES</FONT>].

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:12,29:10">Jer 25:12; 29:10</A>).

 This reference is a parenthetic statement of the historian, and did
 not form part of the proclamation.</P>

 <B>2. The Lord God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the
 earth</B>--Though this is in the Oriental style of hyperbole (see also
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:1">Da 4:1</A>),

 it was literally true that the Persian empire was the greatest ruling 
 power in the world at that time.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem</B>--The phraseology
 of this proclamation, independently of the express testimony of
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>,
 affords indisputable evidence that Cyrus had seen (probably
 through means of Daniel, his venerable prime minister and favorite)
 those prophecies in which, two hundred years before he was born, his
 name, his victorious career, and the important services he should
 render to the Jews were distinctly foretold 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:28,46:1-4">Isa 44:28; 46:1-4</A>).

 The existence of predictions so remarkable led him to acknowledge that
 all his kingdoms were gifts bestowed on him by "the Lord God of 
 heaven," and prompted him to fulfil the duty which had been laid upon 
 him long before his birth. This was the source and origin of the great 
 favor he showed to the Jews. The proclamation, though issued "in the 
 first year of Cyrus"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:1">Ezr 1:1</A>],
 
 did not take effect till the year following.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. Who is there among you of all his people</B>--The purport of the edict
 was to grant full permission to those Jewish exiles, in every part of
 his kingdom, who chose, to return to their own country, as well as to
 recommend those of their countrymen who remained to aid the poor and
 feeble on their way, and contribute liberally towards the rebuilding of
 the temple.</P>

 ecclesiastical chiefs of the later captivity, those of the tribes of
 Judah and Benjamin, with some also from other tribes 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:3">1Ch 9:3</A>),

 who retained their attachment to the pure worship of God, naturally 
 took the lead in this movement. Their example was followed by all whose 
 piety and patriotism were strong enough to brave the various 
 discouragements attending the enterprise. They were liberally assisted 
 by multitudes of their captive countrymen, who, born in Babylonia or 
 comfortably established in it by family connections or the possession 
 of property, chose to remain. It seems that their Assyrian friends and 
 neighbors, too, either from a favorable disposition toward the Jewish 
 faith, or from imitation of the court policy, displayed hearty good 
 will and great liberality in aiding and promoting the views of the 
 emigrants.</P>

 Lord</B>--Though it is said 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:13">2Ki 24:13</A>)

 that these were <I>cut in pieces,</I> that would not be done to the 
 large and magnificent vases; and, if they had been divided, the parts 
 could be reunited. But it may be doubted whether the <I>Hebrew</I> word 
 rendered <I>cut in pieces,</I> does not signify merely <I>cut off,</I> 
 that is, from further use in the temple.</P>

 <B>8. Shesh-bazzar, the prince of Judah</B>--that is, Zerubbabel, son of
 Salathiel (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:8,5:16">Ezr 3:8; 5:16</A>).

 He was born in Babylon, and called by his family Zerubbabel, that is,
 stranger or exile in Babylon.  Shesh-bazzar, signifying 
 "fire-worshipper," was the name given him at court, as other names were 
 given to Daniel and his friends. He was recognized among the exiles as 
 hereditary prince of Judah.</P>

 hundred</B>--The vessels here specified amount only to the number of 2499.
 Hence it is probable that the larger vases only are mentioned, while
 the inventory of the whole, including great and small, came to the
 gross sum stated in the text.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto
 Jerusalem</B>--All the Jewish exiles did not embrace the privilege which
 the Persian king granted them. The great proportion, born in Babylon,
 preferred continuing in their comfortable homes to undertaking a
 distant, expensive, and hazardous journey to a desolate land. Nor did
 the returning exiles all go at once. The first band went with
 Zerubbabel, others afterwards with Ezra, and a large number with
 Nehemiah at a still later period.</P>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:8">Ezr 5:8</A>),

 so called as being now reduced from an illustrious, independent, and 
 powerful kingdom to an obscure, servile, tributary province of the 
 Persian empire. This name is applied by the sacred historian to 
 intimate that the Jewish exiles, though now released from captivity and 
 allowed to return into their own land, were still the subjects of 
 Cyrus, inhabiting a province dependent upon Persia.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>came again unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one unto his city</B>--either
 the city that had been occupied by his ancestors, or, as most parts of
 Judea were then either desolate or possessed by others, the city that
 was rebuilt and allotted to him now.</P>

 <B>2. Which came with Zerubbabel</B>--He was the chief or leader of the first
 band of returning exiles. The names of other influential persons who
 were associated in the conducting of the caravans are also mentioned,
 being extracted probably from the Persian archives, in which the
 register was preserved: conspicuous in the number are Jeshua, the high
 priest, and Nehemiah.</P>

 to have been only six hundred fifty-two. It is probable that all 
 mentioned as belonging to this family repaired to the general place of 
 rendezvous, or had enrolled their names at first as intending to go; 
 but in the interval of preparation, some died, others were prevented by 
 sickness or insurmountable obstacles, so that ultimately no more than 
 six hundred fifty-two came to Jerusalem.</P>

 <B>23. The men of Anathoth</B>--It is pleasant to see so many of this Jewish
 town returning. It was a city of the Levites; but the people spurned
 Jeremiah's warning and called forth against themselves one of his
 severest predictions 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:27-35">Jer 32:27-35</A>).

 This prophecy was fulfilled in the Assyrian conquest. Anathoth was laid 
 waste and continued a heap of ruins. But the people, having been 
 brought during the captivity to a better state of mind, returned, and 
 their city was rebuilt.</P>

 <B>36-39. The priests</B>--Each of their families was ranged under its prince
 or head, like those of the other tribes. It will be remembered that the
 whole body was divided into twenty-four courses, one of which, in
 rotation, discharged the sacerdotal duties every week, and each
 division was called after the name of its first prince or chief. It
 appears from this passage that only four of the courses of the priests
 returned from the Babylonish captivity; but these four courses were
 afterwards, as the families increased, divided into twenty-four, which
 were distinguished by the names of the original courses appointed by
 David 

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:6-13">1Ch 23:6-13</A>].

 <B>61, 62. the children of Barzillai</B>--He preferred that name to that of
 his own family, deeming it a greater distinction to be connected with
 so noble a family, than to be of the house of Levi. But by this worldly
 ambition he forfeited the dignity and advantages of the priesthood.</P>

 equivalent to "your severity," "your awfulness."</P>

 <B>64. The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three
 hundred and threescore</B>--This gross amount is twelve thousand more
 than the particular numbers given in the catalogue, when added
 together, come to. Reckoning up the smaller numbers, we shall find that
 they amount to 29,818 in this chapter, and to 31,089 in the parallel
 chapter of Nehemiah
 [see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:66-69">Ne 7:66-69</A>].

 Ezra also mentions four hundred ninety-four persons omitted by 
 Nehemiah, and Nehemiah mentions 1765 not noticed by Ezra. If, 
 therefore, Ezra's surplus be added to the sum in Nehemiah, and 
 Nehemiah's surplus to the number in Ezra, they will both become 31,583. 
 Subtracting this from 42,360, there will be a deficiency of 10,777. 
 These are omitted because they did not belong to Judah and Benjamin, or 
 to the priests, but to the other tribes. The servants and singers, male 
 and female, are reckoned separately

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:65">Ezr 2:65</A>),

 so that putting all these items together, the number of all who went

 established notions and customs of the East.</P>

 <B>1. when the seventh month was come</B>--The departure of the returning
 exiles from Babylon took place in the spring. For some time after their
 arrival they were occupied in the necessary work of rearing habitations
 to themselves amid the ruins of Jerusalem and its neighborhood. This
 preliminary work being completed, they addressed themselves to rebuild
 the altar of burnt offering. As the seventh month of the sacred year
 was at hand--corresponding to the latter end of our September--when the
 feast of tabernacles 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:34">Le 23:34</A>)

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings
 thereon</B>--This was of urgent and immediate necessity, in order,

 work.</P>

 wept with a loud voice</B>--Those painful emotions were excited by the sad
 contrast between the prosperous circumstances in which the foundations
 of the first temple had been laid and the desolate, reduced state of
 the country and city when the second was begun; between the inferior
 size and less costliness of the stones used in the foundations of the
 second

 appurtenances of the building

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:3">Hag 2:3</A>);
 
 between the comparative smallness of their present means and the
 immense resources of David and Solomon. Perhaps, however, the chief
 cause of grief was that the second temple would be destitute of those
 things which formed the great and distinguishing glory of the first;
 namely, the ark, the shekinah, the Urim and Thummim, &c. Not that this
 second temple was not a very grand and beautiful structure. But no
 matter how great its material splendor was, it was inferior in this
 respect to that of Solomon. Yet the glory of the second far outshone
 that of the first temple in another and more important point of view,
 namely, the receiving within its walls the incarnate Saviour

 <B>2. we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the
 days of Esar-haddon .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which brought us up hither</B>--A very
 interesting explanation of this passage has been recently obtained from
 the Assyrian sculptures. On a large cylinder, deposited in the British
 Museum, there is inscribed a long and perfect copy of the annals of
 Esar-haddon, in which the details are given of a large deportation of
 Israelites from Palestine, and a consequent settlement of Babylonian
 colonists in their place. It is a striking confirmation of the
 statement made in this passage. Those Assyrian settlers intermarried
 with the remnant of Israelite women, and their descendants, a mongrel
 race, went under the name of Samaritans. Though originally idolaters,
 they were instructed in the knowledge of God, so that they could say,
 "We seek your God"; but they served Him in a superstitious way of their
 own (see on

 the Samaritans, from whatever motives it sprang, was overruled by
 Providence for ultimate good; for, had the two peoples worked together,
 familiar acquaintanceship and intermarriage would have ensued, and the
 result might have been a relapse of the Jews into idolatry. Most
 certainly, confusion and obscurity in the genealogical evidence that
 proved the descent of the Messiah would have followed; whereas, in
 their hostile and separate condition, they were jealous observers of
 each other's proceedings, watching with mutual care over the
 preservation and integrity of the sacred books, guarding the purity and
 honor of the Mosaic worship, and thus contributing to the maintenance
 of religious knowledge and truth.</P>

 by every means to molest the workmen as well as obstruct the progress
 of the building; and, though they could not alter the decree which
 Cyrus had issued regarding it, yet by bribes and clandestine arts
 indefatigably plied at court, they labored to frustrate the effects of
 the edict. Their success in those underhand dealings was great; for
 Cyrus, being frequently absent and much absorbed in his warlike
 expeditions, left the government in the hands of his son Cambyses, a
 wicked prince, and extremely hostile to the Jews and their religion.
 The same arts were assiduously practised during the reign of his
 successor, Smerdis, down to the time of Darius Hystaspes. In
 consequence of the difficulties and obstacles thus interposed, for a
 period of twenty years, the progress of the work was very slow.</P>

 <B>1. Then the prophets .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. prophesied .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the name of the God of
 Israel</B>--From the recorded writings of Haggai and Zechariah, it appears
 that the difficulties experienced and the many obstacles thrown in the
 way had first cooled the zeal of the Jews in the building of the
 temple, and then led to an abandonment of the work, under a pretended
 belief that the time for rebuilding it had not yet come 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:2-11">Hag 1:2-11</A>).
 
 For fifteen years the work was completely suspended. These two prophets
 upbraided them with severe reproaches for their sloth, negligence, and
 worldly selfishness 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:4">Hag 1:4</A>),

 promised that they would be blessed with great national prosperity if

 <B>3, 4. At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side 
 the river</B>--The Persian empire west of the Euphrates included at 
 this time Syria, Arabia, Egypt, Ph&oelig;nicia, and other provinces 
 subject to Darius. The empire was divided into twenty provinces, called 
 satrapies. Syria formed one satrapy, inclusive of Palestine,
 Ph&oelig;nicia, and Cyprus, and furnished an annual revenue of three 
 hundred fifty talents. It was presided over by a satrap or viceroy, who 
 at this time resided at Damascus. Though superior to the native 
 governors of the Jews appointed by the Persian king, he never 
 interfered with their internal government except when there was a 
 threatened disturbance of order and tranquillity. Tatnai, the governor 
 (whether this was a personal name or an official title is unknown), had 
 probably been incited by the complaints and turbulent outrages of the 
 Samaritans against the Jews; but he suspended his judgment, and he 
 prudently resolved to repair to Jerusalem, that he might ascertain the 
 real state of matters by personal inspection and enquiry, in company 
 with another dignified officer and his provincial council.</P>

 <B>5-17. But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews,</B>
 &c.--The unusual presence, the imposing suite, the authoritative
 enquiries of the satrap appeared formidable, and might have produced a
 paralyzing influence or led to disastrous consequences, if he had been
 a partial and corrupt judge or actuated by unfriendly feelings towards
 the Jewish cause. The historian, therefore, with characteristic piety,
 throws in this parenthetical verse to intimate that God averted the
 threatening cloud and procured favor for the elders or leaders of the
 Jews, that they were not interrupted in their proceedings till
 communications with the court should be made and received. Not a word
 was uttered to dispirit the Jews or afford cause of triumph to their
 opponents. Matters were to go on till contrary orders arrived from
 Babylon. After surveying the work in progress, he inquired: first, by
 what authority this national temple was undertaken; and, secondly, the
 names of the principal promoters and directors of the undertaking. To
 these two heads of enquiry the Jews returned ready and distinct
 replies. Then having learned that it originated in a decree of Cyrus,
 who had not only released the Jewish exiles from captivity and
 permitted them to return to their own land for the express purpose of
 rebuilding the house of God, but, by an act of royal grace, had
 restored to them the sacred vessels which Nebuchadnezzar had carried
 off as trophies from the former temple, Tatnai transmitted all this
 information in an official report to his imperial master, accompanying
 it with a recommendatory suggestion that search should be made among
 the national archives at Babylon for the original decree of Cyrus, that
 the truth of the Jews' statement might be verified. The whole conduct
 of Tatnai, as well as the general tone of his despatch, is marked by a
 sound discretion and prudent moderation, free from any party bias, and
 evincing a desire only to do his duty. In all respects he appears in
 favorable contrast with his predecessor, Rehum

 stoppage as a temporary interruption, or supposing that the Jews were
 always working a little, as they had means and opportunities.</P>

 <B>1. Darius the king</B>--This was Darius Hystaspes. Great and interesting

 inscriptions on the rocks at Behistun.

 be obtained from the discoveries at Nineveh. Two small chambers were
 discovered in the palace of Koyunjik, which, from the fragments found
 in them, M<FONT SIZE=-1>R.</FONT>
 L<FONT SIZE=-1>AYARD</FONT> considers "as a house of the rolls." After
 reminding his readers that the historical records and public documents
 of the Assyrians were kept on tablets and cylinders of baked clay, many
 specimens of which have been found, he goes on to say, "The chambers I
 am describing appear to have been a depository in the palace of Nineveh
 for such documents. To the height of a foot or more from the floor they
 were entirely filled with them; some entire, but the greater part
 broken into many fragments, probably by the falling in of the upper
 part of the building. They were of different sizes; the largest tablets
 were flat, and measured about nine inches by six and a half inches; the
 smaller were slightly convex, and some were not more than an inch long,
 with but one or two lines of writing. The cuneiform characters on most
 of them were singularly sharp and well-defined, but so minute in some
 instances as to be almost illegible without a magnifying glass. These
 documents appear to be of various kinds. The documents that have thus
 been discovered in the house of rolls' at Nineveh probably exceed all
 that have yet been afforded by the monuments of Egypt, and when the
 innumerable fragments are put together and transcribed, the publication
 of these records will be of the greatest importance to the history of

 A period of one hundred thirty years had elapsed between that 
 catastrophe and the journey of Ezra to Jerusalem. As a grandson of 
 Seraiah, namely, Jeshua, who held the office of high priest, had 
 accompanied Zerubbabel in the first caravan of returning exiles, Ezra 
 must have been in all probability a grandson, descended, too, from a 
 younger son, the older branch being in possession of the 
 pontificate.</P>

 and in all that related to the civil and ecclesiastical polity and

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>11. this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave</B>--The
 measure which this document authorized, and the remarkable interest in
 the Jews displayed in it, were most probably owing to the influence of
 Esther, who is thought to have been raised to the high position of
 queen a few months previous to the departure of Ezra
 [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ALES</FONT>]. According
 to others, who adopt a different chronology, it was more probably
 pressed upon the attention of the Persian court by Ezra, who, like
 Daniel, showed the prophecies to the king; or by some leading Jews on
 his accession, who, seeing the unsettled and disordered state of the
 colony after the deaths of Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Haggai, and Zechariah,
 recommended the appointment of a commission to reform abuses, suppress
 disorder, and enforce the observance of the law.</P>

 <A NAME="Ezr7_12"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>12. Artaxerxes, king of kings</B>--That title might have been assumed as,
 with literal truth, applicable to him, since many of the tributary
 princes of his empire still retained the name and authority of kings.
 But it was a probably a mere Orientalism, denoting a great and powerful
 prince, as the heaven of heavens signified the highest heaven, and
 vanity of vanities, the greatest vanity. This vainglorious title was
 assumed by the kings of Assyria, from whom it passed to the sovereigns
 of Persia.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven</B>--The
 appointment of Ezra to this influential mission was of the highest
 importance to the Hebrew people, as a large proportion of them were
 become, in a great measure, strangers both to the language and the
 institutions of their forefathers.</P>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:10,14">Es 1:10, 14</A>).

 The document describes, with great clearness and precision, the nature 
 of Ezra's commission and the extent of power and prerogatives with 
 which he was invested. It gave him authority, in the first place, to 
 organize the colony in Judea and institute a regular government, 
 according to the laws of the Hebrew people, and by magistrates and 
 rulers of their own nation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:25,26">Ezr 7:25, 26</A>),

 with power to punish offenders by fines, imprisonment, exile, or death, 
 according to the degree of their criminality. Secondly, he was 
 empowered to carry a large donation in money, partly from the royal 
 treasury and partly raised by voluntary contributions among his 
 countrymen, to create a fund out of which to make suitable provision 
 for maintaining the regular worship of God in Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:16,17">Ezr 7:16, 17</A>).

 Thirdly, the Persian officers in Syria were commanded to afford him 
 every assistance by gifts of money within a certain specified limit, in 
 carrying out the objects of his patriotic mission

 the rate of the silver talent of Babylon. Fourthly, Artaxerxes gave his
 royal sanction in the establishment of the divine law, which exempted
 priests and Levites from taxation or tribute and confirmed to them the
 exclusive right to officiate in the sacred services of the sanctuary.
 And, finally, in the expression of the king's desire for the divine
 blessing upon the king and his government 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:23">Ezr 7:23</A>),

 we see the strong persuasion which pervaded the Persian court, and had 
 been produced by the captivity of the Hebrew people, as to the being 
 and directing providence of the God they worshipped. It will be 
 observed, however, that the commission related exclusively to the 
 rebuilding of the temple--not of the walls. The Samaritans

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:20-22">Ezr 4:20-22</A>)

 had succeeded in alarming the Persian court by their representations of

 turbulent character of its inhabitants and the prowess of its 
 kings.</P>

 river has not been ascertained. It is probable that the Ahava was one
 of the streams or numerous canals of Mesopotamia communicating with the
 Euphrates [<I>Cyclop&aelig;dia of Biblical Literature</I>]. But it was certainly in
 Babylonia on the banks of that stream; and perhaps the place appointed
 for general rendezvous was in the neighborhood of a town of the same
 name. The emigrants encamped there for three days, according to
 Oriental custom, while the preparations for the departure were being
 completed and Ezra was arranging the order of the caravan.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. found there none of the sons of Levi</B>--that is, the ordinary
 Levites. Notwithstanding the privilege of exemption from all taxes
 granted to persons engaged in the temple service, none of the Levitical
 tribes were induced to join the settlement in Jerusalem; and it was
 even not without difficulty Ezra persuaded some of the priestly
 families to accompany him.</P>

 by his priestly character he had over the Levites, or of the royal
 commission with which he was invested. The deputation was despatched to
 Iddo, who was a prince or chief of the Nethinims--for the Persian
 government allowed the Hebrews during their exile to retain their
 ecclesiastical government by their own chiefs, as well as to enjoy the
 privilege of free worship. Iddo's influence procured and brought to the
 camp at Ahava thirty-eight Levites, and two hundred twenty Nethinims,
 the descendants of the Gibeonites, who performed the servile duties of
 the temple.</P>

 from the Bedouin Arabs that prowl through the desert were in ancient
 times as great as they still are; and it seems that travellers usually
 sought the protection of a military escort. But Ezra had spoken so much
 to the king of the sufficiency of the divine care of His people that he
 would have blushed to apply for a guard of soldiers. Therefore he
 resolved that his followers should, by a solemn act of fasting and
 prayer, commit themselves to the Keeper of Israel. Their faith,
 considering the many and constant perils of a journey across the
 Bedouin regions, must have been great, and it was rewarded by the
 enjoyment of perfect safety during the whole way.</P>

 and of the sacred vessels was, during the journey, committed to twelve
 of the chief priests, who, with the assistance of ten of their
 brethren, were to watch closely over them by the way, and deliver them
 into the house of the Lord in Jerusalem. The treasures in silver and
 gold, according to the value of the Babylonian talent, amounted to

 made of copper, but of an alloy capable of taking on a bright polish,
 which we think highly probable, as copper was then in common use among
 the Babylonians, and would not be as precious as gold. This alloy, much
 esteemed among the Jews, was composed of gold and other metals, which
 took on a high polish and was not subject to tarnish

 month</B>--Computing from the time of their setting out to the period of
 their arrival, they occupied about four months on the way. Their health
 and security were marvellous during so long a journey. The
 pilgrim-caravans of the present day perform long journeys through the
 wildest deserts of the East under the protection of a firman from the
 Porte, and an escort of soldiers. But for a large body, composed as
 that of Ezra--of some thousands of men, women, and children,
 unaccustomed to travel, undisciplined to order, and without military
 strength, and with so large an amount of treasure tempting the cupidity
 of the marauding, plundering tribes of the desert--to accomplish a
 journey so long and so arduous in perfect safety, is one of the most
 astonishing events recorded in history. Nothing but the vigilant care
 of a superintending Providence could have brought them securely to
 their destination.</P>

 undoubtedly given to repose; on the next, the treasures were weighed
 and handed over to the custody of the officiating priests of the
 temple. The returned exiles offered burnt offerings, and Ezra delivered
 the royal commission to the satraps and inferior magistrates; while the
 Levitical portion of them lent all the assistance they could in
 performing the additional work which the arrival of so many new

 <B>1, 2. Now when these things were done</B>--The first days after Ezra's
 arrival in Jerusalem were occupied in executing the different trusts
 committed to him. The nature and design of the office with which the
 royal authority had invested him was publicly made known to his own
 people by the formal delivery of the contribution and the sacred
 vessels brought from Babylon to the priests to be deposited in the
 temple. Then his credentials were privately presented to the provincial
 governors; and by this prudent, orderly proceeding he put himself in
 the best position to avail himself of all the advantages guaranteed him
 by the king. On a superficial view everything contributed to gratify
 his patriotic feelings in the apparently flourishing state of the
 church and country. But a further acquaintance discovered the existence
 of great corruptions, which demanded immediate correction. One was
 particularly brought under his notice as being the source and origin of
 all others; namely, a serious abuse that was practised respecting the
 law of marriage.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the princes came to me, saying</B>--The information they lodged with Ezra
 was to the effect that numbers of the people, in violation of the
 divine law 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:2,3">De 7:2, 3</A>),

 had contracted marriages with Gentile women, and that the guilt of the 
 disorderly practice, far from being confined to the lower classes, was 
 shared in by several of the priests and Levites, as well as of the 
 leading men in the country. This great irregularity would inevitably 
 bring many evils in its train; it would encourage and increase 
 idolatry, as well as break down the barriers of distinction which, for 
 important purposes, God had raised between the Israelites and all other 
 people. Ezra foresaw these dangerous consequences, but was overwhelmed 
 with a sense of the difficulty of correcting the evil, when matrimonial 
 alliances had been formed, families had been reared, affections 
 engaged, and important interests established.</P>

 <B>3. when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle,</B>

 grief, but of dread at the same time of the divine wrath;

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard</B>--which was a still
 more significant sign of overpowering grief.</P>

 <B>4. Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of
 the God of Israel,</B> &c.--All the pious people who reverenced God's word
 and dreaded its threatenings and judgments joined with Ezra in
 bewailing the public sin, and devising the means of redressing it.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice</B>--The intelligence of so
 gross a violation of God's law by those who had been carried into
 captivity on account of their sins, and who, though restored, were yet
 unreformed, produced such a stunning effect on the mind of Ezra that he
 remained for a while incapable either of speech or of action. The hour
 of the evening sacrifice was the usual time of the people assembling;
 and at that season, having again rent his hair and garments, he made
 public prayer and confession of sin.</P>

 God</B>--The burden of his prayer, which was dictated by a deep sense
 of the emergency, was that he was overwhelmed at the flagrant enormity
 of this sin, and the bold impiety of continuing in it after having, as
 a people, so recently experienced the heavy marks of the divine
 displeasure. God had begun to show returning favor to Israel by the
 restoration of some. But this only aggravated their sin, that, so soon
 after their re-establishment in their native land, they openly violated
 the express and repeated precepts which commanded them to extirpate the
 Canaanites. Such conduct, he exclaimed, could issue only in drawing
 down some great punishment from offended Heaven and ensuring the
 destruction of the small remnant of us that is left, unless, by the
 help of divine grace, we repent and bring forth the fruits of
 repentance in an immediate and thorough reformation.</P>

 <B>1. Now when Ezra had prayed</B>--As this prayer was uttered in public,
 while there was a general concourse of the people at the time of the
 evening sacrifice and as it was accompanied with all the demonstrations
 of poignant sorrow and anguish, it is not surprising that the spectacle
 of a man so respected, a priest so holy, a governor so dignified as
 Ezra, appearing distressed and filled with fear at the sad state of
 things, should produce a deep sensation; and the report of his
 passionate grief and expressions in the court of the temple having
 rapidly spread through the city, a great multitude flocked to the spot.</P>

 <B>2-4. Shechaniah .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. answered and said unto Ezra, We have 
 trespassed</B>--This was one of the leading men, who was not himself a 
 delinquent in the matter, for his name does not occur in the following 
 list.  He spoke in the general name of the people, and his conduct 
 evinced a tender conscience, as well as no small fortitude in making 
 such a proposal; for as his father and five paternal uncles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+10:26">Ezr 10:26</A>)
 
 were involved in the guilt of unlawful marriages, he showed, by the
 measure he recommended, that he deemed it better to obey God than to
 please his nearest relatives.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing</B>--This hope,
 however, depended on timely measures of reformation, and therefore,
 instead of surrendering themselves to despair or despondency, he
 counselled them to amend their error without delay, relying on God's
 mercy for the past. Though the proposal may seem harsh and cruel, yet
 in the peculiar circumstances of the Jews it was just as well as
 necessary; and he urged the duty of seeing it executed on Ezra, as the
 only person competent to carry it into effect, being possessed of skill
 and address for so delicate and difficult a work, and invested by God,
 and under Him by the Persian king 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:23-28">Ezr 7:23-28</A>),

 <B>5-8. Then Ezra .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. went into the chamber of Johanan</B>--At a private
 council of the princes and elders held there, under the presidency of
 Ezra, it was resolved to enter into a general covenant to put away
 their foreign wives and children; that a proclamation should be made
 for all who had returned from Babylon to repair within three days to
 Jerusalem, under pain of excommunication and confiscation of their
 property.</P>

 <B>9-11. Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin</B>--The returned captives
 belonged chiefly to these tribes; but other Israelites are also
 included under these names, as they all were then occupying the
 territory formerly assigned to those two tribes.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>It was the ninth month</B>--that is, between the end of December and the
 beginning of January, which is the coldest and most rainy season of the
 year in Palestine.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>all the people sat in the street</B>--that is, the court.</P>

 <B>10-17. Ezra the priest stood up, and said</B>--Having fully represented
 the enormity of their sin and urged them to dissolve their unlawful
 connections, he was gratified by receiving a prompt acknowledgment of
 the justice of his reproof and a promise of compliance with his
 recommendation. But as the weather was ungenial and the defaulters were
 too numerous to be passed in review at one time, it was resolved that a
 commission should be appointed to examine into the whole matter. These
 commissioners, assisted by the judges and elders of the respective
 cities, made a minute investigation into every case, and after three
 months' labor completely removed all traces of the abuse. Doubtless, an
 adequate provision was made for the repudiated wives and children,
 according to the means and circumstances of the husbands.</P>
