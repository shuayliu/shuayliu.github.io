 <B>1, 2. Now king David was old</B>--He was in the seventieth year of his age

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:4,5">2Sa 5:4, 5</A>).

 But the wear and tear of a military life, bodily fatigue, and mental
 care, had prematurely, if we may say it, exhausted the energies of 
 David's strong constitution

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+16:12">1Sa 16:12</A>).

 In modern Palestine and Egypt the people, owing to the heat of the
 climate, sleep each in a "separate" bed. They only depart from this 
 practice for medical reasons

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:11">Ec 4:11</A>).

 The expedient recommended by David's physicians is the regimen still
 prescribed in similar cases in the East, particularly among the Arab 
 population, not simply to give heat, but "to cherish," as they are 
 aware that the inhalation of young breath will give new life and vigor 
 to the worn-out frame. The fact of the health of the young and 
 healthier person being, as it were, stolen to support that of the more 
 aged and sickly is well established among the medical faculty. And 
 hence the prescription for the aged king was made in a hygienic point 
 of view for the prolongation of his valuable life, and not merely for 
 the comfort to be derived from the natural warmth imparted to his 
 withered frame [P<FONT SIZE=-1>ORTER,</FONT> <I>Tent and Khan</I>]. The 
 polygamy of the age and country may account for the introduction of 
 this practice; and it is evident that Abishag was made a concubine or 
 secondary wife to David (see on

 <B>5, 6. Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself</B>--Nothing is said
 as to the origin or rank of Haggith, so that it is probable she was not
 distinguished by family descent. Adonijah, though David's fourth son

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:4,1Ch+3:2">2Sa 3:4;
 1Ch 3:2</A>), 

 was now the oldest alive; and his personal attractions and manners

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:2">1Sa 9:2</A>)

 not only recommended him to the leading men about court, but made him
 the favorite of his father, who, though seeing him assume an equipage
 becoming only the heir-presumptive to the throne

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:1">2Sa 15:1</A>),

 said nothing; and his silence was considered by many, as well as by
 Adonijah, to be equivalent to an expression of consent. The sinking 
 health of the king prompted him to take a decisive step in furtherance 
 of his ambitious designs.</P>

 <B>7. he conferred with Joab</B>--The anxiety of Adonijah to secure the
 influence of a leader so bold, enterprising, and popular with the army
 was natural, and the accession of the hoary commander is easily
 accounted for from his recent grudge at the king
 (see on

 <A HREF="JFB10.htm#2Sa19_13">2Sa 19:13</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and with Abiathar the priest</B>--His influence was as great over the
 priests and Levites--a powerful body in the kingdom--as that of Joab
 over the troops. It might be that both of them thought the crown
 belonged to Adonijah by right of primogeniture, from his mature age and
 the general expectations of the people 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:15">1Ki 2:15</A>).</P>

 <B>8. But Zadok the priest</B>--He had been high priest in the tabernacle
 at Gibeon under Saul 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:39">1Ch 16:39</A>).

 David, on his accession, had conjoined him and Abiathar equal in the
 exercise of their high functions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:17,15:24,29,35">2Sa 8:17; 15:24, 29, 35</A>).

 But it is extremely probable that some cause of jealousy or discord
 between them had arisen, and hence each lent his countenance and 
 support to opposite parties.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Benaiah</B>--Distinguished for his bravery 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:20">1Sa 23:20</A>),

 he had been appointed captain of the king's bodyguard

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:18,20:23,1Ch+18:17">2Sa 8:18; 20:23;
 1Ch 18:17</A>),
 
 and was regarded by Joab as a rival.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Nathan the prophet</B>--He was held in high estimation by David, and
 stood on the most intimate relations with the royal family

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:25">2Sa 12:25</A>).

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:26">2Sa 20:26</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>9, 10. En-rogel</B>--situated 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:7-10">Jos 15:7-10</A>)

 east of Jerusalem, in a level place, just below the junction of the
 valley of Hinnom with that of Jehoshaphat. It is a very deep well, 
 measuring one hundred twenty-five feet in depth; the water is sweet, 
 but not very cold, and it is at times quite full to overflowing. The 
 Orientals are fond of enjoying festive repasts in the open air at 
 places which command the advantage of shade, water, and verdure; and 
 those <I>fetes champetres</I> are not cold collations, but magnificent 
 entertainments, the animals being killed and dressed on the spot. 
 Adonijah's feast at En-rogel was one of this Oriental description, and 
 it was on a large scale

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:4,5,5:14-16,1Ch+14:1-7">2Sa 3:4, 5; 5:14-16;
 1Ch 14:1-7</A>). 

 At the accession of a new king there were sacrifices offered

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:15">1Sa 11:15</A>).

 But on such an occasion it was no less customary to entertain the
 grandees of the kingdom and even the populace in a public manner

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:23-40">1Ch 12:23-40</A>).
 
 There is the strongest probability that Adonijah's feast was purely
 political, to court popularity and secure a party to support his claim
 to the crown.</P>

 <A NAME="1Ki1_10"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>11-27. Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. let me
 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. give thee counsel,</B> &c.--The revolt was defeated by 
 this prophet, who, knowing the Lord's will

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:12,1Ch+22:9">2Sa 7:12;
 1Ch 22:9</A>), 

 felt himself bound, in accordance with his character and office, to
 take the lead in seeing it executed. Hitherto the succession of the
 Hebrew monarchy had not been settled. The Lord had reserved to Himself
 the right of nomination

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:15">De 17:15</A>),

 which was acted upon in the appointments both of Saul and David; and in
 the case of the latter the rule was so far modified that his posterity 
 were guaranteed the perpetual possession of the sovereignty

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:12">2Sa 7:12</A>).

 This divine purpose was known throughout the kingdom; but no intimation
 had been made as to whether the right of inheritance was to belong to 
 the oldest son. Adonijah, in common with the people generally, expected 
 that this natural arrangement should be followed in the Hebrew kingdom 
 as in all others. Nathan, who was aware of the old king's solemn 
 promise to Solomon, and, moreover, that this promise was sanctioned by 
 the divine will, saw that no time was to be lost. Fearing the effects 
 of too sudden excitement in the king's feeble state, he arranged that 
 Bath-sheba should go first to inform him of what was being transacted 
 without the walls, and that he himself should follow to confirm her 
 statement. The narrative here not only exhibits the vivid picture of a 
 scene within the interior of a palace, but gives the impression that a 
 great deal of Oriental state ceremonial had been established in the 
 Hebrew court.</P>

 countries, have exercised the same right in modern and even recent
 times.</P>

 forthwith given for the immediate coronation of Solomon. A procession
 was to be formed by the "servants of their lord"--that is, the king's
 bodyguard. Mules were then used by all the princes 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+13:29">2Sa 13:29</A>);

 but there was a state mule of which all subjects were forbidden, under
 pain of death, to make use, without special permission; so that its 
 being granted to Solomon was a public declaration in his favor as the

 erected on Mount Zion, where Abiathar, one of his partisans, presided
 as high priest. The horns or projections at the four corners of the
 altar, to which the sacrifices were bound, and which were tipped with
 the blood of the victim, were symbols of grace and salvation to the
 sinner. Hence the altar was regarded as a sanctuary 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:14">Ex 21:14</A>),

 but not to murderers, rebels, or deliberate perpetrators. Adonijah,
 having acted in opposition to the will of the reigning king, was guilty 
 of rebellion, and stood self-condemned. Solomon spared his life on the 
 express condition of his good behavior--living in strict privacy, 
 leading a quiet, peaceable life, and meddling with the affairs of

 which being enforced by the presence of a thousand followers, could not
 have been well refused, he warned his son against Shimei as a turbulent
 and dangerous character. It must not be supposed that in these dying
 instructions David was evincing a fierce, vindictive spirit. He is
 rather to be considered as acting in the character of a king and
 magistrate, in noticing crimes which he had not been in a condition to
 punish, and pointing out persons of whom Solomon would be under a
 necessity to rid himself as dangerous to the state. The grateful
 mention of Barzillai's kindness

 The interval was spent in developing his ideas and plans for the future

 Tradition says that the bones of David repose on Mount Zion, and the
 minaret of a small mosque points out the spot which tradition has 
 fixed. His was a noble, a wondrous, and a humbling history. He was a 
 good man, yet his life was deformed by various crimes of a very gross 
 character. But there were many bright and noble traits in his 
 character; he was an earnest lover of the divine law; his reign was 
 signalized by many important services that contributed to the glory of 
 God and the exaltation of His kingdom; and his name, as the sweet 
 Psalmist of Israel, will be held in honor to the latest age of the 
 Church.</P>

 born after his father became monarch of the <I>whole</I> kingdom, his claim,

 in accordance with the sentiments and customs of the East. The right
 hand is the place of honor; and as it expressly said to have been
 assigned to "the king's mother," it is necessary to remark that, when a
 husband dies, his widow acquires a higher dignity and power, as a
 mother over her son, than she ever possessed before. Besides, the
 dignity of "king's mother" is a state office, to which certain revenues
 are attached. The holder has a separate palace or court, as well as
 possesses great influence in public affairs; and as the dignity is held
 for life, it sometimes happens, in consequence of deaths, that the
 person enjoying it may not be related to the reigning sovereign by
 natural maternity. Bath-sheba had evidently been invested with this
 honorable office.</P>

 Solomon's indignation was roused; he in a moment penetrated the artful
 scheme, and from his associating the names of Abiathar and Joab, he

 there was a treasonable design to conceal under this request or not,
 the act, according to Eastern notions, was criminal, and of dangerous
 consequence to the state. There is no ground of censure upon Solomon
 for cruelty or precipitation in this instance. He had pardoned
 Adonijah's former conspiracy; but this new attempt was rebellion
 against the viceroy appointed by the divine King and called for condign
 punishment. The office of executioner was among the Hebrews, as in
 other ancient countries of the East, performed unceremoniously and
 privately--often without any previous warning--by the captain of the
 guard, or one of his officers

 his long associations with the late king, Solomon pronounced on him the
 mitigated sentence of banishment to his country estate at Anathoth, and
 thereby, as God's vicegerent, deprived him of his office and its
 emoluments. The sacred writer notices the remarkable fulfilment,
 Abiathar's degradation from the high priesthood
 (see on

 And, as he refused to leave it, he seems to have cherished some faint

 <B>1. Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh</B>--This was a royal title,
 equivalent to "sultan," and the personal name of this monarch is said to
 have been Vaphres. The formation, on equal terms, of this matrimonial
 alliance with the royal family of Egypt, shows the high consideration
 to which the Hebrew kingdom had now arisen. Rosellini has given, from
 the Egyptian monuments, what is supposed to be a portrait of this
 princess. She was received in the land of her adoption with great
 eclat; for the Song of Solomon and the forty-fifth Psalm are supposed
 to have been composed in honor of this occasion, although they may both
 have a higher typical reference to the introduction of the Gentiles
 into the church.

 follows, affords undoubted evidence of the young king's piety; nor is
 the word "only," which prefaces the statement, to be understood as
 introducing a qualifying circumstance that reflected any degree of
 censure upon him. The intention of the sacred historian is to describe
 the generally prevailing mode of worship before the temple was built.
 The

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>high places</B> were altars erected on natural or artificial eminences,
 probably from the idea that men were brought nearer to the Deity. They
 had been used by the patriarchs, and had become so universal among the
 heathen that they were almost identified with idolatry. They were
 prohibited in the law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:3,4,De+12:13,14,Jer+7:31,Eze+6:3,4,Ho+10:8">Le 17:3, 4;
 De 12:13, 14; 
 Jer 7:31; 
 Eze 6:3, 4; 
 Ho 10:8</A>). 

 But, so long as the tabernacle was migratory and the means for the
 national worship were merely provisional, the worship on those high 
 places was tolerated. Hence, as accounting for their continuance, it is 
 expressly stated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:2">1Ki 3:2</A>)

 that God had not yet chosen a permanent and exclusive place for his

 The royal progress was of public importance. It was a season of
 national devotion. The king was accompanied by his principal nobility

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:2">2Ch 1:2</A>);

 immense magnitude of the sacrifices.</P>

 at the close of this season, when his mind had been elevated into a
 high state of religious fervor by the protracted services. Solomon felt
 an intense desire, and he had offered an earnest petition, for the gift
 of wisdom. In sleep his thoughts ran upon the subject of his prayer,
 and he dreamed that God appeared to him and gave him the option of
 every thing in the world--that he asked wisdom, and that God granted
 his request

 from which, in monthly rotation, the supplies for the maintenance of 
 the king's household were drawn, having first been deposited in "the 
 store cities" which were erected for their reception

 relations which the king of Tyre had cultivated with David are here 
 seen renewed with his son and successor, by a message of condolence as 
 well as of congratulation on his accession to the throne of Israel. The 
 alliance between the two nations had been mutually beneficial by the 
 encouragement of useful traffic. Israel, being agricultural, furnished 
 corn and oil, while the Tyrians, who were a commercial people, gave in 
 exchange their Ph&oelig;nician manufactures, as well as the produce of
 foreign lands. A special treaty was now entered into in furtherance of

 adjoining the seas in Solomon's time, belonged to the Ph&oelig;nicians,
 and the timber being a lucrative branch of their exports, immense 
 numbers of workmen were constantly employed in the felling of trees as 
 well as the transportation and preparation of the wood. Hiram 
 stipulated to furnish Solomon with as large a quantity of cedars and 
 cypresses as he might require and it was a great additional obligation 
 that he engaged to render the important service of having it brought 
 down, probably by the Dog river, to the seaside, and conveyed along the 
 coast in floats; that is, the logs being bound together, to the harbor 
 of Joppa

 prudent measures he took towards the accomplishment of his work. So 
 great a stretch of arbitrary power as is implied in this compulsory 
 levy would have raised great discontent, if not opposition, had not his 
 wise arrangement of letting the laborers remain at home two months out 
 of three, added to the sacredness of the work, reconciled the people to 
 this forced labor. The carrying of burdens and the irksome work of 
 excavating the quarries was assigned to the remnant of the Canaanites

 recently discovered near Jerusalem, where the temple stones are
 supposed to have been hewn. There is unequivocal evidence in this
 quarry that the stones were dressed there; for there are blocks very
 similar in size, as well as of the same kind of stone, as those found
 in the ancient remains. Thence, probably, they would be moved on
 rollers down the Tyropean valley to the very side of the temple

 supposing that after the erection of so magnificent a temple, he and 
 his people would always be sure of the presence and favor of God. The 
 condition on which that blessing could alone be expected was expressly

 possible to determine whether this was a different edifice from the
 former, or whether his house, the house of the forest of Lebanon, and
 the one for Pharaoh's daughter, were not parts of one grand palace. As
 difficult is it to decide what was the origin of the name; some
 supposing it was so called because built on Lebanon; others, that it
 was in or near Jerusalem, but contained such a profuse supply of cedar
 columns as to have occasioned this peculiar designation. We have a
 similar peculiarity of name in the building called the East India
 house, though situated in London. The description is conformable to the
 arrangement of Eastern palaces. The building stood in the middle of a
 great oblong square, which was surrounded by an enclosing wall, against
 which the houses and offices of those attached to the court were built.
 The building itself was oblong, consisting of two square courts,
 flanking a large oblong hall which formed the center, and was one
 hundred cubits long, by fifty broad. This was properly the house of the
 forest of Lebanon, being the part where were the cedar pillars of this
 hall. In front was the porch of judgment, which was appropriated to
 the transaction of public business. On the one side of this great hall
 was the king's house; and on the other the harem or royal apartments
 for Pharaoh's daughter 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:3,9">Es 2:3, 9</A>).

 This arrangement of the palace accords with the Oriental style of
 building, according to which a great mansion always consists of three 
 divisions, or separate houses--all connected by doors and passages--the 
 men dwelling at one extremity, the women of the family at the other, 
 while public rooms occupy the central part of the building.</P>

 married afterwards to a Tyrian, she might be described as a widow of
 the tribe of Naphtali. Or, if she was a native of the city Dan (Laish),

 The molten sea was an immense semicircular vase, measuring seventeen

 less than from twenty-five to thirty tons in one solid casting--and

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+4:17">2Ch 4:17</A>),

 was on the bank of the Jordan in the territories of western Manasseh.
 Succoth was situated on the eastern side of Jordan, at the ford of the 
 river near the mouth of the Jabbok. One reason assigned by commentators 
 for the castings being made there is, that at such a distance from 
 Jerusalem that city would not be annoyed by the smoke and noxious 
 vapors necessarily occasioned by the process. [Note in <I>Bagster's
 Bible.</I>] But the true reason is to be found in the nature of the 
 soil; <I>Margin</I>, "the thickness of the ground." That part of the 
 Jordan valley abounds with marl. Clay and sand are the moulding 
 material still used for bronze. Such large quantities of metal as one 
 of these castings would contain could not be fused in one furnace, but 
 would require a series of furnaces, especially for such a casting as 
 the brazen sea--the whole series of furnaces being filled with metal, 
 and fused at one time, and all tapped together, and the metal let run 
 into the mould. Thus a national foundry was erected in the plain of 
 Jordan [N<FONT SIZE=-1>APIER</FONT>].</P>

 <B>2-6. at the feast in the month Ethanim</B>--The public and formal
 inauguration of this national place of worship did not take place till
 eleven months after the completion of the edifice. The delay, most
 probably, originated in Solomon's wish to choose the most fitting
 opportunity when there should be a general rendezvous of the people in
 Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:2">1Ki 8:2</A>);

 and that was not till the next year. That was a jubilee year, and he
 resolved on commencing the solemn ceremonial a few days before the
 feast of tabernacles, which was the most appropriate of all seasons. 
 That annual festival had been instituted in commemoration of the 
 Israelites dwelling in booths during their stay in the wilderness, as 
 well as of the tabernacle, which was then erected, in which God 
 promised to meet and dwell with His people, sanctifying it with His 
 glory. As the tabernacle was to be superseded by the temple, there was 
 admirable propriety in choosing the feast of tabernacles as the period 
 for dedicating the new place of worship, and praying that the same 
 distinguished privileges might be continued to it in the manifestation 
 of the divine presence and glory. At the time appointed for the 
 inauguration, the king issued orders for all the heads and 
 representatives of the nation to repair to Jerusalem and take part in 
 the august procession

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:1">1Ki 8:1</A>].

 The lead was taken by the king and elders of the people, whose march
 must have been slow, as priests were stationed to offer an immense 
 number of sacrifices at various points in the line of road through 
 which the procession was to go. Then came the priests bearing the ark
 and the tabernacle--the old Mosaic tabernacle which was brought from 
 Gibeon. Lastly, the Levites followed, carrying the vessels and 
 ornaments belonging to the old, for lodgment in the new, house of the

 deepest humility, naturally bore a reference to the national blessing

 ascription of praise to the Lord for the bestowment of the former, was 
 an earnest supplication for deliverance from the latter. He specifies 
 seven cases in which the merciful interposition of God would be 
 required; and he earnestly bespeaks it on the condition of people 
 praying towards that holy place. The blessing addressed to the people 
 at the close is substantially a brief recapitulation of the preceding

 case of the tabernacle, consumed by miraculous fire from heaven (see

 On remarkable occasions, the heathens sacrificed hecatombs (a hundred
 animals), and even chiliombs (a thousand animals), but the public 
 sacrifices offered by Solomon on this occasion surpassed all the other 
 oblations on record, without taking into account those presented by 
 private individuals, which, doubtless, amounted to a large additional 
 number. The large proportion of the sacrifices were peace offerings,

 sovereigns amused themselves. Hiram having refused these cities, 
 probably on account of their inland situation making them unsuitable to 
 his maritime and commercial people, Solomon satisfied his ally in some

 <B>14, 15. Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one 
 year</B>--666 talents, equal to &pound;3,996,000. The sources whence 
 this was derived are not mentioned; nor was it the full amount of his 
 revenue; for this was "Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of 
 the traffic of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and 
 of the governors of the country." The great encouragement he gave to 
 commerce was the means of enriching his royal treasury. By the 
 fortifications which he erected in various parts of his kingdom, 
 (particularly at such places as Thapsacus, one of the passages of 
 Euphrates, and at Tadmor, in the Syrian desert), he gave complete
 security to the caravan trade from the depredations of the Arab 
 marauders; and it was reasonable that, in return for this protection,
 he should exact a certain toll or duty for the importation of foreign 
 goods. A considerable revenue, too, would arise from the use of the 
 store cities and khans he built; and it is not improbable that those 
 cities were emporia, where the caravan merchants unloaded their bales 
 of spices and other commodities and sold them to the king's factors, 
 who, according to the modern practice in the East, retailed them in the 
 Western markets at a profit. "The revenue derived from the tributary 
 kings and from the governors of the country" must have consisted in the 
 tribute which all inferior magistrates periodically bring to their 
 sovereigns in the East, in the shape of presents of the produce of 
 their respective provinces.</P>

 <B>1, 2. But King Solomon loved many strange women</B>--Solomon's
 extraordinary gift of wisdom was not sufficient to preserve him from
 falling into grievous and fatal errors. A fairer promise of true
 greatness, a more beautiful picture of juvenile piety, never was seen
 than that which he exhibited at the commencement of his reign. No
 sadder, more humiliating, or awful spectacle can be imagined than the
 besotted apostasy of his old age; and to him may be applied the words
 of Paul 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:3">Ga 3:3</A>),
 
 of John 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:17">Re 3:17</A>),
 
 and of Isaiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:21">Isa 14:21</A>).

 A love of the world, a ceaseless round of pleasure, had insensibly
 corrupted his heart, and produced, for a while at least, a state of 
 mental darkness. The grace of God deserted him; and the son of the 
 pious David--the religiously trained child of Bath-sheba

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:1-3">Pr 31:1-3</A>),

 and pupil of Nathan, instead of showing the stability of sound
 principle and mature experience became at last an old and foolish king

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:13">Ec 4:13</A>).

 His fall is traced to his "love of many strange women." Polygamy was
 tolerated among the ancient Hebrews; and, although in most countries of 
 the East, the generality of men, from convenience and economy, confine 
 themselves to one woman, yet a number of wives is reckoned as an 
 indication of wealth and importance, just as a numerous stud of horses 
 and a grand equipage are among us. The sovereign, of course, wishes to 
 have a more numerous harem than any of his subjects; and the female 
 establishments of many Oriental princes have, both in ancient and 
 modern times, equalled or exceeded that of Solomon's. It is probable, 
 therefore, that, in conformity with Oriental notions, he resorted to it 
 as a piece of state magnificence. But in him it was unpardonable, as it 
 was a direct and outrageous violation of the divine law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:17">De 17:17</A>),

 and the very result which that statute was ordained to prevent was
 realized in him. His marriage with the daughter of Pharaoh is not 
 censured either here or elsewhere (see on

 <A HREF="#1Ki3_1">1Ki 3:1</A>). 

 It was only his love for many strange women; for women, though in the
 East considered inferiors, exert often a silent but powerful seductive 
 influence over their husbands in the harem, as elsewhere, and so it was 
 exemplified in Solomon.</P>

 <B>3. he had seven hundred wives, princesses</B>--They were, probably,
 according to an existing custom, the daughters of tributary chiefs,
 given as hostages for good conduct of their fathers.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>concubines</B>--were legitimate, but lower or secondary wives. These the
 chief or first wife regards without the smallest jealousy or regret, as
 they look up to her with feelings of respectful submission. Solomon's
 wives became numerous, not all at once, but gradually. Even at an early
 period his taste for Oriental show seems to have led to the
 establishment of a considerable harem

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>his wives turned away his heart after other gods</B>--Some, considering
 the lapse of Solomon into idolatry as a thing incredible, regard him as
 merely humoring his wives in the practice of their superstition; and,
 in countenancing their respective rites by his presence, as giving only
 an outward homage--a sensible worship, in which neither his
 understanding nor his heart was engaged. The apology only makes matters
 worse, as it implies an adding of hypocrisy and contempt of God to an
 open breach of His law. There seems no possibility of explaining the
 language of the sacred historian, but as intimating that Solomon became
 an actual and open idolater, worshipping images of wood or stone in
 sight of the very temple which, in early life, he had erected to the
 true God. Hence that part of Olivet was called the high place of Tophet

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:30-34">Jer 7:30-34</A>),

 had left Solomon inexcusable; and it was proper and necessary that on
 one who had been so signally favored with the gifts of Heaven, but who 
 had grossly abused them, a terrible judgment should fall. The divine 
 sentence was announced to him probably by Ahijah; but there was mercy 
 mingled with judgment, in the circumstance, that it should not be 
 inflicted on Solomon personally--and that a remnant of the kingdom
 should be spared--"for David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, which 
 had been chosen" to put God's name there; not from a partial bias in 
 favor of either, but that the divine promise might stand

 <B>14-25. the Lord stirred up an adversary</B>--that is, permitted him,
 through the impulse of his own ambition, or revenge, to attack Israel.
 During the war of extermination, which Joab carried on in Edom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:13">2Sa 8:13</A>),

 this Hadad, of the royal family, a mere boy when rescued from the sword
 of the ruthless conqueror, was carried into Egypt, hospitably 
 entertained, and became allied with the house of the Egyptian king. In 
 after years, the thought of his native land and his lost kingdom taking 
 possession of his mind, he, on learning the death of David and Joab, 
 renounced the ease, possessions, and glory of his Egyptian residence, 
 to return to Edom and attempt the recovery of his ancestral throne. The 
 movements of this prince seem to have given much annoyance to the 
 Hebrew government; but as he was defeated by the numerous and strong 
 garrisons planted throughout the Edomite territory, Hadad seems to have 
 offered his services to Rezon, another of Solomon's adversaries

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:23-25">1Ki 11:23-25</A>).

 This man, who had been general of Hadadezer and, on the defeat of that
 great king, had successfully withdrawn a large force, went into the 
 wilderness, led a predatory life, like Jephthah, David, and others, on 
 the borders of the Syrian and Arabian deserts. Then, having acquired 
 great power, he at length became king in Damascus, threw off the yoke, 
 and was "the adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon." He was 
 succeeded by Hadad, whose successors took the official title of 
 Ben-hadad from him, the illustrious founder of the powerful kingdom of 
 Damascene-Syria. These hostile neighbors, who had been long kept in
 check by the traditional fame of David's victories, took courage; and 
 breaking out towards the latter end of Solomon's reign, they must have 
 not only disturbed his kingdom by their inroads, but greatly crippled 
 his revenue by stopping his lucrative traffic with Tadmor and the 
 Euphrates.</P>

 God's providence, and therefore incurred the penalty of death by his
 criminal rebellion. The heavy exactions and compulsory labor

 <B>1. Rehoboam went to Shechem</B>--He was the oldest, and perhaps the only
 son of Solomon, and had been, doubtless, designated by his father heir
 to the throne, as Solomon had been by David. The incident here related
 took place after the funeral obsequies of the late king and the period
 for public mourning had past. When all Israel came to make him king, it
 was not to exercise their old right of election 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:19-21">1Sa 10:19-21</A>),

 for, after God's promise of the perpetual sovereignty to David's
 posterity, their duty was submission to the authority of the rightful 
 heir; but their object was, when making him king, to renew the 
 conditions and stipulations to which their constitutional kings were 
 subject

 and the magnitude of his undertakings being such, that neither the
 tribute of dependent states, nor the presents of foreign princes, nor
 the profits of his commercial enterprises, were adequate to carry them
 on, he had been obliged, for obtaining the necessary revenue, to begin
 a system of heavy taxation. The people looked only to the burdens, not
 to the benefits they derived from Solomon's peaceful and prosperous
 reign--and the evils from which they demanded deliverance were civil
 oppressions, not idolatry, to which they appear to have been
 indifferent or approving.</P>

 his father being either afraid of his aspiring to the sovereignty, like
 the two sons of David, or, which is more probable, afraid of 
 prematurely exposing his imbecility. The king's haughty and violent 
 answer to a people already filled with a spirit of discontent and 
 exasperation, indicated so great an incapacity to appreciate the 
 gravity of the crisis, so utter a want of common sense, as to create a 
 belief that he was struck with judicial blindness. It was received with 
 mingled scorn and derision. The revolt was accomplished, and yet so 
 quietly, that Rehoboam remained in Shechem, fancying himself the 
 sovereign of a united kingdom, until his chief tax gatherer, who had 
 been most imprudently sent to treat with the people, had been stoned to 
 death. This opened his eyes, and he fled for security to Jerusalem.</P>

 Rehoboam determined to assert his authority by leading a large force
 into the disaffected provinces. But the revolt of the ten tribes was 
 completed when the prophet Shemaiah ordered, in the Lord's name, an 
 abandonment of any hostile measures against the revolutionists. The

 <B>26-32. Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the
 house of David</B>--Having received the kingdom from God, he should have
 relied on the divine protection. But he did not. With a view to
 withdraw the people from the temple and destroy the sacred associations
 connected with Jerusalem, he made serious and unwarranted innovations
 on the religious observances of the country, on pretext of saving the
 people the trouble and expense of a distant journey. First, he erected
 two golden calves--the young bulls, Apis and Mnevis, as symbols (in the
 Egyptian fashion) of the true God, and the nearest, according to his
 fancy, to the figures of the cherubim. The one was placed at Dan, in
 the northern part of his kingdom; the other at Beth-el, the southern
 extremity, in sight of Jerusalem, and in which place he probably
 thought God was as likely to manifest Himself as at Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:1-32,2Ki+2:2">Ge 32:1-32;
 2Ki 2:2</A>). 

 The latter place was the most frequented--for the words

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:30">1Ki 12:30</A>)

 should be rendered, "the people even to Dan went to worship before the
 one"

 Am 4:4, 5; 5:5; 
 Ho 5:8; 10:8</A>).

 The innovation was a sin because it was setting up the worship of God
 by symbols and images and departing from the place where He had chosen
 to put His name. Secondly, he changed the feast of tabernacles from the
 fifteenth of the seventh to the fifteenth of the eighth month. The
 ostensible reason might be, that the ingathering or harvest was later
 in the northern parts of the kingdom; but the real reason was to
 eradicate the old association with this, the most welcome and joyous
 festival of the year.</P>

 <B>Behold, a child shall be born .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Josiah by name</B>--This is one of the
 most remarkable prophecies recorded in the Scriptures; and, in its
 clearness, circumstantial minuteness, and exact prediction of an event
 that took place three hundred sixty years later, it stands in striking
 contrast to the obscure and ambiguous oracles of the heathen. Being
 publicly uttered, it must have been well known to the people; and every
 Jew who lived at the accomplishment of the event must have been
 convinced of the truth of a religion connected with such a prophecy as
 this. A present sign was given of the remote event predicted, in a
 visible fissure being miraculously made on the altar. Incensed at the
 man's license of speech, Jeroboam stretched out his hand and ordered
 his attendants to seize the bold intruder. That moment the king's arm
 became stiff and motionless, and the altar split asunder, so that the
 fire and ashes fell on the floor. Overawed by the effects of his
 impiety, Jeroboam besought the prophet's prayer. His request was
 acceded to, and the hand was restored to its healthy state. Jeroboam
 was artful, and invited the prophet to the royal table, not to do him
 honor or show his gratitude for the restoration of his hand, but to
 win, by his courtesy and liberal hospitality, a person whom he could
 not crush by his power. But the prophet informed him of a divine
 injunction expressly prohibiting him from all social intercourse with
 any in the place, as well as from returning the same way. The
 prohibition not to eat or drink in Beth-el was because all the people
 had become apostates from the true religion, and the reason he was not
 allowed to return the same way was lest he should be recognized by any
 whom he had seen in going.</P>

 at Beth-el. As this man was governed by self-interest, and wished to
 curry favor with the king (whose purpose to adhere to his religious
 polity, he feared, might be shaken by the portents that had occurred),
 his hastening after the prophet of Judah, the deception he practised,
 and the urgent invitation by which, on the ground of a falsehood, he
 prevailed on the too facile man of God to accompany him back to his

 blended with the deep and artful policy of an apostate king. The reason
 of this extreme caution was an unwillingness to acknowledge that he
 looked for information as to the future, not to his idols, but to the
 true God; and a fear that this step, if publicly known, might endanger
 the stability of his whole political system; and a strong impression
 that Ahijah, who was greatly offended with him, would, if consulted
 openly by his queen, either insult or refuse to receive her. For these
 reasons he selected his wife, as, in every view, the most proper for
 such a secret and confidential errand, but recommended her to assume
 the garb and manner of a peasant woman. Strange infatuation, to suppose

 prophet was blind, but having received divine premonition of the
 pretended countrywoman's coming, he addressed her as the queen the
 moment she appeared, apprised her of the calamities which, in
 consequence of the ingratitude of Jeroboam, his apostasy, and
 outrageous misgovernment of Israel, impended over their house, as well

 golden calves, and using his influence with his father to allow his
 subjects the free privilege of going to worship in Jerusalem.</P>

 became the prevailing form of worship, and the religious state of the

 royal family, and great influence in the kingdom, were taken away. She 
 was degraded for her idolatry.

 internal reforms, as well as increasing the means of national defense

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+14:1-7">2Ch 14:1-7</A>).

 In the fifteenth year of his reign, however, the king of Israel
 commenced hostilities against him, and, invading his kingdom, erected a 
 strong fortress at Ramah, which was near Gibeah, and only six Roman 
 miles from Jerusalem. Afraid lest his subjects might quit his kingdom 
 and return to the worship of their fathers, he wished to cut off all 
 intercourse between the two nations. Ramah stood on an eminence 
 overhanging a narrow ravine which separated Israel from Judah, and 
 therefore he took up a hostile position in that place.</P>

 decline. He trusted not in the Lord

 In this emergency Asa solicited the powerful aid of the king of
 Damascene-Syria; and to bribe him to break off his alliance with 
 Baasha, he transmitted to him the treasure lying in the temple and 
 palace. The Syrian mercenaries were gained. Instances are to be found, 
 both in the ancient and modern history of the East, of the violation of 
 treaties equally sudden and unscrupulous, through the presentation of 
 some tempting bribe. Ben-hadad poured an army into the northern
 provinces of Israel, and having captured some cities in Galilee, on the 
 borders of Syria, compelled Baasha to withdraw from Ramah back within 
 his own territories.

 plotted the conspiracy and murder of that king in furtherance of his

 in ruins, Omri, in selecting the site of his royal residence, was
 naturally influenced by considerations both of pleasure and advantage.
 In the center of a wide amphitheatre of mountains, about six miles from
 Shechem, rises an oblong hill with steep, yet accessible sides, and a
 long flat top extending east and west, and rising five hundred or six
 hundred feet above the valley. What Omri in all probability built as a
 mere palatial residence, became the capital of the kingdom instead of
 Shechem. It was as though Versailles had taken the place of Paris, or
 Windsor of London. The choice of Omri was admirable, in selecting a

 Jezebel, Ahab's queen. She was "the daughter of Eth-baal,

 having murdered Philetes, king of Tyre, ascended the throne of that
 kingdom, being the eighth king since Hiram. Jezebel was the wicked
 daughter of this regicide and idol priest--and, on her marriage with
 Ahab, never rested till she had got all the forms of her native Tyrian

 Jericho</B>--(see on

 The curse took effect on the family of this reckless man but whether
 his oldest son died at the time of laying the foundation, and the 
 youngest at the completion of the work, or whether he lost all his sons 
 in rapid succession, till, at the end of the undertaking, he found 
 himself childless, the poetical form of the ban does not enable us to 
 determine. Some modern commentators think there is no reference either 
 to the natural or violent deaths of Hiel's sons; but that he began in 
 presence of his oldest son, but some unexpected difficulties, losses, 
 or obstacles, delayed the completion till his old age, when the gates 
 were set up in the presence of his youngest son. But the curse 
 <I>was</I> fulfilled more than five hundred years after it was uttered; 
 and from Jericho being inhabited after Joshua's time

 it has been supposed that the act against which the curse was directed,
 was an attempt at the restoration of the walls--the very walls which 
 had been miraculously cast down. It seems to have been within the 
 territory of Israel; and the unresisted act of Hiel affords a painful 
 evidence how far the people of Israel had lost all knowledge of, or 
 respect for, the word of God.</P>

 Gilead. The employment of a Gentile as an extraordinary minister might
 be to rebuke and shame the apostate people of Israel.

 king how fatal both to himself and people would be the reckless course

 on the obstinate heart of Ahab is shown by the penal prediction uttered
 at parting.

 drought did last and increase in severity, he sought Elijah, who, as it
 was necessary that he should be far removed from either the violence or
 the importunities of the king, was divinely directed to repair to a
 place of retreat, perhaps a cave on "the brook Cherith, that is, before
 [east of] Jordan." Tradition points it out in a small winter torrent, a

 But the common rendering is, in our opinion, preferable to these
 conjectures. And, if Elijah was miraculously fed by ravens, it is idle
 to inquire where they found the bread and the flesh, for God would 
 direct them. After the lapse of a year, the brook dried up, and this
 was a new trial to Elijah's faith.</P>

 Meeting, at his entrance into the town, the very woman who was
 appointed by divine providence to support him, his faith was severely
 tested by learning from her that her supplies were exhausted and that
 she was preparing her last meal for herself and son. The Spirit of God
 having prompted him to ask, and her to grant, some necessary succor,

 severe domestic calamity seems to have led her to think that, as God
 had shut up heaven upon a sinful land in consequence of the prophet,
 she was suffering on a similar account. Without answering her bitter
 upbraiding, the prophet takes the child, lays it on his bed, and after
 a very earnest prayer, had the happiness of seeing its restoration, and
 along with it, gladness to the widow's heart and home. The prophet was
 sent to this widow, not merely for his own security, but on account of
 her faith, to strengthen and promote which he was directed to go to her
 rather than to many widows in Israel, who would have eagerly received
 him on the same privileged terms of exception from the grinding famine.
 The relief of her bodily necessities became the preparatory means of
 supplying her spiritual wants, and bringing her and her son, through
 the teachings of the prophet, to a clear knowledge of God, and a firm
 faith in His word

 "for the space of three years and six months"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:17">Jas 5:17</A>].

 The early rain fell in our March, the latter rain in our October.
 Though Ahab might have at first ridiculed Elijah's announcement, yet 
 when neither of these rains fell in their season, he was incensed 
 against the prophet as the cause of the national judgment, and 
 compelled him, with God's direction, to consult his safety in flight. 
 This was six months after the king was told there would be neither dew 
 nor rain, and from this period the three years in this passage are 
 computed.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Go, show thyself unto Ahab</B>--The king had remained obdurate and
 impenitent. Another opportunity was to be given him of repentance, and
 Elijah was sent in order to declare to him the cause of the national
 judgment, and to promise him, on condition of his removing it, the
 immediate blessing of rain.</P>

 protecting care of God, that he ventured to approach the presence of
 the raging lion.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>there was a sore famine in Samaria</B>--Elijah found that the famine was
 pressing with intense severity in the capital. Corn must have been
 obtained for the people from Egypt or the adjoining countries, else
 life could not have been sustained for three years; but Ahab, with the
 chamberlain of his royal household, is represented as giving a personal
 search for pasture to his cattle. On the banks of the rivulets, grass,
 tender shoots of grass, might naturally be expected; but the water
 being dried up, the verdure would disappear. In the pastoral districts
 of the East it would be reckoned a most suitable occupation still for a
 king or chief to go at the head of such an expedition. Ranging over a
 large tract of country, Ahab had gone through one district, Obadiah
 through another.</P>

 he was a secret and sincere worshipper. He probably considered the
 violent character of the government, and his power of doing some good 
 to the persecuted people of God as a sufficient excuse for his not 
 going to worship in Jerusalem.</P>

 to rush without previous intimation into Ahab's presence, the prophet
 solicited Obadiah to announce his return to Ahab. The commission, with
 a delicate allusion to the perils he had already encountered in
 securing others of God's servants, was, in very touching terms,
 declined, as unkind and peculiarly hazardous. But Elijah having
 dispelled all the apprehensions entertained about the Spirit's carrying
 him away, Obadiah undertook to convey the prophet's message to Ahab and
 solicit an interview. But Ahab, bent on revenge, or impatient for the
 appearance of rain, went himself to meet Elijah.</P>

 and undisguisedly told the king that the national calamity was
 traceable chiefly to his own and his family's patronage and practice of
 idolatry. But, while rebuking the sins, Elijah paid all due respect to
 the high rank of the offender. He urged the king to convene, by virtue
 of his royal mandate, a public assembly, in whose presence it might be
 solemnly decided which was the troubler of Israel. The appeal could not
 well be resisted, and Ahab, from whatever motives, consented to the
 proposal. God directed and overruled the issue.</P>

 western coast of Palestine, at the bay of Acre, for many miles
 eastward, to the central hills of Samaria. It is a long range,
 presenting many summits, and intersected by a number of small ravines.
 The spot where the contest took place is situated at the eastern
 extremity, which is also the highest point of the whole ridge. It is
 called El-Mohhraka, "the Burning," or "the Burnt Place." No spot could
 have been better adapted for the thousands of Israel to have stood
 drawn up on those gentle slopes. The rock shoots up in an almost
 perpendicular wall of more than two hundred feet in height, on the side
 of the vale of Esdraelon. This wall made it visible over the whole
 plain, and from all the surrounding heights, where gazing multitudes
 would be stationed.</P>

 <B>21-40. Elijah said unto all the people, How long halt ye?</B>--They had
 long been attempting to conjoin the service of God with that of Baal.
 It was an impracticable union and the people were so struck with a
 sense of their own folly, or dread of the king's displeasure, that they
 "answered not a word." Elijah proposed to decide for them the
 controversy between God and Baal by an appeal, not to the authority of
 the law, for that would have no weight, but by a visible token from
 Heaven. As fire was the element over which Baal was supposed to
 preside, Elijah proposed that two bullocks should be slain and placed
 on separate altars of wood, the one for Baal, and the other for God. On
 whichever the fire should descend to consume it, the event should
 determine the true God, whom it was their duty to serve. The proposal,
 appearing every way reasonable, was received by the people with
 unanimous approval. The priests of Baal commenced the ceremony by
 calling on their god. In vain did they continue invoking their
 senseless deity from morning till noon, and from noon till evening,
 uttering the most piercing cries, using the most frantic
 gesticulations, and mingling their blood with the sacrifice. No
 response was heard. No fire descended. Elijah exposed their folly and
 imposture with the severest irony and, as the day was far advanced,
 commenced his operations. Inviting the people to approach and see the
 entire proceeding, he first repaired an old altar of God, which Jezebel
 had demolished. Then, having arranged the cut pieces of the bullock, he
 caused four barrels or jars of water to be dashed all over the altar
 and round in the trench. Once, twice, a third time this precaution was
 taken, and then, when he had offered an earnest prayer, the miraculous
 fire descended 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:24,Jdg+6:21,13:20,1Ch+21:26,2Ch+7:1">Le 9:24;

 1Ch 21:26; 
 2Ch 7:1</A>),

 and consumed not only the sacrifice, but the very stones of the altar.
 The impression on the minds of the people was that of admiration 
 mingled with awe; and with one voice they acknowledged the supremacy of 
 Jehovah as the true God. Taking advantage of their excited feelings, 
 Elijah called on them to seize the priestly impostors, and by their

 The natural features of the mount exactly correspond with the details
 of this narrative. The conspicuous summit, 1635 feet above the sea, on 
 which the altars were placed, presents an esplanade spacious enough for 
 the king and the priests of Baal to stand on the one side, and Elijah 
 on the other. It is a rocky soil, on which there is abundance of loose 
 stones, to furnish the twelve stones of which the altar was built--a 
 bed of thick earth, in which a trench could be dug; and yet the earth 
 not so loose that the water poured into it would be absorbed; two 
 hundred fifty feet beneath the altar plateau, there is a perennial 
 fountain, which, being close to the altar of the Lord, might not have 
 been accessible to the people; and whence, therefore, even in that 
 season of severe drought, Elijah could procure those copious supplies 
 of water which he poured over the altar. The distance between this 
 spring and the site of the altar is so short, as to make it perfectly 
 possible to go thrice thither and back again, whereas it would have 
 been impossible <I>once</I> in an afternoon to fetch water from the sea 
 [V<FONT SIZE=-1>AN</FONT> D<FONT SIZE=-1>E</FONT> V<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ELDE</FONT>]. The summit is one thousand feet above the Kishon, 
 which nowhere runs from the sea so close to the base of the mount as 
 just beneath El-Mohhraka; so that the priests of Baal could, in a few 
 minutes, be taken down to the brook (torrent), and slain there.</P>

 continued with unabated agility and strength. It was, in the
 circumstances, a most proper service for Elijah to render. It tended
 to strengthen the favorable impression made on the heart of Ahab and
 furnished an answer to the cavils of Jezebel for it showed that he who
 was so zealous in the service of God, was, at the same time, devotedly
 loyal to his king. The result of this solemn and decisive contest was a
 heavy blow and great discouragement to the cause of idolatry. But
 subsequent events seem to prove that the impressions, though deep, were

 But a message from the incensed and hard-hearted queen, vowing speedy
 vengeance for her slaughtered priests, dispelled all his bright visions
 of the future. It is probable, however, that in the present temper of
 the people, even she would not have dared to lay violent hands on the
 Lord's servant, and purposely threatened him because she could do no
 more. The threat produced the intended effect, for his faith suddenly
 failed him. He fled out of the kingdom into the southernmost part of
 the territories in Judah; nor did he deem himself safe even there, but,
 dismissing his servant, he resolved to seek refuge among the mountain

 Beer-sheba to Horeb--a wide expanse of sand hills, covered with the
 retem (not juniper, but broom shrubs), whose tall and spreading
 branches, with their white leaves, afford a very cheering and
 refreshing shade. His gracious God did not lose sight of His fugitive
 servant, but watched over him, and, miraculously ministering to his
 wants, enabled him, in a better but not wholly right frame of mind, by
 virtue of that supernatural supply, to complete his contemplated
 journey. In the solitude of Sinai, God appeared to instruct him. "What
 doest thou here, Elijah?" was a searching question addressed to one who
 had been called to so arduous and urgent a mission as his. By an awful
 exhibition of divine power, he was made aware of the divine speaker who
 addressed him; his attention was arrested, his petulance was silenced,
 his heart was touched, and he was bid without delay return to the land
 of Israel, and prosecute the Lord's work there. To convince him that an
 idolatrous nation will not be unpunished, He commissions him to anoint
 three persons who were destined in Providence to avenge God's
 controversy with the people of Israel. Anointing is used synonymously
 with appointment 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:8">Jud 9:8</A>),

 and is applied to all named, although Jehu alone had the consecrated
 oil poured over his head. They were all three destined to be eminent 
 instruments in achieving the destruction of idolaters, though in 
 different ways. But of the three commissions, Elijah personally 
 executed only one; namely, the call of Elisha to be his assistant and 
 successor

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:19">1Ki 19:19</A>],

 Having thus satisfied the fiery zeal of the erring but sincere and
 pious prophet, the Lord proceeded to correct the erroneous impression 
 under which Elijah had been laboring, of his being the sole adherent of 
 the true religion in the land; for God, who seeth in secret, and knew 
 all that were His, knew that there were seven thousand persons who had 
 not done homage (literally, "kissed the hand") to Baal.</P>

 The thirty-two kings that were confederate with him were probably 
 tributary princes. The ancient kings of Syria and Ph&oelig;nicia ruled
 only over a single city, and were independent of each other, except 
 when one great city, as Damascus, acquired the ascendency, and even 
 then they were allied only in time of war. The Syrian army encamped at

 But the demand was repeated with greater insolence; and yet, from the
 abject character of Ahab, there is reason to believe he would have
 yielded to this arrogant claim also, had not the voice of his subjects
 been raised against it. Ben-hadad's object in these and other boastful
 menaces was to intimidate Ahab. But the weak sovereign began to show a
 little more spirit, as appears in his abandoning "my lord the king" for
 the single "tell him," and giving him a dry but sarcastic hint to glory
 no more till the victory is won. Kindling into a rage at the cool
 defiance, Ben-hadad gave orders for the immediate sack of the city.</P>

 <B>13-21. behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab</B>--Though the king and
 people of Israel had highly offended Him, God had not utterly cast them
 off. He still cherished designs of mercy towards them, and here, though
 unasked, gave them a signal proof of His interest in them, by a
 prophet's animating announcement that the Lord would that day deliver
 the mighty hosts of the enemy into his hand by means of a small, feeble,
 inadequate band. Conformably to the prophet's instructions, two hundred
 thirty-two young men went boldly out towards the camp of the enemy,
 while seven thousand more, apparently volunteers, followed at some
 little distance, or posted themselves at the gate, to be ready to
 reinforce those in front if occasion required it. Ben-hadad and his
 vassals and princes were already, at that early hour--scarcely
 midday--deep in their cups; and though informed of this advancing
 company, yet confiding in his numbers, or it may be, excited with wine,
 he ordered with indifference the proud intruders to be taken alive,
 whether they came with peaceful or hostile intentions. It was more
 easily said than done; the young men smote right and left, making
 terrible havoc among their intended captors; and their attack, together
 with the sight of the seven thousand, who soon rushed forward to mingle
 in the fray, created a panic in the Syrian army, who immediately took up
 flight. Ben-hadad himself escaped the pursuit of the victors on a fleet
 horse, surrounded by a squadron of horse guards. This glorious victory,
 won so easily, and with such a paltry force opposed to overwhelming
 numbers, was granted that Ahab and his people might know 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:13">1Ki 20:13</A>)

 that God is the Lord. But we do not read of this acknowledgment being

 the king to take every precaution against a renewal of hostilities in
 the following campaign.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:1">2Sa 11:1</A>),

 were anciently begun. It happened as the prophet had forewarned.
 Brooding over their late disastrous defeat, the attendants of Ben-hadad 
 ascribed the misfortune to two causes--the one arose from the 
 principles of heathenism which led them to consider the gods of Israel 
 as "gods of the hills"; whereas their power to aid the Israelites would 
 be gone if the battle was maintained on the plains. The other cause to 
 which the Syrian courtiers traced their defeat at Samaria, was the 
 presence of the tributary kings, who had probably been the first to 
 take flight; and they recommended "captains to be put in their rooms." 
 Approving of these recommendations, Ben-hadad renewed his invasion of 
 Israel the next spring by the siege of Aphek in the valley of Jezreel 
 (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+29:1,1Sa+28:4">1Sa 29:1,

 flocks, or scattered, like sheep; and hence the two small but compact
 divisions of the Israelite force are compared to goats, not sheep.
 Humanly speaking, that little handful of men would have been
 overpowered by numbers. But a prophet was sent to the small Israelite
 army to announce the victory, in order to convince the Syrians that the
 God of Israel was omnipotent everywhere, in the valley as well as on
 the hills. And, accordingly, after the two armies had pitched opposite
 each other for seven days, they came to an open battle. One hundred
 thousand Syrians lay dead on the field, while the fugitives took refuge
 in Aphek, and there, crowding on the city walls, they endeavored to
 make a stand against their pursuers; but the old walls giving way under
 the incumbent weight, fell and buried twenty-seven thousand in the
 ruins. Ben-hadad succeeded in extricating himself, and, with his
 attendants, sought concealment in the city, fleeing from chamber to
 chamber; or, as some think it, an inner chamber, that is, a harem; but
 seeing no ultimate means of escape, he was advised to throw himself on
 the tender mercies of the Israelitish monarch.</P>

 <B>1-3. Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel</B>--Ahab
 was desirous, from its contiguity to the palace, to possess it for a
 vegetable garden. He proposed to Naboth to give him a better in
 exchange, or to obtain it by purchase; but the owner declined to part
 with it. In persisting in his refusal, Naboth was not actuated by any
 feelings of disloyalty or disrespect to the king, but solely from a
 conscientious regard to the divine law, which, for important reasons,
 had prohibited the sale of a paternal inheritance

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+25:23,Nu+36:7">Le 25:23;

 or if, through extreme poverty or debt, an assignation of it to another
 was unavoidable, the conveyance was made on the condition of its being 
 redeemable at any time

 In short, it could not be alienated from the family, and it was on this
 ground that Naboth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:3">1Ki 21:3</A>)

 refused to comply with the king's demand. It was not, therefore, any
 rudeness or disrespect that made Ahab heavy and displeased, but his 
 sulky and pettish demeanor betrays a spirit of selfishness that could 
 not brook to be disappointed of a favorite object, and that would have 
 pushed him into lawless tyranny had he possessed any natural force of 
 character.</P>

 upon?"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee
 the vineyard</B>--After upbraiding Ahab for his pusillanimity and bidding
 him act as a king, Jezebel tells him to trouble himself no more about
 such a trifle; she would guarantee the possession of the vineyard.</P>

 By allowing her the use of his signet-ring, Ahab passively consented to
 Jezebel's proceeding. Being written in the king's name, it had the 
 character of a royal mandate.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his
 city</B>--They were the civic authorities of Jezreel, and would, in all
 likelihood, be the creatures and fit tools of Jezebel. It is evident
 that, though Ahab had recently been in Jezreel, when he made the offer
 to Naboth, both he and Jezebel were now in Samaria

 magistrates did according to orders. Pretending that a heavy guilt lay
 on one, or some unknown party, who was charged with blaspheming God and
 the king and that Ahab was threatening vengeance on the whole city
 unless the culprit were discovered and punished, they assembled the
 people to observe a solemn fast. Fasts were commanded on extraordinary
 occasions affecting the public interests of the state

 The wicked authorities of Jezreel, by proclaiming the fast, wished to

 an impression among the people that Naboth's crime amounted to treason 
 against the king's life.

 <B>set Naboth on high</B>--During a trial the panel, or accused person, was
 placed on a high seat, in the presence of all the court; but as the
 guilty person was supposed to be unknown, the setting of Naboth on high
 among the people must have been owing to his being among the
 distinguished men of the place.</P>

 commission, stood before him. The appearance of the prophet, at such a
 time, was ominous of evil, but his language was much more so (compare

 king's heart, and led, for a while, to sincere repentance. Going
 softly, that is, barefoot, and with a pensive manner, within doors. He

 the resources of his country, that, however eager, he was unable to
 recommence active hostilities against Israel. But that his hereditary
 enmity remained unsubdued, was manifest by his breach of faith
 concerning the treaty by which he had engaged to restore all the cities

 was singular that a friendly league between the sovereigns of Israel
 and Judah should, for the first time, have been formed by princes of
 such opposite characters--the one pious, the other wicked. Neither
 this league nor the matrimonial alliance by which the union of the
 royal families was more closely cemented, met the Lord's approval

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:2">2Ch 19:2</A>).

 It led, however, to a visit by Jehoshaphat, whose reception in Samaria
 was distinguished by the most lavish hospitality

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+18:2">2Ch 18:2</A>).

 on the site of the present Salt Lake, in the province of Belka. It lay
 within the territories of the Israelitish monarch, and was unjustly 
 alienated; but whether it was one of the cities usurped by the first 
 Ben-hadad, which his son had promised to restore, or was retained for 
 some other reasons, the sacred historian has not mentioned. In the 
 expedition which Ahab meditated for the recovery of this town, the aid 
 of Jehoshaphat was asked and promised (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+18:3">2Ch 18:3</A>).

 Previous to declaring hostilities, it was customary to consult the
 prophets (see on

 <A HREF="JFB09.htm#1Sa28_8">1Sa 28:8</A>); 

 and Jehoshaphat having expressed a strong desire to know the Lord's
 will concerning this war, Ahab assembled four hundred of his prophets. 
 These could not be either the prophets of Baal or of Ashteroth

 to have been false prophets, who conformed to the symbolic calf-worship
 of Jehovah. Being the creatures of Ahab, they unanimously predicted a
 prosperous issue to the war. But dissatisfied with them, Jehoshaphat 
 inquired if there was any true prophet of the Lord. Ahab agreed, with 
 great reluctance, to allow Micaiah to be summoned. He was the only true 
 prophet then to be found residing in Samaria, and he had to be brought 
 out of prison

 of that time, and probably by the Israelite warriors also. Zedekiah, by
 assuming two horns, personated two heroes, and, pretending to be a

 Judah in a military triumph. It was a symbolic action, to impart greater
 force to his language (see

 messenger who conducted [Micaiah] to the royal presence informed him of
 the tenor of the prophecies already given and recommended him to agree
 with the rest, no doubt from the kindly motive of seeing him released
 from imprisonment. But Micaiah, inflexibly faithful to his divine
 mission as a prophet, announced his purpose to proclaim honestly
 whatever God should bid him. On being asked by the king, "Shall I go
 against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I forbear?" the prophet gave precisely
 the same answer as the previous oracles that had been consulted; but it
 must have been given in a sarcastic tone and in ironical mockery of
 their way of speaking. Being solemnly urged to give a serious and
 truthful answer, Micaiah then declared the visionary scene the Spirit
 had revealed to him;--</P>

 people return without either being pursued or destroyed by the enemy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>18-23. Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning
 me, but evil?</B>--Since Ahab was disposed to trace this unwelcome truth
 to personal enmity, Micaiah proceeded fearlessly to tell the incensed
 monarch in full detail what had been revealed to him. The Hebrew
 prophets, borrowing their symbolic pictures from earthly scenes,
 described God in heaven as a king in His kingdom. And as earthly
 princes do nothing of importance without asking the advice of their
 counsellors, God is represented as consulting about the fate of Ahab.
 This prophetic language must not be interpreted literally, and the
 command must be viewed as only a permission to the lying spirit

 hoping to evade the force of Micaiah's prophecy by a secret stratagem,
 he assumed the uniform of a subaltern, while he advised Jehoshaphat to

 to take or kill him, as the author of the war. The officers at first

 mistake, desisted. Ahab was wounded by a random arrow, which, being 
 probably poisoned, and the state of the weather increasing the 
 virulence of the poison, he died at sunset. The corpse was conveyed to 
 Samaria; and, as the chariot which brought it was being washed, in a

 wound, the dogs, in conformity with Elijah's prophecy, came and licked
