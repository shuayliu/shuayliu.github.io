 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ABAKKUK,</FONT> from a <I>Hebrew</I> root meaning to "embrace," denoting a
 "favorite" (namely, of God) and a "struggler" (for his country's good).
 Some ancient authors represent him as belonging to the tribe of Levi;
 others [P<FONT SIZE=-1>SEUDO</FONT>
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>PIPHANIUS</FONT>], to that of Simeon. The inscription to Bel
 and the dragon in the <I>Septuagint</I> asserts the former; and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:19">Hab 3:19</A>

 perhaps favors this. E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical 
 History,</I> 7.29] states that in his time Habakkuk's tomb was shown at 
 Celia in Palestine.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The time seems to have been about 610 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT> For the
 Chaldeans attacked Jerusalem in the ninth month of the fifth year of 
 Jehoiakim, 605 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:1,2Ch+36:6,Jer+46:2,Jer+36:9">2Ki 24:1;
 2Ch 36:6;
 Jer 46:2; 36:9</A>).

 And Habakkuk

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:5,6">Hab 1:5, 6</A>,

 &c.) speaks of the Chaldeans as about to invade Judah, but not as
 having actually done so. In the second chapter he proceeds to comfort
 his people by foretelling the humiliation of their conquerors, and that
 the vision will soon have its fulfilment. In the third chapter the
 prophet in a sublime ode celebrates the deliverances wrought by Jehovah
 for His people in times past, as the ground of assurance,
 notwithstanding all their existing calamities, that He will deliver
 them again.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:16">Hab 3:16</A>

 shows that the invader is still coming, and not yet arrived; so that 
 the whole refers to the invasion in Jehoiakim's times, not those under 
 Jehoiachin and Zedekiah. The Apocryphal appendix to Daniel states that 
 he lived to see the Babylonian exile (588 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>),
 which accords with his prophesying early in Jehoiakim's reign, about 
 610 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The position of the book immediately after Nahum is appropriate; as
 Nahum treated of the judgments of the Lord on Assyria, for its violence
 against Israel, so Habakkuk, those inflicted by, and on, the Chaldeans
 for the same reason.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The style is poetical and sublime. The parallelisms are generally
 regular. Borrowed ideas occur (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:19,Ps+18:33">Hab 3:19,

 with Isa 11:9</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The ancient catalogues imply that his book is part of the canon of
 Scripture. In the New Testament,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:17,Hab+2:4">Ro 1:17
 quotes Hab 2:4</A>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:14">Isa 29:14</A>).
 
 Quoted by Paul 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:41">Ac 13:41</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>among the heathen</B>--In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:41">Ac 13:41</A>,

 "ye despisers," from the <I>Septuagint.</I> So the <I>Syriac</I> and 
 <I>Arabic</I> versions; perhaps from a different <I>Hebrew</I> reading. 
 In the <I>English Version</I> reading of Habakkuk, God, in reply to the 
 prophet's expostulation, addresses the Jews as about to be punished, 
 "Behold ye <I>among the heathen</I> (with whom ye deserve to be 
 classed, and by whom ye shall be punished, as despisers; the sense 
 <I>implied,</I> which Paul <I>expresses</I>): learn from them what ye 
 refused to learn from Me!" For "wonder marvellously," Paul, in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:41">Ac 13:41</A>,

 has, "wonder <I>and perish,</I>" which gives the <I>sense,</I> not the 
 literal wording, of the <I>Hebrew,</I> "Wonder, wonder," that is, be 
 overwhelmed in wonder. The despisers are to be given up to their own 
 stupefaction, and so perish. The Israelite unbelievers would not credit 
 the prophecy as to the fearfulness of the destruction to be wrought by 
 the Chaldeans, nor afterwards the deliverance promised from that 
 nation.  So analogously, in Paul's day, the Jews would not credit the 
 judgment coming on them by the Romans, nor the salvation proclaimed 
 through Jesus. Thus the same Scripture applied to both.

 G<FONT SIZE=-1>ESENIUS</FONT> translates, "(is) forwards." The 
 rendering proposed, <I>eastward,</I> as if it referred to the 
 Chaldeans' return home <I>eastward</I> from Judea, laden with spoils, 
 is improbable. Their "gathering the sand" accords with the simoon being 
 meant, as it carries with it whirlwinds of sand collected in the

 to Jehovah, vindicates His being "from everlasting," as contrasted with
 the Chaldean so-called "god."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 that Ezra and his colleagues corrected the old reading, "<I>Thou shalt</I> not die."

 <B>1. stand upon .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. watch</B>--that is, watch-post. The 
 prophets often compare themselves, awaiting the revelations of Jehovah 
 with earnest patience, to watchmen on an eminence watching with intent
 eye all that comes within their view

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:8,11,Jer+6:17,Eze+3:17,33:2,3">Isa 21:8, 11;

 The "watch-post" is the withdrawal of the whole soul from earthly, and
 fixing it on heavenly, things. The accumulation of synonyms, "stand 
 upon .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. watch .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. set me upon .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [M<FONT SIZE=-1>AURER</FONT>].  H<FONT SIZE=-1>ENDERSON'S</FONT> view

 unbelieving Jew (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:17,Ga+3:11">Ro 1:17;
 Ga 3:11</A>).

 The believing Jew, though God's promise tarry, will wait for it; the
 unbelieving "draws back," as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:38">Heb 10:38</A>

 expresses it. The sense, in M<FONT SIZE=-1>AURER'S</FONT> view, which 
 accords better with the context

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:5">Hab 2:5</A>,

 being lifted up with haughty unbelief

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:11,16">Hab 1:11, 16</A>),

 is not upright; that is, has <I>no right</I> stability of soul resting 
 on God, to ensure permanence of prosperity; hence, though for a time 
 executing God's judgments, he at last becomes "lifted up" so as to 
 attribute to his own power what is the work of God, and in this sense 
 "draws back"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:38">Heb 10:38</A>),

 becoming thereby a type of all backsliders who thereby incur God's 
 displeasure; as the believing Jew is of all who <I>wait</I> for God's 
 promises with patient <I>faith,</I> and so "live" (stand accepted) 
 before God. The <I>Hebrew</I> accents induce B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT> to translate, "he who is just by his faith shall 
 live." Other manuscripts read the accents as <I>English Version,</I> 
 which agrees better with <I>Hebrew</I> syntax.</P>

 punishing their Chaldean foe, namely, <I>because .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he is</I>

 expecting the punishment of the Chaldeans, "because he transgresseth by

 Love of wine often begets a <I>proud</I> contempt of divine things, as 
 in Belshazzar's case, which was the immediate cause of the fall of 
 Babylon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:2-4,30">Da 5:2-4, 30</A>;

 <B>Woe</B>--The "derisive song" here begins, and continues to the end of the

 first three consisting of three verses each, the fourth of four verses,
 and the last of two. Each stanza has its own subject, and all except the

 "for," "because," or "but."

 greatest bane to men. For they who invade others' goods, often lose even
 their own" [M<FONT SIZE=-1>ENANDER</FONT>].
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT> makes "how long?" to be the cry of those
 groaning under the Chaldean oppression while it still lasted: How long

 "beasts." I therefore prefer explaining, "the spoiling of beasts," that 
 is, such as is inflicted on beasts caught in a net, and "which makes 
 them afraid (shall cover thee)." Thus the Babylonians are compared to 
 wild beasts terrified at being caught suddenly in a net. In cruel 
 rapacity they resembled wild beasts. The ancients read, "the spoiling 
 of wild beasts <I>shall make</I> <FONT SIZE=-1>THEE</FONT>

 Persians) which (<I>inflicted by thee</I>) made them afraid (shall in 
 turn cover thyself--revert on thyself from them)." This accords better 
 with the parallel clause, "the violence of Lebanon," that is, inflicted 
 by thee on Lebanon. As thou didst hunt men as wild beasts, so shalt 
 thou be hunted thyself as a wild beast, which thou resemblest in 
 cruelty.

 God's elect people are peculiarly His work

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:1">Isa 43:1</A>),

 <I>In the midst of the week.</I> The parallel clause, "in wrath" (that

 Teman is so identified with Seir or <I>Edom,</I> as here to be
 substituted for it.  Habakkuk appeals to God's glorious manifestations 
 to His people at Sinai, as the ground for praying that God will "revive

 Habakkuk shows that God's miraculous interpositions for His people were
 not limited to one time, but that God's <I>oaths</I> to His people are 
 sure ground for their always expecting them. The mention of the 
 <I>tribes,</I> rather than <I>Abraham</I> or Moses, is in order that 
 they may not doubt that to them belongs this grace of which Abraham was 
 the depository [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT> and J<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT>].  M<FONT SIZE=-1>AURER</FONT> translates, "The 
 spears were glutted with blood, the triumphal song!" that is, no sooner 
 did Jehovah begin the battle by baring His bow, than the spears were 
 glutted with blood and the triumphal song sung.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers</B>--the result of the earthquake

 Thus Habakkuk confirms believers in the hope of their deliverance, as 
 well because God is always the same, as also because the same anointed 
 Mediator is ready now to fulfil God's will and interpose for Israel, as 
 of old [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>].  M<FONT SIZE=-1>AURER</FONT>

 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ENDERSON</FONT> translates, "Yet I

 "Hinds' (gazelles') feet" imply the <I>swiftness</I> with which God
