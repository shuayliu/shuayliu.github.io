 The testimonies to its authenticity are--O<FONT SIZE=-1>RIGEN</FONT> 
 [<I>Homily</I> 19, on <I>Jeremiah,</I> vol. 1., p. 185, <I>Edition 
 Huetius</I>], cites it as the letter of Paul to Philemon concerning 
 Onesimus; T<FONT SIZE=-1>ERTULLIAN</FONT> [<I>Against Marcion,</I> 
 5.21]: "The brevity of this Epistle is the sole cause of its escaping 
 the falsifying hands of Marcion." E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> 
 [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 3.25], mentions it among "the 
 universally acknowledged Epistles of the canon"; J<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> [<I>Commentary on Philemon,</I> vol. iv., p. 442], 
 argues for it against those who objected to its canonicity on the 
 ground of its subject being beneath an apostle to write about. I<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>GNATIUS</FONT> [<I>Epistle to the Ephesians,</I> 2; <I>Epistle 
 to the Magnesians,</I> 12], seems to allude to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phile+1:20">Phm 20</A>.

 Compare <I>Epistle to Polycarp</I> [1 and 6]. Its brevity is the cause
 of its not being often quoted by the Fathers. 
 P<FONT SIZE=-1>ALEY</FONT> [<I>Hor&aelig; Paulin&aelig;</I>], has shown
 striking proofs of its authenticity in the undesigned coincidences 
 between it and the Epistle to the Colossians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 P<FONT SIZE=-1>LACE AND</FONT>
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>IME OF</FONT>
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>RITING</FONT>.--This Epistle is closely linked with the
 Epistle to the Colossians. Both were carried by the same bearer, 
 Onesimus (with whom, however, Tychicus is joined in the Epistle to the 
 Colossians),

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:9">Col 4:9</A>.

 The persons sending salutations are the same, except one, Jesus called
 <I>Justus</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:11">Col 4:11</A>).

 In both alike Archippus is addressed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phile+1:2,Col+4:17">Phm 2;
 Col 4:17</A>). 

 Paul and Timothy stand in the headings of both. And in both Paul
 appears as a prisoner

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phile+1:9,Col+4:18">Phm 9;
 Col 4:18</A>).

 Hence it follows, it was written at the same time and place as the
 Epistle to the Colossians (which was about the same time as the Epistle 
 to the Ephesians), namely, at Rome, during Paul's first imprisonment, 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 61 or 62.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 O<FONT SIZE=-1>BJECT</FONT>.--Onesimus, of Colosse ("one of you,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:9">Col 4:9</A>),

 slave of Philemon, had fled from his master to Rome, after having 
 probably defrauded him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phile+1:18">Phm 18</A>).

 He there was converted to Christianity by Paul, and being induced by
 him to return to his master, he was furnished with this Epistle, 
 recommending him to Philemon's favorable reception, as being now no 
 longer a mere servant, but also a brother in Christ. Paul ends by 
 requesting Philemon to prepare him a lodging, as he trusted soon to be 
 set free and visit Colosse. This Epistle is addressed also to Apphia, 
 supposed from its domestic subject to have been Philemon's wife, and 
 Archippus (a minister of the Colossian Church,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:17">Col 4:17</A>),

 for the same reason, supposed to be a near relative.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Onesimus in the <I>Apostolical Canons</I> [73], is said to have been
 emancipated by his master. The <I>Apostolical Constitutions</I> [7.46]
 state that he was consecrated by Paul, bishop of Berea, in Macedonia,
 and that he was martyred at Rome. I<FONT SIZE=-1>GNATIUS</FONT>
 [<I>Epistle to the Ephesians,</I> 1], speaks of him as bishop of the
 Ephesians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 S<FONT SIZE=-1>TYLE</FONT>.--It has been happily termed, from its 
 graceful and delicate urbanity, "the polite Epistle." Yet there is 
 nothing of insincere compliment, miscalled politeness by the world. It 
 is manly and straightforward, without misrepresentation or suppression
 of facts; at the same time it is most captivatingly persuasive. 
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> quotes L<FONT SIZE=-1>UTHER'S</FONT>
 eloquent description, "This Epistle showeth a right, noble, lovely 
 example of Christian love. Here we see how St. Paul layeth himself out 
 for the poor Onesimus, and with all his means pleadeth his cause with 
 his master, and so setteth himself as if he were Onesimus, and had 
 himself done wrong to Philemon. Yet all this doeth he, not with force, 
 as if he had right thereto, but he stripped himself of his right, and 
 thus enforceth Philemon to forego his right also. Even as Christ did 
 for us with God the Father, thus also doth St. Paul for Onesimus with 
 Philemon: for Christ also stripped Himself of His right, and by love 
 and humility enforced [?] the Father to lay aside His wrath and power, 
 and to take us to His grace for the sake of Christ, who lovingly 
 pleadeth our cause, and with all His heart layeth Himself out for us; 
 for we are all His Onesimi, to my thinking."</P>

 <B>5. Hearing</B>--the ground of his thanksgiving. It is a delicate
 mark of authenticity, that he says "hearing" as to churches and persons
 whom he had not seen or <I>then</I> visited. Now Colosse, Philemon's
 place of residence, he had never yet seen. Yet

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phile+1:19">Phm 19</A>

 here implies that Philemon was his convert. Philemon, doubtless, was
 converted at Ephesus, or in some other place where he met Paul.

 <B>love and faith</B>--The theological order is first <I>faith</I> then

 acts be proved to be "a faith which worketh by love."

 "thy love and faith toward all saints"; Paul never ceases to mention
 him in his prayers, <I>in order that</I> his faith may still further 
 show its power in his relation to others, by exhibiting every grace 
 which is in Christians to the glory of Christ. Thus he paves the way

 anything I request.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phile+1:9">Phm 9</A>.

 In the <I>Greek,</I> the name "Onesimus" is skilfully put last, he puts
 first a favorable description of him before he mentions the name that 
 had fallen into so bad repute with Philemon. "I beseech thee for my 
 son, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus." Scripture does not 
 sanction slavery, but at the same time does not begin a political 
 crusade against it. It sets forth <I>principles of love</I> to our 
 fellow men which were sure (as they have done) in due time to undermine 
 and overthrow it, without violently convulsing the then existing 
 political fabric, by stirring up slaves against their masters.</P>

 Not only was he "unprofitable," but positively injurious, having 
 "wronged" his master. Paul uses a mild expression.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>21. Having confidence in thy obedience</B>--to my apostolic
 authority, if I were to "enjoin" it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phile+1:8">Phm 8</A>),

 which I do not, preferring to beseech thee for it as a favor

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phile+1:9">Phm 9</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>thou will also do more</B>--towards Onesimus: hinting at his 
 possible manumission by Philemon, <I>besides,</I> being kindly 
 received.</P>

 <A NAME="Phm1_22"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>22.</B> This prospect of Paul's visiting Colosse would tend to 
 secure a kindly reception for Onesimus, as Paul would know in person 
 how he had been treated.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>your .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you</B>--referring to Philemon, Apphia, 
 Archippus, and the Church in Philemon's house. The same expectation is 
 expressed by him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:23,24">Php 2:23, 24</A>,
 
 written in the same imprisonment.</P>

 <A NAME="Phm1_23"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>23.</B> The same persons send salutations in the accompanying 
 Epistle, except that "Jesus Justus" is not mentioned here.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner</B>--He had been sent by the Colossian 
 Church to inquire after, and minister to, Paul, and possibly was cast 
 into <I>prison</I> by the Roman authorities on suspicion. However, he 
 is not mentioned as a <I>prisoner</I> in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:12">Col 4:12</A>,

 so that "fellow prisoner" here may mean merely one who was a faithful 
 companion to Paul in his imprisonment, and by his society put himself 
 in the position of a prisoner. So also "Aristarchus, my fellow 
 prisoner,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:10">Col 4:10</A>,

 may mean. Benson conjectures the meaning to be that on some 
 <I>former</I> occasion these two were Paul's "fellow prisoners," <I>not 
 at the time.</I></P>
