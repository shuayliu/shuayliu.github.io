 A<FONT SIZE=-1>UTHENTICITY</FONT>.--That these two Epistles were
 written by the same author appears from their similarity of tone,
 style, and sentiments.  That John, the beloved disciple, was the author
 of the Second and Third Epistles, as of the First Epistle, appears from
 I<FONT SIZE=-1>REN&AElig;US</FONT> [<I>Against Heresies,</I> 1.16.3],
 who quotes

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:10,11">2Jo 10, 11</A>;

 and in [3.16.8], he quotes

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:7">2Jo 7</A>,

 mistaking it, however, as if occurring in First John. 
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT> A<FONT SIZE=-1>LEXANDRIA</FONT> 
 (<FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 192) [<I>Miscellanies,</I> 2.66], implies
 his knowledge of other Epistles of John besides the First Epistle; and 
 in fragments of his <I>Adumbrations</I> [p. 1011], he says, "John's 
 Second Epistle which was written to the virgins (<I>Greek,</I> 
 "<I>parthenous</I>"; perhaps <I>Parthos</I> is what was meant) is the 
 simplest; but it was written to a certain Babylonian named <I>the Elect 
 lady.</I>" D<FONT SIZE=-1>IONYSIUS OF</FONT> A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LEXANDRIA</FONT> (in E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> 
 [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 7.25]) observes that John never names 
 himself in his Epistles, "not even in the Second and Third Epistles, 
 although they are short Epistles, but simply calls himself the 
 presbyter, a confutation of those who think John <I>the apostle</I> 
 distinct from John <I>the presbyter.</I> A<FONT SIZE=-1>LEXANDER 
 OF</FONT> A<FONT SIZE=-1>LEXANDRIA</FONT> cites

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:10:11">2Jo 10, 11</A>,

 as John's [S<FONT SIZE=-1>OCRATES</FONT>, <I>Ecclesiastical
 History,</I> 1.6]. C<FONT SIZE=-1>YPRIAN</FONT> [<I>Concerning the 
 Baptism of Heretics</I>], in referring to the bishops at the Council of 
 Carthage, says, "John the apostle, in His Epistle, has said, if any 
 come to you"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:10">2Jo 10</A>);

 so that this Epistle, and therefore its twin sister, Third John, was 
 recognized as apostolic in the North African Church. The 
 M<FONT SIZE=-1>URATORI</FONT> fragment is ambiguous. The Second and
 Third Epistles were not in the <I>Peschito</I> or old <I>Syriac</I> 
 version; and C<FONT SIZE=-1>OSMAS</FONT> I<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>NDICOPLEUSTES</FONT> in the sixth century says that in his time 
 the Syriac Church only acknowledged three of the Catholic Epistles, 
 First Peter, First John, and James. But E<FONT SIZE=-1>PHREM THE</FONT> 
 S<FONT SIZE=-1>YRIAN</FONT> quotes the Second Epistle of John. E<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I>] reckons both 
 Epistles among the <I>Antilegomena</I> or <I>controverted</I> 
 Scriptures, as distinguished from the <I>Homologoumena</I> or 
 <I>universally acknowledged</I> from the first. Still his own opinion 
 was that the two minor Epistles were genuine, remarking, as he does in 
 <I>Demonstration of the Gospel</I> [3.5], that in John's 
 "<I>Epistles</I>" he does not mention his own name, nor call himself an 
 apostle or evangelist, but an "elder"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:1,3Jo+1:1">2Jo 1;
 3Jo 1</A>).

 O<FONT SIZE=-1>RIGEN</FONT> (in E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>
 [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 6.25]) mentions the Second and Third 
 Epistles, but adds, "<I>not all</I> admit (implying that <I>most</I> 
 authorities do) their genuineness." J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> [<I>On 
 Illustrious Men,</I> 9] mentions the two latter Epistles as attributed 
 to John the presbyter, whose sepulcher was shown among the Ephesians in 
 his day. But the designation "elder" was used of the apostles by others 
 (for example, P<FONT SIZE=-1>APIAS</FONT>, in E<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 3.39]), and is 
 used by Peter, an apostle, of himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:1">1Pe 5:1</A>).

 Why, then, should not John also use this designation of himself, in 
 consonance with the humility which leads him not to name himself or his 
 apostleship even in the First Epistle? The <I>Antilegomena</I> were 
 generally recognized as canonical soon after the Council of Nicea 
 (<FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 325). Thus C<FONT SIZE=-1>YRIL OF</FONT> 
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>ERUSALEM</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 349, 
 enumerates fourteen Epistles of Paul, and seven Catholic Epistles. So 
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>REGORY</FONT> N<FONT SIZE=-1>AZIANZEN</FONT>, in <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 389. The Councils of Hippo, 393, and Carthage, 397, 
 adopted a catalogue of New Testament books exactly agreeing with our 
 canon. So our oldest extant <I>Greek</I> manuscripts. The Second and 
 Third Epistles of John, from their brevity (which O<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>RIGEN</FONT> notices), and the private nature of their 
 contents, were less generally read in the earliest Christian assemblies 
 and were also less quoted by the Fathers; hence arose their 
 non-universal recognition at the first. Their private nature makes them 
 the less likely to be spurious, for there seems no purpose in their 
 forgery. The style and coloring too accord with the style of the First 
 Epistle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>O WHOM ADDRESSED</FONT>.--The Third Epistle is directed
 to Gaius or Caius; whether Gaius of Macedonia

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:20">Ac 19:20</A>),
 
 or Gaius of Corinth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:23,1Co+1:14">Ro 16:23;
 1Co 1:14</A>), 
 
 or Gaius of Derbe 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:4">Ac 20:4</A>),

 it is hard to decide. M<FONT SIZE=-1>ILL</FONT> believes Gaius, bishop
 of Pergamos [<I>Apostolic Constitutions,</I> 7.40], to be the person 
 addressed in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:1">3Jo 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The address of the Second Epistle is more disputed. It opens, "The
 elder unto the <I>Elect lady</I>" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:1">2Jo 1</A>).

 And it closes, "The children of thy <I>elect</I> sister greet thee"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:13">2Jo 13</A>).
 
 Now,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:1,2">1Pe 1:1, 2</A>,
 
 addresses the <I>elect</I> in Asia, &c., and closes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:13">1Pe 5:13</A>),

 "The Church that is <I>at Babylon, elected</I> together with you, 
 saluteth you." Putting together these facts, with the quotations 
 (above) from C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT> A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LEXANDRIA</FONT>, and the fact that the word "Church" comes 
 from a <I>Greek</I> word (<I>kyriake</I>) cognate to the <I>Greek</I> 
 for "lady" (<I>kyria;</I> "belonging to the <I>Lord,</I>" 
 <I>kyrios</I>); W<FONT SIZE=-1>ORDSWORTH'S</FONT> view is probable. As 
 Peter in Babylon had sent the salutations <I>of the elect Church</I> in 
 the then <I>Parthian</I> (see above on C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT> 
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LEXANDRIA</FONT>) <I>Babylon</I> to her <I>elect 
 sister</I> in Asia, so John, the metropolitan president of the elect 
 Church in Asia, writes to <I>the elect lady,</I> that is, Church, in 
 Babylon.  N<FONT SIZE=-1>EANDER</FONT>, A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>, 
 and others, think the <I>Greek</I> "<I>kyria</I>" not to mean "lady," 
 but to be her <I>proper name;</I> and that she had a "sister, a 
 Christian matron," then with John.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 D<FONT SIZE=-1>ATE AND PLACE OF 
 WRITING</FONT>.--E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical
 History,</I> 3.25] relates that John, after the death of Domitian,
 returned from his exile in Patmos to Ephesus, and went on missionary
 tours into the heathen regions around, and also made visitations of the
 churches around, and ordained bishops and clergy.  Such journeys are
 mentioned,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:12,3Jo+1:10,14">2Jo 12;
 3Jo 10, 14</A>.

 If E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> be right, both Epistles must have been 
 written after the Apocalypse, in his old age, which harmonizes with the 
 tone of the Epistles, and in or near Ephesus. It was on one of his 
 visitation tours that he designed to rebuke Diotrephes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:9,10">3Jo 9, 10</A>).</P>

 <B>1. The elder</B>--In a familiar letter John gives himself a less
 authoritative designation than "apostle"; so

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:1">1Pe 5:1</A>.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>lady</B>--B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT> takes the <I>Greek</I> as a 
 proper name <I>Kyria,</I> answering to the <I>Hebrew</I> "Martha." 
 Being a person of influence, "deceivers"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:7">2Jo 7</A>)

 were insinuating themselves into her family to seduce her and her
 children from the faith [T<FONT SIZE=-1>IRINUS</FONT>], whence John 
 felt it necessary to write a warning to her. (But see my 
 <I>Introduction</I> and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:13">1Pe 5:13</A>).

 A particular <I>Church,</I> probably that at Babylon, was intended. 
 "Church" is derived from <I>Greek</I> "<I>Kuriake,</I>" akin to 
 <I>Kuria,</I> or <I>Kyria</I> here; the latter word among the Romans 
 and Athenians means the same as <I>ecclesia,</I> the term appropriated 
 to designate the <I>Church assembly.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>love in the truth</B>--Christian <I>love</I> rests on the Christian
 <I>truth</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:3">2Jo 3</A>,

 end). Not merely "I love <I>in truth,</I>" but "I love in 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>THE</FONT> truth."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>all</B>--All Christians form one fellowship, rejoicing in the 
 spiritual prosperity of one another. "The communion of love is as wide 
 as the communion of faith" [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>].</P>

 <A NAME="2Jo1_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. For the truth's sake</B>--joined with "I love,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:1">2Jo 1</A>.

 "They who love <I>in</I> the truth, also love <I>on account of the
 truth.</I>"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever</B>--in consonance 
 with Christ's promise.</P>

 <A NAME="2Jo1_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. Grace be with you</B>--One of the oldest manuscripts and several 
 versions have "us" for <I>you.</I> The <I>Greek</I> is literally, 
 "Grace <I>shall be</I> with us," that is, with both <I>you and me.</I> 
 A prayer, however, is implied besides a confident affirmation.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>grace .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. mercy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
 peace</B>--"<I>Grace</I>" covers the sins of men; "mercy," their 
 miseries. <I>Grace</I> must first do away with man's guilt before his 
 misery can be relieved by <I>mercy.</I> Therefore <I>grace</I> stands 
 before <I>mercy. Peace</I> is the result of both, and therefore stands 
 third in order. Casting all our care on the Lord, with thanksgiving, 
 maintains this peace.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the Lord</B>--The oldest manuscripts and most of the oldest versions 
 omit "the Lord." John never elsewhere uses this title in his Epistles, 
 but "the Son of God."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>in truth and love</B>--The element or sphere in which alone 
 <I>grace, mercy,</I> and <I>peace,</I> have place. He mentions 
 <I>truth</I> in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:4">2Jo 4</A>;
 
 <I>love,</I> in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:5">2Jo 5</A>.

 Paul uses <FONT SIZE=-1>FAITH</FONT> and <I>love;</I> for <I>faith</I>
 and <I>truth</I> are close akin.</P>

 truth."</P>

 <B>5. I beseech</B>--rather (compare <I>Note,</I> see on

 "I request thee," implying some degree of <I>authority.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. new commandment</B>--It was <I>old</I> in that 
 Christians heard it from the first in the Gospel preaching; <I>new,</I> 
 in that the Gospel rested love on the new principle of filial imitation 
 of God who first loved us, and gave Jesus to die for <I>us;</I> and 
 also, in that <I>love</I> is now set forth with greater clearness than 
 in the Old Testament dispensation. Love performs both tables of the 
 law, and is the end of the law and the Gospel alike (compare 
 <I>Notes,</I> see on

 <A HREF="JFB62.htm#1Jo2_7">1Jo 2:7, 8</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>that we</B>--implying that he already had love, and urging her to 
 join him in the same Christian grace. This verse seems to me to decide 
 that a <I>Church,</I> not an <I>individual lady,</I> is meant. For a 
 man to urge a woman ("<FONT SIZE=-1>THEE</FONT>"; not <I>thee and thy 
 children</I>) that he and she should <I>love one another,</I> is hardly 
 like an apostolic precept, however pure may be the love enjoined; but 
 all is clear if "the lady" represent a <I>Church.</I></P>

 and the fulfilling of the law is the sure test of love.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>This is the commandment</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "The commandment is

 <I>coming</I> in the flesh, denies the <I>possibility</I> of the 
 incarnation; he who denies that he <I>has come,</I> denies its 
 <I>actuality.</I> They denied the possibility of a Messiah's appearing, 
 or <I>coming,</I> in the flesh [N<FONT SIZE=-1>EANDER</FONT>]. I think 
 the <I>Greek</I> present participle implies <I>both</I> the first and 
 the second advent of Christ. He is often elsewhere called <I>the Coming 
 One</I> (<I>Greek</I>),

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:3,Heb+10:37">Mt 11:3;
 Heb 10:37</A>. 

 The denial of the reality of His manifestation in the flesh, at His
 first coming, and of His personal advent again, constitutes Antichrist. 
 "The world <I>turns away</I> from God and Christ, busily intent upon 
 its own husks; but to <FONT SIZE=-1>OPPOSE</FONT> God and Christ is of 
 the leaven of Satan" [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>].

 <B>This is a,</B> &c.--<I>Greek,</I> "This (such a one as has been just 
 described) is <I>the</I> deceiver and <I>the</I> Antichrist." The

 the final personal Antichrist, who shall concentrate in himself all the 
 features of previous Antichristian systems.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>YE</FONT> receive."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>which we have wrought</B>--So one oldest manuscript reads. Other
 very old manuscripts, versions, and Fathers, read, "which 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>YE</FONT> have wrought." The <I>we</I> being seemingly
 the more difficult reading is less likely to have been a transcriber's 
 alteration. Look that ye lose not the believing state of "truth and 
 love," which <FONT SIZE=-1>WE</FONT> (as God's workmen,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:1,2Ti+2:15">2Co 6:1;

 <B>a full reward</B>--of grace not of debt. <I>Fully</I> consummated 
 glory. If "which <FONT SIZE=-1>YE</FONT> have wrought" be read with 
 very old authorities, the reward meant is that of their "work (of 
 faith) and labor of love." There are degrees of heavenly reward 
 proportioned to the degrees of capability of receiving heavenly 
 blessedness. Each vessel of glory hanging on Jesus shall be fully 
 happy. But the larger the vessel, the greater will be its capacity for 
 receiving heavenly bliss. He who with one pound made ten, received 
 authority over ten cities. He who made five pounds received five 
 cities; each according to his capacity of rule, and in proportion to 
 his faithfulness. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:41">1Co 15:41</A>.

 "There is no half reward of the saints. It is either lost altogether, 
 or received <I>in full;</I> in <I>full</I> communion with God"

 meant is here explained: the <I>not having God,</I> which results from
 <I>abiding not in the doctrine of Christ.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>transgresseth</B>--The oldest manuscripts and versions read, "Every 
 one who <I>takes the lead</I>"; literally, "goes," or "leads on 
 before"; compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:4">Joh 10:4</A>,

 "He goeth before them" (not the same <I>Greek</I>).  Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:9">3Jo 9</A>,
 
 "Loveth to have the <I>pre-eminence.</I>"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>hath not God</B>--

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:23,5:15">1Jo 2:23; 5:15</A>).

 The second "of Christ" is omitted in the oldest manuscripts, but is
 understood in the sense.

 <B>10. If there come any</B>--as a teacher or brother. The <I>Greek</I> 
 is indicative, not subjunctive; implying that such persons <I>do 
 actually come,</I> and <I>are sure to come;</I> when any comes, as 
 there will. True love is combined with hearty renunciation and 
 separation from all that is false, whether persons or doctrines.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>receive him not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. neither bid him God speed</B>--This 
 is not said of those who were always aliens from the Church, but of 
 those who wish to be esteemed brethren, and subvert the true doctrine 
 [G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT>]. The greeting salutation forbidden in 
 the case of such a one is that <I>usual among Christian brethren</I> in 
 those days, not a mere formality, but a token of <I>Christian 
 brotherhood.</I></P>

 <A NAME="2Jo1_11"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>11.</B> By wishing a false brother or teacher "God (or 
 '<I>good</I>') speed," you imply that he is capable as such of good 
 speed and <I>joy</I> (the literal meaning of the <I>Greek</I>), and 
 that you wish him it while opposing Christ; so you identify yourself 
 with "his evil deeds." The <I>Greek</I> of "partaker" is "having 
 communion with." We cannot have communion with saints and with 
 Antichrist at the same time. Here we see John's naturally fiery zeal 
 directed to a right end. P<FONT SIZE=-1>OLYCARP</FONT>, the disciple of 
 John, told contemporaries of I<FONT SIZE=-1>REN&AElig;US</FONT>, who 
 narrates the story on their authority, that on one occasion when John 
 was about to bathe, and heard that Cerinthus, the heretic, was within, 
 he retired with abhorrence, exclaiming, Surely the house will fall in 
 ruins since the enemy of the truth is there.</P>

 <B>12. I would not write</B>--A heart full of love pours itself out 
 more freely face to face, than by letter.

 <B>paper</B>--made of Egyptian papyrus. Pens were then reeds split.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>ink</B>--made of soot and water, thickened with gum. Parchment was 
 used for the permanent manuscripts in which the Epistles were 
 preserved.  Writing <I>tablets</I> were used merely for temporary 
 purposes, as our slates.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>face to face</B>--literally, "mouth to mouth."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>full</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "filled full." Your joy will be complete in 
 hearing from me in person the joyful Gospel truths which I now defer 
 communicating till I see you. On other occasions his writing the glad 
 truths was for the same purpose.</P>

 <B>13.</B> A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> confesses that the non-mention 
 of the "lady" herself here seems rather to favor the hypothesis that a 
 <I>Church</I> is meant.</P>
