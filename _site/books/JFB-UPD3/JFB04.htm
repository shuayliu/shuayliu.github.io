 <B>1, 2. on the first day of the second month,</B> &c.--Thirteen months had
 elapsed since the exodus. About one month had been occupied in the
 journey; and the rest of the period had been passed in encampment among
 the recesses of Sinai, where the transactions took place, and the laws,
 religious and civil, were promulgated, which are contained in the two
 preceding books. As the tabernacle was erected on the first day of the
 first month, and the order here mentioned was given on the first day of
 the second, some think the laws in Leviticus were all given in one
 month. The Israelites having been formed into a separate nation, under
 the special government of God as their King, it was necessary, before
 resuming their march towards the promised land, to put them into good
 order. And accordingly Moses was commissioned, along with Aaron, to
 take a census of the people. This census was incidentally noticed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+38:26">Ex 38:26</A>), 

 in reference to the poll tax for the works of the tabernacle; but it is
 here described in detail, in order to show the relative increase and 
 military strength of the different tribes. The enumeration was confined 
 to those capable of bearing arms

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:3">Nu 1:3</A>],
 
 and it was to be made with a careful distinction of the tribe, family,
 and household to which every individual belonged. By this rule of
 summation many important advantages were secured: an exact genealogical
 register was formed, the relative strength of each tribe was
 ascertained, and the reason found for arranging the order of precedence
 in march as well as disposing the different tribes in camp around the
 tabernacle. The promise of God to Abraham

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:17">Ge 22:17</A>] 

 was seen to be fulfilled in the extraordinary increase of his
 posterity, and provision made for tracing the regular descent of the 
 Messiah.</P>

 the tribe was a hereditary dignity, vested in the oldest son or some
 other to whom the right of primogeniture was transferred, and under
 whom were other inferior heads, also hereditary, among the different
 branches of the tribe. The Israelites being divided into twelve tribes,
 there were twelve chiefs appointed to assist in taking the census of
 the people.</P>

 it got the precedence in all the encampments of Israel. Of the two
 half-tribes of Joseph, who is seen to be "a fruitful bough"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:22">Ge 49:22</A>], 

 that of Ephraim was the larger, as had been predicted. The relative
 increase of all, as in the two just mentioned, was owing to the special 
 blessing of God, conformably to the prophetic declaration of the dying 
 patriarch. But the divine blessing is usually conveyed through the 
 influence of secondary causes; and there is reason to believe that the 
 relative populousness of the tribes would, under God, depend upon the 
 productiveness of the respective localities assigned to them. [For

 <B>45, 46. all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand,</B>
 &c.--What an astonishing increase from seventy-five persons who went
 down to Egypt about two hundred fifteen years before
 [see on

 <A HREF="JFB01.htm#Ge46_8">Ge 46:8</A>],
 
 and who were subjected to the greatest
 privations and hardships! And yet this enumeration was restricted to
 men from twenty years and upwards

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:3">Nu 1:3</A>].

 Including women, children, and old men, together with the Levites, the
 whole population of Israel, on the ordinary principles of computation, 
 amounted to about 2,400,000.</P>

 <B>47-54. But the Levites .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. were not numbered among them</B>--They were
 obliged to keep a register of their own. They were consecrated to the
 priestly office, which in all countries has been exempted customarily,
 and in Israel by the express authority of God, from military service.
 The custody of the things devoted to the divine service was assigned to
 them so exclusively, that "no stranger"--that is, no person, not even
 an Israelite of any other tribe, was allowed, under penalty of death,
 to approach these 

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:40">Nu 16:40</A>]. 

 Hence they encamped round the tabernacle in order that there should be
 no manifestation of the divine displeasure among the people. Thus the 
 numbering of the people was subservient to the separation of the 
 Levites from those Israelites who were fit for military service, and to 
 the practical introduction of the law respecting the first-born, for 
 whom the tribe of Levi became a substitute

 <B>2. Every man .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall pitch by his own standard, with the ensign of
 their father's house</B>--Standards were visible signs of a certain
 recognized form for directing the movements of large bodies of people.
 As the Israelites were commanded to encamp "each by his own standard,
 with the ensign of their father's house," the direction has been
 considered as implying that they possessed three varieties: (1) the
 great tribal standards, which served as rallying points for the twelve
 large clans of the people; (2) the standards of the subdivided
 portions; and, (3) those of families or houses. The latter must have
 been absolutely necessary, as one ensign only for a tribe would not
 have been visible at the extremities of so large a body. We possess no
 authentic information as to their forms, material, colors, and devices.
 But it is probable that they might bear some resemblance to those of
 Egypt, only stripped of any idolatrous symbols. These were of an
 umbrella or a fanlike form, made of ostrich feathers, shawls, &c.,
 lifted on the points of long poles, which were borne, either like the
 sacred central one, on a car, or on men's shoulders, while others might
 be like the beacon lights which are set on poles by Eastern pilgrims at
 night. Jewish writers say that the standards of the Hebrew tribes were
 symbols borrowed from the prophetic blessing of Jacob--Judah's being a
 lion, Benjamin's a wolf, &c.

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:3-24">Ge 49:3-24</A>]; 

 and that the ensigns or banners were distinguished by their colors--the
 colors of each tribe being the same as that of the precious stone 
 representing that tribe in the breastplate of the high priest

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:17-21">Ex 28:17-21</A>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>far off about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch</B>--that
 is, "over against," at a reverential distance. The place of every tribe
 is successively and specifically described because each had a certain
 part assigned both in the order of march and the disposition of the
 encampment.</P>

 <A NAME="Nu2_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they of the
 standard of the camp of Judah pitch throughout their armies</B>--Judah,
 placed at the head of a camp composed of three tribes rallying under
 its standard, was said to have combined the united colors in the high
 priest's breastplate, but called by the name of Judah. They were
 appointed to occupy the east side and to take the lead in the march,
 which, for the most part, was in an easterly direction.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>shall be captain</B>--It appears that the twelve men who were called to
 superintend the census were also appointed to be the captains of their
 respective tribes--a dignity which they owed probably to the
 circumstances, formerly noticed, of their holding the hereditary office
 of head or "prince."</P>

 <B>7. Then the tribe of Zebulun</B>--on the other side. While Judah's tribe
 was the most numerous, those of Issachar and Zebulun were also very
 numerous; so that the association of those three tribes formed a strong
 and imposing van.</P>

 <A NAME="Nu2_10"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>10-31. On the south side the standard of the camp of Reuben</B>--The
 description given of the position of Reuben and his attendant tribes on
 the south, of Ephraim and his associates on the west, of Dan and his
 confederates on the north, with that of Judah on the east, suggests the
 idea of a square or quadrangle, which, allowing one square cubit to
 each soldier while remaining close in the ranks, has been computed to
 extend over an area of somewhat more than twelve square miles. But into
 our calculations of the occupied space must be taken not only the
 fighting men, whose numbers are here given, but also the families,
 tents, and baggage. The tabernacle or sacred tent of their Divine King,
 with the camp of the Levites around it 
 (see on

 <A HREF="#Nu3_38">Nu 3:38</A>),
 
 formed the center, as does the chief's in the encampment of all nomad
 people. In marching, this order was adhered to, with some necessary
 variations. Judah led the way, followed, it is most probable, by
 Issachar and Zebulun

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:14-16">Nu 10:14-16</A>]. 

 Reuben, Simeon, and Gad formed the second great division

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:18-20">Nu 10:18-20</A>]. 

 They were followed by the central company, composed of the Levites,
 bearing the tabernacle

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:21">Nu 10:21</A>]. 

 Then the third and posterior squadron consisted of Ephraim, Manasseh,
 and Benjamin

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:22-24">Nu 10:22-24</A>], 

 while the hindmost place was assigned to Dan, Asher, and Naphtali

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:25-27">Nu 10:25-27</A>]. 

 Thus Judah's, which was the most numerous, formed the van: and Dan's,
 which was the next in force, brought up the rear; while Reuben's and 
 Ephraim's, with the tribes associated with them respectively, being the 
 smallest and weakest, were placed in the center.  (See on

 chapter contains an account of their families; and although that of
 Moses is not detailed like his brother's, his children are included

 a term which comprehends all the descendants of their common father
 Amram. The reason why the family of Moses was so undistinguished in 
 this record is that they were in the private ranks of the Levites, the 
 dignity of the priesthood being conferred exclusively on the posterity 
 of Aaron; and hence, as the sacerdotal order is the subject of this 
 chapter, Aaron, contrary to the usual style of the sacred history, is 
 mentioned before Moses.

 longer to be employed in any common offices. They were subordinate to
 the priests, who alone enjoyed the privilege of entering the holy
 place; but they were employed in discharging many of the humbler duties

 all the first-born were consecrated to God

 usage of appointing the oldest to act as the priest of the family. But 
 the privilege of redemption that was allowed the first-born opened the 
 way for a change; and accordingly, on the full organization of the 
 Mosaic economy, the administration of sacred things formerly committed 
 to the first-born was transferred from them to the Levites, who 
 received that honor partly as a tribute to Moses and Aaron, partly 
 because this tribe had distinguished themselves by their zeal in the 
 affair of the golden calf

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:29">Ex 32:29</A>), 

 and also because, being the smallest of the tribes, they could ill find
 suitable employment and support in the work. (See on

 <A HREF="JFB05.htm#De33_8">De 33:8</A>).

 The designation of a special class for the sacred offices of religion
 was a wise arrangement; for, on their settlement in Canaan, the people 
 would be so occupied that they might not be at leisure to wait on the 
 service of the sanctuary, and sacred things might, from various causes, 
 fall into neglect. But the appointment of an entire tribe to the divine 
 service ensured the regular performance of the rites of religion. The 
 subsequent portion of the chapter relates to the formal substitution of 
 this tribe.

 <B>14-31. Number the children of Levi</B>--They were numbered as well as the
 other tribes; but the enumeration was made on a different
 principle--for while in the other tribes the number of males was
 calculated from twenty years and upward

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:3">Nu 1:3</A>], 

 in that of Levi they were counted "from a month old and upward." The
 reason for the distinction is obvious. In the other tribes the survey 
 was made for purposes of war

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:3">Nu 1:3</A>], 

 from which the Levites were totally exempt. But the Levites were
 appointed to a work on which they entered as soon as they were capable 
 of instruction. They are mentioned under the names of Gershon, Kohath, 
 and Merari, sons of Levi, and chiefs or ancestral heads of three 
 subdivisions into which this tribe was distributed. Their duties were 
 to assist in the conveyance of the tabernacle when the people were 
 removing the various encampments, and to form its guard while 
 stationary--the Gershonites being stationed on the west, the Kohathites 
 on the south, and the families of Merari on the north. The Kohathites 
 had the principal place about the tabernacle, and charge of the most 
 precious and sacred things--a distinction with which they were honored, 
 probably, because the Aaronic family belonged to this division of the 
 Levitical tribe. The Gershonites, being the oldest, had the next 
 honorable post assigned them, while the burden of the drudgery was 
 thrown on the division of Merari.</P>

 when added together, amount to twenty-two thousand three hundred. The
 omission of the three hundred is variously accounted for--by some,
 because they might be first-born who were already devoted to God and
 could not be counted as substitutes; and by others, because in
 Scripture style, the sum is reckoned in round numbers. The most
 probable conjecture is, that as <I>Hebrew</I> letters are employed for
 figures, one letter was, in the course of transcription, taken for
 another of like form but smaller value.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>40-51. Number all the first-born of the males of the children of
 Israel,</B> &c.--The principle on which the enumeration of the Levites
 had been made was now to be applied to the other tribes. The number of
 their male children, from a month old and upward, was to be reckoned,
 in order that a comparison might be instituted with that of the
 Levites, for the formal adoption of the latter as substitutes for the
 first-born. The Levites, amounting to twenty-two thousand, were given
 in exchange for an equal number of the first-born from the other
 tribes, leaving an excess of two hundred seventy-three; and as there
 were no substitutes for these, they were redeemed at the rate of five
 shekels for each 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:15,16">Nu 18:15, 16</A>).

 Every Israelite would naturally wish that his son might be redeemed by 
 a Levite without the payment of this tax, and yet some would have to 
 incur the expense, for there were not Levites enough to make an equal 
 exchange. Jewish writers say the matter was determined by lot, in this 
 manner: Moses put into an urn twenty-two thousand pieces of parchment,
 on each of which he wrote "a son of Levi," and two hundred 
 seventy-three more, containing the words, "five shekels." These being 
 shaken, he ordered each of the first-born to put in his hand and take 
 out a slip. If it contained the first inscription, the boy was redeemed 
 by a Levite; if the latter, the parent had to pay. The ransom-money, 
 which, reckoning the shekel at half a crown, would amount to 
 12<I>s.</I> 6<I>d.</I> each, was appropriated to the use of the 
 sanctuary. The excess of the general over the Levitical first-born is 
 so small, that the only way of accounting for it is, by supposing those 
 first-born only were counted as were males remaining in their parents' 
 household, or that those first-born only were numbered which had been 
 born since the departure from Egypt, when God claimed all the 
 first-born as his special property.</P>

 equivalent for all the firstlings of the cattle which the Israelites at
 that time possessed. In consequence of this exchange the firstlings
 were not brought then, as afterwards, to the altar and the priests.</P>

 such necessary occasions into the holy place. This was an exception to
 the general rule, which prohibited the entrance of any but the high
 priest. But when the cloud removed from the tabernacle, the sanctuary
 might be entered by the common priests, as to them was reserved the

 <B>2. Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp
 every leper</B>--The exclusion of leprous persons from the camp in the
 wilderness, as from cities and villages afterwards, was a sanitary
 measure taken according to prescribed rules 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:1-14:57">Le 13:1-14:57</A>). 

 This exclusion of lepers from society has been acted upon ever since;
 and it affords almost the only instance in which any kind of attention 
 is paid in the East to the prevention of contagion. The usage still 
 more or less prevails in the East among people who do not think the 
 least precaution against the plague or cholera necessary; but judging 
 from personal observation, we think that in Asia the leprosy has now 
 much abated in frequency and virulence. It usually appears in a 
 comparatively mild form in Egypt, Palestine, and other countries where 
 the disorder is, or was, endemic. Small societies of excluded lepers 
 live miserably in paltry huts. Many of them are beggars, going out into 
 the roads to solicit alms, which they receive in a wooden bowl; 
 charitable people also sometimes bring different articles of food, 
 which they leave on the ground at a short distance from the hut of the 
 lepers, for whom it is intended. They are generally obliged to wear a 
 distinctive badge that people may know them at first sight and be 
 warned to avoid them. Other means were adopted among the ancient Jews 
 by putting their hand on their mouth and crying, "Unclean, unclean"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:45">Le 13:45</A>]. 

 But their general treatment, as to exclusion from society, was the same
 as now described. The association of the lepers, however, in this 
 passage, with those who were subject only to ceremonial uncleanness, 
 shows that one important design in the temporary exile of such persons 
 was to remove all impurities that reflected dishonor on the character 
 and residence of Israel's King. And this vigilant care to maintain 
 external cleanliness in the people was typically designed to teach them 
 the practice of moral purity, or cleansing themselves from all 
 filthiness of the flesh and spirit. The regulations made for ensuring 
 cleanliness in the camp suggest the adoption of similar means for 
 maintaining purity in the church. And although, in large communities of 
 Christians, it may be often difficult or delicate to do this, the 
 suspension or, in flagrant cases of sin, the total excommunication of 
 the offender from the privileges and communion of the church is an 
 imperative duty, as necessary to the moral purity of the Christian as 
 the exclusion of the leper from the camp was to physical health and 
 ceremonial purity in the Jewish church.</P>

 Lord," it is implied, in the case supposed, that the offense has been
 aggravated by prevaricating--by a false oath, or a fraudulent lie in
 denying it, which is a "trespass" committed against God, who is the
 sole judge of what is falsely sworn or spoken

 passage, conscience-smitten, or brought to a sense and conviction of
 his evil conduct.
 (See on

 <A HREF="JFB03.htm#Le6_2">Le 6:2</A>). 

 In that case, there must be: first, confession, a penitential
 acknowledgment of sin; secondly, restitution of the property, or the 
 giving of an equivalent, with the additional fine of a fifth part, both 
 as a compensation to the person defrauded, and as a penalty inflicted 
 on the injurer, to deter others from the commission of similar 
 trespasses.  (See on

 <A HREF="JFB02.htm#Ex22_1">Ex 22:1</A>).
 
 The difference between the law recorded in that passage and this is
 that the one was enacted against flagrant and determined thieves, the
 other against those whose necessities might have urged them into fraud,
 and whose consciences were distressed by their sin. This law also
 supposes the injured party to be dead, in which case, the compensation
 due to his representatives was to be paid to the priest, who, as God's
 deputy, received the required satisfaction.</P>

 <B>12-15. if any man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against
 him</B>--This law was given both as a strong discouragement to conjugal
 infidelity on the part of a wife, and a sufficient protection of her
 from the consequences of a hasty and groundless suspicion on the part
 of the husband. His suspicions, however, were sufficient in the absence
 of witnesses 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:10">Le 20:10</A>) 

 to warrant the trial described; and the course of proceeding to be
 followed was for the jealous husband to bring his wife unto the priest 
 with an offering of barley meal, because none were allowed to approach 
 the sanctuary empty handed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:15">Ex 23:15</A>).

 signified joy, and frankincense which denoted acceptance 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:2">Ps 141:2</A>).
 
 But on the occasion referred to, both these ingredients were to be
 excluded, partly because it was a solemn appeal to God in distressing
 circumstances, and partly because it was a sin offering on the part of
 the wife, who came before God in the character of a real or suspected
 offender.</P>

 <B>29. This is the law of jealousies</B>--Adultery discovered and proved
 was punished with death. But strongly suspected cases would occur, and
 this law made provision for the conviction of the guilty person. It
 was, however, not a trial conducted according to the forms of judicial
 process, but an ordeal through which a suspected adulteress was made to
 go--the ceremony being of that terrifying nature, that, on the known
 principles of human nature, guilt or innocence could not fail to
 appear. From the earliest times, the jealousy of Eastern people has
 established ordeals for the detection and punishment of suspected
 unchastity in wives. The practice was deep-rooted as well as universal.
 And it has been thought, that the Israelites being strongly biassed in
 favor of such usages, this law of jealousies "was incorporated among
 the other institutions of the Mosaic economy, in order to free it from
 the idolatrous rites which the heathens had blended with it." Viewed in
 this light, its sanction by divine authority in a corrected and
 improved form exhibits a proof at once of the wisdom and condescension
 of God.</P>

 <B>2-8. When either man or woman .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall vow a vow of a Nazarite</B>--that
 is, "a separated one," from a <I>Hebrew</I> word, "to separate." It was used
 to designate a class of persons who, under the impulse of extraordinary
 piety and with a view to higher degrees of religious improvement,
 voluntarily renounced the occupations and pleasures of the world to
 dedicate themselves unreservedly to the divine service. The vow might
 be taken by either sex, provided they had the disposal of themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+30:4">Nu 30:4</A>), 
 
 and for a limited period--usually a month or a lifetime

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:5,Jdg+16:17">Jud 13:5; 16:17</A>).

 We do not know, perhaps, the whole extent of abstinence they practised.
 But they separated themselves from three things in particular--namely, 
 from wine, and all the varieties of vinous produce; from the 
 application of a razor to their head, allowing their hair to grow; and 
 from pollution by a dead body. The reasons of the self-restrictions are 
 obvious. The use of wine tended to inflame the passions, intoxicate the 
 brain, and create a taste for luxurious indulgence. The cutting off the 
 hair being a recognized sign of uncleanness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:8,9">Le 14:8, 9</A>),

 its unpolled luxuriance was a symbol of the purity he professed.
 Besides, its extraordinary length kept him in constant remembrance of 
 his vow, as well as stimulated others to imitate his pious example. 
 Moreover, contact with a dead body, disqualifying for the divine 
 service, the Nazarite carefully avoided such a cause of unfitness, and, 
 like the high priest, did not assist at the funeral rites of his 
 nearest relatives, preferring his duty to God to the indulgence of his 
 strongest natural affections.</P>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+15:13,Nu+19:11">Le 15:13;
 Nu 19:11</A>).

 But by the terms of this law an accidental defilement vitiated the
 whole of his previous observances, and he was required to begin the 
 period of his Nazaritism afresh. But even this full completion did not 
 supersede the necessity of a sin offering at the close. Sin mingles 
 with our best and holiest performances, and the blood of sprinkling is 
 necessary to procure acceptance to us and our services.</P>

 but the hair was to be carefully kept and brought to the door of the
 sanctuary. Then after the presentation of sin offerings and burnt 
 offerings, it was put under the vessel in which the peace offerings 
 were boiled; and the priest, taking the shoulder

 "bless and keep us"; of the Son, to be "gracious to us"; and of the
 Holy Ghost, to "give us peace." And because the benediction, though
 pronounced by the lips of a fellow man, derived its virtue, not from
 the priest but from God, the encouraging assurance was added, "I the

 <B>1. the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle</B>--Those who take
 the word "day" as literally pointing to the exact date of the
 completion of the tabernacle, are under a necessity of considering the
 sacred narrative as disjointed, and this portion of the history from
 the seventh to the eleventh chapters as out of its place--the
 chronology requiring that it should have immediately followed the
 fortieth chapter of Exodus, which relates that the tabernacle was
 reared on the first day of the first month of the second year

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+40:17">Ex 40:17</A>]. 

 But that the term "day" is used in a loose and indeterminate sense, as
 synonymous with <I>time,</I> is evident from the fact that not one day 
 but several days were occupied with the transactions about to be
 described. So that this chapter stands in its proper place in the order 
 of the history; after the tabernacle and its instruments (the altar and 
 its vessels) had been anointed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:10">Le 8:10</A>),
 
 the Levites separated to the sacred service--the numbering of the
 people, and the disposal of the tribes about the tabernacle, in a
 certain order, which was observed by the princes in the presentation of
 their offerings. This would fix the period of the imposing ceremonial
 described in this chapter about a month after the completion of the
 tabernacle.</P>

 <B>2, 3. the princes of Israel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. brought their offering before the
 Lord</B>--The finishing of the sacred edifice would, it may well be
 imagined, be hailed as an auspicious occasion, diffusing great joy and
 thankfulness throughout the whole population of Israel. But the leading
 men, not content with participating in the general expression of
 satisfaction, distinguished themselves by a movement, which, while
 purely spontaneous, was at the same time so appropriate in the
 circumstances and so equal in character, as indicates it to have been
 the result of concerted and previous arrangement. It was an offer of
 the means of carriage, suitable to the migratory state of the nation in
 the wilderness, for transporting the tabernacle from place to place. In
 the pattern of that sacred tent exhibited on the mount, and to which
 its symbolic and typical character required a faithful adherence, no
 provision had been made for its removal in the frequent journeyings of
 the Israelites. That not being essential to the plan of the divine
 architect, it was left to be accomplished by voluntary liberality; and
 whether we look to the judicious character of the gifts, or to the
 public manner in which they were presented, we have unmistakable
 evidence of the pious and patriotic feelings from which they emanated
 and the extensive interest the occasion produced. The offerers were
 "the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers," and the
 offering consisted of six covered wagons or little cars, and twelve
 oxen, two of the princes being partners in a wagon, and each furnishing
 an ox.</P>

 <B>4, 5. The Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Take it of them, that they
 may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation</B>--They
 exhibited a beautiful example to all who are great in dignity and in
 wealth, to be foremost in contributing to the support and in promoting
 the interests of religion. The strictness of the injunctions Moses had
 received to adhere with scrupulous fidelity to the divine model of the
 tabernacle probably led him to doubt whether he was at liberty to act
 in this matter without orders. God, however, relieved him by declaring
 His acceptance of the freewill offerings, as well as by giving
 instructions as to the mode of their distribution among the Levites. It
 is probable that in doing so, He merely sanctioned the object for which
 they were offered, and that the practical wisdom of the offerers had
 previously determined that they should be distributed "unto the
 Levites, to every man according to his service"--that is, more or fewer
 were assigned to each of the Levitical divisions, as their department
 of duty seemed to require. This divine sanction it is of great
 importance to notice, as establishing the principle, that while in the
 great matters of divine worship and church government we are to adhere
 faithfully to the revealed rule of faith and duty, minor arrangements
 respecting them may be lawfully made, according to the means and
 convenience of God's people in different places. "There is a great deal
 left to human regulation--appendages of undoubted convenience, and
 which it were as absurd to resist on the ground that an express warrant
 cannot be produced for them, as to protest against the convening of the
 people to divine service, because there is no Scripture for the
 erection and ringing of a church bell"

 <B>6-9. Moses took the wagons and the oxen</B>--The <I>Hebrew</I> word seems to
 be fairly rendered by the word "wagons." Wheel carriages of some kind
 are certainly intended; and as they were covered, the best idea we can
 form of them is, that they bore some resemblance to our covered wagons.
 That wheel carriages were anciently used in Egypt, and in what is now
 Asiatic Turkey, is attested, not only by history, but by existing
 sculptures and paintings. Some of these the Israelites might have
 brought with them at their departure; and others, the skilful artisans,
 who did the mechanical work of the tabernacle, could easily have
 constructed, according to models with which they had been familiar.
 Each wagon was drawn by two oxen, and a greater number does not seem to
 have been employed on any of the different occasions mentioned in
 Scripture. Oxen seem to have been generally used for draught in ancient
 times among other nations as well as the Hebrews; and they continue
 still to be employed in dragging the few carts which are in use in some
 parts of Western Asia [K<FONT SIZE=-1>ITTO</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>gave them unto the Levites</B>--The principle of distribution was natural
 and judicious. The Merarites had twice the number of wagons and oxen
 appropriated to them that the Gershonites had, obviously because, while
 the latter had charge only of the coverings and hangings (the light but
 precious and richly-embroidered drapery,

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:24-26">Nu 4:24-26</A>]) 

 the former were appointed to transport all the heavy and bulky
 materials (the boards, bars, pillars, and sockets) in short, all the 
 larger articles of furniture

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:31,32">Nu 4:31, 32</A>].

 Whoever thinks only of the enormous weight of metal, the gold, silver,
 brass, &c., that were on the bases, chapiters, and pillars, &c., will
 probably come to the conclusion that four wagons and eight oxen were 
 not nearly sufficient for the conveyance of so vast a load. Besides, 
 the Merarites were not very numerous, as they amounted only to 
 thirty-two hundred men from thirty years and upward

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:44">Nu 4:44</A>]; 

 and, therefore, there is reason to suppose that a much greater number
 of wagons would afterwards be found necessary, and be furnished, than 
 were given on this occasion [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALMET</FONT>].  Others, who 
 consider the full number of wagons and oxen to be stated in the sacred 
 record, suppose that the Merarites may have carried many of the smaller 
 things in their hands--the sockets, for instance, which being each a 
 talent weight, was one man's burden

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:23">2Ki 5:23</A>). 

 The Kohathites had neither wheeled vehicles nor beasts of burden
 assigned them, because, being charged with the transport of the 
 furniture belonging to the holy place, the sacred worth and character 
 of the vessels entrusted to them (see on

 <A HREF="#Nu4_15">Nu 4:15</A>)
 
 demanded a more honorable mode of conveyance. These were carried by
 those Levites shoulder high. Even in this minute arrangement every
 reflecting reader will perceive the evidence of divine wisdom and
 holiness; and a deviation from the prescribed rule of duty led, in one
 recorded instance, to a manifestation of holy displeasure, calculated
 to make a salutary and solemn impression

 kind of offerings, that the altars of burnt offering and incense are
 both referred to. This was not the first or proper <I>dedication</I> of

 certain yearly festival, to sit upon their thrones in great state, when
 the princes and nobles, from all parts of their dominions, appear
 before them with tributary presents, which form a large proportion of
 their royal revenue. And in the offering of all gifts or presents to
 great personages, every article is presented singly and with
 ostentatious display. The tabernacle being the palace of their great
 King, as well as the sanctuary of their God, the princes of Israel may
 be viewed, on the occasion under notice, as presenting their tributary
 offerings, and in the same manner of successive detail, which accords
 with the immemorial usages of the East. A day was set apart for each,
 as much for the imposing solemnity and splendor of the ceremony, as for
 the prevention of disorder and hurry; and it is observable that, in the
 order of offering, regard was paid to priority not of birth, but of
 rank and dignity as they were ranked in the camp--beginning at the
 east, proceeding to the south, then to the west, and closing with the
 north, according to the course of the sun.</P>

 private means, but from the general contributions of each tribe. Some
 parts of the offering, as the animals for sacrifice, were for the ritual
 service of the day, the peace offerings being by much the most numerous,
 as the princes and some of the people joined with the priests afterwards
 in celebrating the occasion with festive rejoicing. Hence the feast of
 dedication became afterwards an anniversary festival. Other parts of the
 offering were intended for permanent use, as utensils necessary in the
 service of the sanctuary; such as an immense platter and bowl

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+25:29">Ex 25:29</A>). 

 Being of silver, they were to be employed at the altar of burnt
 offering, or in the court, not in the holy place, all the furniture of 
 which was of solid or plated gold; and there was a golden spoon, the 
 contents of which show its destination to have been the altar of 
 incense. The word rendered "spoon" means a hollow cup, in the shape of 
 a hand, with which the priests on ordinary occasions might lift a 
 quantity from the incense-box to throw on the altar-fire, or into the 
 censers; but on the ceremonial on the day of the annual atonement no 
 instrument was allowed but the high priest's own hands

 <B>18-83. On the second day Nethaneel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. prince of Issachar, did
 offer</B>--This tribe being stationed on the right side of Judah, offered
 next through its representative; then Zebulun, which was on the left
 side; and so on in orderly succession, every tribe making the same kind
 of offering and in the same amount, to show that, as each was under
 equal obligation, each rendered an equal tribute. Although each
 offering made was the same in quantity as well as quality, a separate
 notice is given of each, as a separate day was appointed for the
 presentation, that equal honor might be conferred on each, and none
 appear to be overlooked or slighted. And as the sacred books were
 frequently read in public, posterity, in each successive age, would
 feel a livelier interest in the national worship, from the permanent
 recognition of the offerings made by the ancestors of the respective
 tribes. But while this was done in one respect, as subjects offering
 tribute to their king, it was in another respect, a purely religious
 act. The vessels offered were for a sacrificial use--the animals
 brought were clean and fit for sacrifice, both symbolically denoting,
 that while God was to dwell among them as their Sovereign, they were a
 holy people, who by this offering dedicated themselves to God.</P>

 <B>84-88. This was the dedication of the altar</B>--The inspired 
 historian here sums up the separate items detailed in the preceding 
 narrative, and the aggregate amount is as follows: 12 silver chargers, 
 each weighing 130 shekels equals 1560; 12 silver bowls, each 70 shekels 
 equals 840: total weight. A silver charger at 130 shekels, reduced to 
 troy weight, made 75 ounces, 9 pennyweights, 168.31 grains; and a 
 silver bowl at 70 shekels amounts to 40 ounces, 12 pennyweights, 
 2121.31 grains.  The total weight of the 12 chargers is therefore 905 
 ounces, 16 pennyweights, 33.11 grains; and that of the 12 bowls 487 
 ounces, 14 pennyweights, 204.31 grains; making the total weight of 
 silver vessels 1393 ounces, 10 pennyweights, 237.31 grains; which at 
 5<I>s.</I> per ounce, is equal to &pound;383 1<I>s.</I> 
 8&frac12;<I>d.</I> The 12 golden spoons, allowing each to be 5 ounces, 
 16 pennyweights, 3.31 grains, amount to 69 ounces, 3 pennyweights, 
 135.31 grains, which, at &pound;4 per ounce, is equal to &pound;320
 14<I>s.</I> 10&frac12;<I>d.</I>, and added to the amount of the silver, 
 makes a total of &pound703 16<I>s.</I> 6&frac12;<I>d.</I> Besides these 
 the offerings comprised twelve bullocks, twelve rams, twelve lambs, 
 twenty-four goats, sixty rams, sixty he-goats, sixty lambs--amounting 
 in all to 240. So large a collection of cattle offered for sacrifice on 
 one occasion proves both the large flocks of the Israelites and the
 abundance of pastures which were then, and still are, found in the 
 valleys that lie between the Sinaitic Mountains. All travellers attest 
 the luxuriant verdure of those extensive wadies; and that they were 
 equally or still more rich in pasture anciently, is confirmed by the 
 numerous flocks of the Amalekites, as well as of Nabal, which were fed 
 in the wilderness of Paran

 special license was granted to Moses, who, though not a priest, was
 admitted into the sanctuary to receive instructions from his heavenly
 King as occasion demanded.

 <B>then he heard the voice of one speaking to him</B>--Though standing on the

 this circumstance is important as the fulfilment, at the dedication of
 the tabernacle, of a special promise made by the Lord Christ Himself,
 the Angel of the Covenant, commanding its erection 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+25:22">Ex 25:22</A>).

 idea that the following instructions were given to Moses while he was
 within the tabernacle of the congregation, after the princes had
 completed their offering. But from the tenor of the instructions, it is
 more likely that they were given immediately after the Levites had been
 given to the priests

 be lighted, when the other things in the sanctuary began to be applied

 of lights

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:19">2Pe 1:19</A>).

 And the course he was ordered to follow was first to light the middle

 <B>6, 7. Take the Levites .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and cleanse them</B>--This passage describes
 the consecration of the Levites. Although the tribe was to be devoted
 to the divine service, their hereditary descent alone was not a
 sufficient qualification for entering on the duties of the sacred
 office. They were to be set apart by a special ceremony, which,
 however, was much simpler than that appointed for the priests; neither
 washing nor anointing, nor investiture with official robes, was
 necessary. Their purification consisted, along with the offering of the
 requisite sacrifices

 of the Israelites could do this, a select portion of them must be
 meant. This party, who laid their hands upon the Levites, are supposed
 by some to have been the first-born, who by that act, transferred their
 peculiar privilege of acting as God's ministers to the Levitical tribe;
 and by others, to have been the princes, who thus blessed them. It
 appears, from this passage, that the imposition of hands was a ceremony
 used in consecrating persons to holy offices in the ancient, as, from

 bringing the Levites one by one to the altar, directed them to make
 some simple movements of their persons, analogous to what was done at
 the presentation of the wave offerings before the Lord. Thus were they
 first devoted as an offering to God, and by Him surrendered to the
 priests to be employed in His service. The consecration ceremonial was
 repeated in the case of every Levite who was taken (as was done at a
 later period) to assist the priests in the tabernacle and temple.

 <B>2-5. Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his
 appointed season,</B> &c.--The date of this command to keep the passover
 in the wilderness was given shortly after the erection and consecration
 of the tabernacle and preceded the numbering of the people by a month.
 (Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:1,Nu+1:1,2">Nu 9:1
 with Nu 1:1, 2</A>).

 But it is narrated after that transaction in order to introduce the
 notice of a particular case, for which a law was provided to meet the 
 occasion. This was the first observance of the passover since the 
 exodus; and without a positive injunction, the Israelites were under no 
 obligation to keep it till their settlement in the land of Canaan

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:25">Ex 12:25</A>). 

 The anniversary was kept on the exact day of the year on which they,
 twelve months before, had departed from Egypt; and it was marked by all 
 the peculiar rites--the he lamb and the unleavened bread. The materials 
 would be easily procured--the lambs from their numerous flocks and the 
 meal for the unleavened bread, by the aid of Jethro, from the land of 
 Midian, which was adjoining their camp

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:1">Ex 3:1</A>). 

 But their girded loins, their sandaled feet, and their staff in their
 hand, being mere circumstances attending a hurried departure and not 
 essential to the rite, were not repeated. It is supposed to have been 
 the only observance of the feast during their forty years' wandering; 
 and Jewish writers say that, as none could eat the passover except they 
 were circumcised

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:43,44,48">Ex 12:43, 44, 48</A>),

 <B>6, 7. there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a
 man</B>--To discharge the last offices to the remains of deceased relatives
 was imperative; and yet attendance on a funeral entailed ceremonial
 defilement, which led to exclusion from all society and from the camp
 for seven days. Some persons who were in this situation at the arrival
 of the first paschal anniversary, being painfully perplexed about the
 course of duty because they were temporarily disqualified at the proper
 season, and having no opportunity of supplying their want were liable
 to a total privation of all their privileges, laid their case before
 Moses. Jewish writers assert that these men were the persons who had

 circle or unable by distance to keep the passover on the anniversary
 day, a special license was granted of observing it by themselves on the

 the cloud indicated the command of God: and whatsoever irksomeness they
 might have felt in remaining long stationary in camp, "when the cloud
 tarried upon the tabernacle many days, they kept the charge of the

 spirit of obedience! and happy for all if, through the wilderness of

 the directions of God's Word!</P>

 form, in opposition to that of the Egyptian trumpets, with which the
 people were convened to the worship of Osiris and which were curved
 like rams' horns. Those which Moses made, as described by
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT> and
 represented on the arch of Titus, were straight, a cubit or more in
 length, the tubes of the thickness of a flute. Both extremities bore a
 close resemblance to those in use among us. They were of solid
 silver--so as, from the purity of the metal, to give a shrill, distinct
 sound; and there were two of them, probably because there were only two
 sons of Aaron; but at a later period the number was greatly increased

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+6:8,2Ch+5:12">Jos 6:8;

 <B>3-7. when they shall blow with them</B>--There seem to have been signals
 made by a difference in the loudness and variety in the notes, suited
 for different occasions, and which the Israelites learned to
 distinguish. A simple uniform sound by both trumpets summoned a general
 assembly of the people; the blast of a single trumpet convoked the
 princes to consult on public affairs; notes of some other kind were
 made to sound an alarm, whether for journeying or for war. One alarm
 was the recognized signal for the eastern division of the camp (the
 tribes of Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun) to march; two alarms gave the
 signal for the southern to move; and, though it is not in our present
 <I>Hebrew</I> text, the <I>Septuagint</I> has, that on three alarms being
 sounded, those on the west; while on four blasts, those on the north
 decamped. Thus the greatest order and discipline were established in
 the Israelitish camp--no military march could be better regulated.</P>

 greater attention and more faithful observance, it was reserved to the
 priests alone, as the Lord's ministers; and as anciently in Persia and
 other Eastern countries the alarm trumpets were sounded from the tent of
 the sovereign, so were they blown from the tabernacle, the visible

 and in the circumstances it was an act of devout confidence in God. A
 solemn and religious act on the eve of a battle has often animated the 
 hearts of those who felt they were engaged in a good and just cause; 
 and so the blowing of the trumpet, being an ordinance of God, produced 
 that effect on the minds of the Israelites. But more is meant by the 
 words--namely, that God would, as it were, be aroused by the trumpet to 
 bless with His presence and aid.</P>

 eleven months and twenty-nine days. (Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:1">Ex 19:1</A>). 

 Besides the religious purposes of the highest importance to which their
 long sojourn at Sinai was subservient, the Israelites, after the 
 hardships and oppression of the Egyptian servitude, required an 
 interval of repose and refreshment.  They were neither physically nor 
 morally in a condition to enter the lists with the warlike people they 
 had to encounter before obtaining possession of Canaan. But the 
 wondrous transactions at Sinai--the arm of Jehovah so visibly displayed 
 in their favor--the covenant entered into, and the special blessings 
 guaranteed, beginning a course of moral and religious education which 
 moulded the character of this people--made them acquainted with their 
 high destiny and inspired them with those noble principles of divine 
 truth and righteousness which alone make a great nation.</P>

 described

 but, as the vast horde is represented here in actual migration, let us
 notice the extraordinary care that was taken for ensuring the safe 
 conveyance of the holy things. In the rear of Judah, which, with the 
 tribes of Issachar and Zebulun, led the van, followed the Gershonites 
 and Merarites with the heavy and coarser materials of the tabernacle. 
 Next in order were set in motion the flank divisions of Reuben and 
 Ephraim. Then came the Kohathites, who occupied the center of the 
 moving mass, bearing the sacred utensils on their shoulder. They were 
 so far behind the other portions of the Levitical body that these would 
 have time at the new encampment to rear the framework of the tabernacle 
 before the Kohathites arrived. Last of all, Dan, with the associated 
 tribes, brought up the rear of the immense caravan. Each tribe was 
 marshalled under its prince or chief and in all their movements rallied 
 around its own standard.</P>

 brother-in-law to Moses, seems to have sojourned among the Israelites

 surprised many. But it should be recollected that the guidance of the
 cloud, though it showed the general route to be taken through the
 trackless desert, would not be so special and minute as to point out
 the places where pasture, shade, and water were to be obtained and
 which were often hid in obscure spots by the shifting sands. Besides,
 several detachments were sent off from the main body; the services of
 Hobab, not as a single Arab, but as a prince of a powerful clan, would

 <B>1. When the people complained it displeased the Lord,</B>
 &c.--Unaccustomed to the fatigues of travel and wandering into the
 depths of a desert, less mountainous but far more gloomy and desolate
 than that of Sinai, without any near prospect of the rich country that
 had been promised, they fell into a state of vehement discontent, which
 was vented at these irksome and fruitless journeyings. The displeasure
 of God was manifested against the ungrateful complainers by fire sent
 in an extraordinary manner. It is worthy of notice, however, that the
 discontent seems to have been confined to the extremities of the camp,
 where, in all likelihood, "the mixed multitude"
 [see on

 <A HREF="JFB02.htm#Ex12_38">Ex 12:38</A>]

 had their station. At the intercession of Moses, the appalling judgment
 ceased

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:2">Nu 11:2</A>],

 To dream of banquets and plenty of animal food in the desert becomes a
 disease of the imagination; and to this excitement of the appetite no 
 people are more liable than the natives of Egypt. But the Israelites 
 participated in the same feelings and expressed dissatisfaction with 
 the manna on which they had hitherto been supported, in comparison with 
 the vegetable luxuries with which they had been regaled in Egypt.</P>

 <B>5. We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt
 freely</B>--(See on

 <A HREF="JFB02.htm#Ex7_17">Ex 7:17</A>).

 The people of Egypt are accustomed to an almost exclusive diet of fish,
 either fresh or sun-dried, during the hot season in April and May--the 
 very season when the Israelites were travelling in this desert. Lower 
 Egypt, where were the brick-kilns in which they were employed, afforded 
 great facilities for obtaining fish in the Mediterranean, the lakes, 
 and the canals of the Nile.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>cucumbers</B>--The Egyptian species is smooth, of a cylindrical form, and
 about a foot in length. It is highly esteemed by the natives and when
 in season is liberally partaken of, being greatly mellowed by the
 influence of the sun.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>melons</B>--The watermelons are meant, which grow on the deep, loamy soil
 after the subsidence of the Nile; and as they afford a juicy and
 cooling fruit, all classes make use of them for food, drink, and
 medicine.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>leeks</B>--by some said to be a species of grass cresses, which is much
 relished as a kind of seasoning.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>onions</B>--the same as ours; but instead of being nauseous and affecting
 the eyes, they are sweet to the taste, good for the stomach, and form
 to a large extent the aliment of the laboring classes.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>garlic</B>--is now nearly if not altogether extinct in Egypt although it
 seems to have grown anciently in great abundance. The herbs now
 mentioned form a diet very grateful in warm countries where vegetables
 and other fruits of the season are much used. We can scarcely wonder
 that both the Egyptian hangers-on and the general body of the
 Israelites, incited by their clamors, complained bitterly of the want
 of the refreshing viands in their toilsome wanderings. But after all
 their experience of the bounty and care of God, their vehement longing
 for the luxuries of Egypt was an impeachment of the divine
 arrangements; and if it was the sin that beset them in the desert, it
 became them more strenuously to repress a rebellious spirit, as
 dishonoring to God and unbecoming their relation to Him as a chosen
 people.</P>

 <B>6-9. But now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there is nothing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. beside this manna</B>--Daily
 familiarity had disgusted them with the sight and taste of the
 monotonous food; and, ungrateful for the heavenly gift, they longed for
 a change of fare. It may be noticed that the resemblance of the manna
 to coriander seed was not in the color, but in the size and figure; and
 from its comparison to bdellium, which is either a drop of white gum or
 a white pearl, we are enabled to form a better idea of it. Moreover, it is
 evident, from the process of baking into cakes, that it could not have
 been the natural manna of the Arabian desert, for that is too gummy or
 unctuous to admit of being ground into meal. In taste it is said to
 have been like "wafers made with honey" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:31">Ex 16:31</A>), 

 and here to have the taste of fresh oil. The discrepancy in these
 statements is only apparent; for in the latter the manna is described 
 in its raw state; in the former, after it was ground and baked. The 
 minute description given here of its nature and use was designed to 
 show the great sinfulness of the people, in being dissatisfied with 
 such excellent food, furnished so plentifully and gratuitously.</P>

 incredulous spirit, surprising in one who had witnessed so many

 shrinking from the assumption of a public office, or being prevented by
 some ceremonial defilement. They, however, received the gifts of the

 east wind

 forcing them to change their course, wafted them over the Red Sea to
 the camp of Israel.

 <B>let them fall a day's journey</B>--If the journey of an individual is
 meant, this space might be thirty miles; if the inspired historian
 referred to the whole host, ten miles would be as far as they could
 march in one day in the sandy desert under a vertical sun. Assuming it
 to be twenty miles this immense cloud of quails 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:27">Ps 78:27</A>)

 covered a space of forty miles in diameter. Others reduce it to
 sixteen. But it is doubtful whether the measurement be from the center 
 or the extremities of the camp. It is evident, however, that the 
 language describes the countless number of these quails.

 ground above each other to that height--a supposition which would
 leave a vast quantity useless as food to the Israelites, who were
 forbidden to eat any animal that died of itself or from which the blood
 was not poured out. Others think that, being exhausted with a long
 flight, they could not fly more than three feet above the earth, and so
 were easily felled or caught. A more recent explanation applies the
 phrase, "two cubits high," not to the accumulation of the mass, but to
 the size of the individual birds. Flocks of large red-legged cranes,
 three feet high, measuring seven feet from tip to tip, have been
 frequently seen on the western shores of the Gulf of Akaba, or eastern
 arm of the Red Sea

 "great heaps." The collectors were probably one or two from each 
 family; and, being distrustful of God's goodness, they gathered not for 
 immediate consumption only, but for future use. In eastern and southern 
 seas, innumerable quails are often seen, which, when weary, fall down,

 The occasion of this seditious outbreak on the part of Miriam and Aaron
 against Moses was the great change made in the government by the 
 adoption of the seventy rulers

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:16">Nu 11:16</A>].

 and Miriam

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:20">Ex 15:20</A>);

 and, therefore, they considered the conduct of Moses, in exercising an

 Nu 14:13; 21:7;

 This observation might have been made to account for Moses taking no
 notice of their angry reproaches and for God's interposing so speedily
 for the vindication of His servant's cause. The circumstance of Moses
 recording an eulogium on a distinguishing excellence of his own
 character is not without a parallel among the sacred writers, when
 forced to it by the insolence and contempt of opponents

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:5,12:11,12">2Co 11:5; 12:11, 12</A>).

 and which diffused a general feeling of melancholy and grief throughout
 the camp, the impression was of very brief continuance. They rushed
 from one extreme of rashness and perversity to another, and the
 obstinacy of their rebellious spirit was evinced by their active
 preparations to ascend the hill, notwithstanding the divine warning
 they had received not to undertake that enterprise.

 promise. The entreaties of their prudent and pious leader, who
 represented to them that their enemies, scaling the other side of the
 valley, would post themselves on the top of the hill before them, were
 disregarded. How strangely perverse the conduct of the Israelites, who,
 shortly before, were afraid that, though their Almighty King was with
 them, they could not get possession of the land; and yet now they act
 still more foolishly in supposing that, though God were not with them,
 they could expel the inhabitants by their unaided efforts. The
 consequences were such as might have been anticipated. The Amalekites
 and Canaanites, who had been lying in ambuscade expecting their
 movement, rushed down upon them from the heights and became the
 instruments of punishing their guilty rebellion.</P>

 is evidently narrated as an instance of presumptuous sin. The mere
 gathering of sticks was not a sinful act and might be necessary for
 fuel to warm him or to make ready his food. But its being done on the
 Sabbath altered the entire character of the action. The law of the
 Sabbath being a plain and positive commandment, this transgression of
 it was a known and wilful sin, and it was marked by several
 aggravations. For the deed was done with unblushing boldness in broad
 daylight, in open defiance of the divine authority--in flagrant
 inconsistency with His religious connection with Israel, as the
 covenant-people of God; and it was an application to improper purposes
 of time, which God had consecrated to Himself and the solemn duties of
 religion. The offender was brought before the rulers, who, on hearing
 the painful report, were at a loss to determine what ought to be done.
 That they should have felt any embarrassment in such a case may seem
 surprising, in the face of the sabbath law 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:14">Ex 31:14</A>). 

 Their difficulty probably arose from this being the first public
 offense of the kind which had occurred; and the appeal might be made to 
 remove all ground of complaint--to produce a more striking effect, so 
 that the fate of this criminal might be a beacon to warn all Israelites 
 in the future.</P>

 the right of primogeniture, which had vested the hereditary dignity of
 the priesthood in the first-born of every family, with a view of
 transferring the hereditary exercise of the sacred functions to a
 particular branch of his own house; and that this gross instance of
 partiality to his own relations, to the permanent detriment of others,
 was a sufficient ground for refusing allegiance to his government. In
 addition to this grievance, another cause of jealousy and
 dissatisfaction that rankled in the breasts of the Reubenites was the

 malcontents had been incited by the artful representations of Korah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:11">Jude 11</A>),

 with whom the position of their camp on the south side afforded them
 facilities of frequent intercourse. In addition to his feeling of 
 personal wrongs, Korah participated in their desire (if he did not 
 originate the attempt) to recover their lost rights of primogeniture. 
 When the conspiracy was ripe, they openly and boldly declared its 
 object, and at the head of two hundred fifty princes, charged Moses
 with an ambitious and unwarrantable usurpation of authority, especially 
 in the appropriation of the priesthood, for they disputed the claim of 
 Aaron also to pre-eminence

 an expostulation was the more weighty coming from him who was a Levite

 <B>2-5. Speak unto the children of Israel</B>--The controversy with Moses and
 Aaron about the priesthood was of such a nature and magnitude as
 required a decisive and authoritative settlement. For the removal of
 all doubts and the silencing of all murmuring in the future regarding
 the holder of the office, a miracle was wrought of a remarkable
 character and permanent duration; and in the manner of performing it,
 all the people were made to have a direct and special interest.

 <B>take of every one .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. princes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. twelve rods</B>--As the princes,
 being the oldest sons of the chief family, and heads of their tribes,
 might have advanced the best claims to the priesthood, if that sacred
 dignity was to be shared among all the tribes, they were therefore
 selected, and being twelve in number--that of Joseph being counted only
 one--Moses was ordered to see that the name of each was inscribed--a
 practice borrowed from the Egyptians--upon his rod or wand of office.
 The name of Aaron rather than of Levi was used, as the latter name
 would have opened a door of controversy among the Levites; and
 as there was to be one rod only for the head of each tribe, the express
 appointment of a rod for Aaron determined him to be the head of that
 tribe, as well as that branch or family of the tribe to which the
 priestly dignity should belong. These rods were to be laid in the
 tabernacle close to the ark (compare

 forth without the camp</B>--He was the second or deputy high priest, and
 he was selected for this duty because the execution of it entailed
 temporary defilement, from which the acting high priest was to be
 preserved with the greatest care. It was led "forth without the camp,"
 in accordance with the law regarding victims laden with the sins of the
 people, and thus typical of Christ 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:12,Le+24:14">Heb 13:12;
 also Le 24:14</A>).

 The priest was to sprinkle the blood "seven times" before--literally,
 "towards" or "near" the tabernacle, a description which seems to imply
 either that he carried a portion of the blood in a basin to the door of
 the tabernacle 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:17">Le 4:17</A>), 

 or that in the act of sprinkling he turned his face towards the sacred
 edifice, being disqualified through the defiling influence of this 
 operation from approaching close to it.  By this attitude he indicated 
 that he was presenting an expiatory sacrifice, for the acceptance of 
 which he hoped, in the grace of God, by looking to the mercy seat. 
 Every part of it was consumed by fire except the blood used in 
 sprinkling, and the ingredients mixed with the ashes were the same as 
 those employed in the sprinkling of lepers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:4-7">Le 14:4-7</A>).

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+19:9">Nu 19:9</A>] 

 was applied. The case of a death is one; and as in every family which
 sustained a bereavement the members of the household became defiled, so 
 in an immense population, where instances of mortality and other cases 
 of uncleanness would be daily occurring, the water of separation must 
 have been in constant requisition. To afford the necessary supply of 
 the cleansing mixture, the Jewish writers say that a red heifer was 
 sacrificed every year, and that the ashes, mingled with the sprinkling 
 ingredients, were distributed through all the cities and towns of 
 Israel.</P>

 moral ground; and, therefore, the regulation has been generally
 supposed to have had a typical reference to the resurrection, on that
 day, of Christ, by whom His people are sanctified; while the process of
 ceremonial purification being extended over seven days, was intended to
 show that sanctification is progressive and incomplete till the arrival
 of the eternal Sabbath. Every one knowingly and presumptuously
 neglecting to have himself sprinkled with this water was guilty of an
 offense which was punished by excommunication.</P>

 very minute and trivial; but important ends, both of a religious and of
 a sanitary nature, were promoted by carrying the idea of pollution from
 contact with dead bodies to so great an extent. While it would
 effectually prevent that Egyptianized race of Israelites imitating the
 superstitious custom of the Egyptians, who kept in their houses the
 mummied remains of their ancestors, it ensured a speedy interment to
 all, thus not only keeping burial places at a distance, but removing
 from the habitations of the living the corpses of persons who died from
 infectious disorders, and from the open field the unburied remains of
 strangers and foreigners who fell in battle.</P>

 to the water of separation--of cleansing one person and defiling
 another--are very singular, and not capable of very satisfactory
 explanation. One important lesson, however, was thus taught, that its
 purifying efficacy was not inherent in itself, but arose from the
 divine appointment, as in other ordinances of religion, which are
 effectual means of salvation, not from any virtue in them, or in him
 that administers them, but solely through the grace of God communicated
 thereby.</P>

 figure of a serpent in brass, to be elevated on a pole or standard,
 that it might be seen at the extremities of the camp and that every

 visions and dreams; and Balaam's birth and residence in Mesopotamia,
 where the remains of patriarchal religion still lingered, account for
 his knowledge of the true God. His real character has long been a
 subject of discussion. Some, judging from his language, have thought
 him a saint; others, looking to his conduct, have described him as an
 irreligious charlatan; and a third class consider him a novice in the
 faith, who had a fear of God, but who had not acquired power over his
 passions [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGSTENBERG</FONT>].</P>

 according to his desires, he hoped by a second request to bend it, as
 he had already bent his own conscience, to his ruling passions of pride
 and covetousness. The permission granted to Balaam is in accordance
 with the ordinary procedure of Providence. God often gives up men to
 follow the impulse of their own lusts; but there is no approval in thus
 leaving them to act at the prompting of their own wicked hearts

 the middle of a plain history. Besides, the opening of the ass's mouth
 must have been an external act, and that, with the manifest tenor of

 The absence of any surprise at such a phenomenon on the part of Balaam

 number of Levites, who had no participation in the popular defections

 company of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Korah</B>--This declaration might be necessary because
 his death might have occurred about the time of that rebellion; and
 especially because, as the children of these conspirators were involved
 along with their fathers in the awful punishment, their plea appeared
 the more proper and forcible that their father did not die for any cause
 that doomed his family to lose their lives or their inheritance.

 young women perceived that the males only in families had been
 registered in the census. Because there were none in their household,
 their family was omitted. So they made known their grievance to Moses,
 and the authorities conjoined with him in administering justice. The
 case was important; and as the peculiarity of daughters being the sole
 members of a family would be no infrequent or uncommon occurrence, the
 law of inheritance, under divine authority, was extended not only to
 meet all similar cases, but other cases also--such as when there were
 no children left by the proprietor, and no brothers to succeed him. A
 distribution of the promised land was about to be made; and it is
 interesting to know the legal provision made in these comparatively
 rare cases for preserving a patrimony from being alienated to another
 tribe. (See on

 promised land, Moses was not privileged to cross the Jordan, but died
 on one of the Moabitic range of mountains, to which the general name of
 Abarim was given

 <B>11-15. And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt

 These observations are not prescribed in the law though they obtained
 in the practice of a later time. The beginning of the month was known, 
 not by astronomical calculations, but, according to Jewish writers, by 
 the testimony of messengers appointed to watch the first visible 
 appearance of the new moon; and then the fact was announced through the 
 whole country by signal-fires kindled on the mountain tops. The 
 new-moon festivals having been common among the heathen, it is probable 
 that an important design of their institution in Israel was to give the 
 minds of that people a better direction; and assuming this to have been 
 one of the objects contemplated, it will account for one of the kids 
 being offered unto the Lord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+28:15">Nu 28:15</A>),

 <B>1. in the seventh month</B>--of the ecclesiastical year, but the first
 month of the civil year, corresponding to our September. It was, in
 fact, the New Year's Day, which had been celebrated among the Hebrews
 and other contemporary nations with great festivity and joy and ushered
 in by a flourish of trumpets. This ordinance was designed to give a
 religious character to the occasion by associating it with some solemn
 observances. (Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:2,Le+23:24">Ex 12:2;
 Le 23:24</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you</B>--This made it a solemn
 preparation for the sacred feasts--a greater number of which were held
 during this month than at any other season of the year. Although the
 institution of this feast was described before, there is more
 particularity here as to what the burnt offering should consist of;
 and, in addition to it, a sin offering is prescribed. The special
 offerings, appointed for certain days, were not to interfere with the
 offerings usually requisite on these days, for in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+29:6">Nu 29:6</A>

 it is said that the daily offerings, as well as those for the first day
 of the month, were to take place in their ordinary course.</P>

 described 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:29,30">Le 16:29, 30</A>).

 But additional offerings seem to be noticed, namely, the large animal
 sacrifice for a general expiation, which was a sweet savor unto the 
 Lord, and the sin offering to atone for the sins that mingled with that 
 day's services. The prescriptions in this passage appear supplementary 
 to the former statement in Leviticus.</P>

 tabernacles. (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:34,35">Le 23:34, 35</A>).

 The feast was to last seven days, the first and last of which were to
 be kept as Sabbaths, and a particular offering was prescribed for each 
 day, the details of which are given with a minuteness suited to the 
 infant state of the church.  Two things are deserving of notice: First, 
 that this feast was distinguished by a greater amount and variety of 
 sacrifices than any other--partly because, occurring at the end of the 
 year, it might be intended to supply any past deficiencies--partly 
 because, being immediately after the ingathering of the fruits, it 
 ought to be a liberal acknowledgment--and partly, perhaps, because God 
 consulted the weakness of mankind, who naturally grow weary both of the 
 charge and labor of such services when they are long-continued, and 
 made them every day less toilsome and expensive [P<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ATRICK</FONT>]. Secondly, it will be remarked that the 
 sacrifices varied in a progressive ratio of decrease every day.</P>

 <B>35-40. On the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly</B>--The feast
 of tabernacles was brought to a close on the eighth day, which was the
 great day 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:37">Joh 7:37</A>).

 Besides the common routine sacrifices, there were special offerings
 appointed for that day though these were fewer than on any of the 
 preceding days; and there were also, as was natural on that occasion 
 when vast multitudes were convened for a solemn religious purpose, many 
 spontaneous gifts and services, so that there was full scope for the 
 exercise of a devout spirit in the people, both for their obedience to 
 the statutory offerings, and by the presentation of those which were 
 made by free will or in consequence of vows.</P>

 the statements made in this and the preceding chapter, it appears that
 the yearly offerings made to the altar at the public expense, without
 taking into account a vast number of voluntary vow and trespass
 offerings, were calculated at the following amount:--goats, fifteen;
 kids, twenty-one; rams, seventy-two; bullocks, one hundred thirty-two;
 lambs, 1,101; sum-total of animals sacrificed at public cost, 1,241.
 This, of course, is exclusive of the prodigious addition of lambs slain
 at the passover, which in later times, according to

 in a single year to the immense number of 255,600.</P>

 <B>1. This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded</B>--The subject of
 this chapter relates to vowing, which seems to have been an ancient
 usage, allowed by the law to remain, and by which some people declared
 their intention of offering some gift on the altar or abstaining from
 particular articles of meat or drink, of observing a private fast, or
 doing something to the honor or in the service of God, over and above
 what was authoritatively required. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+29:39">Nu 29:39</A>, 

 mention was made of "vows and freewill offerings," and it is probable,
 from the explanatory nature of the rules laid down in this chapter, 
 that these were given for the removal of doubts and difficulties which 
 conscientious persons had felt about their obligation to perform their 
 vows in certain circumstances that had arisen.</P>

 <A NAME="Nu30_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. If a man vow a vow unto the Lord</B>--A mere secret purpose of the mind
 was not enough to constitute a vow; it had to be actually expressed in
 words; and though a purely voluntary act, yet when once the vow was
 made, the performance of it, like that of every other promise, became
 an indispensable duty--all the more because, referring to a sacred
 thing, it could not be neglected without the guilt of prevarication and
 unfaithfulness to God.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he shall not break his word</B>--literally, "profane his word"--render it
 vain and contemptible 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+55:20,89:34">Ps 55:20; 89:34</A>).

 But as it would frequently happen that parties would vow to do things
 which were neither good in themselves nor in their power to perform, 
 the law ordained that their natural superiors should have the right of 
 judging as to the propriety of those vows, with discretionary power to 
 sanction or interdict their fulfilment. Parents were to determine in 
 the case of their children, and husbands in that of their wives--being, 
 however, allowed only a day for deliberation after the matter became 
 known to them; and their judgment, if unfavorable, released the devotee 
 from all obligation

 <B>3. If a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord, and bind herself by a
 bond, being in her father's house in her youth</B>--Girls only are
 specified; but minors of the other sex, who resided under the parental
 roof, were included, according to Jewish writers, who also consider the
 name "father" as comprehending all guardians of youth. We are also told
 that the age at which young people were deemed capable of vowing was
 thirteen for boys and twelve for girls. The judgment of a father or
 guardian on the vow of any under his charge might be given either by an
 expressed approval or by silence, which was to be construed as
 approval. But in the case of a husband who, after silence from day to
 day, should ultimately disapprove or hinder his wife's vow, the sin of
 non-performance was to be imputed to him and not to her

 <B>9. every vow of a widow</B>--In the case of a married woman, who, in the
 event of a separation from her husband, or of his death, returned, as
 was not uncommon, to her father's house, a doubt might have been
 entertained whether she was not, as before, subject to paternal
 jurisdiction and obliged to act with the paternal consent. The law
 ordained that the vow was binding if it had been made in her husband's
 lifetime, and he, on being made aware of it, had not interposed his
 veto 

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+30:10,11">Nu 30:10, 11</A>];

 as, for instance, she might have vowed, when not a widow, that she
 would assign a portion of her income to pious and charitable uses, of 
 which she might repent when actually a widow; but by this statute she 
 was required to fulfil the obligation, provided her circumstances 
 enabled her to redeem the pledge. The rules laid down must have been 
 exceedingly useful for the prevention or cancelling of rash vows, as 
 well as for giving a proper sanction to such as were legitimate in 
 their nature, and made in a devout, reflecting spirit.</P>

 <B>1, 2. the Lord spake unto Moses, Avenge the children of Israel of the
 Midianites</B>--a semi-nomad people, descended from Abraham and Keturah,
 occupying a tract of country east and southeast of Moab, which lay on
 the eastern coast of the Dead Sea. They seem to have been the principal
 instigators of the infamous scheme of seduction, planned to entrap the
 Israelites into the double crime of idolatry and licentiousness

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:1-3,17,18">Nu 25:1-3, 17, 18</A>]

 by which, it was hoped, the Lord would withdraw from that people the
 benefit of His protection and favor. Moreover, the Midianites had 
 rendered themselves particularly obnoxious by entering into a hostile 
 league with the Amorites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:21">Jos 13:21</A>). 

 The Moabites were at this time spared in consideration of Lot

 as dishonor had been done to God and an injury inflicted on His people.
 The interests were identical. God and His people have the same cause,

 the army

 was necessary to preside over the Levites, who accompanied the

 services and counsels.

 <B>holy instruments</B>--As neither the ark nor the Urim and Thummim were

 But, either diverging from his way to tamper with the Midianites, he
 remained among them without proceeding farther, to incite them against 
 Israel and to watch the effects of his wicked counsel; or, learning in 
 his own country that the Israelites had fallen into the snare which he 
 had laid and which he doubted not would lead to their ruin, he had, 
 under the impulse of insatiable greed, returned to demand his reward 
 from the Midianites. He was an object of merited vengeance. In the 
 immense slaughter of the Midianitish people--in the capture of their 
 women, children, and property and in the destruction of all their 
 places of refuge--the severity of a righteous God fell heavily on that 
 base and corrupt race. But, more than all others, Balaam deserved and 
 got the just reward of his deeds. His conduct had been atrociously 
 sinful, considering the knowledge he possessed, and the revelations he 
 had received, of the will of God. For any one in his circumstances to 
 attempt defeating the prophecies he had himself been the organ of 
 uttering, and plotting to deprive the chosen people of the divine favor 
 and protection, was an act of desperate wickedness, which no language 
 can adequately characterize.</P>

 enlightened regard to the best interests of Israel. No order had been
 given for the slaughter of the women, and in ancient war they were
 commonly reserved for slaves. By their antecedent conduct, however, the
 Midianitish women had forfeited all claims to mild or merciful
 treatment; and the sacred character, the avowed object of the war

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:2,3">Nu 31:2, 3</A>),

 made their slaughter necessary without any special order. But why "kill

 <B>1-5. the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead</B>--A complete conquest
 had been made of the country east of the Jordan, comprising "the land
 of Jazer," which formed the southern district between the Arnon and
 Jabbok and "the land of Gilead," the middle region between the Jabbok
 and Jarmouk, or Hieromax, including Bashan, which lay on the north of
 that river. The whole of this region is now called the Belka. It has
 always been famous for its rich and extensive pastures, and it is still
 the favorite resort of the Bedouin shepherds, who frequently contend
 for securing to their immense flocks the benefit of its luxuriant
 vegetation. In the camp of ancient Israel, Reuben and Gad were
 pre-eminently pastoral; and as these two tribes, being placed under the
 same standard, had frequent opportunities of conversing and arranging
 about their common concerns, they united in preferring a request that
 the trans-jordanic region, so well suited to the habits of a pastoral
 people, might be assigned to them.</P>

 <B>6-19. Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of
 Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here</B>--Their
 language was ambiguous; and Moses, suspicious that this proposal was an
 act of unbelief, a scheme of self-policy and indolence to escape the
 perils of warfare and live in ease and safety, addressed to them a
 reproachful and passionate remonstrance. Whether they had really
 meditated such a withdrawal from all share in the war of invasion, or
 the effect of their leader's expostulation was to drive them from their
 original purpose, they now, in answer to his impressive appeal,
 declared it to be their sincere intention to co-operate with their
 brethren; but, if so, they ought to have been more explicit at first.</P>

 <B>16. they came near</B>--The narrative gives a picturesque description
 of this scene. The suppliants had shrunk back, dreading from the
 undisguised emotions of their leader that their request would be
 refused. But, perceiving, from the tenor of his discourse, that his
 objection was grounded only on the supposition that they would not
 cross the Jordan to assist their brethren, they became emboldened to
 approach him with assurances of their goodwill.

 <B>We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our
 little ones</B>--that is, rebuild, repair. It would have been impossible
 within two months to found new cities, or even to reconstruct those
 which had been razed to the ground. Those cities of the Amorites were
 not absolutely demolished, and they probably consisted only of
 mud-built, or dry-stone walls.</P>

 reprisals; and as only forty thousand of the Reubenites and the
 Gadites, and a half of Manasseh, passed over the Jordan 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+4:13">Jos 4:13</A>),

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>go before the Lord to war</B>--The phrase was used in allusion to the
 order of march in which the tribes of Reuben and Gad immediately
 preceded the ark (see on

 <A HREF="#Nu2_10">Nu 2:10-31</A>),

 or to the passage over the Jordan, in which the ark stood in
 mid-channel, while all the tribes marched by in succession

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:4">Jos 3:4</A>),

 of course including those of Reuben and Gad, so that, literally, they
 <I>passed over before the Lord</I> and before the rest of Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+4:13">Jos 4:13</A>). 

 Perhaps, however, the phrase is used merely in a general sense to
 denote their marching on an expedition, the purpose of which was 
 blessed with the presence, and destined to promote the glory, of God. 
 The displeasure which Moses had felt on the first mention of their 
 proposal had disappeared on the strength of their solemn assurances. 
 But a lurking suspicion of their motives seems still to have been 
 lingering in his mind--he continued to speak to them in an admonitory 
 strain; and he concluded by warning them that in case of their failing 
 to redeem their pledge, the judgments of an offended God would 
 assuredly fall upon them. This emphatic caution against such an 
 eventuality throws a strong doubt on the honesty of their first 
 intentions; and yet, whether through the opposing attitude or the 
 strong invectives of Moses they had been brought to a better state of 
 mind, their final reply showed that now all was right.</P>

 as the express terms on which he assented to it, was announced by the
 leader to the public authorities. The pastoral country the two tribes
 had desired was to be granted them on condition that they would lend
 their aid to their brethren in the approaching invasion of Canaan. If
 they refused or failed to perform their promise, those possessions
 should be forfeited, and they themselves compelled to go across the
 Jordan and fight for a settlement like the rest of their brethren.</P>

 <B>33. half the tribe of Manasseh</B>--It is nowhere explained in the record
 how they were incorporated with the two tribes, or what broke this
 great tribe into two parts, of which one was left to follow the
 fortunes of its brethren in the settled life of the western hills,
 while the other was allowed to wander as a nomadic tribe over the
 pasture lands of Gilead and Bashan. They are not mentioned as
 accompanying Reuben and Gad in their application to Moses

 but as they also were a people addicted to pastoral pursuits and
 possessed as immense flocks as the other two, Moses invited the half of 
 them to remain, in consequence, probably, of finding that this region 
 was more than sufficient for the pastoral wants of the others, and he 
 may have given them the preference, as some have conjectured, for their 
 valorous conduct in the contests with the Amorites (compare

 may be said to form the winding up of the history of the travels of the
 Israelites through the wilderness; for the three following chapters
 relate to matters connected with the occupation and division of the
 promised land. As several apparent discrepancies will be discovered on
 comparing the records here given of the journeyings from Sinai with the
 detailed accounts of the events narrated in the Book of Exodus and the
 occasional notices of places that are found in that of Deuteronomy, it
 is probable that this itinerary comprises a list of only the <I>most
 important</I> stations in their journeys--those where they formed
 prolonged encampments, and whence they dispersed their flocks and herds
 to pasture on the adjacent plains till the surrounding herbage was
 exhausted. The catalogue extends from their departure out of Egypt to
 their arrival on the plains of Moab.

 The minute accuracy of the Scripture narrative, in corresponding so

 shown in describing the Israelites as proceeding by the only

 --The route, on breaking up the encampment at Sinai, led down Wady
 Sheikh; then crossing Jebel-et-Tih, which intersected the peninsula, 
 they descended into Wady Zalaka, pitching successively at two brief, 
 though memorable, stations

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:22">De 9:22</A>);
 
 then they encamped at Hazeroth ("unwalled villages"), supposed to be at
 Ain-Hadera (see on

 <A HREF="#Nu11_35">Nu 11:35</A>).

 Kadesh, or Kadesh-barnea, is supposed to be the great valley of the
 Ghor, and the city Kadesh to have been situated on the border of this 
 valley [B<FONT SIZE=-1>URCKHARDT</FONT>; R<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OBINSON</FONT>].  But as there are no less than <I>eighteen 
 stations</I> inserted between Hazeroth and Kadesh, and only eleven days 
 were spent in performing that journey

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+1:2">De 1:2</A>), 

 it is evident that the intermediate stations here recorded belong to
 another and totally different visit to Kadesh.  The first was when they 
 left Sinai in the second month

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:11,13:20">Nu 1:11; 13:20</A>),
 
 and were in Kadesh in August

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+1:45">De 1:45</A>),

 and "abode many days" in it. Then, murmuring at the report of the
 spies, they were commanded to return into the desert "by the way of the 
 Red Sea." The arrival at Kadesh, mentioned in this catalogue, 
 corresponds to the <I>second</I> sojourn at that place, being the 
 <I>first</I> month, or April

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:1">Nu 20:1</A>). 

 Between the two visits there intervened a period of thirty-eight years,
 during which they wandered hither and thither through all the region of 
 El-Tih ("wanderings"), often returning to the same spots as the 
 pastoral necessities of their flocks required; and there is the 
 strongest reason for believing that the stations named between Hazeroth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+33:8">Nu 33:8</A>) 
 
 and Kadesh 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+33:36">Nu 33:36</A>)

 belong to the long interval of wandering. No certainty has yet been
 attained in ascertaining the locale of many of these stations. There 
 must have been more than are recorded; for it is probable that those 
 only are noted where they remained some time, where the tabernacle was 
 pitched, and where Moses and the elders encamped, the people being 
 scattered for pasture in various directions. From Ezion-geber, for 
 instance, which stood at the head of the gulf of Akaba, to Kadesh, 
 could not be much less than the whole length of the great valley of the 
 Ghor, a distance of not less than a hundred miles, whatever might be 
 the exact situation of Kadesh; and, of course, there must have been 
 several intervening stations, though none are mentioned. The incidents 
 and stages of the rest of the journey to the plains of Moab are 
 sufficiently explicit from the preceding chapters.</P>

 cities to dwell in</B>--As the Levites were to have no territorial

 Canaan, they were to be distributed throughout the land in certain 
 cities appropriated to their use; and these cities were to be

 two verses refer to totally different things--the one to the extent of 
 the suburbs from the walls of the city, the other to the space of two 
 thousand cubits from their extremity. In point of fact, there was an 
 extent of ground, amounting to three thousand cubits, measured from the 
 wall of the city. One thousand were most probably occupied with 
 outhouses for the accommodation of shepherds and other servants, with 
 gardens, vineyards, or oliveyards. And these which were portioned out 
 to different families

 presence and counsels might calm or restrain the stormy passions of the

 <B>11. that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at

 the author of his death, existed from a very remote antiquity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:14,27:45">Ge 4:14; 27:45</A>).

 It seems to have been an established usage in the age of Moses; and
 although in a rude and imperfect state of society, it is a natural and 
 intelligible principle of criminal jurisprudence, it is liable to many 
 great abuses; the chief of the evils inseparable from it is that the 
 kinsman, who is bound in duty and honor to execute justice, will often 
 be precipitate--little disposed, in the heat of passion or under the 
 impulse of revenge, to examine into the circumstances of the case, to 
 discriminate between the premeditated purpose of the assassin and the 
 misfortune of the unintentional homicide. Moreover, it had a tendency, 
 not only to foster a vindictive spirit, but in case of the Goel being 
 unsuccessful in finding his victim, to transmit animosities and feuds 
 against his descendants from one generation to another. This is 
 exemplified among the Arabs in the present day. Should an Arab of one 
 tribe happen to kill one of another tribe, there is "blood" between the 
 tribes, and the stain can only be wiped out by the death of some 
 individual of the tribe with which the offense originated. Sometimes 
 the penalty is commuted by the payment of a stipulated number of sheep 
 or camels. But such an equivalent, though offered, is as often refused, 
 and blood has to be repaid only by blood.  This practice of Goelism 
 obtained among the Hebrews to such an extent that it was not perhaps 
 expedient to abolish it; and Moses, while sanctioning its continuance, 
 was directed, by divine authority, to make some special regulations, 
 which tended both to prevent the unhappy consequences of sudden and 
 personal vengeance, and, at the same time, to afford an accused person 
 time and means of proving his innocence.  This was the humane and 
 equitable end contemplated in the institution of cities of refuge. 
 There were to be six of these legalized asyla, three on the east of 
 Jordan, both because the territory there was equal in length, though 
 not in breadth, to Canaan, and because it might be more convenient for 
 some to take refuge across the border. They were appointed for the 
 benefit, not of the native Israelites only, but of all resident 
 strangers.</P>

 upon him any thing without laying of wait,</B> &c.--Under the 
 excitement of a sudden provocation, or violent passion, an injury might 
 be inflicted issuing in death; and for a person who had thus 
 undesignedly committed slaughter, the Levitical cities offered the 
 benefit of full protection.  Once having reached the nearest, for one 
 or other of them was within a day's journey of all parts of the land, 
 he was secure. But he had to "abide in it." His confinement within its 
 walls was a wise and salutary rule, designed to show the sanctity of 
 human blood in God's sight, as well as to protect the manslayer 
 himself, whose presence and intercourse in society might have provoked 
 the passions of the deceased's relatives.  But the period of his 
 release from this confinement was not until the death of the high 
 priest. That was a season of public affliction, when private sorrows 
 were sunk or overlooked under a sense of the national calamity, and 
 when the death of so eminent a servant of God naturally led all to 
 serious consideration about their own mortality. The moment, however, 
 that the refugee broke through the restraints of his confinement and 
 ventured beyond the precincts of the asylum, he forfeited the 
 privilege, and, if he was discovered by his pursuer, he might be slain 
 with impunity.</P>

 established by divine authority, was a vast improvement on the ancient
 practice of Goelism. By the appointment of cities of refuge, the
 manslayer was saved, in the meantime, from the blind and impetuous fury
 of vindictive relatives; but he might be tried by the local court, and,
 if proved guilty on sufficient evidence, condemned and punished as a
 murderer, without the possibility of deliverance by any pecuniary
 satisfaction. The enactment of Moses, which was an adaptation to the
 character and usages of the Hebrew people, secured the double advantage
 of promoting the ends both of humanity and of justice.</P>

 <B>1. the chief fathers of the families of the children of 
 Gilead</B>--Being the tribal governors in Manasseh, they consulted 
 Moses on a case that affected the public honor and interests of their 
 tribe. It related once more to the daughters of Zelophehad. Formerly 
 they had applied, at their own instance, to be recognized, for want of 
 male heirs in their family, as entitled to inherit their father's 
 property

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:1-11">Nu 27:1-11</A>];

 now the application was made on behalf of the tribe to which they
 belonged--that steps might be taken to prevent the alienation of their 
 patrimony by their alliance with husbands of another tribe. The 
 unrestricted marriages of daughters in such circumstances threatened 
 seriously to affect the tenure of land in Israel, as their inheritance 
 would go to their children, who, by the father's side, would belong to 
 another tribe, and thus lead, through a complication of interests and 
 the confusion of families, to an evil for which even the Jubilee could 
 not afford a remedy. [See on

 accordingly an enactment was made by which the daughters of Zelophehad, 
 while left to the free choice of their husbands, were restricted to 
 marry not only within their own tribe, but <I>within the family</I> of 
 their father's tribe--that is, one of their cousins. This restriction, 
 however, was imposed only on those who were heiresses. The law was not 
 applicable to daughters in different circumstances

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:22">1Ch 23:22</A>)

 --for they might marry into another tribe; but if they did so, they
 were liable to forfeit their patrimonial inheritance, which, on the 
 death of their father or brothers, went to the nearest of the family 
 kinsmen. Here was an instance of progressive legislation (see also

 in Israel, the enactments made being suggested by circumstances. But it
 is deserving of special notice that those additions to, or 
 modifications of, the law were confined to civil affairs; while the 
 slightest change was inadmissible in the laws relating to worship or 
 the maintenance of religion.</P>
