 T<FONT SIZE=-1>IME AND</FONT>
 P<FONT SIZE=-1>LACE OF</FONT>
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>RITING</FONT>.--This Epistle seems to have been written
 from Corinth [B<FONT SIZE=-1>IRKS</FONT>], subsequently to his first 
 imprisonment, when Paul was on his way to Nicopolis

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:12">Tit 3:12</A>)

 in Epirus, where he purposed passing the winter, shortly before his
 martyrdom, <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 67.  B<FONT SIZE=-1>IRKS</FONT> 
 thinks, from the similarity of the Epistle to Titus and First Timothy, 
 that both were written from the same place, Corinth, and at dates not 
 widely apart; First Timothy shortly after coming to Corinth, before he 
 had planned a journey to Epirus, the Epistle to Titus afterwards. The 
 journey to Crete and Ephesus for the bearers of his letters would be 
 easy from Corinth, and he could himself thence easily pass into Epirus.  
 He had shortly before visited Crete, wherein a Church existed (though 
 without due organization), the first foundation of which he may have 
 partly laid at his former visit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:7">Ac 27:7</A>,

 &c.), when on his way to his first imprisonment at Rome. That he 
 returned to the East after his first imprisonment appears most probable 
 from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:24,Phile+1:22">Php 2:24;
 Phm 22</A>.

 However, there may have been seeds of Christianity sown in Crete, even
 before his first visit, by the Cretans who heard Peter's preaching on 
 Pentecost

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:11">Ac 2:11</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 O<FONT SIZE=-1>CCASION OF</FONT> W<FONT SIZE=-1>RITING</FONT>.--Corrupt 
 elements soon showed themselves in the Cretan Church, similar to those 
 noticed in the Epistles to Timothy, as existing in the Ephesian Church, 
 Judaism, false pretensions to science, and practical ungodliness. Paul, 
 on his late visit, had left Titus in Crete to establish Church 
 government, and ordain <I>presbyters</I> (<I>deacons</I> are not 
 mentioned). Titus had been several times employed by Paul on a mission 
 to the Corinthian Churches, and had probably thence visited Crete, 
 which was within easy reach of Corinth. Hence the suitableness of his 
 selection by the apostle for the superintendence of the Cretan Church. 
 Paul now follows up with instructions by letter those he had already 
 given to Titus in person on the qualifications of elders, and the
 graces becoming the old, the young, and females, and warns him against
 the unprofitable speculations so rife in Crete. The national character
 of the Cretans was low in the extreme, as 
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>PIMENIDES</FONT>, quoted in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:12">Tit 1:12</A>,

 [<I>Histories,</I> 6.47.5], their <I>mendacity,</I> so much so, that 
 "to Cretanize" is another name for <I>to lie:</I> they were included in 
 the proverbial three infamous initials "K" or "C," "Cappadocia, Crete, 
 Cilicia."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 N<FONT SIZE=-1>OTICES OF</FONT> T<FONT SIZE=-1>ITUS</FONT>.--It is
 strange that he is never mentioned by this name in Acts, and there 
 seems none of those mentioned in that book who exactly answers to him. 
 He was a <I>Greek,</I> and therefore a Gentile

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:1,3">Ga 2:1, 3</A>),

 and converted by Paul 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:4">Tit 1:4</A>).

 He accompanied the apostle on the deputation sent from the Church of 
 Antioch to Jerusalem, to consult the apostles respecting the 
 circumcision of Gentile converts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:2">Ac 15:2</A>);

 and, agreeably to the decree of the council there, was not circumcised. 
 He was in company with Paul at Ephesus, whence he was sent to Corinth 
 to commence the collection for the Jerusalem saints, and to ascertain 
 the effect of the First Epistle on the Corinthians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:6-9,8:6,12:18">2Co 7:6-9; 8:6; 12:18</A>),

 and there showed an unmercenary spirit. He next proceeded to Macedon,
 where he joined Paul, who had been already eagerly expecting him at 
 Troas

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:12,13">2Co 2:12, 13</A>,
 
 "Titus my brother,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:6">2Co 7:6</A>).

 He was then employed by the apostle in preparing the collection for the 
 poor saints in Judea, and became the bearer of the Second Epistle to 
 the Corinthians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:16,17,23">2Co 8:16, 17, 23</A>).

 Paul in it calls him "my partner and fellow helper concerning you." His 
 being located in Crete

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:5">Tit 1:5</A>)

 was subsequent to Paul's first imprisonment, and shortly before the 
 second, about <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 67, ten years subsequent to the 
 last notice of him in Second Corinthians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:18">2Co 12:18</A>),

 <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 57. He probably met Paul, as the apostle 
 desired, at Nicopolis; for his subsequent journey into Dalmatia, thence 
 (or else from Rome, whither he may have accompanied Paul) would be more 
 likely, than from the distant Crete

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:10">2Ti 4:10</A>,

 written <I>subsequently to the Epistle to Titus</I>).  In the unsettled 
 state of things then, Titus' episcopal commission in Crete was to be 
 but temporary, Paul requiring the presence of Titus with himself, 
 whenever Artemas or Tychicus should arrive in Crete and set him free 
 from his duties there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Tradition represents him to have died peaceably in Crete, as
 archbishop of Gortyna, at an advanced age.</P>

 In 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:1">Ro 1:1</A>,

 there follows, "called to be an <I>apostle,</I>" which corresponds to
 the general designation of the office first, "<I>servant of</I> G<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OD</FONT>," here, followed by the special description, 
 "<I>apostle</I> of <I>Jesus Christ.</I>" The full expression of his 
 apostolic office answers, in both Epistles, to the design, and is a 
 comprehensive index to the contents. The <I>peculiar</I> form here 
 would never have proceeded from a forger.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>according to the faith</B>--rather, "for," "with a view to subserve the

 This election has its ground, not in anything belonging to those thus 
 distinguished, but in the purpose and will of God from everlasting

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:48">Ac 13:48</A>

 shows that all faith on the part of the elect, rests on the divine
 foreordination: they do not become <I>elect</I> by their faith, but 
 receive <I>faith,</I> and so become believers, because they are 
 <I>elect.</I>

 or even which has for its object mere earthly truth, not growth in the
 divine life. "Godliness," or "piety," is a term peculiar to the 
 Pastoral Epistles: a fact explained by the apostle having in them to 
 combat doctrine tending to "ungodliness"

 <B>set in order</B>--rather as <I>Greek,</I> "that thou mightest 
 <I>follow up</I> (the work begun by me), setting right the things that 
 are wanting," which I was unable to complete by reason of the shortness 
 of my stay in Crete. Christianity, doubtless, had long existed in
 Crete: there were some Cretans among those who heard Peter's preaching
 on Pentecost

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:11">Ac 2:11</A>).

 The number of Jews in Crete was large 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:10">Tit 1:10</A>),

 and it is likely that those scattered in the persecution of Stephen

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:19">Ac 11:19</A>)

 preached to them, as they did to the Jews of Cyprus, &c.  Paul also was 
 there on his voyage to Rome

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:7-12">Ac 27:7-12</A>).

 By all these instrumentalities the Gospel was sure to reach Crete. But 
 until Paul's later visit, after his first imprisonment at Rome, the 
 Cretan Christians were without Church organization. This Paul began, 
 and had commissioned (before leaving Crete) Titus to go on with, and 
 now reminds him of that commission.

 <B>as I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. appointed thee</B>--that is, as I directed 
 thee; prescribing as well the <I>act</I> of constituting elders, as 
 also the <I>manner</I> of doing so, which latter includes the 
 qualifications required in a presbyter presently stated. Those called 
 "elders" here are called "bishops" in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:7">Tit 1:7</A>.

 <I>Elder</I> is the term of <I>dignity</I> in relation to the college 
 of presbyters; <I>bishop</I> points to the <I>duties</I> of his office 
 in relation to the flock. From the unsound state of the Cretan 
 Christians described here, we see the danger of the want of Church 
 government. The appointment of presbyters was designed to check idle 
 <I>talk</I> and speculation, by setting forth the "faithful word."</P>

 The thing dwelt on here as the requisite in a bishop, is a good 
 reputation among those over whom he is to be set.  The immorality of 
 the Cretan professors rendered this a necessary requisite in one who 
 was to be a <I>reprover:</I> and their unsoundness in doctrine also 
 made needful great steadfastness in the faith

 there is no reference to the Father, but to Christ alone; and here
 there is no occasion for reference to <I>the Father</I> in the

 instrument of our being "saved"; our being so, then, is spoken of as an 
 <I>accomplished fact. Faith</I> is not mentioned, but only <I>God's</I> 
 part.  as Paul's object here is not to describe man's new state, but 
 the saving agency of <I>God</I> in bringing about that state,

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>of regeneration</B>--<I>designed</I> to be the visible instrument of
 regeneration. "The apostles are wont to draw an argument from the
 sacraments to prove the thing therein signified, because it ought to be
 a recognized principle among the godly, that God does not mark us with
 empty signs, but by His power inwardly makes good what He demonstrates
 by the outward sign. Wherefore baptism is congruously and truly called
 <I>the laver of regeneration.</I> We must connect the sign and thing
 signified, so as not to make the sign empty and ineffectual; and yet
 not, for the sake of honoring the sign, to detract from the Holy Spirit
 what is peculiarly His" [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>], 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:21">1Pe 3:21</A>).

 Adult candidates for baptism are presupposed to have had repentance and 
 faith (for Paul often assumes in faith and charity that those addressed 
 are what they profess to be, though in fact some of them were not so,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:11">1Co 6:11</A>),

 in which case baptism would be the visible "laver or regeneration" to 
 them, "faith being thereby <I>confirmed,</I> and grace 
 <I>increased,</I> by virtue of prayer to God" [Article XXVII, Church of 
 England]. Infants are <I>charitably presumed</I> to have received a 
 grace in connection with their Christian descent, in answer to the 
 <I>believing</I> prayers of their parents or guardians presenting them 
 for baptism, which grace is visibly sealed and increased by baptism, 
 "the laver of regeneration." They are <I>presumed</I> to be then 
 regenerated, until years of developed consciousness prove whether they 
 have been <I>actually</I> so or not. "Born of (from) water and (no 'of' 
 in <I>Greek</I>) the Spirit." The Word is the <I>remote</I> and 
 <I>anterior</I> instrument of the new birth; Baptism, the 
 <I>proximate</I> instrument. The Word, the instrument to the 
 individual; Baptism, in relation to the <I>Society</I> of Christians. 
 The laver of cleansing stood outside the door of the tabernacle, 
 wherein the priest had to wash before entering the Holy Place; so we 
 must wash in the laver of regeneration before we can enter the Church, 
 whose members are "a royal priesthood." "Baptism by the Spirit" 
 (whereof water baptism is the designed accompanying seal) makes the 
 difference between Christian baptism and that of John. As Paul 
 presupposes the outward Church is the visible community of the 
 redeemed, so he speaks of baptism on the supposition that it answers to 
 its idea; that all that is inward belonging to its completeness 
 accompanied the outward. Hence he here asserts of outward baptism 
 whatever is involved in the believing appropriation of the divine facts 
 which it symbolizes, whatever is realized when baptism fully 
 corresponds to its original design. So

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:27">Ga 3:27</A>;

 language holding good only of those in whom the inward living communion 
 and outward baptism coalesce. "Saved us" applies fully to those truly 
 regenerate alone; in a general sense it may include many who, though 
 put within reach of salvation, shall not finally be saved.  
 "Regeneration" occurs only once more in New Testament,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:28">Mt 19:28</A>,

 that is, <I>the new birth of the heaven and earth</I> at Christ's 
 second coming to renew all material things, the human body included, 
 when the creature, now travailing in labor-throes to the birth, shall 
 be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty 
 of the children of God. Regeneration, which now begins in the 
 believer's soul, shall then be extended to his body, and thence to all 
 creation.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and renewing</B>--not "<I>the laver</I> ('washing') of renewing," 
 but "and <FONT SIZE=-1>BY</FONT> the renewing," &c., following "saved
 us." To make "renewing of the Holy Ghost" follow "the laver" would 
 destroy the balance of the clauses of the sentence, and would make 
 baptism the seal, not only of <I>regeneration,</I> but also of the 
 subsequent process of <I>progressive</I> sanctification ("renewing of 
 the Holy Ghost"). <I>Regeneration</I> is a thing once for all done; 
 <I>renewing</I> is a process daily proceeding. As "the washing," or 
 "laver," is connected with "<I>regeneration,</I>" so the "renewing of 
 the Holy Ghost" is connected with "shed on us abundantly"

 with this purpose. Crete would be on his way either to Palestine or his 
 native place, Alexandria. Paul and Apollos thus appear in beautiful 
 harmony in that very city where their names had been formerly the 
 watchword of unchristian party work. It was to avoid this party rivalry
