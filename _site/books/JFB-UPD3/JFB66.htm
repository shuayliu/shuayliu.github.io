 A<FONT SIZE=-1>UTHENTICITY</FONT>.--The author calls himself
 <I>John</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:1,4,9,2:8">Re 1:1, 4, 9; 2:8</A>).

 J<FONT SIZE=-1>USTIN</FONT> M<FONT SIZE=-1>ARTYR</FONT> [<I>Dialogue 
 with Trypho,</I> p. 308] (<FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 139-161) quotes 
 from the Apocalypse, as <I>John the apostle's</I> work, the prophecy of 
 the millennium of the saints, to be followed by the general 
 resurrection and judgment. This testimony of 
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>USTIN</FONT> is referred to also by 
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 4.18].
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>USTIN</FONT> M<FONT SIZE=-1>ARTYR</FONT>, in the early
 part of the second century, held his controversy with 
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>RYPHO</FONT>, a learned Jew, at <I>Ephesus,</I> where
 John had been living thirty or thirty-five years before: he says that
 "the Revelation had been given to John, one of the twelve apostles of
 Christ." M<FONT SIZE=-1>ELITO</FONT>, bishop of <I>Sardis</I> (about
 <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 171), <I>one of the seven churches
 addressed,</I> a successor, therefore, of one of the seven angels, is
 said by E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 
 4.26] to have written treatises on the Apocalypse <I>of John.</I> The 
 testimony of the bishop of Sardis is the more impartial, as Sardis is 
 one of the churches severely reproved

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:1">Re 3:1</A>).

 So also T<FONT SIZE=-1>HEOPHILUS OF</FONT> A<FONT SIZE=-1>NTIOCH</FONT> 
 (about <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 180), according to E<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 4.26], quoted 
 testimonies from the Apocalypse of John. E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> 
 says the same of Apollonius, who lived in Asia Minor in the end of the 
 second century.  I<FONT SIZE=-1>REN&AElig;US</FONT> (about <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 180), a hearer of P<FONT SIZE=-1>OLYCARP</FONT>, 
 the disciple of John, and supposed by A<FONT SIZE=-1>RCHBISHOP</FONT> 
 U<FONT SIZE=-1>SHER</FONT> to be the <I>angel of the Church of 
 Smyrna,</I> is most decided again and again in quoting the Apocalypse 
 as the work of the apostle John [<I>Against Heresies,</I> 4.20.11; 
 4.21.3; 4.30.4; 5.36.1; 5.30.3; 5.35.2].  In [5.30.1], alluding to the 
 mystical number of the beast, six hundred sixty-six

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:18">Re 13:18</A>),

 found in all old copies, he says, "We do not hazard a confident theory 
 as to the name of Antichrist; for if it had been necessary that his 
 name should be proclaimed openly at the present time, it would have 
 been declared by him who saw the apocalyptic vision; <I>for it was seen 
 at no long time back, but almost in our generation, towards the end of 
 Domitian's reign.</I>" In his work <I>Against Heresies,</I> published 
 ten years after Polycarp's martyrdom, he quotes the Apocalypse twenty 
 times, and makes long extracts from it, as inspired Scripture. These 
 testimonies of persons contemporary with John's immediate successors, 
 and more or less connected with the region of the seven churches to 
 which Revelation is addressed, are most convincing. T<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ERTULLIAN</FONT>, of North Africa (about <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 220), [<I>Against Marcion,</I> 3.14], quotes the 
 apostle John's descriptions in the Apocalypse of the sword proceeding 
 out of the Lord's mouth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:15">Re 19:15</A>),
 
 and of the heavenly city 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:1-27">Re 21:1-27</A>).

 Compare <I>On the Resurrection of the Flesh</I> [27]; <I>A Treatise on 
 the Soul,</I> [8, 9, &c.]; <I>The Prescription Against Heretics,</I> 
 [33]. The M<FONT SIZE=-1>URATORI</FONT> fragment of the canon (about 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 200) refers to John the apostle writing to 
 the seven churches. H<FONT SIZE=-1>IPPOLYTUS</FONT>, bishop of Ostia, 
 near Rome (about <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 240) [<I>On Antichrist,</I> 
 p. 67], quotes

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:1-18">Re 17:1-18</A>,

 as the writing of John the apostle. Among 
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>IPPOLYTUS'</FONT> works, there is specified in the
 catalogue on his statue, a treatise "on the Apocalypse and Gospel 
 according to John." C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT> A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LEXANDRIA</FONT> (about <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 200) 
 [<I>Miscellanies,</I> 6.13], alludes to the twenty-four seats on which 
 the elders sit as mentioned by John in the Apocalypse

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:5">Re 4:5</A>);

 also, [<I>Who Is the Rich Man Who Shall Be Saved?</I> 42], he mentions 
 John's return from Patmos to Ephesus on the death of the Roman tyrant. 
 O<FONT SIZE=-1>RIGEN</FONT> (about <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 233), 
 [<I>Commentary on Matthew,</I> in E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> 
 <I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 6.25], mentions John as the author of 
 the Apocalypse, without expressing any doubts as to its authenticity; 
 also, in <I>Commentary on Matthew,</I> [16.6], he quotes

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:9">Re 1:9</A>,

 and says, "John seems to have beheld the Apocalypse in the island of 
 Patmos." V<FONT SIZE=-1>ICTORINUS</FONT>, bishop of Pettau in Pannonia, 
 who suffered martyrdom under Diocletian in <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 
 303, wrote the earliest extant commentary on the Apocalypse. Though the 
 <I>Old Syriac Peschito version</I> does not contain the Apocalypse, yet 
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>PHREM THE</FONT> S<FONT SIZE=-1>YRIAN</FONT> (about 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 378) frequently quotes the Apocalypse as 
 canonical, and ascribes it to John.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Its <I>canonicity</I> and inspiration (according to a scholium of
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>NDREAS OF</FONT> C<FONT SIZE=-1>APPADOCIA</FONT>) are 
 attested by P<FONT SIZE=-1>APIAS</FONT>, a hearer of John, and 
 associate of P<FONT SIZE=-1>OLYCARP</FONT>.  P<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>APIAS</FONT> was bishop of Hierapolis, near <I>Laodicea,</I> 
 one of the seven churches.  W<FONT SIZE=-1>ORDSWORTH</FONT> conjectures 
 that a feeling of shame, on account of the rebukes of <I>Laodicea</I> 
 in Revelation, may have operated on the Council of Laodicea, so as to 
 omit Revelation from its list of books to be <I>read publicly</I> (?). 
 The Epistle of the churches of Lyons and Vienne to the churches of Asia 
 and Phrygia (in E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>, [<I>Ecclesiastical 
 History,</I> 5.1-3]), in the persecution under Marcus Aurelius (<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 77) quotes

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:5,3:14,14:4,22:11">Re 1:5; 3:14; 14:4; 22:11</A>,

 as Scripture. C<FONT SIZE=-1>YPRIAN</FONT> (about 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 250) also, in <I>Epistle 13,</I> quotes

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:5">Re 2:5</A>

 as Scripture; and in <I>Epistle 25</I> he quotes

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:21">Re 3:21</A>,

 as of the same authority as the Gospel. (For other instances, see
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD'S</FONT> <I>Prolegomena,</I> from whom mainly this
 summary of evidence has been derived).  
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>THANASIUS</FONT>, in his <I>Festival Epistle,</I>
 enumerates the Apocalypse among the <I>canonical</I> Scriptures, to
 which none must add, and from which none must take away.  
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> [<I>Epistle to Paulinus</I>] includes in
 the canon the Apocalypse, adding, "It has as many mysteries as words.
 All praise falls short of its merits. In each of its words lie hid 
 manifold senses." Thus an unbroken chain of testimony down from the 
 apostolic period confirms its canonicity and authenticity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The A<FONT SIZE=-1>LOGI</FONT> [E<FONT SIZE=-1>PIPHANIUS</FONT>,
 <I>Heresies,</I> 51] and C<FONT SIZE=-1>AIUS</FONT> the Roman presbyter
 [E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>, <I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 3.28],
 towards the end of the second and beginning of the third century,
 rejected John's Apocalypse on mere captious grounds. C<FONT
 SIZE=-1>AIUS</FONT>, according to J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> [<I>On
 Illustrious Men</I>], about <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 210, attributed
 it to Cerinthus, on the ground of its supporting the millennial reign
 on earth.  D<FONT SIZE=-1>IONYSIUS OF</FONT> A<FONT
 SIZE=-1>LEXANDRIA</FONT> mentions many before his time who rejected it
 because of its obscurity and because it seemed to support Cerinthus'
 dogma of an earthly and carnal kingdom; whence they attributed it to
 Cerinthus. This D<FONT SIZE=-1>IONYSIUS</FONT>, scholar of 
 O<FONT SIZE=-1>RIGEN</FONT>, and bishop of Alexandria 
 (<FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 247), admits its inspiration (in 
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 7.10]),
 but attributes it to some John distinct from John the apostle, on the 
 ground of its difference of style and character, as compared with 
 John's Gospel and Epistle, as also because the name John is several 
 times mentioned in the Apocalypse, which is always kept back in both 
 the Gospel and Epistle; moreover, neither does the Epistle make any 
 allusion to the Apocalypse, nor the Apocalypse to the Epistle; and the 
 style is not pure <I>Greek,</I> but abounds in barbarisms and 
 solecisms. E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> wavers in opinion 
 [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 24.39] as to whether it is, or is not, 
 to be ranked among the undoubtedly canonical Scriptures. His antipathy 
 to the millennial doctrine would give an unconscious bias to his 
 judgment on the Apocalypse. C<FONT SIZE=-1>YRIL OF</FONT> J<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ERUSALEM</FONT> (<FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 386), 
 [<I>Catechetical Lectures,</I> 4.35,36], omits the Apocalypse in 
 enumerating the New Testament Scriptures to be read privately as well 
 as publicly. "Whatever is not read in the churches, that do not even 
 read by thyself; the apostles and ancient bishops of the Church who 
 transmitted them to us were far wiser than thou art." Hence, we see 
 that, in his day, the Apocalypse was not read in the churches. Yet in 
 <I>Catechetical Lectures,</I> 1.4 he quotes

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:7,17">Re 2:7, 17</A>;

 and in <I>Catechetical Lectures,</I> 1; 15.13 he draws the prophetical
 statement from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:11">Re 17:11</A>,

 that the king who is to humble the three kings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:8,20">Da 7:8, 20</A>)

 is the <I>eighth king.</I> In <I>Catechetical Lectures,</I> 15 and 27, he
 similarly quotes from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:3,4">Re 12:3, 4</A>.

 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> conjectures that C<FONT SIZE=-1>YRIL</FONT>
 had at some time changed his opinion, and that these references to the
 Apocalypse were slips of memory whereby he retained phraseology which
 belonged to his former, not his subsequent views. The sixtieth canon
 (if genuine) of the Laodicean Council in the middle of the fourth
 century omits the Apocalypse from the canonical books. The Eastern
 Church in part doubted, the Western Church, after the fifth century,
 universally recognized, the Apocalypse.  C<FONT SIZE=-1>YRIL OF</FONT>
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LEXANDRIA</FONT> [<I>On Worship,</I> 146], though
 implying the fact of some doubting its genuineness, himself undoubtedly
 accepts it as the work of St. John. A<FONT SIZE=-1>NDREAS OF</FONT>
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>&AElig;SAREA</FONT>, in Cappadocia, recognized as
 genuine and canonical, and wrote the first entire and connected 
 commentary on, the Apocalypse. The sources of doubt seem to have been, 
 (1) the antagonism of many to the millennium, which is set forth in it; 
 (2) its obscurity and symbolism having caused it not to be read in the 
 churches, or to be taught to the young. But <I>the most primitive</I> 
 tradition is unequivocal in its favor. In a word, the objective 
 evidence is decidedly for it; the only arguments against it seem to 
 have been subjective.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The personal notices of John in the Apocalypse occur

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:1,4,9,22:8">Re 1:1, 4, 9;
 Re 22:8</A>.

 Moreover, the writer's addresses to the churches of Proconsular
 <I>Asia</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:1">Re 2:1</A>)

 accord with the concurrent tradition, that after John's return from his 
 exile in Patmos, at the death of Domitian, under Nerva, he resided for 
 long, and died at last in Ephesus, in the time of Trajan [E<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>, <I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 3.20,23]. If the 
 Apocalypse were not the inspired work of John, purporting as it does to 
 be an address from their superior to the seven churches of Proconsular 
 Asia, it would have assuredly been rejected <I>in that region;</I> 
 whereas the earliest testimonies <I>in those churches</I> are all in 
 its favor. One person alone was entitled to use language of authority 
 such as is addressed to the seven angels of the churches--namely, John, 
 as the last surviving apostle and superintendent of all the churches. 
 Also, it accords with John's manner to assert the accuracy of his 
 testimony both at the beginning and end of his book (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:2,3,22:8,Joh+1:14,21:24,1Jo+1:1,2">Re 1:2, 3,
 and 22:8,
 with Joh 1:14; 21:24;
 1Jo 1:1, 2</A>).

 Again, it accords with the view of the writer being an <I>inspired
 apostle</I> that he addresses the angels or presidents of the several 
 churches in the tone of a <I>superior</I> addressing inferiors. Also, 
 he commends the Church of Ephesus for trying and convicting "them which 
 <I>say they are apostles,</I> and are not," by which he implies his own 
 undoubted claim to apostolic inspiration

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:2">Re 2:2</A>),

 as declaring in the seven epistles Christ's will revealed through 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As to the difference of style, as compared with the Gospel and Epistle, 
 the <I>difference of subject</I> in part accounts for it, the visions
 of the seer, transported as he was above the region of sense, 
 appropriately taking a form of expression abrupt, and unbound by the 
 grammatical laws which governed his writings of a calmer and more 
 deliberate character. Moreover, as being a Galilean Hebrew, John, in 
 writing a Revelation akin to the Old Testament prophecies, naturally 
 reverted to their Hebraistic style.  A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> 
 notices, among the features of resemblance between the styles of the 
 Apocalypse and John's Gospel and Epistle: (1) the characteristic 
 appellation of our Lord, peculiar to John exclusively, "the Word of 
 God"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:13">Re 19:13</A>;
 
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:1,1Jo+1:1">Joh 1:1;
 1Jo 1:1</A>).
 
 (2) the phrase, "he that overcometh"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:7,11,17,3:5,12,21,12:11,15:2,17:14,21:7">Re 2:7, 11, 17;
 3:5, 12, 21; 12:11; 15:2; 17:14; 21:7</A>;
 
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:33">Joh 16:33</A>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:13,14,4:4,5:4,5">1Jo 2:13, 14; 4:4; 5:4, 5</A>).

 (3) The <I>Greek</I> term (<I>alethinos</I>) for "true," as opposed to
 that which is shadowy and unreal

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:7,14,6:10,15:3,16:7,19:2,9,11,21:5,22:6">Re 3:7, 14;
 6:10; 15:3; 16:7; 19:2, 9, 11; 21:5; 22:6</A>).

 This term, found only once in Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:11">Lu 16:11</A>),
 
 four times in Paul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:9,Heb+8:2,9:24,10:22">1Th 1:9;
 Heb 8:2; 9:24; 10:22</A>), 
 
 is found nine times in John's Gospel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:9,4:23,37,6:32,7:28,8:16,15:1">Joh 1:9;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:3,19:3,5">Joh 17:3; 19:3, 5</A>),

 twice in John's First Epistle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:8,5:20">1Jo 2:8; 5:20</A>),

 and ten times in Revelation

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:6">Re 22:6</A>).

 (4) The <I>Greek</I> diminutive for "Lamb" (<I>arnion,</I> literally,
 "lambkin") occurs twenty-nine times in the Apocalypse, and the only 
 other place where it occurs is

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:15">Joh 21:15</A>.

 In John's writings alone is Christ called <I>directly</I> "the Lamb"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:29,36">Joh 1:29, 36</A>).

 In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:19">1Pe 1:19</A>,
 
 He is called "as a lamb without blemish," in allusion to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:7">Isa 53:7</A>.
 
 So the use of "witness," or "testimony"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:2,9,6:9,11:7">Re 1:2, 9; 6:9; 11:7</A>,
 
 &c.; compare

 as to the spiritual <I>anointing.</I> The seeming solecisms of style
 are attributable to that,inspired elevation which is above mere 
 grammatical rules, and are designed to arrest the reader's attention by 
 the peculiarity of the phrase, so as to pause and search into some deep 
 truth lying beneath.  The vivid earnestness of the inspired writer, 
 handling a subject so transcending all others, raises him above all 
 servile adherence to ordinary rules, so that at times he abruptly 
 passes from one grammatical construction to another, as he graphically 
 sets the thing described before the eye of the reader. This is not due 
 to ignorance of grammar, for he "has displayed a knowledge of 
 grammatical rules in other much more difficult constructions" [W<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>INER</FONT>].  <I>The connection of thought</I> is more 
 attended to than mere grammatical connection. Another consideration to 
 be taken into account is that two-fifths of the whole being the 
 recorded language of others, he moulds his style accordingly. Compare

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>REGELLES</FONT> well says [<I>New Testament Historic
 Evidence</I>], "There is no book of the New Testament for which we have
 such clear, ample, and numerous testimonies in the second century as we
 have in favor of the Apocalypse. The more closely the witnesses were
 connected with the apostle John (as was the case with 
 I<FONT SIZE=-1>REN&AElig;US</FONT>), the more explicit is their
 testimony.  That doubts should prevail in after ages must have 
 originated either in ignorance of the earlier testimony, or else from 
 some supposed intuition of what an apostle <I>ought</I> to have 
 written. The objections on the ground of internal <I>style</I> can 
 weigh nothing against the actual evidence. It is in vain to argue, a 
 priori, that John <I>could</I> not have written this book when we have 
 the evidence of several competent witnesses that he <I>did</I> write 
 it."</P>

 R<FONT SIZE=-1>ELATION OF THE</FONT>
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>POCALYPSE TO THE REST OF THE 
 CANON</FONT>.--G<FONT SIZE=-1>REGORY OF</FONT>
 N<FONT SIZE=-1>YSSA</FONT> [tom. 3, p. 601], calls Revelation "the last
 book of grace." It completes the volume of inspiration, so that we are 
 to look for no further revelation till Christ Himself shall come.  
 Appropriately the last book completing the canon was written by John, 
 the last survivor of the apostles. The New Testament is composed of the 
 historical books, the Gospels and Acts, the doctrinal Epistles, and the 
 one prophetical book, Revelation. The same apostle wrote the last of 
 the Gospels, and probably the last of the Epistles, and the only 
 prophetical book of the New Testament. All the books of the New 
 Testament had been written, and were read in the Church assemblies, 
 some years before John's death. His life was providentially prolonged 
 that he might give the final attestation to Scripture. About the year 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 100, the bishops of Asia (the angels of the 
 seven churches) came to John at E<FONT SIZE=-1>PHESUS</FONT>, bringing 
 him copies of the three Gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and desired 
 of him a statement of his apostolical judgment concerning them; 
 whereupon he pronounced them authentic, genuine, and inspired, and at 
 their request added his own Gospel to complete the fourfold aspect of 
 the Gospel of Christ (compare M<FONT SIZE=-1>URATORI</FONT> 
 [<I>Fragment on the Canon of Scripture</I>]; E<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 3.24]; J<FONT

 SIZE=-1>ICTORINUS</FONT> on the <I>Apocalypse;</I> T<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>HEODORET</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 39]). A Greek 
 divine, quoted in A<FONT SIZE=-1>LLATIUS</FONT>, calls Revelation "the 
 seal of the whole Bible." The canon would be incomplete without 
 Revelation. Scripture is a complete whole, its component books, written 
 in a period ranging over one thousand five hundred years, being 
 mutually connected. Unity of aim and spirit pervades the entire, so 
 that the end is the necessary sequence of the middle, and the middle of 
 the beginning. Genesis presents before us man and his bride in 
 innocence and blessedness, followed by man's fall through Satan's 
 subtlety, and man's consequent misery, his exclusion from Paradise and 
 its tree of life and delightful rivers. Revelation presents, in reverse 
 order, man first liable to sin and death, but afterwards made conqueror 
 through the blood of the Lamb; the first Adam and Eve, represented by 
 the second Adam, Christ, and the Church. His spotless bride, in 
 Paradise, with free access to the tree of life and the crystal water of 
 life that flows from the throne of God. As Genesis foretold the 
 bruising of the serpent's head by the woman's seed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15">Ge 3:15</A>),

 so Revelation declares the final accomplishment of that prediction

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 P<FONT SIZE=-1>LACE AND TIME OF WRITING</FONT>.--The best authorities
 among the Fathers state that John was exiled under Domitian 
 (I<FONT SIZE=-1>REN&AElig;US</FONT> [<I>Against Heresies,</I> 5; 30];
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT> A<FONT SIZE=-1>LEXANDRIA</FONT>; 
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 3.20]).
 V<FONT SIZE=-1>ICTORINUS</FONT> says that he had to labor in the mines
 of Patmos. At Domitian's death, <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 95, he
 returned to Ephesus under the Emperor Nerva. Probably it was
 immediately after his return that he wrote, under divine inspiration,
 the account of the visions vouchsafed to him in Patmos

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:2,9">Re 1:2, 9</A>).

 However,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:4">Re 10:4</A>

 seems to imply that he wrote the visions immediately after seeing them.
 Patmos is one of the Sporades. Its circumference is about thirty miles.
 "It was fitting that when forbidden to go beyond certain bounds of the
 earth's lands, he was permitted to penetrate the secrets of heaven"
 [B<FONT SIZE=-1>EDE</FONT>, <I>Explanation of the Apocalypse</I> on
 chap. 1]. The following arguments favor an earlier date, namely, under
 Nero: (1) E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Demonstration of the
 Gospel</I>] unites in the same sentence John's banishment with the
 stoning of James and the beheading of Paul, which were <I>under
 Nero.</I> (2) C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT> 
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LEXANDRIA'S</FONT>'S story of the robber reclaimed by
 John, after he had pursued, and with difficulty overtaken him, accords
 better with John then being a younger man than under Domitian, when he
 was one hundred years old. Arethas, in the sixth century, applies the
 sixth seal to the destruction of Jerusalem (<FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 
 70), adding that the Apocalypse was written before that event. So the 
 <I>Syriac version</I> states he was banished by Nero the C&aelig;sar.  
 Laodicea was overthrown by an earthquake (<FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 60) 
 but was immediately rebuilt, so that its being called "rich and 
 increased with goods" is not incompatible with this book having been 
 written under the Neronian persecution (<FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 64).

 make a date before the destruction of Laodicea possible. Cerinthus is 
 stated to have died before John; as then he borrowed much in his 
 Pseudo-Apocalypse from John's, it is likely the latter was at an 
 earlier date than Domitian's reign. See T<FONT SIZE=-1>ILLOCH'S</FONT>
 <I>Introduction to Apocalypse.</I> But the Pauline benediction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:4">Re 1:4</A>)

 implies it was written after Paul's death under Nero.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>O WHAT READERS ADDRESSED</FONT>.--The inscription states
 that it is addressed to the seven churches of Asia, that is, 
 Proconsular Asia.  John's reason for fixing on the number <I>seven</I> 
 (for there were more than seven churches in the region meant by "Asia," 
 for instance, Magnesia and Tralles) was doubtless because <I>seven</I> 
 is the sacred number implying totality and universality: so it is 
 implied that John, through the medium of the seven churches, addresses 
 in the Spirit the Church of all places and ages. The Church in its 
 various states of spiritual life or deadness, in all ages and places, 
 is represented by the seven churches, and is addressed with words of 
 consolation or warning accordingly. Smyrna and Philadelphia alone of 
 the seven are honored with unmixed praise, as faithful in tribulation 
 and rich in good works. Heresies of a decided kind had by this time 
 arisen in the churches of Asia, and the love of many had waxed cold, 
 while others had advanced to greater zeal, and one had sealed his 
 testimony with his blood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 O<FONT SIZE=-1>BJECT</FONT>.--It begins with admonitory addresses to
 the seven churches from the divine Son of man, whom John saw in vision, 
 after a brief introduction which sets forth the main subject of the 
 book, namely, to "show unto His servants things which must shortly come 
 to pass" (the first through third chapters). From the fourth chapter to 
 the end is mainly prophecy, with practical exhortations and 
 consolations, however, interspersed, similar to those addressed to the 
 seven churches (the representatives of the universal Church of every 
 age), and so connecting the body of the book with its beginning, which 
 therefore forms its appropriate introduction. Three schools of 
 interpreters exist: (1) The Preterists, who hold that almost the whole 
 has been fulfilled. (2) The Historical Interpreters, who hold that it 
 comprises the history of the Church from John's time to the end of the 
 world, the seals being <I>chronologically</I> succeeded, by the 
 trumpets and the trumpets by the vials. (3) The Futurists, who consider 
 almost the whole as yet future, and to be fulfilled immediately before 
 Christ's second coming. The first theory was not held by any of the 
 earliest Fathers, and is only held now by Rationalists, who limit 
 John's vision to things within his own horizon, pagan Rome's 
 persecutions of Christians, and its consequently anticipated 
 destruction. The Futurist school is open to this great objection: it 
 would leave the Church of Christ unprovided with prophetical guidance 
 or support under her fiery trials for 1700 or 1800 years. Now God has 
 said, "Surely He will do nothing, but He revealeth His secrets unto His 
 servants the prophets"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:7">Am 3:7</A>).

 The Jews had a succession of prophets who guided them with the light of 
 prophecy: what their prophets were to them, that the apocalyptic 
 Scriptures have been, and are, to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>, following I<FONT SIZE=-1>SAAC</FONT>
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>ILLIAMS</FONT>, draws attention to the parallel 
 connection between the Apocalypse and Christ's discourse on the Mount 
 of Olives, recorded in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:4-28">Mt 24:4-28</A>.

 The seals plainly bring us down to the second coming of Christ, just as 
 the trumpets also do (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:12-17,8:1,11:15">Re 6:12-17; 8:1,
 &c.; Re 11:15</A>),

 and as the vials also do

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:17">Re 16:17</A>):

 all three run parallel, and end in the same point. Certain "catchwords"
 (as W<FONT SIZE=-1>ORDSWORTH</FONT> calls them) connect the three
 series of symbols together. They do not succeed one to the other in
 historical and chronological sequence, but move side by side, the
 subsequent series filling up in detail the same picture which the
 preceding series had drawn in outline. So
 V<FONT SIZE=-1>ICTORINUS</FONT> (on

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:2">Re 7:2</A>),

 the earliest commentator on the Apocalypse, says, "The order of the 
 things said is not to be regarded, since often the Holy Spirit, when He 
 has run to the end of the last time, again returns to the same times, 
 and supplies what He has less fully expressed." And P<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>RIMASIUS</FONT> [<I>Commentary on the Apocalypse</I>], "In the 
 trumpets he gives a description by a pleasing <I>repetition,</I> as is 
 his custom."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 At the very beginning, John hastens, by anticipation (as was the
 tendency of all the prophets), to the grand consummation.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:7">Re 1:7</A>,
 
 "Behold, He cometh with clouds," &c.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:8,17">Re 1:8, 17</A>,

 "I am the beginning and <I>the ending</I> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the first and 
 <I>the last.</I>" So the seven epistles exhibit the same anticipation 
 of the end.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:12">Re 3:12</A>,

 "Him that overcometh, I will write upon Him the name of my God, and the 
 name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down 
 out of heaven"; compare at the close,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:2">Re 21:2</A>.
 
 So also 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:28">Re 2:28</A>,

 "I will give him the morning star"; compare at the close,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:16">Re 22:16</A>,
 
 "I am the bright and morning star."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Again, the <I>earthquake</I> that ensues on the opening of the sixth
 seal is one of the catchwords, that is, a link connecting 
 chronologically this sixth seal with the sixth trumpet

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+9:13,11:13">Re 9:13; 11:13</A>):

 compare also the seventh vial,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:17,18">Re 16:17, 18</A>.

 The concomitants of the opening of the sixth seal, it is plain, in no 
 full and exhaustive sense apply to any event, save the terrors which 
 shall overwhelm the ungodly just before the coming of the Judge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Again, <I>the beast out of the bottomless pit</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:7">Re 11:7</A>),

 between the sixth and seventh trumpets, connects this series with the 
 section, twelfth through fourteenth chapters, concerning the Church and 
 her adversaries.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Again, the sealing of the 144,000 under the sixth seal connects this
 seal with the section, the twelfth through fourteenth chapters.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Again, the loosing of the four winds by the four angels standing on the
 four corners of the earth, under the sixth seal, answers to the loosing 
 of the <I>four</I> angels at the Euphrates, under the sixth 
 trumpet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moreover, links occur in the Apocalypse connecting it with the Old
 Testament. For instance, the "mouth speaking great things" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:8">Da 7:8</A>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:5">Re 13:5</A>),

 connects the <I>beast that blasphemes against God, and makes war 
 against the saints,</I> with <I>the little horn</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:21,Re+13:6,7">Da 7:21;

 also, compare the "forty-two months"

 or "a thousand two hundred and threescore days"

 A<FONT SIZE=-1>UBERLEN</FONT> observes, "The history of salvation is
 mysteriously governed by holy numbers. They are the scaffolding of the 
 organic edifice. They are not merely outward indications of time, but 
 indications of nature and essence. Not only nature, but history, is 
 based in numbers. Scripture and antiquity put numbers as the 
 fundamental forms of things, where we put ideas." As number is the 
 regulator of the relations and proportions of the natural world, so 
 does it enter most frequently into the revelations of the Apocalypse, 
 which sets forth the harmonies of the supernatural, the immediately 
 Divine. Thus the most supernatural revelation leads us the farthest 
 into the natural, as was to be expected, seeing the God of nature and 
 of revelation is one. <I>Seven</I> is the number for perfection 
 (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:4,4:5">Re 1:4; 4:5</A>,
 
 the <I>seven</I> Spirits before the throne; also,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:6">Re 5:6</A>,

 the Lamb's <I>seven</I> horns and <I>seven</I> eyes). Thus <I>the seven 
 churches</I> represent the Church catholic in its totality.  <I>The 
 seven seals</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:1">Re 5:1</A>),
 
 <I>the seven trumpets</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+8:2">Re 8:2</A>),
 
 and <I>the seven vials</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:1">Re 17:1</A>),

 are severally a complete series each in itself, fulfilling perfectly 
 the divine course of judgments.  <I>Three and a half</I> implies a 
 number opposed to the divine (seven), but broken in itself, and which, 
 in the moment of its highest triumph, is overwhelmed by judgment and 
 utter ruin. <I>Four</I> is the number of the world's extension; 
 <I>seven</I> is the number of God's revelation in the world. In the 
 <I>four</I> beasts of Daniel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:3">Da 7:3</A>)

 there is a recognition of some power above them, at the same time that 
 there is a mimicry of the <I>four</I> cherubs of Ezekiel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:9">Eze 10:9</A>),

 the heavenly symbols of all creation in its due subjection to God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:6-8">Re 4:6-8</A>).

 So the four corners of the earth, the four winds, the four angels 
 loosed from the Euphrates, and Jerusalem lying "foursquare"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:16">Re 21:16</A>),

 represent world-wide extension. The sevenfoldness of the Spirits on the 
 part of God corresponds with the fourfold cherubim on the part of the 
 created. John, seeing more deeply into the essentially God-opposed 
 character of the world, presents to us, not the <I>four</I> beasts of 
 Daniel, but the <I>seven</I> heads of the beast, whereby it arrogates 
 to itself the <I>sevenfold</I> perfection of <I>the Spirits of God;</I> 
 at the same time that, with characteristic self-contradiction, it has 
 <I>ten</I> horns, the number peculiar to the world power. Its unjust 
 usurpation of the sacred number <I>seven</I> is marked by the addition 
 of an <I>eighth</I> to the <I>seven</I> heads, and also by the beast's 
 own number, six hundred sixty-six, which in units, tens, and hundreds, 
 verges upon, but falls short of, <I>seven.</I> The judgments on the 
 world are complete in <I>six:</I> after the sixth seal and the sixth 
 trumpet, there is a pause.  When <I>seven</I> comes, there comes "the 
 kingdom of our Lord and His Christ." Six is the number of the world 
 given to judgment. Moreover, <I>six</I> is half of <I>twelve,</I> as 
 <I>three and a half</I> is the half of <I>seven. Twelve</I> is the 
 number of the Church: compare the <I>twelve</I> tribes of Israel, the

 <I>Six</I> thus symbolizes the world broken, and without solid 
 foundation.  Twice twelve is the number of the heavenly elders; twelve 
 times twelve thousand the number of the sealed elect

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:4">Re 7:4</A>):

 the tree of life yields twelve manner of fruits. Doubtless, besides 
 this symbolic force, there is a special chronological meaning in the 
 numbers; but as yet, though a <I>commanded</I> subject of 
 investigation, they have received no solution which we can be sure is 
 the true one. They are intended to stimulate reverent inquiry, not to 
 gratify idle speculative curiosity; and when the event shall have been 
 fulfilled, they will show the divine wisdom of God, who ordered all 
 things in minutely harmonious relations, and left neither the times nor 
 the ways haphazard.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The arguments for the year-day theory are as follows:

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:24">Da 9:24</A>,

 "Seventy weeks are determined upon," where the <I>Hebrew</I> may be 
 <I>seventy sevens;</I> but M<FONT SIZE=-1>EDE</FONT> observes, the 
 <I>Hebrew</I> word means always seven of <I>days,</I> and never seven 
 of <I>years</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+12:5,De+16:9,10,16">Le 12:5;
 De 16:9, 10, 16</A>).

 Again, the number of <I>years'</I> wandering of the Israelites was made
 to correspond to the number of <I>days</I> in which the spies searched 
 the land, namely, <I>forty:</I> compare "each day for a year,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:33,34">Nu 14:33, 34</A>.
 
 So in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+4:5,6">Eze 4:5, 6</A>,

 "I have laid up on thee the <I>years</I> of their iniquity, according 
 to the number of the <I>days,</I> three hundred and ninety days 
 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. forty days: I have appointed thee <I>each day for a 
 year.</I>" John, in Revelation itself, uses <I>days</I> in a sense 
 which can hardly be literal.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:10">Re 2:10</A>,

 "Ye shall have tribulation <I>ten days</I>": the persecution of <I>ten 
 years</I> recorded by E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> seems to correspond 
 to it. In the year-day theory there is still quite enough of obscurity 
 to exercise the patience and probation of faith, for we cannot say 
 precisely <I>when</I> the 1260 years <I>begin:</I> so that this theory 
 is quite compatible with Christ's words, "Of that day and hour knoweth 
 no man"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:36,Mk+13:32">Mt 24:36;
 Mr 13:32</A>].

 However, it is a difficulty in this theory that "a thousand years," in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:6,7">Re 20:6, 7</A>,

 can hardly mean one thousand by three hundred sixty days, that is, 
 three hundred sixty thousand years. The first resurrection there must 
 be literal, even as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:5">Re 20:5</A>

 must be taken literally, "<I>the rest of the dead</I> lived not again 
 until the thousand years were finished"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:5">Re 20:5</A>).

 To interpret the former spiritually would entail the need of 
 interpreting the latter so, which would be most improbable; for it 
 would imply that "<I>the rest of the</I> (spiritually) <I>dead lived 
 not</I> (spiritually)" until the end of the thousand years, and then 
 that they did come spiritually to life.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:23">1Co 15:23</A>,

 "they that are Christ's at His coming," confirms the literal view.</P>

 <B>1. Revelation</B>--an apocalypse or <I>unveiling</I> of those things
 which had been veiled. A <I>manifesto</I> of the kingdom of Christ. The
 travelling manual of the Church for the Gentile Christian times. Not a
 <I>detailed history</I> of the future, but a representation of the
 great epochs and chief powers in developing the kingdom of God in
 relation to the world. The "Church-<I>historical</I>" view goes counter
 to the great principle that Scripture interprets itself. Revelation is
 to teach us to understand the times, not the times to interpret to us
 the Apocalypse, although it is in the nature of the case that a reflex
 influence is exerted here and is understood by the prudent 
 [A<FONT SIZE=-1>UBERLEN</FONT>].  The book is in a series of parallel
 groups, not in chronological succession. Still there is an organic 
 historical development of the kingdom of God. In this book all the 
 other books of the Bible end and meet: in it is the consummation of all 
 previous prophecy. Daniel foretells as to Christ and the Roman 
 destruction of Jerusalem, and the last Antichrist. But John's 
 Revelation fills up the intermediate period, and describes the 
 millennium and final state beyond Antichrist. Daniel, as a godly 
 statesman, views the history of God's people in relation to the <I>four 
 world kingdoms.</I> John, as an apostle, views history from the 
 <I>Christian Church aspect.</I> The term <I>Apocalypse</I> is applied 
 to no Old Testament book. Daniel is the nearest approach to it; but 
 what Daniel was told to <I>seal</I> and <I>shut up till the time of the 
 end,</I> John, now that <I>the time is at hand</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:3">Re 1:3</A>),
 
 is directed to <I>reveal.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>of Jesus Christ</B>--coming <I>from</I> Him. Jesus Christ, not John 
 the writer, is the Author of the Apocalypse. Christ taught many things 
 before His departure; but those which were unsuitable for announcement 
 at that time He brought together into the Apocalypse [B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]. Compare His promise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:15">Joh 15:15</A>,

 "All things that I have heard of My Father, I have made known unto 
 you"; also,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:13">Joh 16:13</A>,

 "The Spirit of truth <I>will show</I> you things to come." The Gospels 
 and Acts are the books, respectively, of His first advent, in the 
 flesh, and in the Spirit; the Epistles are the inspired comment on 
 them. The Apocalypse is the book of His second advent and the events 
 preliminary to it.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>which God gave unto him</B>--The Father reveals Himself and His will

 so entirely have the parts of Revelation reference to one another. It 
 is its peculiar excellence that it comprises in a perfect compendium 
 future things, and these widely differing: things close at hand, far 
 off, and between the two; great and little; destroying and saving; 
 repeated from old prophecies and new; long and short, and these 
 interwoven with one another, opposed and mutually agreeing; mutually 
 involving and evolving one another; so that in no book more than in 
 this would the addition, or taking away, of a single word or clause

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:18,19">Re 22:18, 19</A>),

 have the effect of marring the sense of the context and the comparison 
 of passages together [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>].

 <I>all</I> His servants (compare

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>shortly</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "speedily"; literally, "in," or "with 
 speed." Compare "the time is at hand,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:3,22:6">Re 1:3; 22:6</A>,
 
 "shortly"; 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:7">Re 22:7</A>,

 "Behold, I come <I>quickly.</I>" Not that the things prophesied were
 according to man's computation near; but this word "shortly" implies a 
 corrective of our estimate of worldly events and periods. Though a 
 "thousand years"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:1-15">Re 20:1-15</A>)

 at least are included, the time is declared to be <I>at hand.</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:8">Lu 18:8</A>,

 "speedily." The Israelite Church hastened eagerly to the predicted end, 
 which premature eagerness prophecy restrains (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:1-27">Da 9:1-27</A>).

 The Gentile Church needs to be reminded of the transitoriness of the 
 world (which it is apt to make its home) and the nearness of Christ's 
 advent. On the one hand Revelation says, "the time is at hand"; on the 
 other, the succession of seals, &c., show that many intermediate events 
 must first elapse.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he sent</B>--Jesus Christ sent.

 opens the Revelation,

 "Loosed us in (virtue of) His blood," being the

 In favor of <I>English Version</I> reading is the usage whereby the 
 priests, before putting on the holy garments and ministering, 
 <I>washed</I> themselves: so spiritually believers, as <I>priests</I>

 its mystical signification, expressing <I>totality</I> and

 oldest manuscripts, A, B, C, C<FONT SIZE=-1>YPRIAN</FONT>, 
 <I>Vulgate,</I> and <I>Syriac; Coptic</I> alone supports them of old 
 authorities. These seven are representative churches; and, as a complex 
 whole, ideally complete, embody the chief spiritual characteristics of 
 the Church, whether as faithful or unfaithful, in all ages. The 
 churches selected are not taken at random, but have a many-sided 
 completeness. Thus, on one side we have Smyrna, a Church exposed to 
 persecutions unto death; on the other Sardis, having a high <I>name</I> 
 for spiritual <I>life and yet dead.</I> Again, Laodicea, in its own 
 estimate <I>rich</I> and <I>having need of nothing,</I> with ample 
 talents, yet <I>lukewarm</I> in Christ's cause; on the other hand, 
 Philadelphia, with but a <I>little strength,</I> yet <I>keeping</I> 
 Christ's word and having an <I>open door</I> of usefulness <I>set 
 before</I> it by Christ Himself. Again, Ephesus, intolerant of 
 <I>evil</I> and of <I>false apostles,</I> yet having <I>left its first 
 love;</I> on the other hand, Thyatira, abounding in <I>works, love, 
 service, and faith,</I> yet <I>suffering</I> the false 
 <I>prophetess</I> to <I>seduce</I> many. In another aspect, Ephesus in 
 conflict with false freedom, that is fleshly licentiousness (the 
 Nicolaitanes); so also Pergamos in conflict with Balaam-like tempters 
 to fornication and <I>idol-meats;</I> and on the other side, 
 Philadelphia in conflict with the Jewish synagogue, that is, legal 
 bondage. Finally, Sardis and Laodicea without any active opposition to 
 call forth their spiritual energies; a dangerous position, considering 
 man's natural indolence. In the historic scheme of interpretation, 
 which seems fanciful, Ephesus (meaning "the beloved" or "desired" 
 [S<FONT SIZE=-1>TIER</FONT>]) represents the waning period of the 
 apostolic age. Smyrna ("myrrh"), bitter suffering, yet sweet and costly 
 perfume, the martyr period of the Decian and Diocletian age. Pergamos 
 (a "castle" or "tower"), the Church possessing earthly power and 
 decreasing spirituality from Constantine's time until the seventh 
 century. Thyatira ("unwearied about sacrifices"), the Papal Church in 
 the first half of the Middle Ages; like "Jezebel," keen about its 
 so-called <I>sacrifice</I> of the mass, and slaying the prophets and 
 witnesses of God. Sardis, from the close of the twelfth century to the 
 Reformation. Philadelphia ("brotherly love"), the first century of the 
 Reformation. Laodicea, the Reformed Church after its first zeal had 
 become <I>lukewarm.</I></P>

 independent as to external ceremonies and government (provided all 
 things are done to edification, and schisms or needless separations are 
 avoided), yet one in the unity of the Spirit and the Headship of 
 Christ.  The candlestick is not light, but the bearer of light, holding 
 it forth to give light around. The light is the Lord's, not the 
 Church's; from Him she receives it. She is to be a light-bearer to His 
 glory. The candlestick stood in the holy place, the type of the Church 
 on earth, as the holiest place was type of the Church in heaven. The 
 holy place's only light was derived from the candlestick, daylight

 ascension; and, therefore He here wears its emblems. As Aaron wore 
 these insignia when He came forth from the sanctuary to bless the

 Each of the seven epistles in this and the third chapter, commences
 with, "I know thy works." Each contains a promise from Christ, "To him
 that overcometh." Each ends with, "He that hath an ear, let him hear
 what the Spirit saith unto the churches." The title of our Lord in each
 case accords with the nature of the address, and is mainly taken from
 the imagery of the vision,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:12-16">Re 1:12-16</A>.

 Each address has a threat or a promise, and most of the addresses have 
 both. Their order seems to be ecclesiastical, civil, and geographical: 
 Ephesus first, as being the Asiatic metropolis (termed "the light of 
 Asia," and "first city of Asia"), the nearest to Patmos, where John 
 received the epistle to the seven churches, and also as being that 
 Church with which John was especially connected; then the churches on 
 the west coast of Asia; then those in the interior. Smyrna and 
 Philadelphia alone receive unmixed praise. Sardis and Laodicea receive 
 almost solely censure. In Ephesus, Pergamos, and Thyatira, there are 
 some things to praise, others to condemn, the latter element 
 preponderating in one case (Ephesus), the former in the two others 
 (Pergamos and Thyatira). Thus the main characteristics of the different 
 states of different churches, in all times and places, are portrayed, 
 and they are suitably encouraged or warned.</P>

 <B>1. Ephesus</B>--famed for the temple of Diana, one of the seven

 the province.

 which shows the true sense of Nicolaitanes; they are not a sect, but 
 professing Christians who, like Balaam of old.  tried to introduce into 
 the Church a false freedom, that is, licentiousness; this was a 
 reaction in the opposite direction from Judaism, the first danger to 
 the Church combated in the council of Jerusalem, and by Paul in the 
 Epistle to Galatians. These symbolical Nicolaitanes, or followers of 
 Balaam, abused Paul's doctrine of the grace of God into a plea for 
 lasciviousness

 what was peculiar to the Israelites, namely, that they 
 <I>sacrificed</I> to idols.  The temptation to eat idol-meats was a 
 peculiarly strong one to the Gentile converts. For not to do so 
 involved almost a withdrawal from partaking of any social meal with the 
 heathen around. For idol-meats, after a part had been offered in 
 sacrifice, were nearly sure to be on the heathen entertainer's table; 
 so much so, that the <I>Greek</I> "to kill" (<I>thuein</I>) meant 
 originally "to sacrifice." Hence arose the decree of the council of 
 Jerusalem forbidding to eat such meats; subsequently some at Corinth 
 ate unscrupulously and <I>knowingly</I> of such meats, on the ground 
 that the idol is nothing; others needlessly tortured themselves with 
 scruples, lest <I>unknowingly</I> they should eat of them when they got 
 meat from the market or in a heathen friend's house. Paul handles the

 the idol-meats

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:14">Re 2:14</A>).

 A pot of manna was laid up in the holy place "before the testimony." 
 The allusion is here to this: probably also to the Lord's discourse

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:31-35">Joh 6:31-35</A>).

 Translate, "the manna which is hidden." As the manna hidden in the 
 sanctuary was by divine power preserved from corruption, so Christ in 
 His incorruptible body has passed into the heavens, and is hidden there 
 until the time of His appearing. Christ Himself is the manna "hidden" 
 from the world, but revealed to the believer, so that he has already a 
 foretaste of His preciousness. Compare as to Christ's own hidden food 
 on earth,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:32,34,Job+23:12">Joh 4:32, 34,
 and Job 23:12</A>.

 The full manifestation shall be at His coming. Believers are now 
 hidden, even as their meat is hidden. As the manna in the sanctuary, 
 unlike the other manna, was incorruptible, so the spiritual feast 
 offered to all who reject the world's dainties for Christ is 
 everlasting: an incorruptible body and life for ever in Christ at the 
 resurrection.

 <B>white stone .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. new name .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no man knoweth 
 saving he</B>--T<FONT SIZE=-1>RENCH'S</FONT> explanation seems best. 
 <I>White</I> is the color and livery of heaven.  "New" implies 
 something altogether renewed and heavenly. The white stone is a 
 glistening diamond, the Urim borne by the high priest within the 
 <I>choschen</I> or breastplate of judgment, with the twelve tribes' 
 names on the twelve precious stones, next the heart. The word 
 <I>Urim</I> means "light," answering to the color <I>white.</I> None 
 but the high priest knew the name written upon it, probably the 
 incommunicable name of God, "Jehovah." The high priest consulted it in 
 some divinely appointed way to get direction from God when needful. The 
 "new name" is <I>Christ's</I> (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:12">Re 3:12</A>,

 "I will write upon him <I>My</I> new name"): some new revelation of 
 Himself which shall hereafter be imparted to His people, and which they 
 alone are capable of receiving. The connection with the "hidden manna" 
 will thus be clear, as none save the high priest had access to the 
 "manna hidden" in the sanctuary. Believers, as spiritual priests unto 
 God, shall enjoy the heavenly antitypes to the hidden manna and the 
 Urim stone. What they had peculiarly to contend against at Pergamos was 
 the temptation to <I>idol-meats,</I> and <I>fornication,</I> put in 
 their way by Balaamites. As Phinehas was rewarded with "an everlasting 
 priesthood" for his zeal against these very sins to which the Old 
 Testament Balaam seduced Israel; so the heavenly high priesthood is the 
 reward promised here to those zealous against the New Testament 
 Balaamites tempting Christ's people to the same sins.

 purple-seller of this city, having been converted at Philippi, a 
 Macedonian city (with which Thyatira, as being a Macedonian colony, had 
 naturally much intercourse), was probably the instrument of first 
 carrying the Gospel to her native town. John follows the geographical

 Pergamos to Sardis [S<FONT SIZE=-1>TRABO</FONT>, 13:4].

 Some self-styled prophetess (or as the feminine in <I>Hebrew</I> is 
 often used <I>collectively</I> to express a multitude, <I>a set of 
 false prophets</I>), as closely attached to the Church of Thyatira as a 
 <I>wife</I> is to a husband, and as powerfully influencing for evil 
 that Church as Jezebel did Ahab. As Balaam, in Israel's early history, 
 so Jezebel, daughter of Eth-baal, king of Sidon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+16:31">1Ki 16:31</A>,
 
 formerly priest of Astarte, and murderer of his predecessor on the
 throne, J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>
 [<I>Against Apion,</I> 1.18]), was the great seducer to
 idolatry in Israel's later history. Like her father, she was swift to
 shed blood. Wholly given to Baal worship, like Eth-baal, whose name
 expresses his idolatry, she, with her strong will, seduced the weak
 Ahab and Israel beyond the calf-worship (which was a worship of the
 true God under the cherub-ox form, that is, a violation of the second
 commandment) to that of Baal
 (a violation of the first commandment also).
 She seems to have been herself a priestess and prophetess of
 Baal. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:22,30">2Ki 9:22, 30</A>,

 "<I>whoredoms</I> of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Jezebel and her 
 <I>witchcrafts</I>" (impurity was part of the worship of the 
 Ph&oelig;nician Astarte, or Venus). Her spiritual counterpart at 
 Thyatira lured God's "servants" by pretended utterances of inspiration 
 to the same libertinism, fornication, and eating of idol-meats, as the 
 Balaamites and Nicolaitanes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:6,14,15">Re 2:6, 14, 15</A>).

 By a false spiritualism these seducers led their victims into the 
 grossest carnality, as though things done in the flesh were outside the 
 true man, and were, therefore, indifferent. "The deeper the Church 
 penetrated into heathenism, the more she herself became heathenish;

 the Spirit in this case sanctions the <I>additional</I> thought as 
 true, that the Lord shall mingle mercy to some, with judgment on 
 others; beginning by destroying His Antichristian foes, He shall reign 
 in love over the rest. "Christ shall rule them with a <I>scepter</I> of

 M<FONT SIZE=-1>ELITO</FONT>, bishop of Sardis in the second century,

 himself and his flock as to the Old Testament canon and wrote an

 in reality fulfil even a third of them, would be esteemed holy by men,

 in Sardis and Laodicea alone of the seven we read of no conflict with 
 foes within or without the Church. Not that either had renounced the

 faithfulness to witness for God by word and example, so as to "torment

 What Sardis is to "remember" is, not <I>how</I> joyfully she had
 received originally the Gospel message, but how the precious deposit 
 was committed to her originally, so that she could not say, she had not 
 "received and heard" it. The <I>Greek</I> is not aorist (as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:4">Re 2:4</A>,

 as to Ephesus, "Thou <I>didst leave</I> thy first love"), but "thou 
 hast received" (perfect), and still hast the permanent deposit of 
 doctrine committed to thee. The word "keep" (so the <I>Greek</I> is for 
 <I>English Version,</I> "hold fast") which follows, accords with this 
 sense. "Keep" or observe the commandment which thou hast received and 
 didst hear.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>heard</B>--<I>Greek</I> aorist, "didst hear," namely, when the
 Gospel doctrine was committed to thee.  T<FONT SIZE=-1>RENCH</FONT>
 explains "how," <I>with what demonstration of the Spirit and power</I>
 from Christ's ambassadors the truth came to you, and how heartily and
 zealously you at first received it. Similarly 
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>, "Regard to her former <I>character</I>
 (<I>how</I> it once stood) ought to guard Sardis against the future 
 <I>hour, whatsoever</I> it shall be, proving fatal to her." But it is 
 not likely that the Spirit repeats the same exhortation virtually to 
 Sardis as to Ephesus.

 Church, with the same stealthiness and as unexpectedly as shall be My 
 visible second coming. As <I>the thief</I> gives no notice of his

 describes His second coming, to describe His coming in special 
 judgments on churches and states (as Jerusalem,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:4-28">Mt 24:4-28</A>)

 these special judgments being anticipatory earnests of that great last 
 coming. "The last day is hidden from us, that every day may be observed 
 by us" [A<FONT SIZE=-1>UGUSTINE</FONT>].  Twice Christ in the days of 
 His flesh spake the same words

 The Greek proverb was that "the feet of the avenging deities are shod

 profession with any defilement of flesh or spirit, but to "keep her 
 garments." For no defilement shall enter the heavenly city. Not that 
 any keep themselves here wholly free from defilement; but, as compared 
 with hollow professors, the godly <I>keep themselves unspotted from the

 coincidence, proving that these epistles are, as they profess, in their 
 words, as well as substance, Christ's own addresses; not even tinged 
 with the color of John's style, such as it appears in his Gospel and 
 Epistles. The coincidence is mainly with the three other Gospels, and 
 not with John's, which makes the coincidence more markedly undesigned. 
 So also the clause, "He that hath an ear, let him hear," is not 
 repeated from John's Gospel, but from the Lord's own words in the three 
 synoptic Gospels

 <B>he that hath the key of David</B>--the antitype of Eliakim, to whom 
 the "key," the emblem of authority "over the house of David," was 
 transferred from Shebna, who was removed from the office of chamberlain 
 or treasurer, as unworthy of it. Christ, the Heir of the throne of 
 David, shall supplant all the less worthy stewards who have abused 
 their trust in God's spiritual house, and "shall reign over the house 
 of Jacob," literal and spiritual

 The power of the keys was given to Peter and the other apostles, only 
 when, and in so far as, Christ made him and them infallible. Whatever 
 degrees of this power may have been committed to ministers, the supreme 
 power belongs to Christ alone. Thus Peter rightly opened the Gospel 
 door to the Gentiles

 Eliakim had "the key of the house of David laid upon his shoulder": 
 Christ, as the antitypical David, Himself has the key of the supreme

 whereas the sense rather is, He does so because she has "<I>but

 had a Church <I>small in numbers and external resources:</I> "a little 
 flock poor in worldly goods, and of small account in the eyes of men" 
 [T<FONT SIZE=-1>RENCH</FONT>]. So A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>. I prefer 
 the view given above. The <I>Greek</I> verbs are in the aorist tense:

 The promise to Philadelphia is larger than that to Smyrna. To Smyrna 
 the promise was that "the synagogue of Satan" should not prevail 
 against the faithful in her: to Philadelphia, that she should even win 
 over some of "the synagogue of Satan" to <I>fall on their faces and 
 confess God is in her of a truth.</I> Translate, "(some) of the 
 synagogue." For until Christ shall come, and <I>all</I> Israel then be 
 saved, there is but "a remnant" being gathered out of the Jews 
 "according to the election of grace." This is an instance of how Christ 
 set before her an "open door," some of her greatest adversaries, the 
 Jews, being brought to the obedience of the faith. Their <I>worshipping 
 before her feet</I> expresses the convert's willingness to take the 
 very lowest place in the Church, doing servile honor to those whom once 
 they persecuted, rather than dwell with the ungodly. So the Philippian

 <I>My endurance</I> is the endurance which I require, and which I

 the usurper be cast out, and all "His enemies be made His footstool."

 describes.  See on

 <A HREF="JFB51.htm#Col4_16">Col 4:16</A>, 

 on the Epistle which is thought to have been written to the Laodicean 
 Church by Paul. The Church in latter times was apparently flourishing; 
 for one of the councils at which the canon of Scripture was determined 
 was held in Laodicea in <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 361. Hardly a

 He who not only says, but is, <I>the Truth.</I> The saints used 
 <I>Amen</I> at the end of prayer, or in assenting to the word of God; 
 but none, save the Son of God, ever said, "Amen, I say unto you," for 
 it is the language peculiar to God, who avers <I>by Himself.</I> The 
 New Testament formula, "Amen. I say unto you," is equivalent to the Old 
 Testament formula, "<I>as I live,</I> saith Jehovah." In John's Gospel 
 alone He uses (in the <I>Greek</I>) the double "Amen,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:51,3:3">Joh 1:51; 3:3</A>,

 &c.; in <I>English Version,</I>" Verily, verily." The title happily
 harmonizes with the address. His unchanging faithfulness as "the Amen" 
 contrasts with Laodicea's wavering of purpose, "neither hot nor cold"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:16">Re 3:16</A>).

 The angel of Laodicea has with some probability been conjectured to be 
 Archippus, to whom, thirty years previously, Paul had already given a 
 monition, as needing to be stirred up to diligence in his ministry. So 
 the <I>Apostolic Constitutions,</I> [8.46], name him as the first 
 bishop of Laodicea: supposed to be the son of Philemon

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>faithful and true witness</B>--As "the Amen" expresses the 
 unchangeable truth of His promises; so "the faithful the true witness," 
 the truth of His revelations as to the heavenly things which He has 
 seen and testifies. "Faithful," that is, trustworthy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:11,13">2Ti 2:11, 13</A>).

 "True" is here (<I>Greek,</I> "<I>alethinos</I>") <I>not 
 truth-speaking</I> (<I>Greek,</I> "<I>alethes</I>"), but "perfectly 
 realizing all that is comprehended in the name <I>Witness</I>"

 Three things are necessary for this: (1) to have seen with His own eyes 
 what He attests; (2) to be competent to relate it for others; (3) to be 
 willing truthfully to do so. In Christ all these conditions meet

 requires that "cold" should here mean more than negatively cold; it is
 rather, positively <I>icy cold:</I> having never yet been warmed. The
 Laodiceans were in spiritual things <I>cold</I> comparatively, but not
 <I>cold</I> as the world outside, and as those who had never belonged
 to the Church. The lukewarm state, if it be the transitional stage to a 
 warmer, is a desirable state (for a little religion, if real, is better 
 than none); but most fatal when, as here, an abiding condition, for it 
 is mistaken for a safe state

 This accounts for Christ's desiring that they were <I>cold</I> rather 
 than <I>lukewarm.</I> For then there would not be the same "danger of 
 mixed motive and disregarded principle" [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]. 
 Also, there is more hope of the "cold," that is, those who are of the 
 world, and not yet warmed by the Gospel call; for, when called, they 
 may become <I>hot</I> and fervent Christians: such did the 
 once-<I>cold</I> publicans, Zaccheus and Matthew, become. But the 
 <I>lukewarm</I> has been brought within reach of the holy fire, without 
 being heated by it into <I>fervor:</I> having religion enough to lull 
 the conscience in false security, but not religion enough to save the

 <I>Coptic</I> transpose thus, "hot nor cold." It is remarkable that the 
 <I>Greek</I> adjectives are in the masculine, agreeing with the angel, 
 not feminine, agreeing with the Church. The Lord addresses the angel as 
 the embodiment and representative of the Church. The chief minister is 
 answerable for his flock if he have not faithfully warned the members 
 of it.

 <B>I will</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "I am about to," "I am ready to": I have

 being executed, if only they repent at once. His dealings towards them 
 will depend on theirs towards Him.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Canaan spued out its inhabitants for their abominations. Physicians

 The riches on which they prided themselves were spiritual riches; 
 though, doubtless, their spiritual self-sufficiency ("I have need of 
 nothing") was much fostered by their worldly wealth; as, on the other

 their own estimate of themselves, "I have need of nothing!"

 and the giving up of all things, however dear to us, that would prevent 
 our <I>receiving</I> Christ's salvation as a <I>free gift,</I> for

 <B>white raiment</B>--"garments." Laodicea's wools were famous. Christ 
 offers infinitely whiter raiment. As "gold tried in the fire" expresses 
 <I>faith</I> tested by fiery trials: so "white raiment," <I>Christ's 
 righteousness</I> imputed to the believer in justification and imparted 
 in sanctification.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>appear</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "be manifested," namely, at the last day, 
 when everyone without the wedding garment shall be discovered. To strip 
 one, is in the East the image of putting to open shame. So also to 
 clothe one with fine apparel is the image of doing him honor. Man can 
 discover his shame, God alone can cover it, so that his nakedness shall 
 not be manifested at last

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:10-14">Col 3:10-14</A>).

 Blessed is he whose sin is so <I>covered.</I> The hypocrite's shame may 
 be manifested now; it must be so at last.

 <B>anoint .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with eye-salve</B>--The oldest manuscripts 
 read, "(buy of Me) eye-salve (<I>collyrium,</I> a roll of ointment), 
 <I>to anoint</I> thine eyes." Christ has for Laodicea an ointment far 
 more precious than all the costly unguents of the East. The <I>eye</I> 
 is here the conscience or inner light of the mind. According as it is 
 sound and "single" (<I>Greek,</I> "<I>haplous,</I>" "simple"), or 
 otherwise, the man sees aright spiritually, or does not. The Holy 
 Spirit's unction, like the ancient eye-salve's, first smarts with 
 conviction of sin, then heals. He opens our eyes first to ourselves in 
 our wretchedness, then to the Saviour in His preciousness. T<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>RENCH</FONT> notices that the most sunken churches of the 
 seven, namely, Sardis and Laodicea, are the ones in which alone are 
 specified no opponents from without, nor heresies from within. The 
 Church owes much to God's overruling Providence which has made so often 
 internal and external foes, in spite of themselves, to promote His 
 cause by calling forth her energies in contending for the faith once 
 delivered to the saints. Peace is dearly bought at the cost of 
 spiritual stagnation, where there is not interest enough felt in 
 religion to contend about it at all.</P>

 This is a further manifestation of His loving desire for the sinner's 
 salvation. He who is Himself "the Door," and who bids us "knock" that 
 it may be "opened unto" us, is first Himself to knock at the door of 
 our hearts. If He did not knock first, we should never come to knock at 
 His door. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:4-6">So 5:4-6</A>,

 which is plainly alluded to here; the Spirit thus in Revelation sealing 
 the canonicity of that mystical book. The spiritual state of the bride 
 there, between <I>waking</I> and <I>sleeping,</I> slow to open the door 
 to her divine lover, answers to that of the <I>lukewarm</I> Laodicea 
 here. "Love in regard to men emptied (humbled) God; for He does not 
 remain in His place and call to Himself the servant whom He loved, but 
 He comes down Himself to seek him, and He who is all-rich arrives at 
 the lodging of the pauper, and with His own voice intimates His 
 yearning love, and seeks a similar return, and withdraws not when 
 disowned, and is not impatient at insult, and when persecuted still 
 waits at the doors" [N<FONT SIZE=-1>ICOLAUS</FONT> C<FONT

 <B>my voice</B>--He appeals to the sinner not only with His hand (His 
 providences) <I>knocking,</I> but with His <I>voice</I> (His word read 
 or heard; or rather, His Spirit inwardly applying to man's spirit the 
 lessons to be drawn from His providence and His word). If we refuse to 
 answer to His knocking at our door now, He will refuse to hear our 
 knocking at His door hereafter. In respect to His second coming also, 
 He is even now <I>at the door,</I> and we know not how soon He may 
 <I>knock:</I> therefore we should always be ready to <I>open to Him 
 immediately.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ <I>knocks,</I> but does not break open the door, though the

 The transfigured elect Church shall with Christ judge and reign over 
 the nations in the flesh, and Israel the foremost of them; ministering 
 blessings to them as angels were the Lord's mediators of blessing and

 there shall be no longer scope for it, for all on earth shall know the

 order of the promises in the seven epistles corresponds to that of the 
 unfolding of the kingdom of God its first beginnings on earth to its

 Here there is a division, the seven falling into two groups,

 Christ on His throne, even as He has sat with His Father on His 
 Father's throne

 Here begins the Revelation proper; and first, the fourth and fifth
 chapters set before us the heavenly scenery of the succeeding visions,
 and God on His throne, as the <I>covenant God of His Church,</I> the
 Revealer of them to His apostle through Jesus Christ. The first great
 portion comprises the opening of the seals and the sounding of the
 trumpets (fourth to eleventh chapters). As the communication respecting
 the seven churches opened with a suitable vision of the Lord Jesus as
 Head of the Church, so the second part opens with a vision suitable to
 the matter to be revealed. The scene is changed from earth to
 <I>heaven.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>1. After this</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "After these things," marking the 
 opening of the next vision in the succession. Here is the transition 
 from "the things which are"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:19">Re 1:19</A>),

 the existing state of the seven churches, as a type of the Church in 
 general, in John's time, to "the things which shall be hereafter," 
 namely, in relation to the time when John wrote.

 being opened. Compare

 Mt 3:16; 
 Ac 7:56; 10:11</A>. 

 But in those visions the heavens opened, disclosing the visions to
 those below on earth. Whereas here, heaven, the temple of God, remains 
 closed to those on earth, but John is transported in vision through an 
 open door up into heaven, whence he can see things passing on earth or 
 in heaven, according as the scenes of the several visions require.

 of God's perfection and eternity: not a half circle as the earthly 
 rainbow) surrounding the throne vertically. Its various colors, which 
 combined form one pure solar ray, symbolize the varied aspects of God's 
 providential dealings uniting in one harmonious whole. Here, however, 
 the predominating color among the prismatic colors is green, the most 
 refreshing of colors to look upon, and so symbolizing God's consolatory 
 promises in Christ to His people amidst judgments on His foes. 
 Moreover, the rainbow was the appointed token of God's covenant with 
 all flesh, and His people in particular. Hereby God in type renewed to 
 man the grant originally made to the first Adam. The antitype will be 
 the "new heavens and the new earth" restored to redeemed man, just as 
 the earth, after the destruction by the flood, was restored to Noah. As 
 the rainbow was first reflected on the waters of the world's ruin, and 
 continues to be seen only when a cloud is brought over the earth, so 
 another deluge, namely, of fire, shall precede the new heavens and 
 earth: the Lord, as here, on His throne, whence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:5">Re 4:5</A>)

 proceed "lightnings and thunderings," shall issue the commission to rid 
 the earth of its oppressors: but then, amidst judgment, when other 
 men's hearts fail them for fear, the believer shall be reassured by the 
 rainbow, the covenant token, round the throne (compare D<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>E</FONT> B<FONT SIZE=-1>URGH</FONT>, <I>Exposition of 
 Revelation</I>).  The heavenly bow speaks of the shipwreck of the world 
 through sin: it speaks also of calm and sunshine after the storm. The 
 <I>cloud</I> is the regular token of God's and Christ's presence, for 
 example, in the tabernacle's holiest place; on Mount Sinai at the 
 giving of the law; at the ascension

 <B>four and twenty elders</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "<I>the</I> four and
 twenty (or as one oldest manuscript, 'twenty-four') elders": the
 well-known elders [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]. But 
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>REGELLES</FONT> translates, "Upon the twenty-four
 thrones (<I>I saw:</I> omitted in two oldest manuscripts) elders
 sitting": which is more probable, as <I>the twenty-four elders</I> were 
 not mentioned before, whereas <I>the twenty-four thrones</I> were. They 
 are not angels, for they have <I>white robes</I> and <I>crowns</I> of 
 victory, implying a conflict and endurance, "Thou hast <I>redeemed 
 us</I>": they represent the <I>Heads</I> of the Old and New Testament 
 churches respectively, the Twelve Patriarchs (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:5-8">Re 7:5-8</A>,

 not in their personal, but in their representative character), and 
 Twelve Apostles. So in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+15:3">Re 15:3</A>,

 "the song of <I>Moses,</I> and of the <I>Lamb,</I>" the double 
 constituents of the Church are implied, the Old Testament and the New 
 Testament. "Elders" is the very term for <I>the ministry</I> both of 
 the Old and New Testament, the Jewish and the catholic Gentile Church. 
 The tabernacle was a "pattern" of the heavenly antitype; the holy 
 place, a figure of <FONT SIZE=-1>HEAVEN ITSELF</FONT>.  Thus Jehovah's 
 throne is represented by the mercy seat in the holiest, the 
 Shekinah-cloud over it. "The seven lamps of fire before the throne"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:5">Re 4:5</A>)

 are antitypical to the seven-branched candlestick also in the holiest, 
 emblem of the manifold Spirit of God: "the sea of glass"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:6">Re 4:6</A>)

 corresponds to the molten sea before the sanctuary, wherein the priests 
 washed themselves before entering on their holy service; so introduced 
 here in connection with the redeemed "priests unto God" (compare 
 <I>Note,</I> see on

 <A HREF="#Re15_2">Re 15:2</A>). 

 The "four living creatures"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:6,7">Re 4:6, 7</A>)

 answer to the cherubim over the mercy seat. So the twenty-four throned 
 and crowned elders are typified by the twenty-four chiefs of the 
 twenty-four courses of priests, "<I>Governors</I> of the sanctuary, and 
 governors of God"

 the pure ether which separates God's throne from John, and from all
 things before it, may be meant, symbolizing the "purity, calmness, and
 majesty of God's rule" [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]. But see the
 analogue in the temple, the molten sea <I>before</I> the sanctuary 
 (see on

 <A HREF="#Re4_4">Re 4:4</A>, 

 above). There is in this sea depth and transparency, but not the 
 fluidity and instability of the natural sea (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+15:2">Re 15:2</A>

 the baptism with the fire of trial is meant. Through both all the 
 king-priests have to pass in coming to God: His <I>judgments,</I> which

 "All round and within (their wings) they are (so two oldest 
 manuscripts, A, B, and <I>Vulgate</I> read) full of eyes." John's 
 object is to show that the six wings in each did not interfere with 
 that which he had before declared, namely, that they were "full of eyes 
 before and behind." The eyes were <I>round</I> the outside of each 
 wing, and up the <I>inside</I> of each when half expanded, and of the 
 part of body in that inward recess.

 as here, it occurs; also 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+99:3,5,9">Ps 99:3, 5, 9</A>,

 which displayed itself in times past. So here "Holy," as He "who was"; 
 "Holy," as He "who is": "Holy," as He "who is to come." He showed 
 Himself an object of holy worship in the past creation of all things: 
 more fully He shows Himself so in governing all things: He will, in the 
 highest degree, show Himself so in the consummation of all things. "Of 
 (from) Him, through Him, and to Him, are all things: to whom be glory 
 for ever. Amen." In

 whereas the cherubim in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:6">Eze 1:6</A>

 had <I>four</I> wings each. They are called by the same name, "living
 creatures." But whereas in Ezekiel each living creature has all four 
 faces, here the four belong severally one to each.  See on

 <A HREF="JFB26.htm#Eze1_6">Eze 1:6</A>. 

 The four <I>living creatures</I> answer by contrast to the four world 
 powers represented by four <I>beasts.</I> The Fathers identified them 
 with the four Gospels, Matthew the lion, Mark the ox, Luke the man, 
 John the eagle: these symbols, thus viewed, express not the personal 
 character of the Evangelists, but the manifold aspect <I>of Christ</I> 
 in relation to the world (<I>four</I> being the number significant of 
 world-wide extension, for example, the four quarters of the world) 
 presented by them severally: the lion expressing <I>royalty,</I> as 
 Matthew gives prominence to this feature of Christ; the ox, 
 <I>laborious endurance,</I> Christ's prominent characteristic in Mark; 
 man, <I>brotherly sympathy</I> with the whole race of man, Christ's 
 prominent feature in Luke; the eagle, <I>soaring majesty,</I> prominent 
 in John's description of Christ as the Divine Word. But here the 
 context best suits the view which regards the <I>four living 
 creatures</I> as representing the <I>redeemed election-Church</I> in 
 its relation of ministering king-priests to God, and ministers of 
 blessing to the redeemed earth, and the nations on it, and the animal 
 creation, in which <I>man</I> stands at the head of all, <I>the 
 lion</I> at the head of wild beasts, <I>the ox</I> at the head of tame 
 beasts, <I>the eagle</I> at the head of birds and of the creatures of 
 the waters. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:8-10">Re 5:8-10</A>,

 "Thou hast <I>redeemed us</I> by Thy blood <I>out of every kindred</I>

 and we shall reign on the earth</I>"; and

 Jewish tradition says the "four standards" under which Israel encamped
 in the wilderness, to the east, Judah, to the north, Dan, to the west, 
 Ephraim, to the south, Reuben, were respectively a <I>lion,</I> an 
 <I>eagle,</I> an <I>ox,</I> and a <I>man,</I> while in the midst was 
 the tabernacle containing the Shekinah symbol of the Divine Presence. 
 Thus we have "the picture of that blessed period when--the earth having 
 been fitted for being the kingdom of the Father--the court of heaven 
 will be transferred to earth, and the 'tabernacle of God shall be with 
 men'

 and the whole world will be subject to a never-ending theocracy" 
 (compare D<FONT SIZE=-1>E</FONT> B<FONT SIZE=-1>URGH</FONT>, 
 <I>Exposition of Revelation</I>). The point of union between the two 
 views given above is: Christ is the perfect realization of the ideal of 
 man; Christ is presented in His fourfold aspect in the four Gospels 
 respectively. The redeemed election-Church similarly, when in and 
 through Christ (with whom she shall reign) she realizes the ideal of 
 man, shall combine in herself human perfections having a fourfold 
 aspect: (1) kingly righteousness with hatred of evil and judicial 
 equity, answering to the "lion"; (2) laborious diligence in every duty, 
 the "ox"; (3) human sympathy, the "man"; (4) the contemplation of 
 heavenly truth, the "eagle." As the high-soaring intelligence, the 
 <I>eagle,</I> forms the contrasted complement to practical labor, the 
 <I>ox</I> bound to the soil; so holy judicial vengeance against evil, 
 the <I>lion</I> springing suddenly and terribly on the doomed, forms 
 the contrasted complement to human sympathy, the <I>man.</I> In

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:18">Re 22:18</A>).

 The roll, or book, appears from the context to be "<I>the title-deed of 
 man's inheritance</I>" [D<FONT SIZE=-1>E</FONT> B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>URGH</FONT>] redeemed by Christ, and contains the successive 
 steps by which He shall recover it from its usurper and obtain actual 
 possession of the kingdom already "purchased" for Himself and His elect 
 saints. However, no portion of the roll is said to be <I>unfolded</I> 
 and <I>read;</I> but simply the <I>seals</I> are successively 
 <I>opened,</I> giving final access to its contents being read as a 
 perfect whole, which shall not be until the events symbolized by the 
 seals shall have been past, when

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:10">Eph 3:10</A>

 shall receive its <I>complete</I> accomplishment, and the Lamb shall 
 reveal God's providential plans in redemption in all their manifold 
 beauties. Thus the opening of the seals will mean the successive steps 
 by which God in Christ clears the way for the final opening and reading 
 of the book at the visible setting up of the kingdom of Christ.

 NOW</FONT>, in Christ her Head, reigning on the earth: "all things are 
 being put under her feet, as under His; her kingly office and rank are 
 asserted, even in the midst of persecution." But even if we read (I 
 think the weightiest authority is against it), "They <I>reign,</I>"

 Many (M<FONT SIZE=-1>EDE</FONT>, F<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMING</FONT>, 
 N<FONT SIZE=-1>EWTON</FONT>, &c.) hold that all these seals have been
 fulfilled, the sixth having been so by the overthrow of paganism and
 establishment of Christianity under Constantine's edict, 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 312. There can, however, be no doubt that at
 least the sixth seal is future, and is to be at the coming again of 
 Christ.  The great objection to supposing the seals to be finally and 
 exhaustively fulfilled (though, probably, particular events may be 
 partial fulfilments typical of the final and fullest one), is that, if 
 so, they ought to furnish (as the destruction of Jerusalem, according 
 to Christ's prophecy, does) a strong external evidence of Revelation.  
 But it is clear they cannot be used for this, as hardly any two 
 interpreters of this school are agreed on what events constitute the 
 fulfilment of each seal. Probably not isolated facts, but 
 <I>classes</I> of events preparing the way for Christ's coming kingdom, 
 are intended by the opening of the seals. The four living creatures 
 severally cry at the opening of the first four seals, "Come," which 
 fact marks the division of the <I>seven,</I> as often occurs in this 
 sacred number, into <I>four</I> and <I>three.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>1. one of the seals</B>--The oldest manuscripts, A, B, C, 
 <I>Vulgate,</I> and <I>Syriac</I> read, "one of the <I>seven</I> 
 seals."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>noise</B>--The three oldest manuscripts read this in the nominative 
 or dative, not the genitive, as <I>English Version,</I> "I heard one 
 from among the four living creatures saying, as (it were) <I>the 
 voice</I> (or, '<I>as with the voice</I>') of thunder." The first 
 living creature was like a <I>lion</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:7">Re 4:7</A>):

 his voice is in consonance. Implying the lion-like boldness with which, 
 in the successive great revivals, the faithful have <I>testified for 
 Christ,</I> and especially a little before His coming shall testify. 
 Or, rather, their earnestness in praying for <I>Christ's coming.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Come and see</B>--One oldest manuscript, B, has "And see." But A, C, 
 and <I>Vulgate</I> reject it. A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> rightly 
 objects to <I>English Version</I> reading: "Whither was John to come?  
 Separated as he was by the glassy sea from the throne, was he to cross 
 it?" Contrast the form of expression,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:8">Re 10:8</A>.

 It is much more likely to be the cry of the redeemed to the Redeemer, 
 "Come" and deliver the groaning creature from the bondage of 
 corruption. Thus,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:2">Re 6:2</A>

 is an answer to the cry, <I>went</I> (literally, "came") forth 
 corresponding to "Come." "Come," says G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT>, is 
 the living creature's address to John, <I>calling his earnest 
 attention.</I> But it seems hard to see how "Come" by itself can mean 
 this. Compare the only other places in Revelation where it is used,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:1,22:17">Re 4:1; 22:17</A>.

 If the four living creatures represent the four Gospels, the "Come" 
 will be their invitation to everyone (for it is not written that they 
 addressed <I>John</I>) to <I>accept</I> Christ's salvation while there 
 is time, as the opening of the seals marks a progressive step towards 
 the end (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:17">Re 22:17</A>).

 Judgments are foretold as accompanying the <I>preaching of the Gospel 
 as a witness to all nations</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:6-11,Mt+24:6-14">Re 14:6-11;
 Mt 24:6-14</A>). 

 Thus the invitation, "Come," here, is aptly parallel to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:14">Mt 24:14</A>.

 The opening of the first four seals is followed by judgments 
 preparatory for His coming. At the opening of the fifth seal, the 
 martyrs above express the same

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:9,10">Re 6:9, 10</A>;
 
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:10">Zec 1:10</A>).

 At the opening of the sixth seal, the Lord's coming is ushered in with 
 terrors to the ungodly. At the seventh, the consummation is fully 
 attained

 not merely <I>Greek,</I> "<I>stephanoi,</I>" "crowns" or "wreaths"), 
 and is personally attended by the hosts of heaven. Compare

 four seals usher in <I>judgments</I> on the earth, as the power which 
 opposes the reign of Himself and His Church. This, rather than the work

 secondarily, the elect will be gathered out through His word and His 
 judgments.</P>

 bloodless victories is soon followed, through man's perversion of the 
 Gospel, by the <I>red</I> horse of bloodshed; but this is overruled to 
 the clearing away of the obstacles to Christ's coming kingdom. The 
 patient <I>ox</I> is the emblem of the second <I>living creature</I> 
 who, at the opening of this seal, saith, "Come." The saints amidst 
 judgments on the earth in patience "endure to the end."

 heard "in the midst of the four living creatures" (as Jehovah in the 
 Shekinah-cloud manifested His presence between the cherubim); because 
 it is only for the sake of, and in connection with, His redeemed, that 
 God mitigates His judgments on the earth.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>A measure</B>--"A ch&oelig;nix." While making food scarce, do not 
 make it so much so that a ch&oelig;nix (about a day's provision of 
 wheat, variously estimated at two or three pints) shall not be 
 obtainable "for a penny" (<I>denarius,</I> eight and a half pence of 
 our money, probably the day's wages of a laborer). <I>Famine</I>
 generally follows the <I>sword.</I> Ordinarily, from sixteen to twenty 
 measures were given for a denarius. The <I>sword, famine, noisome 
 beasts,</I> and the <I>pestilence,</I> are God's four judgments on the 
 earth. A spiritual famine, too, may be included in the judgment. The 
 "Come," in the case of this third seal, is said by the third of the 
 four living creatures, whose likeness is <I>a man</I> indicative of 
 sympathy and human compassion for the sufferers. God in it tempers 
 judgment with mercy.  Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:7">Mt 24:7</A>,

 not restricted to one time, but extend through the whole period of 
 Church history to the coming of Christ, before which last great and 
 terrible day of the Lord they shall reach highest aggravation. The 
 first seal is the summary, Christ going forth <I>conquering</I> till 
 all enemies are subdued under Him, with a view to which the judgments 
 subsequently specified accompany the <I>preaching of the Gospel for a

 four to the visible world; the fifth, to the martyrs who have died as 
 believers; the sixth, to those who have died, or who shall be found at 
 Christ's coming, unbelievers, namely, "the kings .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. great 
 men .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  bondman .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. freeman"; the seventh, to 
 the silence in heaven. The scene changes from earth to heaven; so that 
 interpretations which make these three last consecutive to the first 
 four seals, are very doubtful.

 <B>I saw</B>--in spirit. For souls are not naturally visible.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>under the altar</B>--As the blood of sacrificial victims slain on 
 the altar was poured <I>at the bottom of the altar,</I> so the souls of 
 those sacrificed for Christ's testimony are symbolically represented as 
 <I>under the altar,</I> in heaven; for the life or animal <I>soul</I> 
 is in the <I>blood,</I> and blood is often represented as crying for 
 vengeance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:10">Ge 4:10</A>).

 The altar in heaven, antitypical to the altar of sacrifice, is Christ 
 crucified. As it is the altar that sanctifies the gift, so it is Christ 
 alone who makes our obedience, and even our sacrifice of life for the 
 truth, acceptable to God. The sacrificial altar was not in the 
 sanctuary, but outside; so Christ's literal sacrifice and the 
 figurative sacrifice of the martyrs took place, not in the heavenly 
 sanctuary, but outside, here on earth. The only altar in heaven is that 
 antitypical to the temple altar of incense. The blood of the martyrs 
 cries from the earth under Christ's cross, whereon they may be 
 considered virtually to have been sacrificed; their souls cry from 
 under the altar of incense, which is Christ in heaven, by whom alone 
 the incense of praise is accepted before God. They are <I>under</I> 
 Christ, in His immediate presence, shut up unto Him in joyful eager 
 expectancy until He shall come to raise the sleeping dead. Compare the 
 language of

 <U>2 Maccabees 7:36</U> 

 as indicating Jewish opinion on the subject. Our brethren who have now
 suffered a short pain are dead <I>under</I> (<I>Greek</I>) <I>God's 
 covenant</I> of everlasting life.

 The seventh trumpet

 seventh vial,

 Not that the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven vials, 
 though parallel, are repetitions. They each trace the course of divine 
 action up to the grand consummation in which they all meet, under a 
 different aspect. <I>Thunders, lightnings, an earthquake,</I> and

 <I>The half-hour silence</I> is the brief pause <FONT SIZE=-1>GIVEN

 In the Jewish temple, musical instruments and singing resounded during 
 the whole time of the offering of the sacrifices, which formed the 
 first part of the service. But at the offering of incense, solemn 
 silence was kept ("My soul <I>waiteth</I> upon God,"

 <B>3. another angel</B>--not Christ, as many think; for He, in 
 Revelation, is always designated by one of His proper titles; though, 
 doubtless, He is the only true High Priest, the Angel of the Covenant, 
 standing before the golden altar of incense, and there, as Mediator, 
 offering up His people's prayers, rendered acceptable before God 
 through the incense of His merit. Here the angel acts merely as a 
 <I>ministering spirit</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:4">Heb 1:4</A>),

 just as the twenty-four elders <I>have vials full of odors,</I> or 
 incense, <I>which are the prayers of saints</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:8">Re 5:8</A>),

 and which they present before the Lamb. How precisely their ministry, 
 in perfuming the prayers of the saints and offering them on the altar 
 of incense, is exercised, we know not, but we do know they are not to 
 be prayed <FONT SIZE=-1>TO</FONT>. If we send an offering of tribute to 
 the king, the king's messenger is not allowed to appropriate what is 
 due to the king alone.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>there was given unto him</B>--The angel does not provide the 
 incense; it is <I>given to him</I> by Christ, whose meritorious 
 obedience and death are the incense, rendering the saints' prayers well 
 pleasing to God. It is not the saints who give the angel the incense; 
 nor are their prayers identified with the incense; nor do they offer

 prophecies, but now more and more clearly revealed according as the 
 Gospel kingdom develops itself, up to its fullest consummation at the

 glorious consummation of the mystery in having taken to Himself and His 
 saints the kingdom so long usurped by Satan and the ungodly. Thus this

 <I>Coptic.</I> Supported by B and <I>Syriac.</I> If it be omitted, the
 "reed" will, in construction, agree with "saying." So 
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>ORDSWORTH</FONT> takes it. The <I>reed,</I> the canon of
 Scripture, the measuring reed of the Church, our rule of faith, 
 <I>speaks.</I> So in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:7">Re 16:7</A>

 <I>the altar</I> is personified as <I>speaking</I> (compare 
 <I>Note,</I> see on

 <A HREF="#Re16_7">Re 16:7</A>). 

 The Spirit speaks in the canon of Scripture (the word <I>canon</I> is 
 derived from <I>Hebrew,</I> "<I>kaneh,</I>" "a reed," the word here 
 used; and John it was who completed the canon). So V<FONT

 Heb 1:8</A>,

 <I>Greek,</I> "a rod of straightness," <I>English Version,</I> "a
 scepter of righteousness"; this is added to guard against it being
 thought that the <I>reed</I> was one "shaken by the wind" In the abrupt
 style of the Apocalypse, "saying" is possibly indefinite, put for
 "<I>one said.</I>" Still W<FONT SIZE=-1>ORDSWORTH'S</FONT> view agrees
 best with <I>Greek.</I> So the ancient commentator, A<FONT

 <B>the temple</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "<I>naon</I>" (as distinguished from 
 the <I>Greek,</I> "<I>hieron,</I>" or temple in general), the Holy 
 Place, "<I>the sanctuary.</I>"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the altar</B>--of incense; for it alone was in "the sanctuary." 
 (<I>Greek,</I> "<I>naos</I>"). The measurement of the Holy place seems 
 to me to stand parallel to the sealing of the elect of Israel under the 
 sixth seal.  God's elect are symbolized by the sanctuary at Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:16,17">1Co 3:16, 17</A>,

 where the same <I>Greek</I> word, "<I>naos,</I>" occurs for "temple," 
 as here). Literal Israel in Jerusalem, and with the temple restored

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:3,5">Eze 40:3, 5</A>,

 where also the temple is measured with the measuring reed, the 
 forty-first, forty-second, forty-third, and forty-fourth chapters), 
 shall stand at the head of the elect Church. The measuring implies at 
 once the exactness of the proportions of the temple to be restored, and 
 the definite completeness (not one being wanting) of the numbers of the 
 Israelite and of the Gentile elections. The literal temple at Jerusalem 
 shall be the typical forerunner of the heavenly Jerusalem, in which 
 there shall be all temple, and <I>no</I> portion exclusively set apart 
 as <I>temple.</I> John's accurately drawing the distinction in 
 subsequent chapters between God's servants and those who bear the mark 
 of the beast, is the way whereby he fulfils the direction here given 
 him <I>to measure the temple.</I> The fact that the <I>temple</I> is 
 distinguished from <I>them that worship therein,</I> favors the view 
 that the spiritual temple, the Jewish and Christian Church, is not 
 exclusively meant, but that the literal temple must also be meant. It 
 shall be rebuilt on the return of the Jews to their land. Antichrist 
 shall there put forward his blasphemous claims. The sealed elect of 
 Israel, the head of the elect Church, alone shall refuse his claims.  
 These shall constitute the true sanctuary which is here measured, that 
 is, accurately marked and kept by God, whereas the rest shall yield to 
 his pretensions. W<FONT SIZE=-1>ORDSWORTH</FONT> objects that, in the 
 twenty-five passages of the Acts, wherein the Jewish temple is 
 mentioned, it is called <I>hieron,</I> not <I>naos,</I> and so in the 
 apostolic Epistles; but this is simply because no occasion for 
 mentioning <I>the literal Holy Place</I> (<I>Greek,</I> "<I>naos</I>") 
 occurs in Acts and the Epistles; indeed, in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:48">Ac 7:48</A>,

 though not directly, there does occur the term, <I>naos,</I> indirectly 
 referring to the Jerusalem temple <I>Holy Place.</I> In addressing 
 Gentile Christians, to whom the literal Jerusalem <I>temple</I> was not 
 familiar, it was to be expected the term, <I>naos,</I> should not be 
 found in the literal, but in the spiritual sense. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:19">Re 11:19</A>

 1290 days, and 1260 days, as symbolical of the long period of the 
 Gentile times, whether dating from the subversion of the Jewish 
 theocracy at the Babylonian captivity (the <I>kingdom</I> having been 
 never since restored to Israel), or from the last destruction of 
 Jerusalem under Titus, and extending to the restoration of the 
 theocracy at the coming of Him "whose right it is"; the different 
 epochs marked by the 2300, 1335, 1290, and 1260 days, will not be fully 
 cleared up till the grand consummation; but, meanwhile, our duty and 
 privilege urge us to investigate them. Some one of the epochs assigned 
 by many may be right but as yet it is uncertain. The times of the 
 Gentile monarchies during Israel's <I>seven times</I> punishment, will 
 probably, in the narrower sense

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:2">Re 11:2</A>),

 be succeeded by the much more restricted times of the personal 
 Antichrist's tyranny in the Holy Land. The long years of papal misrule 
 may be followed by the short time of the man of sin who shall 
 concentrate in himself all the apostasy, persecution, and evil of the 
 various forerunning Antichrists, Antiochus, Mohammed, Popery, just 
 before Christ's advent. His time shall be <FONT SIZE=-1>THE 
 RECAPITULATION</FONT> and open consummation of the "mystery of 
 iniquity" so long leavening the world. Witnessing churches may be 
 followed by witnessing individuals, the former occupying the longer, 
 the latter, the shorter period. The <I>three and a half</I> (1260 days 
 being three and a half years of three hundred sixty days each, during 
 which the two witnesses prophesy in sackcloth) is the sacred number 
 <I>seven</I> halved, implying the Antichristian world-power's time is 
 broken at best; it answers to the <I>three and a half</I> years' period 
 in which Christ witnessed for the truth, and the Jews, His own people, 
 disowned Him, and the God-opposed world power crucified Him (compare 
 <I>Note,</I> see on

 <A HREF="JFB27.htm#Da9_27">Da 9:27</A>). 

 The three and a half, in a word, marks the time in which the earthly 
 rules over the heavenly kingdom. It was the duration of Antiochus' 
 treading down of the temple and persecution of faithful Israelites. The 
 resurrection of the witnesses after three and a half days, answers to 
 Christ's resurrection after three days. The world power's times never 
 reach the sacred fulness of seven times three hundred sixty, that is, 
 2520, though they approach to it in 2300

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:14">Da 8:14</A>).

 in the wilderness, as contrasted with the sabbatic rest in Canaan: 
 reminding the Church that here, in the world wilderness, she cannot 
 look for her sabbatic rest. Also, three and a half years was the period 
 of the heaven being shut up, and of consequent famine, in Elias' time. 
 Thus, three and a half represented to the Church the idea of toil,

 I think the twofold Church, Jewish and Gentile, may be meant by the two 
 candlesticks represented by the two witnesses: just as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:1-8">Re 7:1-8</A>

 there are described first the sealed of Israel, then those of all 
 nations. But see on

 <A HREF="#Re11_4">Re 11:4</A>. 

 The actions of the two witnesses are just those of Moses when 
 witnessing for God against Pharaoh (the type of Antichrist, the last 
 and greatest foe of Israel), <I>turning the waters into blood,</I> and 
 <I>smiting</I> with <I>plagues;</I> and of Elijah (the witness for God 
 in an almost universal apostasy of Israel, a remnant of seven thousand, 
 however, being left, as the 144,000 sealed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:1-8">Re 7:1-8</A>)

 causing <I>fire</I> by his word to <I>devour the enemy,</I> and 
 <I>shutting heaven, so that it rained not for three years and six 
 months,</I> the very time (1260 days) during which the two witnesses 
 prophesy.  Moreover, the words "witness" and "prophesy" are usually 
 applied to <I>individuals,</I> not to abstractions (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+52:8">Ps 52:8</A>).

 D<FONT SIZE=-1>E</FONT> B<FONT SIZE=-1>URGH</FONT> thinks Elijah and 
 Moses will again appear, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:5,6">Mal 4:5, 6</A>

 seems to imply (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:11,Ac+3:21">Mt 17:11;
 Ac 3:21</A>). 

 Moses and Elijah appeared with Christ at the Transfiguration, which
 foreshadowed His coming millennial kingdom. As to Moses, compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+34:5,6,Jude+1:9">De 34:5, 6;
 Jude 9</A>. 

 Elias' genius and mode of procedure bears the same relation to the
 "second" coming of Christ, that John the Baptist's did to the first 
 coming [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]. Many of the early Church thought 
 the two witnesses to be Enoch and Elijah.  This would avoid the 
 difficulty of the dying a <I>second</I> time, for these have never yet 
 died; but, perhaps, shall be the witnesses slain. Still, the <I>turning 
 the water to blood, and the plagues</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:6">Re 11:6</A>),
 
 apply best to "<I>Moses</I> (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+15:3">Re 15:3</A>,

 the song of <I>Moses</I>"). The transfiguration glory of Moses and 
 Elias was not their permanent resurrection-state, which shall not be 
 till Christ shall come to glorify His saints, for He has precedence 
 before all in rising. An objection to this interpretation is that those 
 blessed departed servants of God would have to submit to death

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:7,8">Re 11:7, 8</A>),

 and this in Moses' case a <I>second</I> time, which

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:27">Heb 9:27</A>

 denies.  See on

 <A HREF="JFB38.htm#Zec4_11">Zec 4:11, 12</A>, 

 on the two witnesses as answering to "the two olive trees." The two 
 olive trees are channels of the oil feeding the Church, and symbols of 
 peace. The Holy Spirit is the oil in them. Christ's witnesses, in 
 remarkable times of the Church's history, have generally appeared in 
 pairs: as Moses and Aaron, the inspired civil and religious 
 authorities; Caleb and Joshua; Ezekiel the priest and Daniel the 
 prophet; Zerubbabel and Joshua.

 <B>in sackcloth</B>--the garment of prophets, especially when calling 
 people to mortification of their sins, and to repentance. Their very 
 exterior aspect accorded with their teachings: so Elijah, and John who 
 came in His spirit and power. The <I>sackcloth</I> of the witnesses is 
 a catch word linking this episode under the sixth trumpet, with the 
 <I>sun black as sackcloth</I> (in righteous retribution on the 
 apostates who rejected God's witnesses) under the sixth seal

 The phrase alludes to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:10,14">Zec 4:10, 14</A>,

 "the two anointed ones that stand by the Lord of the whole earth." The 
 article "the" marks this allusion. They are "the two candlesticks," not 
 that they are the Church, the <I>one</I> candlestick, but as its 
 representative <I>light-bearers</I> (<I>Greek,</I> "<I>phosteres,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:15">Php 2:15</A>),
 
 and ministering for its encouragement in a time of apostasy.
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>ORDSWORTH'S</FONT> view is worth consideration, whether
 it may not constitute a secondary sense: <I>the two witnesses, the 
 olive trees,</I> are <FONT SIZE=-1>THE TWO</FONT> T<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ESTAMENTS</FONT> ministering their <I>testimony</I> to the 
 Church of the old dispensation, as well as to that of the new, which 
 explains the two witnesses being called also <I>the two 
 candlesticks</I> (the Old and New Testament churches; the candlestick 
 in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:2">Zec 4:2</A>

 is but <I>one</I> as there was then but one Testament, and one Church, 
 the Jewish). The Church in both dispensations has no light in herself, 
 but derives it from the Spirit through the witness of the twofold word, 
 the two olive trees: compare <I>Note,</I> see on

 <A HREF="#Re11_1">Re 11:1</A>, 

 which is connected with this, <I>the reed,</I> the <I>Scripture

 P<FONT SIZE=-1>RIMASIUS</FONT> [X, p. 314]: the two witnesses preach in
 sackcloth, marking the ignominious treatment which the word, like 
 Christ Himself, receives from the world. So the twenty-four elders 
 represent the ministers of the two dispensations by the double twelve.  
 But

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:7">Re 11:7</A>

 Thus, John at once appropriates the Old Testament prophecies; and also,

 Christ's crucifixion was enclosed within the city by Constantine; so it 
 will be probably at the time of the slaying of the witnesses. "The 
 beast [for example, Napoleon and France's efforts] has been long 
 struggling for a footing in Palestine; after his ascent from the 
 bottomless pit he struggles much more" [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]. 
 Some one of the Napoleonic dynasty may obtain that footing, and even be 
 regarded as Messiah by the Jews, in virtue of his restoring them to 
 their own land; and so may prove to be the last Antichrist. The 
 difficulty is, how can Jerusalem be called "the great city," that is, 
 Babylon? By her becoming the world's capital of idolatrous apostasy, 
 such as Babylon originally was, and then Rome has been; just as she is 
 here called also "Sodom and Egypt."

 world apostasy, and so receive the last and worst visitation of all the 
 judgments ever inflicted on the apostate world, the earnest of which 
 was given in the Roman destruction of Jerusalem. In the wider sense, in 
 the Church-historical period, the Church being the sanctuary, all 
 outside of it is the world, the great city, wherein all the martyrdoms 
 of saints have taken place. <I>Babylon</I> marks its idolatry, 
 <I>Egypt</I> its tyranny, <I>Sodom</I> its desperate corruption,

 lead Antichrist's followers to exult in having at last seemingly 
 silenced in death their Christian rebukers. Like her Lord, the Church 
 will have her dark passion week followed by the bright resurrection 
 morn. It is a curious historical coincidence that, at the fifth Lateran 
 Council, May 5, 1514, no witness (not even the Moravians who were 
 summoned) testified for the truth, as H<FONT SIZE=-1>USS</FONT> and 
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> did at Constance; an orator ascended the

 "There is no reclaimant, no opponent." L<FONT SIZE=-1>UTHER</FONT>, on

 his famous theses on the church at Wittenberg. The objection is, the 
 years are years of three hundred sixty-five, not three hundred sixty,

 coincidence is curious; and if this prophecy be allowed other 
 fulfilments, besides the final and literal one under the last

 and the elect of all nations, caught up out of the reach of the 
 Antichristian foe. In

 <B>their enemies beheld them</B>--and were thus openly convicted by God 
 for their unbelief and persecution of His servants; unlike Elijah's 
 ascension formerly, in the sight of friends only. The Church caught up 
 to meet the Lord in the air, and transfigured in body, is justified by 
 her Lord before the world, even as the man-child (Jesus) was "caught up 
 unto God and His throne" from before <I>the dragon standing ready to 
 devour the woman's child as soon as born.</I></P>

 sixth seal, just at the approach of the Lord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:12">Re 6:12</A>).

 Christ was delivered unto His enemies on the fifth day of the week, and 
 on the <I>sixth</I> was crucified, and on the sabbath rested; so it is 
 under the sixth seal and sixth trumpet that the last suffering of the 
 Church, begun under the fifth seal and trumpet, is to be consummated, 
 before she enters on her seventh day of eternal sabbath. <I>Six</I> is 
 the number of the world power's greatest triumph, but at the same time 
 verges on <I>seven,</I> the divine number, when its utter destruction 
 takes place.  Compare "666" in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:18">Re 13:18</A>,
 
 "the number of the beast."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>tenth part of the city fell</B>--that is, of "the great city"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:19,Zec+14:2">Re 16:19;

 Thus, in the Church-historical view, it is hereby implied that one of 
 the ten apostate world kingdoms fall. But in the narrower view a tenth 
 of Jerusalem under Antichrist falls. The nine-tenths remain and become 
 when purified the center of Christ's earthly kingdom.

 including also the prophecy,

 the present, until first there is given a sketch of the history of the 
 origination, suffering, and faithfulness of the Church in a time of 
 apostasy and persecution. Instead of the third woe being detailed, the 
 grand consummation is summarily noticed, the thanksgiving of the 
 twenty-four elders in heaven for the establishment of <I>Christ's 
 kingdom on earth,</I> attended with the <I>destruction of the 
 destroyers of the earth.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>LAST</FONT> trumpet." <I>Six</I> is close to
 <I>seven,</I> but does not reach it. The world judgments are complete 
 in <I>six,</I> but by the fulfilment of <I>seven</I> the world kingdoms 
 become Christ's.  Six is the number of the world given over to 
 judgment. It is half of <I>twelve,</I> the Church's number, as three 
 and a half is half of seven, the divine number for completeness.  
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT> thinks the angel <I>here</I> to have been 
 Gabriel, which name is compounded of <I>El,</I> G<FONT

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:1">Re 10:1</A>).

 Gabriel therefore appropriately announced to Mary the advent of the 
 <I>mighty God-man:</I> compare the account of the <I>man-child's</I> 
 birth which follows

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:1-6">Re 12:1-6</A>),

 to which this forms the transition though the seventh trumpet in time 
 is subsequent, being the consummation of the historical episode, the 
 twelfth and thirteen chapters. The seventh trumpet, like the seventh 
 seal and seventh vial, being the consummation, is accompanied 
 differently from the preceding six: not the consequences which follow 
 on earth, but those <FONT SIZE=-1>IN HEAVEN</FONT>, are set before us, 
 the <I>great voices and thanksgiving of the twenty-four elders in 
 heaven, as the half-hour's silence in heaven</I> at the seventh seal, 
 and <I>the voice out of the temple in heaven,</I> "<I>It is done,</I>" 
 at the seventh vial. This is parallel to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:44">Da 2:44</A>,

 "The God <I>of heaven</I> shall set up a <I>kingdom,</I> which shall 
 never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, 
 but it shall break to pieces all these <I>kingdoms,</I> and it shall 
 stand for ever." It is the setting up of <I>Heaven's</I> sovereignty 
 over the earth visibly, which, when invisibly exercised, was rejected 
 by the earthly rulers heretofore. The distinction of worldly and 
 spiritual shall then cease. There will be no beast in opposition to the 
 woman. Poetry, art, science, and social life will be at once worldly 
 and Christian.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>kingdoms</B>--A, B, C, and <I>Vulgate</I> read the singular, "The
 <I>kingdom</I> (sovereignty) <I>of</I> (over) the world is our Lord's
 and His Christ's." There is no good authority for <I>English
 Version</I> reading. The <I>kingdoms</I> of the world give way to
 <I>the kingdom of</I> (over) <I>the world</I> exercised by Christ. The
 earth-kingdoms are many: His shall be <I>one.</I> The appellation
 "Christ," <I>the Anointed,</I> is here, where His <I>kingdom</I> is
 mentioned appropriately for the first time used in Revelation. For it
 is equivalent to K<FONT SIZE=-1>ING</FONT>. Though priests and prophets
 also were <I>anointed,</I> yet this term is peculiarly applied to Him
 as King, insomuch that "the Lord's anointed" is His title as 
 K<FONT SIZE=-1>ING</FONT>, in places where He is distinguished from the
 priests. The glorified Son of man shall rule mankind by His 
 transfigured Church in heaven, and by His people Israel on earth: 
 Israel shall be the priestly mediator of blessings to the whole world, 
 realizing them first.

 <B>19.</B> A similar solemn conclusion to that of the seventh seal,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+8:5">Re 8:5</A>,
 
 and to that of the seventh vial, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:18">Re 16:18</A>.

 Thus, it appears, the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven 
 vials, are not consecutive, but parallel, and ending in the same 
 consummation. They present the unfolding of God's plans for bringing 
 about the grand end under three different aspects, mutually 
 complementing each other.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the temple</B>--the sanctuary or <I>Holy place</I> (<I>Greek,</I> 
 "<I>naos</I>"), not the whole <I>temple</I> (<I>Greek,</I> 
 "<I>hieron</I>").

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>opened in heaven</B>--A and C read the article, "the temple of God 
 "which is" in heaven, was opened."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the ark of his testament</B>--or ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. His 
 <I>covenant.</I>" As in the first verse the earthly sanctuary was 
 <I>measured,</I> so here its heavenly antitype is laid open, and the 
 antitype above to the <I>ark of the covenant</I> in the Holiest Place 
 below is seen, the pledge of God's faithfulness to His covenant in 
 saving His people and punishing their and His enemies. Thus this forms 
 a fit close to the series of trumpet judgments and an introduction to 
 the episode (the twelfth and thirteen chapters) as to His faithfulness 
 to His Church. Here first His secret place, the heavenly sanctuary, is 
 opened for the assurance of His people; and thence proceed His 
 judgments in their behalf

 which the great company in heaven laud as "true and righteous." This
 then is parallel to the scene at the heavenly altar, at the close of 
 the seals and opening of the trumpets

 The beast in

 &c., is shown not to be alone, but to be the instrument in the hand of 
 a greater power of darkness, Satan. That this is so, appears from the 
 time of the eleventh chapter being the period also in which the events 
 of the twelfth and thirteenth chapters take place, namely, 1260 days

 <B>woman clothed with the sun .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. moon under her 
 feet</B>--the Church, Israel first, and then the Gentile Church; 
 clothed with Christ, "the Sun of righteousness." "Fair as the moon, 
 clear as the sun." Clothed with the Sun, the Church is the bearer of 
 divine supernatural light in the world. So the seven churches (that is, 
 the Church universal, the woman) are represented as light-bearing 
 <I>candlesticks</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:12,20">Re 1:12, 20</A>).

 On the other hand, the <I>moon,</I> though standing above the sea and 
 earth, is altogether connected with them and is an earthly light: 
 <I>sea, earth,</I> and <I>moon</I> represent the worldly element, in 
 opposition to the kingdom of God--heaven, the sun. The moon cannot 
 disperse the darkness and change it into-day: thus she represents the 
 world religion (heathenism) in relation to the supernatural world. The 
 Church has the moon, therefore, under her feet; but the stars, as 
 heavenly lights, on her head. The devil directs his efforts against the 
 stars, the angels of the churches, about hereafter to shine for ever.  
 The twelve stars, the crown around her head, are the twelve tribes of 
 Israel [A<FONT SIZE=-1>UBERLEN</FONT>]. The allusions to <I>Israel</I> 
 before accord with this: compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:19">Re 11:19</A>,

 "the temple of God"; "the ark of His testament." The ark lost at the
 Babylonian captivity, and never since found, is seen in the "temple of
 God opened in heaven," signifying that God now enters again into
 covenant with His ancient people. The woman cannot mean, literally, the
 virgin mother of Jesus, for she did not flee into the wilderness and
 stay there for 1260 days, while the dragon persecuted the remnant of her
 seed 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:13-17">Re 12:13-17</A>)

 [D<FONT SIZE=-1>E</FONT> B<FONT SIZE=-1>URGH</FONT>]. The <I>sun, 
 moon,</I> and <I>twelve stars,</I> are emblematical of Jacob, Leah, or 
 else Rachel, and the twelve patriarchs, that is, the Jewish Church: 
 secondarily, the Church universal, having <I>under her feet,</I> in due 
 subordination, the ever changing moon, which shines with a borrowed 
 light, emblem of <I>the Jewish dispensation,</I> which is now in a 
 position of inferiority, though supporting the woman, and also of the 
 changeful things of this world, and having on her head the crown of 
 twelve stars, the twelve apostles, who, however, are related closely to 
 Israel's twelve tribes.  The Church, in passing over into the Gentile 
 world, is (1) persecuted; (2) then seduced, as heathenism begins to 
 react on her. This is the key to the meaning of the symbolic woman, 
 beast, harlot, and false prophet.  <I>Woman</I> and <I>beast</I> form 
 the same contrast as <I>the Son of man</I> and the <I>beasts</I> in 
 Daniel. As the Son of man comes <I>from heaven,</I> so the woman is 
 seen <I>in heaven</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:1">Re 12:1</A>).

 The two beasts arise respectively <I>out of the sea</I> (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:3">Da 7:3</A>)

 and <I>the earth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:1,11">Re 13:1, 11</A>):

 their origin is not of heaven, but of earth earthy.  Daniel beholds the 
 heavenly Bridegroom coming visibly to reign. John sees the woman, the 
 Bride, whose calling is heavenly, in the world, before the Lord's 
 coming again. The characteristic of woman, in contradistinction to man, 
 is her being subject, the surrendering of herself, her being receptive. 
 This similarly is man's relation to God, to be subject to, and receive 
 from, God. All autonomy of the human spirit reverses man's relation to 
 God. Woman-like receptivity towards God constitutes <I>faith.</I> By it 
 the <I>individual</I> becomes a child of God; the children 
 <I>collectively</I> are viewed as "the woman." Humanity, in so far as

 "<I>huios arrheen,</I>" "male-child"). Though born of a woman, and 
 under the law for man's sake, He is also the Son of God, and so the 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>HUSBAND</FONT> of the Church. As Son of the woman, He is 
 "'Son of man"; as <I>male-child,</I> He is Son of God, and Husband of 
 the Church. All who imagine to have life in themselves are severed from 
 Him, the Source of life, and, standing in their own strength, sink to 
 the level of senseless <I>beasts.</I> Thus, the woman designates 
 universally the kingdom of God; the beast, the kingdom of the world.

 Israel (Christ and His apostles being Jews), on which the Gentile

 conversion, shall be grafted, as into <I>her own olive tree.</I> During 
 the whole Church-historic period, or "times of the Gentiles," wherein 
 "Jerusalem is trodden down of the Gentiles," there is no believing 
 Jewish Church, and therefore, only the Christian Church can be "the 
 woman." At the same time there is meant, secondarily, the preservation 
 of the Jews during this Church-historic period, in order that Israel, 
 who was once "the woman," and of whom the <I>man-child</I> was born, 
 may become so again at the close of the Gentile times, and stand at the 
 head of the two elections, literal Israel, and spiritual Israel, the 
 Church elected from Jews and Gentiles without distinction.

 conflict in heaven, though judicially decided already against Satan 
 from the time of Christ's resurrection and ascension, receives its 
 actual completion in the execution of judgment by the angels who cast 
 out Satan from heaven.  From Christ's ascension he has no 
 standing-ground judicially against the believing elect.

 so now the mediator of the new covenant, by offering His sinless body

 by a complete victory. That Satan is not yet <I>actually</I> and

 to that effect received its ratification at Christ's ascension, appears

 so it was not yet shut against Satan and his demons. The Old Testament

 millennium, he is judicially cast out of heaven as the accuser of the 
 elect, and shortly before the millennium loses his power against 
 Israel, and has sentence of expulsion fully executed on him and his by 
 Michael. His rage on earth is consequently the greater, his power being

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:30,31">Isa 40:30, 31</A>).

 <I>The great eagle</I> is the world power; in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:3,7">Eze 17:3, 7</A>,

 <B>wilderness</B>--the land of the heathen, the Gentiles: in contrast 
 to Canaan, the <I>pleasant</I> and <I>glorious land.</I> God dwells in 
 the glorious land; demons (the rulers of the heathen world,

 Heathendom, in its essential nature, being without God, is a desolate
 <I>wilderness.</I> Thus, the woman's flight into the wilderness is the 
 passing of the kingdom of God from the Jews to be among the Gentiles 
 (typified by Mary's flight with her child from Judea into Egypt). The 
 eagle flight is from Egypt into the wilderness. The <I>Egypt</I> meant 
 is virtually stated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:8">Re 11:8</A>)

 to be Jerusalem, which has become spiritually so by <I>crucifying our 
 Lord.</I> Out of her the New Testament Church flees, as the Old 
 Testament Church out of the literal Egypt; and as the true Church 
 subsequently is called to flee out of Babylon (the woman become an 
 harlot, that is, the Church become apostate) [A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>UBERLEN</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>her place</B>--the chief seat of the then world empire, Rome. The 
 Acts of the Apostles describe the passing of the Church from Jerusalem 
 to Rome. The Roman protection was the eagle wing which often shielded 
 Paul, the great instrument of this transmigration, and Christianity, 
 from Jewish opponents who stirred up the heathen mobs. By degrees the 
 Church had "her place" more and more secure, until, under Constantine, 
 the empire became Christian. Still, all this Church-historical period 
 is regarded as a wilderness time, wherein the Church is in part 
 protected, in part oppressed, by the world power, until just before the 
 end the enmity of the world power under Satan shall break out against 
 the Church worse than ever. As Israel was in the wilderness forty 
 years, and had forty-two stages in her journey, so the Church for 
 <I>forty-two</I> months, three and a half years or <I>times</I> 
 [literally, <I>seasons,</I> used for <I>years</I> in Hellenistic 
 <I>Greek</I> (M<FONT SIZE=-1>OERIS</FONT>, the Atticist), <I>Greek,</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:6">Re 12:6</A>)

 between the overthrow of Jerusalem and the coming again of Christ, 
 shall be a wilderness sojourner before she reaches her millennial rest 
 (answering to Canaan of old). It is possible that, besides this 
 Church-historical fulfilment, there may be also an ulterior and 
 narrower fulfilment in the restoration of Israel to Palestine, 
 Antichrist for seven times (short periods analogical to the longer 
 ones) having power there, for the former three and a half times keeping 
 covenant with the Jews, then breaking it in the midst of the week, and 
 the mass of the nation fleeing by a second Exodus into the wilderness, 
 while a <I>remnant</I> remains in the land exposed to a fearful 
 persecution (the "144,000 sealed of Israel,"

 these interpretations require, but on the two (east and west) together, 
 so that any theory which makes the ten kingdoms belong to the west 
 alone must err. If the ten kingdoms meant were those which sprung up on 
 the overthrow of Rome, the ten would be accurately known, whereas

 Thus it represents comprehensively in one figure <I>the world power</I> 
 (which in Daniel is represented by four) <I>of all times and 
 places,</I> not merely of one period and one locality, viewed as 
 opposed to God; just as the <I>woman</I> is the Church of all ages. 
 This view is favored also by the fact, that the beast is the vicarious 
 representative of Satan, who similarly has <I>seven heads</I> and 
 <I>ten horns:</I> a general description of his universal power in all 
 ages and places of the world. Satan appears as a serpent, as being the 
 archetype of the beast nature

 Here, on the contrary, the <I>beast's</I> head is not changed into a 
 <I>human</I> head, but receives a deadly wound, that is, the world 
 kingdom which this head represents does not truly turn to God, but for 
 a time its God-opposed character remains paralyzed ("as it were slain";

 it were slain," see on

 the beast still, to rise again in another form

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:11">Re 13:11</A>).

 The first six heads were heathenish, Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, 
 Greece, Rome; the new seventh world power (the pagan German hordes 
 pouring down on Christianized Rome), whereby Satan had hoped to stifle 
 Christianity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:15,16">Re 11:15, 16</A>),

 No essential change is noticed in Daniel as effected by Christianity 
 upon the fourth kingdom; it remains essentially God-opposed to the 
 last. The beast, <I>healed</I> of its temporary and external 
 <I>wound,</I> now returns, not only from the sea, but from the 
 <I>bottomless pit,</I> whence it draws new Antichristian strength of 
 hell

 A new and worse heathenism breaks in upon the Christianized world, more 
 devilish than the old one of the first heads of the beast. The latter 
 was an apostasy only from the general revelation of God in nature and 
 conscience; but this new one is from God's revelation of love in His 
 Son. It culminates in Antichrist, the man of sin, the son of perdition 
 (compare

 <B>out of the earth</B>--out of society civilized, consolidated, and 
 ordered, but still, with all its culture, of earth earthy: as 
 distinguished from "the sea," the troubled agitations of various 
 peoples out of which the world power and its several kingdoms have 
 emerged.  "<I>The sacerdotal persecuting power, pagan and 
 Christian;</I> the pagan priesthood making an image of the emperors 
 which they compelled Christians to worship, and working wonders by 
 magic and omens; the Romish priesthood, the inheritors of pagan rites, 
 images, and superstitions, lamb-like in Christian professions, 
 dragon-like in word and act" [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>, and so the 
 Spanish Jesuit, L<FONT SIZE=-1>ACUNZA</FONT>, writing under the name 
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>EN</FONT> E<FONT SIZE=-1>ZRA</FONT>]. As the first beast 
 was like the Lamb in being, <I>as it were, wounded to death,</I> so the 
 second is like the Lamb in having <I>two lamb-like horns</I> (its 
 essential difference from the Lamb is marked by its having 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>TWO</FONT>, but the Lamb <FONT SIZE=-1>SEVEN</FONT>
 horns,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:6">Re 5:6</A>).

 The former paganism of the world power, seeming to be wounded to death
 by Christianity, revives. In its second beast-form it is Christianized 
 heathendom ministering to the former, and having earthly culture and 
 learning to recommend it. The second beast's, or false prophet's rise, 
 coincides in time with the healing of the beast's deadly wound and its 
 revival

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:12-14">Re 13:12-14</A>).

 "<I>Many</I> false prophets shall rise," where He is speaking of the 
 last days. As the former beast corresponds to the first four beasts of 
 Daniel, so the second beast, or the false prophet, to the little horn 
 starting up among the ten horns of the fourth beast.  This 
 Antichristian horn has not only the mouth of blasphemy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:5">Re 13:5</A>),
 
 but also "the eyes of man"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:8">Da 7:8</A>):

 the former is also in the first beast

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:1,5">Re 13:1, 5</A>),

 but the latter not so. "The eyes of man" symbolize cunning and 
 intellectual culture, the very characteristic of "the false prophet"

 Re 16:14</A>). 

 The first beast is physical and political; the second a spiritual
 power, the power of knowledge, ideas (the favorite term in the French 
 school of politics), and scientific cultivation. Both alike are 
 <I>beasts,</I> from below, not from above; faithful allies, worldly 
 Antichristian wisdom standing in the service of the worldly 
 Antichristian power: the dragon is both lion and serpent: might and 
 cunning are his armory. The dragon gives his external power to the 
 first beast

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:2">Re 13:2</A>),

 his spirit to the second, so that it <I>speaks as a dragon</I>

 the last apostasy. P<FONT SIZE=-1>LINY</FONT>, in his letter to Trajan,
 states that he consigned to punishment those Christians who would not
 worship the emperor's image with incense and wine. So 
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>ULIAN</FONT>, the apostate, set up his own image with
 the idols of the heathen gods in the Forum, that the Christians in 
 doing reverence to it, might seem to worship the idols. So 
 Charlemagne's image was set up for homage; and the Pope <I>adored</I> 
 the new emperor [D<FONT SIZE=-1>UPIN</FONT>, vol. 6, p. 126]. Napoleon, 
 the successor of Charlemagne, designed after he had first lowered the 
 Pope by removing him to Fontainebleau, then to "make an idol of him" 
 [<I>Memorial de Sainte Helene</I>]; keeping the Pope near him, he 
 would, through the Pope's influence, have directed the religious, as 
 well as the political world. The revived Napoleonic dynasty may, in 
 some one representative, realize the project, becoming the beast 
 supported by the false prophet (perhaps some openly infidel supplanter 
 of the papacy, under a spiritual guise, after the harlot, or apostate 
 Church, who is distinct from the second beast, has been stripped and 
 judged by the beast,

 maintains "666." I<FONT SIZE=-1>REN&AElig;US</FONT>, in the second 
 century, disciple of P<FONT SIZE=-1>OLYCARP</FONT>, John's disciple, 
 explained this number as contained in the <I>Greek</I> letters of 
 <I>Lateinos</I> (L being thirty; A, one; T, three hundred; E, five; I, 
 ten; N, fifty; O, seventy; S, two hundred). The <I>Latin</I> is 
 peculiarly the language of the Church of Rome in all her official acts; 
 the forced unity of language in ritual being the counterfeit of the 
 true unity; the premature and spurious anticipation of the real unity, 
 only to be realized at Christ's coming, when all the earth shall speak 
 "one language"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:9">Zep 3:9</A>).

 The last Antichrist may have a close connection with Rome, and so the 
 name <I>Lateinos</I> (666) may apply to him. The <I>Hebrew</I> letters 
 of <I>Balaam</I> amount to 666 [B<FONT SIZE=-1>UNSEN</FONT>]; a type of 
 the <I>false prophet,</I> whose characteristic, like Balaam's, will be 
 high spiritual knowledge perverted to Satanic ends. The number 
 <I>six</I> is the world number; in 666 it occurs in units, tens, and 
 hundreds. It is next neighbor to the sacred <I>seven,</I> but is 
 severed from it by an impassable gulf. It is <I>the number of the world 
 given over to judgment;</I> hence there is a pause between the sixth 
 and seventh seals, and the sixth and seventh trumpets. The judgments on 
 the world are complete in <I>six;</I> by the fulfilment of 
 <I>seven,</I> the kingdoms of the world become Christ's. As 
 <I>twelve</I> is the number of the Church, so six, its half, symbolizes 
 the world kingdom broken. The raising of the six to tens and hundreds 
 (higher powers) indicates that the beast, notwithstanding his 
 progression to higher powers, can only rise to greater ripeness for 
 judgment. Thus 666, the judged world power, contrasts with the 144,000 
 sealed and transfigured ones (the Church number, twelve, squared and 
 multiplied by one thousand, the number symbolizing the world pervaded 
 by God; ten, the world number, raised to the power of three the number 
 of God) [A<FONT SIZE=-1>UBERLEN</FONT>]. The "mark" (<I>Greek,</I> 
 "<I>charagma</I>") and "name" are one and the same. The first two 
 radical letters of <I>Christ</I> (<I>Greek,</I> "<I>Christos</I>"), 
 <I>Ch</I> and <I>R,</I> are the same as the first two of 
 <I>charagma,</I> and were the imperial monogram of Christian Rome.  
 Antichrist, personating Christ, adopts a symbol like, but not agreeing 
 with, Christ's monogram, <I>Ch, X, St;</I> whereas the radicals in 
 "Christ" are <I>Ch, R, St.</I> Papal Rome has similarly substituted the 
 standard of <I>the Keys</I> for the standard of <I>the Cross;</I> so on 
 the papal <I>coinage</I> (the image of power,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:20">Mt 22:20</A>).

 The two first letters of "Christ," <I>Ch, R,</I> represent <I>seven</I> 
 hundred, the perfect number.  The <I>Ch, X, St</I> represent an 
 imperfect number, a triple <I>falling away</I> (apostasy) from 
 <I>septenary</I> perfection [W<FONT SIZE=-1>ORDSWORTH</FONT>].</P>

 <I>at,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:20">Re 3:20</A>.

 It has a pregnant sense: "standing" implies <I>rest, Greek</I> 
 "<I>epi</I>" with the accusative case implies motion "towards." Thus 
 the meaning is, Having come <FONT SIZE=-1>TO</FONT> the sea, and now 
 <I>standing</I> <FONT SIZE=-1>AT</FONT> it. In

 where Christ walks <I>on</I> the sea, the <I>Greek</I> oldest 
 manuscripts have the genitive, not the accusative as here. Allusion is 
 made to the Israelites standing <I>on the shore at the Red Sea,</I> 
 after having passed victoriously through it, and after the Lord had 
 destroyed the Egyptian foe (type of Antichrist) in it. Moses and the 
 Israelites' song of triumph

 Still <I>English Version</I> is consistent with good <I>Greek,</I> and 
 the sense will then be: As the sea typifies the troubled state out of

 The Churches of the Old and New Testament are essentially one in their 
 conflicts and triumphs. The two appear joined in this phrase, as they 
 are in the twenty-four elders. Similarly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+12:1-6">Isa 12:1-6</A>

 foretells the song of the redeemed (Israel foremost) after the second 
 antitypical exodus and deliverance <I>at the Egyptian Sea.</I> The 
 passage through the Red Sea under the pillar of cloud was Israel's 
 baptism, to which the believer's baptism in trials corresponds. The 
 elect after their trials (especially those arising from the beast) 
 shall be taken up before the vials of wrath be poured on the beast and 
 his kingdom. So Noah and his family were taken out of the doomed world 
 before the deluge; Lot was taken out of Sodom before its destruction; 
 the Christians escaped by a special interposition of Providence to 
 Pella before the destruction of Jerusalem. As the pillar of 
 <I>cloud</I> and <I>fire</I> interposed between Israel and the Egyptian 
 foe, so that Israel was safely landed on the opposite shore before the 
 Egyptians were destroyed; so the Lord, coming with <I>clouds</I> and in 
 flaming <I>fire,</I> shall first catch up His elect people "in the 
 clouds to meet Him in the air," and then shall with fire destroy the 
 enemy. The Lamb leads the song in honor of the Father amidst the great 
 congregation. This is the "new song" mentioned in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:3">Re 14:3</A>.

 The trumpets shook the world kingdoms in a longer process; the vials
 destroy with a swift and sudden overthrow the kingdom of "the beast" in
 particular who had invested himself with the world kingdom. The Hebrews
 thought the Egyptian plagues to have been inflicted with but an
 interval of a month between them severally 
 [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>, referring to S<FONT SIZE=-1>EDER</FONT>
 O<FONT SIZE=-1>LAM</FONT>]. As Moses took ashes from an earthly common 
 furnace, so angels, as priestly ministers in the heavenly temple, take 
 holy fire in sacred vials or bowls, from the heavenly altar to pour 
 down (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+8:5">Re 8:5</A>).

 The same heavenly altar which would have kindled the sweet incense of 
 prayer bringing down blessing upon earth, by man's sin kindles the 
 fiery descending curse. Just as the river Nile, which ordinarily is the 
 source of Egypt's fertility, became blood and a curse through Egypt's 
 sin.</P>

 being called "the last," must belong to the period just when the term 
 of the beast's power has expired (whence reference is made in them all 
 to the worshippers of the beast as the objects of the judgments), close 
 to the end or coming of the Son of man. The first four are 
 distinguished from the last three, just as in the case of the seven 
 seals and the seven trumpets. The first four are more general, 
 affecting the earth, the sea, springs, and the sun, not merely a 
 portion of these natural bodies, as in the case of the trumpets, but 
 the whole of them; the last three are more particular, affecting the 
 throne of the beast, the Euphrates, and the grand consummation. Some of 
 these particular judgments are set forth in detail in the seventeenth

 <B>kings of the east</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "the kings who are from the

 in the sixth trumpet. The drying up of the <I>Euphrates,</I> I think, 
 is to be taken figuratively, as <I>Babylon</I> itself, which is 
 situated on it, is undoubtedly so,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:5">Re 17:5</A>.
 
 The waters of the Euphrates (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:7,8">Isa 8:7, 8</A>)

 are spiritual Babylon's, that is, the apostate Church's (of which Rome 
 is the chief, though not exclusive representative) spiritual and 
 temporal powers. The drying up of the waters of Babylon expresses the 
 same thing as the ten kings stripping, eating, and burning the whore. 
 The phrase, "way may be prepared for," is that applied to <I>the Lord's 
 coming</I>

 As the Antichristian ten <I>kings</I> accompany the beast, so the

 and others take it of <I>the Jews,</I> who also were designed to be 
 <I>a kingdom of priests to God</I> on earth. They shall, doubtless, 
 become priest-kings in the flesh to the nations in the flesh at His 
 coming.  Abraham from the East (if

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:2,8,9">Isa 41:2, 8, 9</A>,

 refers to him, and not Cyrus) conquering the Chaldean kings is a type 
 of Israel's victorious restoration to the priest-kingdom. Israel's 
 exodus after the last Egyptian plagues typifies Israel's restoration 
 after the spiritual Babylon, the apostate Church, has been smitten. 
 Israel's promotion to the priest-kingdom after Pharaoh's downfall, and 
 at the Lord's descent at Sinai to establish the theocracy, typifies the 
 restored kingdom of Israel at the Lord's more glorious descent, when 
 Antichrist shall be destroyed utterly. Thus, besides the transfigured 
 saints, Israel secondarily may be meant by "the kings from the East" 
 who shall accompany the "King of kings" returning "from the way of the 
 East" to reign over His ancient people. As to the <I>drying up</I> 
 again of the <I>waters</I> opposing His people's assuming the kingdom, 
 compare

 D<FONT SIZE=-1>URHAM</FONT>, several centuries ago, interpreted the
 drying up of the Euphrates to mean the wasting away of the Turkish 
 power, which has heretofore held Palestine, and so the way being 
 prepared for Israel's restoration. But as <I>Babylon</I> refers to the 
 apostate Church, not to Mohammedanism, the drying up of the Euphrates 
 (answering to Cyrus' overthrow of literal Babylon by marching into it 
 through the dry channel of the Euphrates) must answer to the draining 
 off of the apostate Church's resources, the Roman and Greek corrupt 
 Church having been heretofore one of the greatest barriers by its 
 idolatries and persecutions in the way of Israel's restoration and 
 conversion. The <I>kings of the earth</I> who are earthly

 <B>13. unclean spirits like frogs</B>--the antitype to the plague of 
 frogs sent on Egypt. The presence of the "unclean spirit" in the land 
 (Palestine) is foretold,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:2">Zec 13:2</A>,

 in connection with idolatrous <I>prophets.</I> Beginning with 
 infidelity as to Jesus Christ's coming in the flesh, men shall end in 
 the grossest idolatry of the beast, the incarnation of all that is 
 self-deifying and God-opposed in the world powers of all ages; having 
 rejected Him that came in the Father's name, they shall worship one 
 that comes in his own, though really the devil's representative; as 
 frogs croak by night in marshes and quagmires, so these unclean spirits 
 in the darkness of error teach lies amidst the mire of filthy lusts. 
 They talk of <I>liberty,</I> but it is not Gospel liberty, but license 
 for lust. There being <I>three,</I> as also <I>seven,</I> in the 
 description of the last and worst state of the Jewish nation, implies a 
 parody of the two divine numbers, <I>three</I> of the Trinity, and 
 <I>seven</I> of the Holy Spirit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:4">Re 1:4</A>).

 Some observe that <I>three frogs</I> were the original arms of France, 
 a country which has been the center of infidelity, socialism, and false 
 spiritualism. A and B read, "<I>as it were</I> frogs," instead of 
 "<I>like</I> frogs," which is not supported by manuscripts. The unclean 
 spirit out of the mouth of <I>the dragon</I> symbolizes the proud 
 infidelity which opposes God and Christ. That out of the <I>beast's</I> 
 mouth is the spirit of the world, which in the politics of men, whether 
 lawless democracy or despotism, sets man above God. That out of the 
 mouth of the <I>false prophet</I> is lying spiritualism and religious 
 delusion, which shall take the place of the harlot when she shall have 
 been destroyed.

 also the dragon a little later

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:10">Re 20:10</A>).

 The dragon, the beast, and the false prophet, "the mystery of 
 iniquity," form a blasphemous Antitrinity, the counterfeit of "the 
 mystery of godliness" God manifests in Christ, witnessed to by the 
 Spirit. The dragon acts the part of God the Father, assigning his 
 authority to his representative the beast, as the Father assigns His to 
 the Son. They are accordingly jointly worshipped; compare as to the 
 Father and Son,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:23">Joh 5:23</A>;

 as the ten-horned beast has its ten horns crowned with <I>diadems</I>

 so Christ has on His head <I>many diadems.</I> While the false prophet, 
 like the Holy Ghost, speaks not of himself, but tells all men to 
 worship the beast, and confirms his testimony to the beast by

 divine mission.</P>

 (the sun-rising),

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:12">Re 16:12</A>,

 namely, the saints to whom Christ <I>has appointed a kingdom,</I> and 
 who are "children of light." God, in permitting Satan's 
 <I>miracles,</I> as in the case of the Egyptian magicians who were His 
 instruments in hardening Pharaoh's heart, gives the reprobate up to 
 judicial delusion preparatory to their destruction. As Aaron's rod was 
 changed into a serpent, so were those of the Egyptian magicians. Aaron 
 turned the water into blood; so did the magicians. Aaron brought up 
 frogs; so did the magicians. With the <I>frogs</I> their power ceased.

 Rome, resting on the world power and ruling it by the claim of 
 supremacy, is the chief, though not the exclusive, representative of 
 this symbol. As the dragon is fiery-<I>red,</I> so the beast is 
 blood-red in color; implying its <I>blood-guiltiness,</I> and also 
 deep-dyed sin. The <I>scarlet</I> is also the symbol of kingly

 for its opposition to God is now about to develop itself in all its 
 intensity. Under the harlot's superintendence, the world power puts 
 forth blasphemous pretensions worse than in pagan days. So the Pope is 
 placed by the cardinals <I>in God's temple on the altar to sit 
 there,</I> and the cardinals <I>kiss the feet</I> of the Pope. This 
 ceremony is called in Romish writers "the adoration." [<I>Historie de

 <I>blasphemous</I> legend, "<I>Quem creant, adorant.</I>" 
 <I>Kneeling</I> and <I>kissing</I> are the worship meant by John's word 
 nine times used in respect to the rival of God (<I>Greek,</I> 
 "<I>proskunein</I>"). <I>Abomination,</I> too, is the scriptural term 
 for an idol, or any creature worshipped with the homage due to the 
 Creator. Still, there is some check on the God-opposed world power 
 while ridden by the harlot; the consummated Antichrist will be when, 
 having destroyed her, the beast shall be revealed as the concentration 
 and incarnation of all the self-deifying God-opposed principles which 
 have appeared in various forms and degrees heretofore.  "The Church has 
 gained outward recognition by leaning on the world power which in its 
 turn uses the Church for its own objects; such is the picture here of 
 Christendom ripe for judgment" [A<FONT SIZE=-1>UBERLEN</FONT>]. The 
 seven heads in the view of many are the seven successive forms of 
 government of Rome: kings, consuls, dictators, decemvirs, military 
 tribunes, emperors, the German emperors 
 [W<FONT SIZE=-1>ORDSWORTH</FONT>], of whom Napoleon is the successor

 <B>4.</B> The color scarlet, it is remarkable, is that reserved for
 popes and cardinals. Paul II made it penal for anyone but cardinals to
 wear hats of scarlet; compare <I>Roman Ceremonial</I> [3.5.5]. This
 book was compiled several centuries ago by 
 M<FONT SIZE=-1>ARCELLUS</FONT>, a Romish archbishop, and dedicated to
 Leo X.  In it are enumerated five different articles of dress of 
 <I>scarlet</I> color. A vest is mentioned studded with <I>pearls.</I> 
 The Pope's miter is of <I>gold</I> and <I>precious stones.</I> These 
 are the very characteristics outwardly which Revelation thrice assigns 
 to the harlot or Babylon. So Joachim an abbot from Calabria, about 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 1200, when asked by Richard of England, who 
 had summoned him to Palestine, concerning Antichrist, replied that "he 
 was born long ago at Rome, and is now exalting himself above all that 
 is called God." R<FONT SIZE=-1>OGER</FONT> H<FONT SIZE=-1>OVEDEN</FONT> 
 [<I>Annals,</I> 1.2], and elsewhere, wrote, "The harlot arrayed in gold 
 is the Church of Rome." Whenever and wherever (not in Rome alone) the 
 Church, instead of being "clothed (as at first,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:1">Re 12:1</A>)

 with the sun" of heaven, is arrayed in earthly meretricious gauds, 
 compromising the truth of God through fear, or flattery, of the world's 
 power, science, or wealth, she becomes the harlot seated on the beast, 
 and doomed in righteous retribution to be judged by the beast

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:16">Re 17:16</A>).

 Soon, like Rome, and like the Jews of Christ's and the apostles' time 
 leagued with the heathen Rome, she will then become the persecutor of 
 the saints

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:6">Re 17:6</A>).

 Instead of drinking her Lord's "cup" of suffering, she has "a cup full 
 of abominations and filthinesses." Rome, in her medals, represents 
 herself holding a cup with the self-condemning inscription, "<I>Sedet 
 super universum.</I>" Meanwhile the world power gives up its hostility 
 and accepts Christianity externally; the beast gives up its God-opposed 
 character, the woman gives up her divine one. They meet halfway by 
 mutual concessions; Christianity becomes worldly, the world becomes 
 Christianized. The gainer is the world; the loser is the Church. The 
 beast for a time receives a <I>deadly wound</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:3">Re 13:3</A>),

 but is not really transfigured; he will return worse than ever

 The Lord alone by His coming can make the kingdoms of this world become

 <B>mystery</B>--implying a spiritual fact heretofore hidden, and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:31,32">Eph 5:31, 32</A>),

 so the Church conforming to the world and thereby becoming a harlot is 
 a counter "mystery" (or spiritual truth, symbolically now revealed). As 
 iniquity in the harlot is a leaven working in "<I>mystery,</I>" and 
 therefore called "the <I>mystery</I> of iniquity," so when she is 
 destroyed, the iniquity heretofore working (comparatively) latently in 
 her, shall be <I>revealed</I> in <I>the man of iniquity,</I> the open 
 embodiment of all previous evil. Contrast the "mystery of God" and 
 "godliness,"

 It was Rome that crucified Christ; that destroyed Jerusalem and
 scattered the Jews; that persecuted the early Christians in pagan 
 times, and Protestant Christians in papal times; and probably shall be 
 again restored to its pristine grandeur, such as it had under the 
 C&aelig;sars, just before the burning of the harlot and of itself with 
 her. So H<FONT SIZE=-1>IPPOLYTUS</FONT> [<I>On Antichrist</I>] (who 
 lived in the second century), thought. Popery cannot be at one and the 
 same time the "<I>mystery</I> of iniquity," and the <I>manifested</I> 
 or <I>revealed</I> Antichrist. Probably it will compromise for 
 political power

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:3">Re 17:3</A>)

 the portion of Christianity still in its creed, and thus shall prepare 
 the way for Antichrist's manifestation. The name Babylon, which in the 
 image,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:32,38">Da 2:32, 38</A>,

 is given to the <I>head,</I> is here given to the harlot, which marks 
 her as being connected with the fourth kingdom, Rome, the last part of 
 the image. Benedict XIII, in his indiction for a jubilee, <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 1725, called Rome "the <I>mother</I> of all 
 believers, and the mistress of all churches" (harlots like herself). 
 The correspondence of syllables and accents in <I>Greek</I> is 
 striking; "<I>He porne kai to therion; He numphe kai to arnion</I>." 
 "The whore and the beast; the Bride and the Lamb."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>of harlots</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "of <I>the</I> harlots and of 
 <I>the</I> abominations." Not merely Rome, but Christendom as a whole, 
 even as formerly Israel as a whole, has become a harlot. The invisible 
 Church of true believers is hidden and dispersed in the visible Church. 
 The boundary lines which separate harlot and woman are not 
 denominational nor drawn externally, but can only be spiritually 
 discerned. If Rome were the <I>only</I> seat of Babylon, much of the 
 spiritual profit of Revelation would be lost to us; but the harlot 
 "sitteth upon many waters"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:1">Re 17:1</A>),

 and "<FONT SIZE=-1>ALL</FONT> nations have drunk of the wine of her

 "the earth,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:2">Re 19:2</A>).

 External extensiveness over the whole world and internal conformity to 
 the world--worldliness in extent and contents--is symbolized by the 
 name of the world city, "Babylon." As the sun shines on all the earth, 
 thus the woman clothed with the sun is to let her light penetrate to 
 the uttermost parts of the earth. But she, in externally Christianizing 
 the world, permits herself to be seduced by the world; thus her 
 universality or catholicity is not that of the <I>Jerusalem</I> which 
 we look for ("the <FONT SIZE=-1>MOTHER</FONT> of us all,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:2,Isa+2:2-4,Ga+4:26">Re 21:2;
 Isa 2:2-4; 
 Ga 4:26</A>), 

 but that of <I>Babylon,</I> the world-wide but harlot city! (As Babylon
 was destroyed, and the Jews restored to Jerusalem by Cyrus, so our
 Cyrus--a Persian name meaning the <I>sun</I>--the Sun of righteousness,
 shall bring Israel, literal and spiritual, to the holy Jerusalem at His
 coming. Babylon and Jerusalem are the two opposite poles of the
 spiritual world). Still, the Romish Church is not only accidentally and
 as a matter of fact, but in virtue of its very 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>PRINCIPLE</FONT>, a harlot, the metropolis of whoredom,
 "the mother of harlots"; whereas the evangelical Protestant Church is, 
 according to her principle and fundamental creed, a chaste woman; the 
 Reformation was a protest of the woman against the harlot. The spirit 
 of the heathen world kingdom Rome had, before the Reformation, changed 
 the Church in the West into a <I>Church-State,</I> Rome; and in the 
 East, into a <I>State-Church,</I> fettered by the world power, having 
 its center in Byzantium; the Roman and Greek churches have thus fallen 
 from the invisible spiritual essence of the Gospel into the elements of 
 the world [A<FONT SIZE=-1>UBERLEN</FONT>]. Compare with the "woman" 
 called "Babylon" here, the woman named "wickedness," or "lawlessness," 
 "iniquity"

 Church become a world-loving apostate, moves his sorrowful astonishment 
 at so awful a change. That the world should be beastly is natural, but 
 that the faithful bride should become the whore is monstrous, and 
 excites the same amazement in him as the same awful change in Israel 
 excited in Isaiah and Jeremiah. "Horrible thing" in them answers to 
 "abominations" here. "<I>Corruptio optimi pessima</I>"; when the Church 
 falls, she sinks lower than the godless world, in proportion as her 
 right place is higher than the world. It is striking that in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:3">Re 17:3</A>,

 "woman" has not the article, "<I>the</I> woman," as if she had been

 Antichrist is in existence long before the fall of Babylon; but it is
 only at its fail he obtains the vassalage of the ten kings. He in the 
 first instance imposes on the Jews as the Messiah, coming in his own 
 name; then persecutes those of them who refuse his blasphemous 
 pretensions. Not until the sixth vial, in the latter part of his reign, 
 does he associate the ten kings with him in war with the Lamb, having 
 gained them over by the aid of the spirits of devils working miracles.  
 His connection with Israel appears from his sitting "in the temple of 
 God"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:4">2Th 2:4</A>),

 As Jerusalem used the world power to crucify her Saviour, and then was 
 destroyed by that very power, Rome; so the Church, having apostatized 
 to the world, shall have judgment executed on her first by the world 
 power, the beast and his allies; and these afterwards shall have 
 judgment executed on them by Christ Himself in person. So Israel 
 leaning on Egypt, a broken reed, is pierced by it; and then Egypt 
 itself is punished. So Israel's whoredom with Assyria and Babylon was 
 punished by the Assyrian and Babylonian captivities. So the Church when 
 it goes a-whoring after the word as if <I>it</I> were the reality, 
 instead of witnessing against its apostasy from God, is false to its 
 profession. Being no longer a reality itself, but a sham, the Church is 
 rightly judged by that world which for a time had used the Church to 
 further its own ends, while all the while "hating" Christ's unworldly 
 religion, but which now no longer wants the Church's aid.

 Even in the Romish Church God has a people: but they are in great
 danger; their only safety is in coming out of her at once. So also in 
 every apostate or world-conforming church there are some of God's 
 invisible and true Church, who, if they would be safe, must come out.  
 Especially at the eve of God's judgment on apostate Christendom: as Lot 
 was warned to come out of Sodom just before its destruction, and Israel 
 to come from about the tents of Dathan and Abiram. So the first 
 Christians came out of Jerusalem when the apostate Jewish Church was 
 judged. "State and Church are precious gifts of God. But the State 
 being desecrated to a different end from what God designed it, namely.  
 to govern for, and as under, God, becomes beast-like; the Church 
 apostatizing becomes the harlot. The true woman is the kernel: beast 
 and harlot are the shell: whenever the kernel is mature, the shell is 
 thrown away" [A<FONT SIZE=-1>UBERLEN</FONT>]. "The harlot is not Rome 
 alone (though she is pre-eminently so), but every Church that has not 
 Christ's mind and spirit. False Christendom, divided into very many 
 sects, is truly Babylon, that is, confusion. However, in all 
 Christendom the true Jesus-congregation, the woman clothed with the 
 sun, lives and is hidden.  Corrupt, lifeless Christendom is the harlot, 
 whose great aim is the pleasure of the flesh, and which is governed by 
 the spirit of nature and the world" [H<FONT SIZE=-1>AHN</FONT> in 
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>UBERLEN</FONT>]. The first justification of the woman is 
 in her being called out of Babylon the harlot, as the culminating stage 
 of the latter's sin, when judgment is about to fall: for apostate 
 Christendom, Babylon, is not to be converted, but to be destroyed.  
 Secondly, she has to pass through an ordeal of persecution from the 
 beast, which purifies and prepares her for the transfiguration glory at 
 Christ's coming

 <B>avenged you on her</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "judged your judgment on 
 (literally, exacting it <I>from</I>) her." "There is more joy in heaven 
 at the harlot's downfall than at that of the two beasts. For the most 
 heinous of all sin is the sin of those who know God's word of grace, 
 and keep it not. The worldliness of the Church is the most worldly of 
 all worldliness. Hence, Babylon, in Revelation, has not only Israel's 
 sins, but also the sins of the heathen; and John dwells longer on the 
 abominations and judgments of the harlot than on those of the beast. 
 The term 'harlot' describes the false Church's essential character. She 
 retains her human shape as the <I>woman,</I> does not become a 
 <I>beast:</I> she has the form of godliness, but denies its power. Her 
 rightful lord and husband, Jehovah-Christ, and the joys and goods of 
 His house, are no longer her all in all, but she runs after the visible 
 and vain things of the world, in its manifold forms. The fullest form 
 of her whoredom is, where the Church wishes to be itself a worldly 
 power, uses politics and diplomacy, makes flesh her arm, uses unholy 
 means for holy ends, spreads her dominion by sword or money, fascinates 
 men by sensual ritualism, becomes 'mistress of ceremonies' to the 
 dignitaries of the world, flatters prince or people, and like Israel, 
 seeks the help of one world power against the danger threatening from 
 another" [A<FONT SIZE=-1>UBERLEN</FONT>]. <I>Judgment,</I> therefore, 
 <I>begins with</I> the harlot, as in privileges <I>the house of

 <FONT SIZE=-1>PRESENT</FONT> help; so that "Hallelujah," says 
 K<FONT SIZE=-1>IMCHI</FONT> in B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>, is found
 first in the Psalms <I>on the destruction of the ungodly.</I> 
 "Hallelu-Jah" occurs four times in this passage. Compare

 now clears the way for His advent to reign; therefore, not merely Rome, 
 but the whole of Christendom in so far as it is carnal and compromised 
 Christ for the world, is comprehended in the term "harlot." The beast

 &c. Previously there must be the overthrow of the beast, &c., at the 
 Lord's coming, the binding of Satan, the millennial reign, the loosing 
 of Satan and his last overthrow, and the general judgment. The 
 elect-Church, the heavenly Bride, soon after the destruction of the 
 harlot, is transfigured at the Lord's coming, and joins with Him in His 
 triumph over the beast. On the emblem of the heavenly Bridegroom and 
 Bride, compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:2,25:6,10,2Co+11:2">Mt 22:2; 25:6, 10;
 2Co 11:2</A>.

 Perfect union with Him personally, and participation in His holiness;
 joy, glory, and kingdom, are included in this symbol of "marriage"; 
 compare Song of Solomon everywhere. Besides the <I>heavenly</I> Bride, 
 the transfigured, translated, and risen Church, reigning <I>over</I> 
 the earth with Christ, there is also the <I>earthly</I> bride, Israel, 
 in the flesh, never yet <I>divorced,</I> though for a time separated, 
 from her divine husband, who shall then be reunited to the Lord, and be 
 the mother Church of the millennial earth, Christianized through her. 
 Note, we ought, as Scripture does, restrict the language drawn from 
 marriage-love to <I>the Bride,</I> the Church <I>as a whole;</I> not 
 use it as individuals in our relation to Christ, which Rome does in the 
 case of her nuns. Individually, believers are effectually-<I>called 
 guests;</I> collectively, they constitute <I>the bride.</I> The harlot 
 divides her affections among many lovers: the bride gives hers

 who, by <I>giving Himself for</I> her, <I>presents her to Himself a 
 glorious Church, not having spot, but holy and without blemish.</I> It 
 is He also who sanctifies her, naturally vile and without beauty, 
 <I>with the washing of water by the word, and puts His own comeliness

 He is <I>accounted as</I> "the Lord our righteousness" to each saint on
 his believing, their robes being made <I>white in the blood of the
 Lamb.</I> The righteousness of the saint is not, as 
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> erroneously states, <I>inherent,</I> but is
 <I>imputed:</I> if it were otherwise, Christ would be merely enabling 
 the sinner to justify himself.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:18">Ro 5:18</A>

 is decisive on this. Compare Article XI, Church of England. The 
 justification already given to the saints in title and unseen 
 possession, is now <FONT SIZE=-1>GIVEN</FONT> them <I>in manifestation: 
 they</I> openly <I>walk with Christ in white.</I> To this, rather than 
 to their primary justification on earth, the reference is here. Their 
 justification before the apostate world, which had persecuted them, 
 contrasts with the judgment and condemnation of the harlot. "Now that 
 the harlot has fallen, the woman triumphs" [A<FONT

 as wrought by <I>the second beast before</I> (literally, 'in sight of') 
 <I>the first beast.</I> Hence it follows the <I>second beast</I> is

 first beast to be the secular, the second beast to be the 
 ecclesiastical power of Rome; and account for the change of title for 
 the latter from the "other beast" to the "false prophet," is because by 
 the judgment on the harlot, the ecclesiastical power will then retain 
 nothing of its former character save the power to deceive. I think it 
 not unlikely that the false prophet will be the successor of the 
 spiritual pretensions of the papacy; while the beast in its last form 
 as the fully revealed Antichrist will be the secular representative and 
 embodiment of the fourth world kingdom, Rome, in its last form of 
 intensified opposition to God. Compare with this prophecy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:1-39:29,Da+2:34,35,44,11:44,45,12:1,Joe+3:9-17,Zec+12:1-14:21">Eze 38:1-39:29;

 Daniel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:8">Da 7:8</A>)

 makes no mention of the second beast, or false prophet, but mentions 
 that "the little horn" has "the eyes of a man," that is, cunning and 
 intellectual culture; this is not a feature of the first beast in the 
 thirteenth chapter, but is expressed by the Apocalyptic "false 
 prophet," the embodiment of man's unsanctified knowledge, and the 
 subtlety of the old serpent. The first beast is a political power; the 
 second is a spiritual power--the power of ideas.  But both are 
 <I>beasts,</I> the worldly Antichristian wisdom serving the worldly 
 Antichristian power. The dragon is both lion and serpent. As the first 
 law in God's moral government is that "judgment should begin at the 
 house of God," and be executed on the harlot, the faithless Church, by 
 the world power with which she had committed spiritual adultery, so it 
 is a second law that the world power, after having served as God's 
 instrument of punishment, is itself punished. As the harlot is judged 
 by the beast and the ten kings, so these are destroyed by the Lord 
 Himself coming in person. So

 And Jeremiah, after denouncing Jerusalem's judgment by Babylon, ends 
 with denouncing Babylon's own doom. Between the judgment on the harlot 
 and the Lord's destruction of the beast, will intervene that season in 
 which earthly-mindedness will reach its culmination, and 
 Antichristianity triumph for its short three and a half days during 
 which the two witnesses lie dead. Then shall the Church be ripe for her 
 glorification, the Antichristian world for destruction. The world at 
 the highest development of its material and spiritual power is but a 
 decorated carcass round which the eagles gather. It is characteristic 
 that Antichrist and his kings, in their blindness, imagine that they 
 can wage war against the King of heaven with earthly hosts; herein is 
 shown the extreme folly of Babylonian confusion. The Lord's mere 
 appearance, without any actual encounter, shows Antichrist his 
 nothingness; compare the effect of Jesus' appearance even in His 
 humiliation,

 Satan imagined that he had overcome Christ on Golgotha, and that his 
 power was secure for ever, but the Lord in death overcame him, and by 
 His ascension as our righteous Advocate cast out Satan, the accuser 
 from heaven. Time was given on earth to make the beast and harlot 
 powerful, and then to concentrate all his power in Antichrist.  The 
 Antichristian kingdom, his last effort, being utterly destroyed by 
 Christ's mere appearing, his power on earth is at an end. He had 
 thought to destroy God's people on earth by Antichristian persecutions 
 (just as he had thought previously to destroy Christ); but the Church 
 is not destroyed from the earth but is raised to rule over it, and 
 Satan himself is shut up for a thousand years in the "abyss" 
 (<I>Greek</I> for "bottomless pit"), the preparatory prison to the 
 "lake of fire," his final doom. As before he ceased by Christ's 
 ascension to be an accuser in heaven, so during the millennium he 
 ceases to be the seducer and the persecutor on earth. As long as the 
 devil rules in the darkness of the world, we live in an atmosphere 
 impregnated with deadly elements. A mighty purification of the air will 
 be effected by Christ's coming.  Though sin will not be absolutely 
 abolished--for men will still be in the flesh

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:20">Isa 65:20</A>)

 --sin will no longer be a universal power, for the flesh is not any 
 longer seduced by Satan. He will not be, as now, "the god and prince of 
 the world"--nor will the world "lie in the wicked one"--the flesh will 
 become ever more isolated and be overcome. Christ will reign with His 
 transfigured saints over men in the flesh [A<FONT

 to come," which has been already set up invisibly in the saints, amidst 
 "this world"

 The Jewish Rabbis thought, as the world was created in six days and on
 the <I>seventh</I> God rested, so there would be six millenary periods, 
 followed by a sabbatical millennium. Out of seven years every seventh 
 is the year of remission, so out of the seven thousand years of the 
 world the seventh millenary shall be the millenary of remission. A 
 tradition in the house of Elias, <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 200, states 
 that the world is to endure six thousand years; two thousand before the 
 law, two thousand under the law, and two thousand under Messiah.

 imperial Rome. Paul was <I>beheaded,</I> and no doubt shall share 
 <I>the first resurrection,</I> in accordance with his prayer that he 
 "might attain unto the resurrection from out of the rest of the dead"

 we find that all "in Christ" shall share in it. John himself was not
 "beheaded," yet who doubts but that he shall share in the first 
 resurrection? The martyrs are put first, because most like Jesus in 
 their sufferings and death, therefore nearest Him in their life and 
 reign; for Christ indirectly affirms there are relative degrees and 
 places of honor in His kingdom, the highest being for those who drink 
 his cup of suffering. Next shall be those who have not bowed to the

 <B>first resurrection</B>--"the resurrection of the just." Earth is not 
 yet transfigured, and cannot therefore be the meet locality for the 
 transfigured Church; but from heaven the transfigured saints with 
 Christ rule the earth, there being a much freer communion of the 
 heavenly and earthly churches (a type of which state may be seen in the 
 forty days of the risen Saviour during which He appeared to His 
 disciples), and they know no higher joy than to lead their brethren on 
 earth to the same salvation and glory as they share themselves. The 
 millennial reign on earth does not rest on an isolated passage of the 
 Apocalypse, but all Old Testament prophecy goes on the same view 
 (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:3,11:9,35:8">Isa 4:3; 11:9; 35:8</A>).

 Jesus, while opposing the carnal views of the kingdom of God prevalent
 among the Jews in His day, does not contradict, but confirms, the Old 
 Testament view of a coming, earthly, Jewish kingdom of glory: beginning 
 from within, and spreading itself now spiritually, the kingdom of God 
 shall manifest itself outwardly at Christ's coming again. The papacy is 
 a false anticipation of the kingdom during the Church-historical 
 period. "When Christianity became a worldly power under Constantine, 
 the hope of the future was weakened by the joy over present success" 
 [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]. Becoming a harlot, the Church ceased to 
 be a bride going to meet her Bridegroom; thus millennial hopes 
 disappeared. The rights which Rome as a harlot usurped, shall be 
 exercised in holiness by the Bride. They are "kings" because they are 
 "priests"

 their priesthood unto God and Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:15">Re 7:15</A>)

 is the ground of their kingship in relation to man. Men will be willing 
 subjects of the transfigured priest-kings, in the day of the Lord's 
 power. Their power is that of attraction, winning the heart, and not 
 counteracted by devil or beast. Church and State shall then be 
 co-extensive. Man created "to have dominion over earth" is to rejoice 
 over <I>his</I> world with unmixed, holy joy. John tells us that, 
 instead of the devil, the transfigured Church of Christ; Daniel, that 
 instead of the heathen beast, the holy Israel, shall rule the world

 <B>priests of God</B>--Apostate Christendom being destroyed, and the 
 believing Church translated at Christ's coming, there will remain 
 Israel and the heathen world, constituting the majority of men then 
 alive, which, from not having come into close contact with the Gospel, 
 have not incurred the guilt of rejecting it. These will be the subjects 
 of a general conversion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:15">Re 11:15</A>).

 "The veil" shall be taken off Israel first, then from off "all people." 
 The glorious events attending Christ's appearing, the destruction of 
 Antichrist, the transfiguration of the Church, and the binding of 
 Satan, will prepare the nations for embracing the Gospel. As 
 <I>individual</I> regeneration goes on now, so there shall be a 
 "regeneration" of <I>nations</I> then. Israel, as a nation, shall be 
 "born at once--in one day." As <I>the Church</I> began at Christ's 
 ascension, so the <I>kingdom</I> shall begin at His second advent. This 
 is the humiliation of the modern civilized nations, that nations which 
 they despise most, Jews and uncivilized barbarians, the negro 
 descendants of Ham who from the curse of Noah have been so backward, 
 Cush and Sheba, shall supplant and surpass them as centers of the 
 world's history (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:21,Ro+10:19,11:20">De 32:21;
 Ro 10:19; 11:20</A>, 

 &c.). The Jews are our teachers even in New Testament times. Since 
 their rejection revelation has been silent. The whole Bible, even the 
 New Testament, is written by Jews. If revelation is to recommence in 
 the millennial kingdom, converted Israel must stand at the head of 
 humanity. In a religious point of view, Jews and Gentiles stand on an 
 equal footing as both alike needing mercy; but as regards God's 
 instrumentalities for bringing about His kingdom on earth, Israel is 
 His chosen people for executing His plans. The Israelite priest-kings 
 on earth are what the transfigured priest-kings are in heaven. There 
 shall be a blessed chain of giving and receiving--God, Christ, the 
 transfigured Bride the Church, Israel, the world of nations. A new time 
 of revelation will begin by the outpouring of the fulness of the 
 Spirit. Ezekiel (the fortieth through forty-eighth chapters), himself 
 son of a priest, sets forth the priestly character of Israel; Daniel 
 the statesman, its kingly character; Jeremiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:17-21">Jer 33:17-21</A>),

 both its priestly and kingly character. In the Old Testament the whole 
 Jewish national life was religious only in an external legal manner. 
 The New Testament Church insists on inward renewal, but leaves its 
 outward manifestations free. But in the millennial kingdom, all spheres 
 of life shall be truly Christianized from within outwardly. The Mosaic 
 ceremonial law corresponds to Israel's priestly office; the civil law 
 to its kingly office: the Gentile Church adopts the moral law, and 
 exercises the prophetic office by the word working inwardly. But when 
 the royal and the priestly office shall be revived, then--the 
 principles of the Epistle to the Hebrews remaining the same--also the 
 ceremonial and civil law of Moses will develop its spiritual depths in 
 the divine worship (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:17-19">Mt 5:17-19</A>).

 At present is the time of preaching; but then the time of the 
 <I>Liturgy</I> of converted souls forming "the great congregation" 
 shall come. Then shall our present defective governments give place to 
 perfect governments in both Church and State. Whereas under the Old 
 Testament the Jews exclusively, and in the New Testament the Gentiles 
 exclusively, enjoy the revelation of salvation (in both cases humanity 
 being divided and separated), in the millennium both Jews and Gentiles 
 are united, and the whole organism of mankind under the first-born 
 brother, Israel, walks in the light of God, and the full life of 
 humanity is at last realized. Scripture does not view the human race as 
 an aggregate of individuals and nationalities, but as an organic whole, 
 laid down once for all in the first pages of revelation.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:25-27,10:1,5,18,25,32,De+32:8">Ge 9:25-27; 10:1, 5, 18, 25, 32;
 De 32:8</A> 

 recognizes the fact that from the first the division of the nations was
 made with a relation to Israel). Hence arises the importance of the Old 
 Testament to the Church now as ever. Three grand groups of nations, 
 Hamites, Japhetites, and Shemites, correspond respectively to the three 
 fundamental elements in man--body, soul, and spirit. The flower of 
 Shem, the representative of <I>spiritual</I> life, is Israel, even as 
 the flower of Israel is He in whom all mankind is summed up, the second 
 Adam

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:1-3">Ge 12:1-3</A>).

 Thus Israel is the mediator of divine revelations for all times. Even 
 nature and the animal world will share in the millennial blessedness. 
 As sin loses its power, decay and death will decrease [A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>UBERLEN</FONT>]. Earthly and heavenly glories shall be united 
 in the twofold election. Elect Israel in the flesh shall stand at the 
 head of the earthly, the elect spiritual Church, the Bride, in the 
 heavenly. These twofold elections are not merely for the good of the 
 elect themselves, but for the good of those to whom they minister. The 
 heavenly Church is elected not merely to salvation, but to rule in 
 love, and minister blessings over the whole earth, as king-priests. The 
 glory of the transfigured saints shall be felt by men in the flesh with 
 the same consciousness of blessing as on the Mount of Transfiguration 
 the three disciples experienced in witnessing the glory of Jesus, and 
 of Moses and Elias, when Peter exclaimed, "It is good for us to be 
 here"; in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:16-18">2Pe 1:16-18</A>,

 the Transfiguration is regarded as the earnest of Christ's coming in 
 glory.  The privilege of "our high <I>calling</I> in Christ" is limited 
 to the present time of Satan's reign; when he is bound, there will be 
 no scope for suffering for, and so afterwards <I>reigning</I> with, Him

 Moreover, none can be saved in the present age and in the pale of the 
 Christian Church who does not also reign with Christ hereafter, the 
 necessary preliminary to which is suffering with Christ now. If we fail

 apostasy should take place at its close. In the judgment on this 
 apostasy the world of nature is destroyed and renewed, as the world of 
 history was before the millennial kingdom; it is only then that the new 
 heaven and new earth are realized in final perfection.  The 
 <I>millennial</I> new heaven and earth are but a foretaste of this 
 everlasting state when the upper and lower congregations shall be no 
 longer separate, though connected as in the millennium, and when new 
 Jerusalem shall descend from God out of heaven. The inherited 
 sinfulness of our nature shall be the only influence during the 
 millennium to prevent the power of the transfigured Church saving all 
 souls. When this time of grace shall end, no other shall succeed. For 
 what can move him in whom the visible glory of the Church, while the 
 influence of evil is restrained, evokes no longing for communion with 
 the Church's King? As the history of the world of nations ended with 
 the manifestation of the Church in visible glory, so that of mankind in 
 general shall end with the great separation of the just from the wicked

 Rather, the Son, to whom "the Father hath committed all judgment." God

 whose judgment-seat we must all stand. The Son's mediatorial reign is 
 with a view to prepare the kingdom for the Father's acceptance. When He 
 has done that, He shall give it up to the Father, "that God may be all 
 in all," coming into direct communion with His creatures, without 
 intervention of a Mediator, for the first time since the fall. 
 Heretofore Christ's <I>Prophetical</I> mediation had been prominent in 
 His earthly ministry, His Priestly mediation is prominent now in heaven

 Besides the general book recording the works of all, there is a special

 righteousness before</I> the whole world, which in this checkered 
 dispensation of good and evil, though really ruling the world, has been 
 for the time less manifest. <I>Faith</I> is appreciable by God and the 
 believer alone

 The remaining two chapters describe the eternal and consummated kingdom
 of God and the saints on the new earth. As the world of nations is to
 be pervaded by divine influence in the millennium, so the world of
 nature shall be, not annihilated, but transfigured universally in the
 eternal state which follows it. The earth was cursed for man's sake; 
 but is redeemed by the second Adam. <I>Now</I> is the Church; in the 
 millennium shall be the kingdom; and after that shall be the new world 
 wherein God shall be all in all. The "day of the Lord" and the 
 conflagration of the earth are in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:10,11">2Pe 3:10, 11</A>

 spoken of as if connected together, from which many argue against a 
 millennial interval between His coming and the general conflagration of 
 the old earth, preparatory to the new; but "day" is used often of a 
 whole period comprising events intimately connected together, as are 
 the Lord's second advent, the millennium, and the general conflagration 
 and judgment. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:4">Ge 2:4</A>

 as to the wide use of "day." Man's <I>soul</I> is redeemed by 
 regeneration through the Holy Spirit now; man's <I>body</I> shall be 
 redeemed at the resurrection; man's <I>dwelling-place,</I> His 
 inheritance, the earth, shall be redeemed perfectly at the creation of 
 the new heaven and earth, which shall exceed in glory the first 
 Paradise, as much as the second Adam exceeds in glory the first Adam 
 before the fall, and as man regenerated in body and soul shall exceed 
 man as he was at creation.</P>

 <B>no more sea</B>--The sea is the type of perpetual unrest. Hence our 
 Lord rebukes it as an unruly hostile troubler of His people. It 
 symbolized the political tumults out of which "the beast" arose,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:1">Re 13:1</A>.

 As the physical corresponds to the spiritual and moral world, so the 
 absence of <I>sea,</I> after the metamorphosis of the earth by 
 <I>fire,</I> answers to the unruffled state of solid peace which shall 
 then prevail. The <I>sea,</I> though severing lands from one another, 
 is now, by God's eliciting of good from evil, made the medium of 
 communication between countries through navigation. Then man shall 
 possess inherent powers which shall make the sea no longer necessary, 
 but an element which would detract from a perfect state. A "river" and 
 "water" are spoken of in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:1,2">Re 22:1, 2</A>,

 probably literal (that is, with such changes of the natural properties 
 of water, as correspond analogically to man's own transfigured body), 
 as well as symbolical. The sea was once the element of the world's 
 destruction, and is still the source of death to thousands, whence 
 after the millennium, at the general judgment, it is specially said, 
 "The <I>sea</I> gave up the dead .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in it." Then it shall 
 cease to destroy, or disturb, being removed altogether on account of 
 its past destructions.</P>

 costlier, statelier, and more glorious, but at the same time the result

 the primitive garden of Eden. "The lively stones" were severally in

 the serpent, and driven from the tree of life, and from the pleasant 
 waters of Eden, yet not without a promise of a Redeemer who should

 the command is, "Seal the book," for the vision shall be "for many 
 days." The fulfilment of Daniel's prophecy was distant, that of John's 
 prophecy is near. The New Testament is the time of the end and 
 fulfilment. The Gentile Church, for which John wrote his Revelation, 
 needs more to be impressed with the shortness of the period, as it is 
 inclined, owing to its Gentile origin, to conform to the world and 
 forget the coming of the Lord. The Revelation points, on the one hand, 
 to Christ's coming as distant, for it shows the succession of the seven 
 seals, trumpets, and vials; on the other hand, it proclaims, "Behold, I 
 come quickly." So Christ marked many events as about to intervene 
 before His coming, and yet He also says "Behold, I come quickly," 
 because our right attitude is that of continual prayerful watching for 
 His coming

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the bride</B>--not here called "wife," as that title applies to her 
 only when the full number constituting the Church shall have been 
 completed.  The invitation, "Come," only holds good while the Church is 
 still but an affianced <I>Bride,</I> and not the actually wedded 
 <I>wife.</I> However, "Come" may rather be the prayer of the Spirit in 
 the Church and in believers in reply to Christ's "I come quickly," 
 crying, Even so, "Come"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:7,12">Re 22:7, 12</A>);

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:20">Re 22:20</A>

 confirms this view. The whole question of your salvation hinges on
 this, that you be able to hear with joy Christ's announcement, "I 
 come," and to reply, "Come" [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]. Come to 
 fully glorify Thy Bride.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>let him that heareth</B>--that is, let him that heareth the Spirit 
 and Bride saying to the Lord Jesus, "Come," join the Bride as a true 
 believer, become part of her, and so say with her to Jesus, "Come." On 
 "heareth" means "obeyeth"; for until one has <I>obeyed</I> the Gospel 
 call, he cannot pray to Jesus "Come"; so "hear" is used,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:3,Joh+10:16">Re 1:3;
 Joh 10:16</A>.
 
 Let him that hears and obeys Jesus' voice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:16,Re+1:3">Re 22:16;
 Re 1:3</A>) 

 join in praying "Come." Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:1,10">Re 6:1, 10</A>;

 see on

 <A HREF="#Re6_1">Re 6:1</A>. 

 In the other view, which makes "Come" an invitation to sinners, this 
 clause urges those who themselves hear savingly the invitation to 
 address the same to others, as did Andrew and Philip after they 
 themselves had heard and obeyed Jesus' invitation, "Come."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>let him that is athirst come</B>--As the Bride, the Church, prays to 
 Jesus, "Come," so she urges all whosoever <I>thirst</I> for 
 participation in the full manifestation of redemption-glory at <I>His 
 coming to us,</I> to <FONT SIZE=-1>COME</FONT> in the meantime and 
 drink of the living waters, which are the earnest of "the water of life 
 pure as crystal .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. out of the throne of God of the Lamb"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:1">Re 22:1</A>)
 
 in the regenerated heaven and earth.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>And</B>--so <I>Syriac.</I> But A, B, <I>Vulgate,</I> and 
 <I>Coptic</I> omit "and."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>whosoever will</B>--that is, is willing and desirous. There is a 
 descending climax; Let him that <I>heareth</I> effectually and savingly 
 Christ's voice, pray individually, as the Bride, the Church, does 
 collectively, "Come, Lord Jesus"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:20">Re 22:20</A>).

 Let him who, though not yet having actually <I>heard</I> unto 
 salvation, and so not yet able to join in the prayer, "Lord Jesus, 
 come, "still <I>thirsts</I> for it, <I>come</I> to Christ. Whosoever is 
 even <I>willing,</I> though his desires do not yet amount to positive 
 <I>thirsting,</I> let him take the water of life freely, that is, 
 gratuitously.</P>

 <I>Syriac, Coptic,</I> and A<FONT SIZE=-1>NDREAS</FONT> omit "and"; 
 then "which are written in this book" will refer to "the holy city and 
 the tree of life." As in the beginning of this book

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:3">Re 1:3</A>)

 a blessing was promised to the devout, obedient student of it, so now 
 at its close a curse is denounced against those who add to, or take 
 from, it.</P>

 closes with the same yearning prayer for Christ's coming. A, B, and 
 <I>Aleph</I> omit "Even so," <I>Greek,</I> "<I>nai</I>": then translate 
 for <I>Amen,</I> "<I>So be it,</I> come, Lord Jesus"; joining the 
 "Amen," or "So be it," not with Christ's saying (for He calls Himself 
 the "Amen" at the beginning of sentences, rather than puts it as a 
 confirmation at the end), but with John's reply. Christ's "I come," and 
 John's "Come," are almost coincident in time; so truly does the 
 believer reflect the mind of his Lord.</P>

 saints." A and <I>Vulgate</I> have, "with all." <I>Aleph</I> has, "with 
 the saints." This closing benediction, Paul's mark in his Epistles, was 
 after Paul's death taken up by John. The Old Testament ended with a 
 "curse" in connection with the <I>law;</I> the New Testament ends with 
 a blessing in union with the Lord Jesus.

 <B>Amen</B>--so B, <I>Aleph,</I> and A<FONT SIZE=-1>NDREAS</FONT>. A

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 May the Blessed Lord who has caused all holy Scriptures to be written
 for our learning, bless this humble effort to make Scripture expound
 itself, and make it an instrument towards the conversion of sinners and
 the edification of saints, to the glory of His great name and the
 hastening of His kingdom! Amen.</P>
