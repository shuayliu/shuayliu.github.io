 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT> writer of this Gospel is universally allowed 
 to have been Lucas (an abbreviated form of Lucanus, as Silas of 
 Silvanus), though he is not expressly named either in the Gospel or in 
 the Acts. From

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:14">Col 4:14</A>
 
 we learn that he was a "physician"; and by comparing that verse with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:10,11">Col 4:10, 11</A>

 --in which the apostle enumerates all those of the circumcision who 
 were then with him, but does not mention Luke, though he immediately 
 afterwards sends a salutation from him--we gather that Luke was not a 
 born Jew. Some have thought he was a freed-man (<I>libertinus</I>), as 
 the Romans devolved the healing art on persons of this class and on 
 their slaves, as an occupation beneath themselves.  His intimate 
 acquaintance with Jewish customs, and his facility in <I>Hebraic 
 Greek,</I> seem to show that he was an early convert to the Jewish 
 faith; and this is curiously confirmed by

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:27-29">Ac 21:27-29</A>,

 where we find the Jews enraged at Paul's supposed introduction of 
 Greeks into the temple, because they had seen "Trophimus the Ephesian" 
 with him; and as we know that Luke was with Paul on that occasion, it 
 would seem that they had taken him for a Jew, as they made no mention 
 of him. On the other hand, his fluency in classical <I>Greek</I> 
 confirms his Gentile origin.  The time when he joined Paul's company is 
 clearly indicated in the Acts by his changing (at

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:10">Ac 16:10</A>)

 from the third person singular ("he") to the first person plural 
 ("we"). From that time he hardly ever left the apostle till near the 
 period of his martyrdom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:11">2Ti 4:11</A>).

 E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> makes him a native of Antioch. If so, he 
 would have every advantage for cultivating the literature of Greece and 
 such medical knowledge as was then possessed. That he died a natural 
 death is generally agreed among the ancients; G<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>REGORY</FONT> N<FONT SIZE=-1>AZIANZEN</FONT> alone affirming 
 that he died a martyr.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <I>time</I> and <I>place</I> of the publication of his Gospel are alike
 uncertain. But we can approximate to it. It must at any rate have been
 issued before the Acts, for there the 'Gospel' is expressly referred to
 as the same author's "former treatise" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:1">Ac 1:1</A>).

 Now the Book of the Acts was not published for two whole years after 
 Paul's arrival as a prisoner at Rome, for it concludes with a reference 
 to this period; but probably it was published soon after that, which 
 would appear to have been early in the year 63. Before that time, then, 
 we have reason to believe that the Gospel of Luke was in circulation, 
 though the majority of critics make it later. If we date it somewhere 
 between <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 50 and 60, we shall probably be near 
 the truth; but nearer it we cannot with any certainty come. Conjectures 
 as to the place of publication are too uncertain to be mentioned 
 here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 That it was addressed, in the first instance, to Gentile <I>readers,</I>
 is beyond doubt. This is no more, as D<FONT SIZE=-1>AVIDSON</FONT> remarks
 [<I>Introduction to the New Testament,</I> p. 186], than was to have been
 expected from the companion of an "apostle of the Gentiles," who had
 witnessed marvellous changes in the condition of many heathens by the
 reception of the Gospel. But the explanations in his Gospel of things
 known to every Jew, and which could only be intended for Gentile
 readers, make this quite plain--see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:26,4:31,8:26,21:37,22:1,24:13">Lu 1:26;
 4:31; 8:26; 21:37; 22:1; 24:13</A>.

 A number of other minute particulars, both of things inserted and of
 things omitted, confirm the conclusion that it was Gentiles whom this 
 Evangelist had in the first instance in view.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have already adverted to the classical <I>style</I> of <I>Greek</I> which
 this Evangelist writes--just what might have been expected from an
 educated Greek and travelled physician. But we have also observed that
 along with this he shows a wonderful flexibility of style, so much so,
 that when he comes to relate transactions wholly Jewish, where the
 speakers and actors and incidents are all Jewish, he writes in such
 <I>Jewish Greek</I> as one would do who had never been out of Palestine or
 mixed with any but Jews. In D<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT>
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>OSTA'S</FONT>'S <I>Four Witnesses</I> will be found
 some traces of "the beloved <I>physician</I>" in this Gospel. But far more
 striking and important are the traces in it of his intimate connection
 with the apostle of the Gentiles. That one who was so long and so
 constantly in the society of that master mind has in such a work as
 this shown no traces of that connection, no stamp of that mind, is
 hardly to be believed. Writers of Introductions seem not to see it, and
 take no notice of it. But those who look into the interior of it will
 soon discover evidences enough in it of a <I>Pauline</I> cast of mind.
 Referring for a number of details to D<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT>
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>OSTA</FONT>, we notice here only two
 examples: In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:23">1Co 11:23</A>,

 Paul ascribes to an express revelation from Christ Himself the account 
 of the Institution of the Lord's Supper which he there gives. Now, if 
 we find this account differing in small yet striking particulars from 
 the accounts given by Matthew and Mark, but agreeing to the letter with 
 Luke's account, it can hardly admit of a doubt that the one had it from 
 the other; and in that case, of course, it was Luke that had it from 
 Paul. Now Matthew and Mark both say of the Cup, "This is my blood of 
 the New Testament"; while Paul and Luke say, in identical terms, "This 
 cup is the New Testament in My blood"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:25,Lu+22:20">1Co 11:25;
 Lu 22:20</A>). 

 Further, Luke says, "Likewise also the cup <I>after supper,</I>
 saying," &c.; while Paul says, "After the same manner He took the cup 
 <I>when He had supped,</I> saying," &c.; whereas neither Matthew nor 
 Mark mention that this was after supper. But still more striking is 
 another point of coincidence in this case. Matthew and Mark both say of 
 the Bread merely this: "Take, eat; this is My body"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:26,Mk+14:22">Mt 26:26;
 Mr 14:22</A>); 

 whereas Paul says, "Take, eat, this is My body, <I>which is broken for
 you</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:24">1Co 11:24</A>),

 and Luke, "This is My body, <I>which is given for you</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:19">Lu 22:19</A>).

 And while Paul adds the precious clause, "<I>This do in remembrance of 
 Me,</I>" Luke does the same, in identical terms. How can one who 
 reflects on this resist the conviction of a Pauline stamp in this 
 Gospel? The other proof of this to which we ask the reader's attention 
 is in the fact that Paul, in enumerating the parties by whom Christ was 
 seen after His resurrection, begins, singularly enough, with 
 Peter--"And that He rose again the third day according to the 
 Scriptures and that He was seen of Cephas, then of the Twelve"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:4,5">1Co 15:4, 5</A>)

 --coupled with the remarkable fact, that Luke is the only one of the 
 Evangelists who mentions that Christ appeared to Peter at all. When the 
 disciples had returned from Emmaus to tell their brethren how the Lord 
 had appeared to them in the way, and how He had made Himself known to 
 them in the breaking of bread, they were met, as Luke relates, ere they 
 had time to utter a word, with this wonderful piece of news, "The Lord 
 is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:34">Lu 24:34</A>).</P>

 It appears from the Acts of the Apostles, and the Apostolic Epistles,
 that the earliest preaching of the Gospel consisted of a brief summary
 of the facts of our Lord's earthly history, with a few words of pointed
 application to the parties addressed. Of these astonishing facts, notes
 would naturally be taken and <I>digests</I> put into circulation. It is to
 such that Luke here refers; and in terms of studied respect, as
 narratives of what was "believed surely," or "on sure grounds" among
 Christians, and drawn up from the testimony of "eye-witnesses and
 ministering servants of the word." But when he adds that "it seemed good
 to him also to write in order, having traced down all things with
 exactness from their first rise," it is a virtual claim for his own
 Gospel to supersede these "many" narratives. Accordingly, while not one
 of them has survived the wreck of time, this and the other canonical
 Gospels live, and shall live, the only fitting vehicles of those
 life-bringing facts which have made all things new. Apocryphal or
 spurious gospels, upheld by parties unfriendly to the truths exhibited
 in the canonical Gospels, have <I>not</I> perished; but those well-meant
 and substantially correct narratives here referred to, used only while
 better were not to be had, were by tacit consent allowed to merge in the
 four peerless documents which from age to age, and with astonishing
 unanimity, have been accepted as the written charter of all
 Christianity.</P>

 in this Gospel.

 the hot coals; and, while the smoke of it ascended, to make intercession
 for the people. This was the most distinguished part of the service

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+8:3">Re 8:3</A>),

 verse, inasmuch as Cyrenius, or Quirinus, appears not to have been 
 governor of Syria for about ten years after the birth of Christ, and 
 the "taxing" under his administration was what led to the insurrection
 mentioned in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:37">Ac 5:37</A>.

 That there was a taxing, however, of the whole Roman Empire under 
 Augustus, is now admitted by all; and candid critics, even of skeptical 
 tendency, are ready to allow that there is not likely to be any real 
 inaccuracy in the statement of our Evangelist. Many superior scholars 
 would render the words thus, "This registration was <I>previous</I> to 
 Cyrenius being governor of Syria"--as the word "first" is rendered in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:15,15:18">Joh 1:15; 15:18</A>.

 In this case, of course, the difficulty vanishes.  But it is perhaps
 better to suppose, with others, that the registration may have been 
 ordered with a view to the taxation, about the time of our Lord's 
 birth, though the taxing itself--an obnoxious measure in Palestine--was 
 not carried out till the time of Quirinus.</P>

 From about passover time in April until autumn, the flocks pastured
 constantly in the open fields, the shepherds lodging there all that
 time. (From this it seems plain that the period of the year usually
 assigned to our Lord's birth is too late). Were these shepherds chosen
 to have the first sight of the blessed Babe without any respect of their
 own state of mind? That, at least, is not God's way. "No doubt, like
 Simeon

 their quiet occupation, the stillness of the midnight hours, and the 
 amplitude of the deep blue vault above them for the heavenly music 
 which was to fill their ear, pointed them out as fit recipients for the 
 first tidings of an Infant Saviour, the congenial meditations and 
 conversations by which, we may suppose, they would beguile the tedious 
 hours would perfect their preparation for the unexpected visit. Thus 
 was Nathanael engaged, all alone but not unseen, under the fig tree, in 
 unconscious preparation for his first interview with Jesus.  (See on

 Yet in this naming of Him "Saviour," in the act of circumcising Him,
 which was a symbolical and bloody removal of the body of sin, we have a 
 tacit intimation that they "had need"--as John said of His 
 Baptism--rather to be circumcised by Him "with the circumcision made 
 without hands, in the putting off of the body [of the sins] of the 
 flesh by the circumcision of Christ"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:11">Col 2:11</A>),

 and that He only "suffered it to be so, because thus it became Him to 
 fulfil all righteousness"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:15">Mt 3:15</A>).

 Still the circumcision of Christ had a profound bearing on His own 
 work--by few rightly apprehended. For since "he that is circumcised is 
 a <I>debtor to do the whole law</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:3">Ga 5:3</A>),

 Jesus thus bore about with Him in His very flesh the seal of a 
 voluntary obligation to do the whole law--by Him only possible in the 
 flesh since the fall. And as He was "made under the law" for no ends of 
 His own, but only "<I>to redeem them that were under the law,</I> that 
 we might receive the adoption of sons"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:4,5">Ga 4:4, 5</A>),

 the obedience to which His circumcision pledged Him was a <I>redeeming 
 obedience</I>--that of a "Saviour." And, finally, as "Christ hath 
 redeemed us from the curse of the law" by "being made <I>a curse</I> 
 for <I>us</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:13">Ga 3:13</A>),

 we must regard Him, in His circumcision, as brought under a palpable 
 pledge to be "<I>obedient unto death, even the death of the cross</I>"

 <B>22, 24. her purification</B>--Though the most and best copies read
 "their," it was the mother only who needed purifying from the legal 
 uncleanness of childbearing. "The days" of this purification for a male 
 child were forty in all

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+12:2,4">Le 12:2, 4</A>),

 on the expiry of which the mother was required to offer a lamb for a
 burnt offering, and a turtle dove or a young pigeon for a sin offering. 
 If she could not afford a lamb, the mother had to bring another turtle 
 dove or young pigeon; and, if even this was beyond her means, then a 
 portion of fine flour, but without the usual fragrant accompaniments of 
 oil and frankincense, as it represented a sin offering

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+12:6-8,Le+5:7-11">Le 12:6-8; 5:7-11</A>).

 From the intermediate offering of "a pair of turtle doves or two young
 pigeons," we gather that Joseph and the Virgin were in poor 
 circumstances

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:9">2Co 8:9</A>),

 though not in abject poverty. Being a first-born male, they "bring him 
 to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord." All such had been claimed as 
 "holy to the Lord," or set apart to sacred uses, in memory of the 
 deliverance of the first-born of Israel from destruction in Egypt, 
 through the sprinkling of blood

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+13:2">Ex 13:2</A>).

 In lieu of these, however, one whole tribe, that of Levi, was accepted, 
 and set apart to occupations exclusively sacred

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:11-38">Nu 3:11-38</A>);

 and whereas there were two hundred seventy-three fewer Levites than 
 first-born of all Israel on the first reckoning, each of these 
 first-born was to be redeemed by the payment of five shekels, yet not 
 without being "<I>presented</I> (or brought) <I>unto the Lord,</I>" in 
 token of His rightful claim to them and their service

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:44-47,18:15,16">Nu 3:44-47; 18:15, 16</A>).

 It was in obedience to this "law of Moses," that the Virgin presented
 her babe unto the Lord, "in the east gate of the court called Nicanor's 
 Gate, where she herself would be sprinkled by the priest with the blood 
 of her sacrifice" [L<FONT SIZE=-1>IGHTFOOT</FONT>].  By that Babe, in 
 due time, we were to be redeemed, "not with corruptible things as 
 silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:18,19">1Pe 1:18, 19</A>),

 and the consuming of the mother's burnt offering, and the sprinkling of 
 her with the blood of her sin offering, were to find their abiding 
 realization in the "living sacrifice" of the Christian mother herself, 
 in the fulness of a "heart sprinkled from an evil conscience," by "the 
 blood which cleanseth from all sin."</P>

 fasting and attendance on public worship, besides being set to learn a
 trade. At this age accordingly our Lord is taken up for the first time
 to Jerusalem, at the passover season, the chief of the three annual
 festivals. But oh, with what thoughts and feelings must this Youth have
 gone up! Long ere He beheld it, He had doubtless "loved the habitation
 of God's house and the place where His honor dwelt"

 a love nourished, we may be sure, by that "word hid in His heart," with 
 which in afterlife He showed so perfect a familiarity. As the time for 
 His first visit approached, could one's ear have caught the breathings 
 of His young soul, he might have heard Him whispering, "As the hart 
 panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God.  
 The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.

 Of His feelings or actions during all the eight days of the feast not a
 word is said. As a devout child, in company with its parents, He would 
 go through the services, keeping His thoughts to Himself. But methinks 
 I hear Him, after the sublime services of that feast, saying to 
 Himself, "He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph,</B> &c.--Have we in this
 genealogy, as well as in Matthew's, the line of <I>Joseph?</I> or is this
 the line of <I>Mary?</I>--a point on which there has been great difference
 of opinion and much acute discussion. Those who take the <I>former</I> opinion
 contend that it is the natural sense of this verse, and that no
 other would have been thought of but for its supposed improbability and
 the uncertainty which it seems to throw over our Lord's real descent.
 But it is liable to another difficulty; namely, that in this case
 Matthew makes <I>Jacob,</I> while Luke makes "<I>Heli,</I>" to be Joseph's
 father; and though the same man had often more than one name, we ought
 not to resort to that supposition, in such a case as this, without
 necessity. And then, though the descent of Mary from David would be
 liable to no real doubt, even though we had no table of her line
 preserved to us (see, for example,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:2-32">Lu 1:2-32</A>,

 and see on

 <A HREF="#Lu2_5">Lu 2:5</A>), 

 still it does seem unlikely--we say not incredible--that two 
 genealogies of our Lord should be preserved to us, neither of which 
 gives his <I>real</I> descent. Those who take the <I>latter</I> 
 opinion, that we have here the line of <I>Mary,</I> as in Matthew that 
 of <I>Joseph</I>--here His <I>real,</I> there His <I>reputed</I> 
 line--explain the statement about Joseph, that he was "<I>the son</I> 
 of Hell," to mean that he was his <I>son-in-law,</I> as the husband of 
 his daughter Mary (as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:11,12">Ru 1:11, 12</A>),

 and believe that Joseph's name is only introduced instead of Mary's, in 
 conformity with the Jewish custom in such tables. Perhaps this view is 
 attended with fewest difficulties, as it certainly is the best 
 supported. However we decide, it is a satisfaction to know that not a 
 doubt was thrown out by the bitterest of the early enemies of 
 Christianity as to <I>our Lord's real descent from David.</I> On 
 comparing the two genealogies, it will be found that Matthew, writing 
 more immediately for <I>Jews,</I> deemed it enough to show that the 
 Saviour was sprung from Abraham and David; whereas Luke, writing more 
 immediately for <I>Gentiles,</I> traces the descent back to Adam, the 
 parent stock of the whole human family, thus showing Him to be the 
 promised "Seed of the woman." "The possibility of constructing such a 
 table, comprising a period of thousands of years, in an uninterrupted 
 line from father to son, of a family that dwelt for a long time in the 
 utmost retirement, would be inexplicable, had not the members of this 
 line been endowed with <I>a thread</I> by which they could extricate 
 themselves from the many families into which every tribe and branch was 
 again subdivided, and thus hold fast and know <I>the</I> member that 
 was destined to continue the lineage. This thread was the hope that 
 Messiah would be born of the race of Abraham and David. The ardent 
 desire to behold Him and be partakers of His mercy and glory suffered 
 not the attention to be exhausted through a period embracing thousands 
 of years. Thus the member destined to continue the lineage, whenever 
 doubtful, became easily distinguishable, awakening the hope of a final 
 fulfilment, and keeping it alive until it was consummated" [O<FONT

 <B>18, 19.</B> To have fixed on any passage announcing His <I>sufferings</I>
 (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:1-12">Isa 53:1-12</A>),

 would have been unsuitable at that early stage of His ministry. But He 
 selects a passage announcing the sublime object of His whole mission, 
 its divine character, and His special endowments for it; expressed in 
 the first person, and so singularly adapted to <I>the first opening of 
 the mouth</I> in His prophetic capacity, that it seems as if made 
 expressly for this occasion. It is from the well-known section of 
 Isaiah's prophecies whose burden is that mysterious "S<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ERVANT OF THE</FONT> L<FONT SIZE=-1>ORD</FONT>," despised of 
 man, abhorred of the nation, but before whom kings on seeing Him are to 
 arise, and princes to worship; in visage more marred than any man and 
 His form than the sons of men, yet sprinkling many nations; laboring 
 seemingly in vain, and spending His strength for naught and in vain, 
 yet Jehovah's Servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and be His 
 Salvation to the ends of the earth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:1-26">Isa 49:1-26</A>,

 As the maladies under which humanity groans are here set forth under
 the names of <I>poverty, broken-heartedness, bondage, blindness, 
 bruisedness</I> (or <I>crushedness</I>), so, as the glorious H<FONT

 the act of reading it, stopping the quotation just before it comes to 
 "the day of vengeance," which was only to come on the rejecters of His 
 message

 doings at Capernaum; but if such power resides in Thee to cure the ills
 of humanity, why has none of it yet come nearer home, and why is all
 this alleged power reserved for strangers?" His choice of Capernaum as a
 place of residence since entering on public life was, it seems, already
 well known at Nazareth; and when He did come thither, to give no
 displays of His power when distant places were ringing with His fame,
 wounded their pride. He had indeed "laid his hands on a few sick folk
 and healed them" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:5">Mr 6:5</A>);

 familiarity breeds contempt." Our Lord's long residence in Nazareth
 merely as a townsman had made Him <I>too common,</I> incapacitating them
 for appreciating Him as others did who were
 <I>less familiar with His everyday demeanor in private life.</I> A most
 important principle, to which the wise will pay due regard. (See also

 of prophetic antiquity, and whose miracles strikingly prefigured those
 of our Lord. As He intended like them to feed the poor and cleanse the

 and in the other, "the new wine is spilled," <I>so by a mongrel mixture 
 of the ascetic ritualism of the old with the spiritual freedom of the 
 new economy, both are disfigured and destroyed.</I> The additional 
 parable in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:39">Lu 5:39</A>,

 which is peculiar to Luke, has been variously interpreted.  But the 
 "new wine" seems plainly to be the evangelical freedom which Christ was 
 introducing; and the old, the opposite spirit of Judaism: men long 
 accustomed to the latter could not be expected "straightway"--all at 
 once--to take a liking for the former; that is, "These inquiries about 
 the difference between My disciples and the Pharisees," and even 
 John's, are not surprising; they are the effect of <I>a natural 
 revulsion against sudden change,</I> which time will cure; <I>the new 
 wine will itself in time become old, and so acquire all the added 
 charms of antiquity.</I> What lessons does this teach, on the one hand, 
 to those who unreasonably cling to what is getting antiquated; and, on 
 the other, to hasty reformers who have no patience with the timidity of 
 their weaker brethren!</P>

 of which they take this following discourse of Luke to be but an 
 abridged form. But as the sense given in our version is the more 
 accurate, so there are weighty reasons for considering the discourses 
 different. This one contains little more than a fourth of the other; it

 above all, that of Matthew was plainly delivered a good while 
 <I>before,</I> while this was spoken <I>after</I> the choice of the

 <B>began to wash,</B> &c.--to "water with a shower." The tears, which were
 quite <I>involuntary,</I> poured down in a flood upon His naked feet, as
 she bent down to kiss them; and deeming them rather fouled than washed
 by this, she hastened to wipe them off with the only towel she had, the
 long tresses of her own hair, "with which slaves were wont to wash their
 masters' feet" [S<FONT SIZE=-1>TIER</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>kissed</B>--The word signifies "to kiss fondly, to caress," or to "kiss
 again and again," which

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:45">Lu 7:45</A>

 shows is meant here. What prompted this? <I>Much love, springing from a 
 sense of much forgiveness.</I> So says He who knew her heart

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:47">Lu 7:47</A>).

 Where she had met with Christ before, or what words of His had brought 
 life to her dead heart and a sense of divine pardon to her guilty soul, 
 we know not. But probably she was of the crowd of "publicans and 
 <I>sinners</I>" whom Incarnate Compassion drew so often around Him, and 
 heard from His lips some of those words such as never man spake, "Come 
 unto Me, all ye that labour," &c. No personal interview had up to this 
 time taken place between them; but she could keep her feelings no 
 longer to herself, and having found her way to Him (and entered along 
 with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:45">Lu 7:45</A>),
 
 they burst forth in this surpassing yet most artless style, as if her
 whole soul would go out to Him.</P>

 <A NAME="Lu7_39"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>39. the Pharisee</B>--who had formed no definite opinion of our Lord,
 and invited Him apparently to obtain materials for a judgment.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>spake within himself,</B> &c.--"Ha! I have Him now; He plainly knows
 nothing of the person He allows to touch Him; and so, He can be no
 prophet." Not so fast, Simon; thou hast not seen through thy Guest yet,
 but He hath seen through thee.</P>

 <A NAME="Lu7_40"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>40-43.</B> Like Nathan with David, our Lord conceals His home thrust under
 the veil of a parable, and makes His host himself pronounce upon the
 case. The two debtors are the woman and Simon; the criminality of the
 one was <I>ten times</I> that of the other (in the proportion of "five
 hundred" to "fifty"); but both being equally insolvent, both are with
 equal frankness forgiven; and Simon is made to own that the greatest
 debtor to forgiving mercy will cling to her Divine Benefactor with the
 deepest gratitude. Does our Lord then admit that Simon was a forgiving
 man? Let us see.</P>

 <A NAME="Lu7_41"> </A>

 <A NAME="Lu7_43"> </A>

 <A NAME="Lu7_44"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>44-47. I entered .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no water</B>--a compliment to guests. Was this "much
 love?" Was it <I>any?</I></P>

 <A NAME="Lu7_45"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>45. no kiss</B>--of salutation. How much love was here? <I>Any at all?</I></P>

 <A NAME="Lu7_46"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>46. with oil .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not anoint</B>--even common <I>olive oil</I> in contrast
 with the woman's "ointment" or <I>aromatic balsam.</I> What evidence was
 thus afforded of any feeling which forgiveness prompts? Our Lord speaks
 this with delicate politeness, as if <I>hurt</I> at these inattentions of
 His host, which though not <I>invariably</I> shown to guests, were the
 customary marks of studied respect and regard. The inference is
 plain--<I>only one of the debtors was really forgiven,</I> though in the
 first instance, to give room for the play of withheld feelings, the
 forgiveness of both is supposed in the parable.</P>

 <A NAME="Lu7_47"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>47. Her sins which are many</B>--"Those many sins of hers," our Lord, who
 admitted how much more she owed than the Pharisee, now proclaims in
 naked terms the forgiveness of her guilt.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for</B>--not <I>because,</I> as if love were the cause of forgiveness, but
 "inasmuch as," or "in proof of which." The latter clause of the verse,
 and the whole structure of the parable, plainly show this to be the
 meaning.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>little forgiven .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. loveth little</B>--delicately ironical intimation of
 <I>no love</I> and <I>no forgiveness</I> in the present case.</P>

 <A NAME="Lu7_48"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>48. said unto her,</B> &c.--an unsought assurance, usually springing up
 unexpected in the midst of active duty and warm affections, while often
 it flies from those who mope and are paralyzed for want of it.</P>

 <A NAME="Lu7_49"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>49, 50. they that sat .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Who is this,</B> &c.--No wonder they were
 startled to hear One who was reclining at the same couch, and partaking
 of the same hospitalities with themselves, assume the awful prerogative
 of "even forgiving sins." But so far from receding from this claim, or
 softening it down, our Lord only repeats it, with two precious
 additions: one, announcing what was the one secret of the "forgiveness"
 she had experienced, and which carried "salvation" in its bosom; the
 other, a glorious dismissal of her in that "peace" which she had already
 felt, but is now assured she has His full warrant to enjoy! This
 wonderful scene teaches two very weighty truths: (1)
 <I>Though there be degrees of guilt, insolvency, or inability to wipe out the
 dishonor done to God, is common to all sinners.</I> (2)
 <I>As Christ is the Great Creditor to whom all debt, whether great or small,
 contracted by sinners is owing, so to Him belongs the
 prerogative of forgiving it.</I> This latter truth is brought out in the
 structure and application of the present parable as it is nowhere else.
 Either then Jesus was a blaspheming deceiver, or He is God manifest in
 the flesh.</P>

 though he might be favorably disposed towards Him.  But what we know 
 not of him, and may fear he lacked, we are sure his wife possessed. 
 Healed either of "evil spirits" or of some one of the "infirmities" 
 here referred to--the ordinary diseases of humanity--she joins in the 
 Saviour's train of grateful, clinging followers. Of "Susanna," next 
 mentioned, we know nothing but the name, and that here only. But her 
 services on this memorable occasion have immortalized her name.

 of His people disdained not to be supported by them in the body. He was
 not ashamed to penetrate so far into the depths of poverty as to live
 upon the alms of love. He only fed others miraculously; for Himself, He
 lived upon the love of His people. He gave all things to men, His
 brethren, and received all things from them, enjoying thereby the pure
 blessing of love: which is then only perfect when it is at the same time
 both giving and receiving. Who could invent such things as these?

 But who can adequately translate those "strong cryings and tears?" 
 Methinks, as I steal by His side, I hear from Him these plaintive 
 sounds, "Lord, who hath believed Our report? I am come unto Mine own 
 and Mine own receive Me not; I am become a stranger unto My brethren, 
 an alien to My mother's children: Consider Mine enemies, for they are 
 many, and they hate Me with cruel hatred.  Arise, O Lord, let not man

 prayer this! Thanks to God, transfiguring manifestations are not quite
 strangers here. Ofttimes in the deepest depths, out of groanings which
 cannot be uttered, God's dear children are suddenly transported to a
 kind of heaven upon earth, and their soul is made as the chariots of
 Amminadab. Their prayers fetch down such light, strength, holy
 gladness, as make their face to shine, putting a kind of celestial
 radiance upon it

 What now may be gathered from this statement? (1) <I>That a dying 
 Messiah is the great article of the true Jewish theology.</I> For a 
 long time the Church had fallen clean away from the faith of this 
 article, and even from a preparedness to receive it. But here we have 
 that jewel raked out of the dunghill of Jewish traditions, and by the 
 true representatives of the Church of old made the one subject of talk 
 with Christ Himself. (2) <I>The adoring gratitude of glorified men for 
 His undertaking to accomplish such a decease; their felt dependence 
 upon it for the glory in which they appeared; their profound interest 
 in the progress of it, their humble solaces and encouragements to go 
 through with it; and their sense of its peerless and overwhelming 
 glory.</I> "Go, matchless, adored One, a Lamb to the slaughter! 
 rejected of men, but chosen of God and precious; dishonored, abhorred, 
 and soon to be slain by men, but worshipped by cherubim, ready to be 
 greeted by all heaven. In virtue of that decease we are here; our all 
 is suspended on it and wrapped up in it. Thine every step is watched by 
 us with ineffable interest; and though it were too high an honor to us 
 to be permitted to drop a word of cheer into that precious but now 
 clouded spirit, yet, as the first-fruits of harvest; the very joy set 
 before Him, we cannot choose but tell Him that what is the depth of 
 shame to Him is covered with glory in the eyes of Heaven, that the 
 Cross to Him is the Crown to us, that that 'decease' is all our 
 salvation and all our desire." And who can doubt that such a scene 
 <I>did</I> minister deep cheer to that spirit?  It is said they 
 "talked" not <I>to Him,</I> but "<I>with Him</I>"; and if they told 
 <I>Him</I> how glorious His decease was, might He not fitly reply, "I 
 know it, but your voice, as messengers from heaven come down to tell it 
 Me, is music in Mine ears."</P>

 <B>49, 50. John answered,</B> &c.--The link of connection here with the
 foregoing context lies in the words "in My name" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:48">Lu 9:48</A>).

 "Oh, as to that," said John, young, warm, but not sufficiently 
 apprehending Christ's teaching in these things, "we saw one casting out 
 devils in Thy name, and we forbade him: Were we wrong?" "Ye were 
 wrong." "But we did because he followeth not us,'" "No matter. For (1) 
 There is no man which shall do a miracle in My name that can lightly 
 [soon] speak evil of Me'

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:39">Mr 9:39</A>].

 And (2) If such a person cannot be supposed to be '<I>against</I> us,'
 you are to consider him '<I>for</I> us.'" Two principles of immense 
 importance. Christ does not say this man should <I>not</I> have 
 followed "with them," but simply teaches how he was to be regarded 
 <I>though he did not</I>--as a reverer of His name and a promoter of 
 His cause. Surely this condemns not only those horrible attempts <I>by 
 force</I> to shut up all within one visible pale of discipleship, which 
 have deluged Christendom with blood in Christ's name, but the same 
 spirit in its milder form of proud ecclesiastic scowl upon all who 
 "after the form which they call <I>a sect</I> (as the word signifies,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:14">Ac 24:14</A>),

 on the nice shade of sense indicated by the <I>imperfect tense</I> in the
 original, it should be brought out in the translation: "I was beholding
 Satan as lightning falling from heaven"; that is, "I followed you on
 your mission, and watched its triumphs; while you were wondering at the
 subjection to you of devils in My name, a grander spectacle
 <I>was opening</I> to My view; sudden as the darting of lightning from
 heaven to earth, lo! Satan was beheld falling from heaven!" How
 remarkable is this, that by that law of association which connects a
 part with the whole, those feeble triumphs of the Seventy seem to have
 not only brought vividly before the Redeemer the whole ultimate result
 of His mission, but compressed it into a moment and quickened it into
 the rapidity of lightning! <I>Note.</I>--The word rendered "<I>devils,</I>"
 is always used for those spiritual agents employed in
 <I>demoniacal possessions</I>--never for the ordinary agency of Satan in
 rational men. When therefore the Seventy say, "the <I>devils</I> [demons]
 are subject to us," and Jesus replies, "Mine eye was beholding
 <I>Satan falling,</I>" it is plain that He meant to raise their minds not
 only from the <I>particular</I> to the <I>general,</I> but from a very
 <I>temporary</I> form of satanic operation to <I>the entire kingdom of evil.</I>

 but (1) There we are merely told that He "answered and said" thus; 
 here, He "<I>rejoiced in spirit</I> and said," &c. (2) There it was 
 merely "at that time" (or season) that He spoke thus, meaning with a 
 general reference to the rejection of His gospel by the 
 self-sufficient; here, "<I>In that hour</I> Jesus said," with express 
 reference probably to the humble class from which He had to draw the 
 Seventy, and the similar class that had chiefly welcomed their message. 
 "Rejoice" is too weak a word. It is "exulted in spirit"--evidently 
 giving visible expression to His unusual emotions; while, at the same 
 time, the words "in spirit" are meant to convey to the reader the 
 <I>depth</I> of them. This is one of those rare cases in which the veil 
 is lifted from off the Redeemer's inner man, that, angel-like, we may 
 "look into it" for a moment

 charity has not this opened up in the human spirit--rivers in the
 wilderness, streams in the desert! What noble Christian institutions
 have not such words founded, all undreamed of till that wondrous One
 came to bless this heartless world of ours with His incomparable
 love--first in words, and then in deeds which have translated His words
 into flesh and blood, and poured the life of them through that humanity
 which He made His own! Was this parable, now, designed to magnify the
 law of love, and to show who fulfils it and who not? And who did this as
 never man did it, as our Brother Man, "our Neighbor?" The priests and
 Levites had not strengthened the diseased, nor bound up the broken

 neither loving nor dreading the world, anticipating awful wrenches of 
 the dearest ties in life, but looking forward, as I do, to the

 that he drew after him a multitude of followers, who on his being slain 
 were all dispersed.  About this time that party would be at its height,

 that would be "mingling their blood with their sacrifices" [G<FONT

 draw out His views of such, and whether it was not a judgment of 
 Heaven, He simply points them to the practical view of the matter: 
 "These men are not signal examples of divine vengeance, as ye suppose; 
 but every impenitent sinner--<I>ye yourselves,</I> except ye 
 repent--shall be like monuments of the judgment of Heaven, and in a

 sheep-My-piece," &c. In this sublime sense it is "joy," <I>before</I> 
 "<I>or in the presence</I> of the angels"; they only "catch the flying 
 joy," sharing it <I>with Him!</I> The application of this to the 
 reception of those publicans and sinners that stood around our Lord is 
 grand in the extreme: "Ye turn from these lost ones with disdain, and 
 because I do not the same, ye murmur at it: but a very different 
 feeling is cherished in heaven. There, the recovery of even one such 
 outcast is watched with interest and hailed with joy; nor are they left 
 to come home of themselves or perish; for lo! even now the great 
 Shepherd is going after His lost sheep, and the Owner is making 
 diligent search for the lost property; and He is finding it, too, and 
 bringing it back with joy, and all heaven is full of it." (Let the 
 reader mark what sublime claims Himself our Lord covertly puts in 
 here--as if in Him they beheld, all unknown to themselves, nothing less 
 than heaven in the habiliments of earth, the Great Shepherd above, 
 clothed in a garment of flesh, come "to seek and to save that which was 
 lost")!</P>

 special, exuberant joy over thee? Didst thou say, 'Lo, these many years
 do I serve thee?' In that saidst thou truly; but <I>just for that reason</I>
 do I not set the whole household a-rejoicing over thee. For thee is
 reserved <I>what is higher still</I>--a tranquil lifelong satisfaction in
 thee, as a true-hearted faithful son in thy father's house, nor of the
 inheritance reserved for thee is aught alienated by this festive and

 place in the family without one special sign of wonder and delight at
 the change? Would that have been <I>nature?</I> But <I>this</I> being the
 meaning of the festivity, it would for that very reason be <I>temporary.</I>
 In time, the dutifulness of even the younger son would become the
 <I>law</I> and not the <I>exception;</I> he too at length might venture to
 say, "Lo, these many years do I serve thee"; and of him the father would
 say, "Son, thou art ever with me." In that case, therefore, it would
 <I>not</I> be "meet that they should make merry and be glad." The lessons
 are obvious, but how beautiful! (1) The deeper sunk and the longer
 estranged any sinner is, the more exuberant is the joy which his
 recovery occasions. (2) Such joy is <I>not</I> the portion of those whose
 whole lives have been spent in the service of their Father in heaven.
 (3) Instead of grudging the want of this, they should deem it the
 highest testimony to their lifelong fidelity, that something better is
 reserved for them--the deep, abiding complacency of their Father in
 heaven.</P>

 the wrongs of His Church, so low will the hope of relief sink, through
 the length of the delay, that one will be fain to ask, Will He find any
 faith of a coming avenger left on the earth? From this we learn: (1)
 That the <I>primary</I> and <I>historical</I> reference of this parable is to
 the Church in its <I>widowed,</I> desolate, oppressed, defenseless
 condition during the present absence of her Lord in the heavens; (2)
 That in these circumstances importunate, persevering prayer for
 deliverance is the Church's fitting exercise; (3) That notwithstanding
 every encouragement to this, so long will the answer be delayed, while
 the need of relief continues the same, and all hope of deliverance will
 have nearly died out, and "faith" of Christ's coming scarcely to be
 found. But the application of the parable to <I>prayer in general</I> is so
 obvious as to have nearly hidden its more direct reference, and so
 precious that one cannot allow it to disappear in any public and
 historical interpretation.</P>

 <B>God,</B> &c.--To have been kept from gross iniquities was undoubtedly a
 just cause of thankfulness to God; but instead of the devoutly humble,
 admiring frame which this should inspire, the Pharisee arrogantly severs
 himself from the rest of mankind, as quite above them, and, with a
 contemptuous look at the poor publican, thanks God that he has not to
 stand afar off like him, to hang down his head like a bulrush and beat
 his breast like him. But these are only his <I>moral</I> excellencies. His
 <I>religious</I> merits complete his grounds for congratulation. Not

 What words are these from the lips of Christ! The price of them is
 above rubies. But the <I>reason</I> assigned, "F<FONT SIZE=-1>OR OF

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:14">Mt 19:14</A>,

 It is surely not to be conceived that all our Lord meant was to inform
 us, that seeing <I>grown people</I> must become childlike in order to 
 be capable of the Kingdom of God, therefore they should not hinder 
 <I>infants</I> from coming to Him, and therefore He took up and blessed 
 <I>the infants themselves.</I> Was it not just the grave mistake of the 
 disciples that infants should not be brought to Christ, because only 
 grown people could profit by Him, which "much displeased" our Lord? And 
 though He took the irresistible opportunity of lowering their pride of 
 reason, by informing them that, in order to enter the Kingdom, 
 "<I>instead of the children first becoming like them, they must 
 themselves become like the children</I>" [R<FONT SIZE=-1>ICHTER</FONT> 
 in S<FONT SIZE=-1>TIER</FONT>], this was but by the way; and, returning 
 to the <I>children themselves,</I> He took them up in His gracious 
 arms, put His hands upon them and blessed them, for no conceivable 
 reason but to show that <I>they were thereby made capable,</I> <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>AS INFANTS</FONT>, <I>of the Kingdom of God.</I> And if so, 
 then "<I>Can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized 
 which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:47">Ac 10:47</A>).

 But such application of the baptismal water can have no warrant here, 
 save where the infants have been <I>previously brought to Christ 
 Himself</I> for His benediction, and only as the <I>sign and seal</I> 
 of that benediction.</P>

 This case presents some remarkable points. (1) The man was of
 irreproachable moral character; and this amidst all the temptations of
 <I>youth,</I> for he was a "young man" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:22">Mt 19:22</A>),

 and <I>wealth,</I> for "he was very rich"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:23,Mk+10:22">Lu 18:23;
 Mr 10:22</A>). 

 (2) But restless notwithstanding, his heart craves eternal life. (3)
 Unlike the "rulers," to whose class he belonged

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:18">Lu 18:18</A>),

 he so far believed in Jesus as to be persuaded He could authoritatively 
 direct him on this vital point. (4) So earnest is he that he comes 
 "running" and even "kneeling before Him," and that when He was gone 
 forth <I>into the war</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:17">Mr 10:17</A>)

 --the high-road, by this time crowded with travellers to the passover;
 undeterred by the virulent opposition of the class he belonged to as a 
 "ruler" and by the shame he might be expected to feel at broaching such 
 a question in the hearing of a crowd and on the open road.</P>

 <A NAME="Lu18_19"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>19. Why,</B> &c.--Did our Lord mean then to teach that God only ought
 to be called "good?" Impossible, for that had been to contradict all
 Scripture teaching, and His own, too 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:5,Mt+25:21,Tit+1:8">Ps 112:5;
 Mt 25:21; 
 Tit 1:8</A>).

 Unless therefore we are to ascribe captiousness to our Lord, He could
 have had but one object--<I>to raise the youth's ideas of Himself,</I> 
 as not to be classed merely with other "good masters," and declining to 
 receive this title <I>apart from</I> the "One" who is essentially and 
 only "good." This indeed is but distantly hinted; but unless this is 
 seen in <I>the background</I> of our Lord's words, nothing worthy of 
 Him can be made out of them. (Hence, <I>Socinianism,</I> instead of 
 having any support here, is only baffled by it).</P>

 <A NAME="Lu18_20"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>20. Thou knowest,</B> &c.--Matthew 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:17">Mt 19:17</A>)

 is more complete here: "but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the 
 commandments. He saith unto him, Which--as if he had said, Point me out 
 one of them which I have not kept?--"Jesus said, Thou shalt," &c.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:17,18">Mt 19:17, 18</A>).

 Our Lord purposely confines Himself to the <I>second</I> table, which 
 He would consider easy to keep, enumerating them all--for in Mark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:19">Mr 10:19</A>),
 
 "Defraud not" stands for the <I>tenth</I> (else the eighth is twice
 repeated). In Matthew

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:19">Mt 19:19</A>)

 the <I>sum</I> of this second table of the law is added, "Thou shalt 
 love thy neighbor as thyself," as if to see if he would venture to say 
 he had kept <I>that.</I></P>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:20">Mt 19:20</A>).
 
 Ah! this gives us a glimpse of his heart. Doubtless he was perfectly
 sincere; but something within whispered to him that <I>his</I> keeping of
 the commandments was <I>too easy</I> a way of getting to heaven. He felt
 something beyond this to be necessary; after keeping all the
 commandments he was at a loss to know what that could be; and he came to
 Jesus just upon that point. "Then," says Mark 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:21">Mr 10:21</A>),

 "Jesus beholding him loved him," or "looked lovingly upon him." His
 sincerity, frankness, and nearness to the kingdom of God, in themselves 
 most winning qualities, won our Lord's regard even though he turned his 
 back upon Him--a lesson to those who can see nothing lovable save in 
 the regenerate.</P>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>sell,</B> &c.--As riches were his idol, our Lord, who knew if from the
 first, lays His great authoritative grasp at once upon it, saying, "Now
 give Me up that, and all is right." No general direction about the
 disposal of riches, then, is here given, save that we are to sit loose
 to them and lay them at the feet of Him who gave them. He who does this
 with all he has, whether rich or poor, is a true heir of the kingdom of
 heaven.</P>

 more fully, "<I>went away</I> sorrowful"; Mark still more, "was sad" or 
 "sullen" at that saying, and "went away grieved." Sorry he was, very 
 sorry, to part with Christ; but to part with his riches would have cost 
 him a pang more. When Riches or Heaven, on Christ's terms, were the 
 alternative, the result showed to which side the balance inclined. Thus 
 was he shown to lack the one all-comprehensive requirement of the 
 law--the <I>absolute subjection of the heart to God,</I> and this want

 <I>reconstruction of all human relationships and affections on a 
 Christian basis and in a Christian state, after being sacrificed, in 
 their natural form, on the altar of love to Christ.</I> This He calls 
 "manifold more"--"an hundredfold more"--than what they sacrificed. Our 
 Lord was Himself the first to exemplify this <I>new adjustment of His

 Christ.  But in Matthew

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:28">Mt 19:28</A>)

 this is prefaced by a special promise to <I>the Twelve:</I> "Verily I
 say unto you, That ye which have followed Me in the Regeneration, when 
 the Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit 
 on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel." Ye who have now 
 adhered to Me shall, in the new kingdom, rule, or give law to, the 
 great Christian world, here set forth in Jewish dress as the twelve 
 tribes, presided over by the twelve apostles on so many judicial 
 thrones. In this sense certainly the promise has been illustriously 
 fulfilled [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>, G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT>,

 P<FONT SIZE=-1>ARABLE OF THE</FONT>
 P<FONT SIZE=-1>OUNDS.</FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 A different parable from that of the Talents 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:14-30">Mt 25:14-30</A>).

 For, (1) This parable was spoken "when He was <I>nigh</I> to Jerusalem"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:11">Lu 19:11</A>);

 that one, some days after entering it, and from the Mount of Olives. 
 (2) This parable was spoken to the promiscuous crowd; that, to the 
 Twelve alone. Accordingly, (3) Besides the "servants" in this parable, 
 who profess subjection to Him, there is a class of "citizens" who 
 refuse to own Him, and who are treated differently, whereas in the 
 parable of the talents, spoken to the <I>former</I> class alone, this 
 latter class is omitted. (4) In the Talents, each servant receives a 
 different number of them (five, two, one); in the Pounds all receive 
 the same one pound, which is but about the sixtieth part of a talent; 
 also, in the talents, each shows the same fidelity by doubling what he 
 received (the five are made ten; the two, four); in the Pounds, each 
 receiving the same, render a <I>different</I> return (one making his 
 pound ten, another five). Plainly, therefore, the intended lesson is 
 different; the one illustrating <I>equal fidelity with different 
 degrees of advantage;</I> the other, <I>different degrees of 
 improvement of the same opportunities;</I> yet with all this 
 difference, the parables are remarkably similar.</P>

 went to Rome and was there made king; a striking expression of what our
 Lord went away for and received, "sitting down at the right hand of the
 Majesty on high."

 Matthew adds the following

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:12">Mt 24:12</A>):

 "And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many," the many or, the 
 most--the generality of professed disciples--"shall wax cold." But he 
 that endureth to the end shall be saved. Sad illustrations of the 
 effect of abounding iniquity in cooling the love of faithful disciples 
 we have in the <I>Epistle of James,</I> written about this period 
 referred to, and too frequently ever since

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:38,39,Re+2:10">Heb 10:38, 39;

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:14">Mt 24:14</A>).

 God never sends judgment without previous warning; and there can be no 
 doubt that the Jews, already dispersed over most known countries, had 
 nearly all heard the Gospel "as a witness," before the end of the 
 Jewish state. The same principle was repeated and will repeat itself to 
 <I>the</I> end.</P>

 says, "And then shall appear <I>the sign</I> of the Son of man in 
 heaven," evidently something distinct from Himself, mentioned 
 immediately after.  What this was intended to mean, interpreters are 
 not agreed. But as before Christ came to destroy Jerusalem, some 
 appalling portents were seen in the air, so before His personal

 entrusting him with "the bag"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:6">Joh 12:6</A>),

 as treasurer to Himself and the Twelve. (2) In the discharge of that
 most sacred trust he became "a thief," appropriating its contents from 
 time to time to his own use. Satan, seeing this door into his heart 
 standing wide open, determines to enter by it, but cautiously

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:11">2Co 2:11</A>);

 first merely "<I>putting it into his heart to betray Him</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:2">Joh 13:2</A>),

 suggesting the thought to him that by this means he might enrich 
 himself. (3) This thought was probably converted into a settled purpose 
 by what took place in Simon's house at Bethany. (See

 (4) Starting back, perhaps, or mercifully held back, for some time, the
 determination to carry it into immediate effect was not consummated 
 till, sitting at the paschal supper, "<I>Satan entered into him</I>" 
 (see on

 <B>40. the place</B>--the Garden of Gethsemane, on the west or city side of
 the mount. Comparing all the accounts of this mysterious scene, the
 facts appear to be these: (1) He bade nine of the Twelve remain "here"
 while He went and prayed "yonder." (2) He "took the other three, Peter,
 James, and John, and began to be sore amazed [appalled], sorrowful, and
 very heavy [oppressed], and said, My soul is exceeding sorrowful even
 unto death"--"I feel as if nature would sink under this load, as if life
 were ebbing out, and death coming before its time"--"tarry ye here, and
 watch with Me"; not, "Witness for Me," but, "Bear Me company." It did
 Him good, it seems, to have them beside Him. (3) But soon even they were
 too much for Him: He must be alone. "He was withdrawn from them about a
 stone's-cast"--though near enough for them to be competent witnesses and
 kneeled down, uttering that most affecting prayer 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:36">Mr 14:36</A>),

 that if possible "the cup," of His approaching <I>death,</I> "might
 pass from Him, but if not, His Father's will be done": implying that 
 <I>in itself</I> it was so purely revolting that only its being the 
 Father's will would induce Him to taste it, but that <I>in that 
 view</I> of it He was perfectly prepared to drink it. It is no struggle 
 between a reluctant and a compliant will, but between two views of one 
 event--an <I>abstract</I> and a <I>relative</I> view of it, in the one 
 of which it was <I>revolting,</I> in the other <I>welcome.</I> By 
 signifying how it felt in the <I>one</I> view, He shows His beautiful 
 oneness with ourselves in nature and feeling; by expressing how He 
 regarded it in the other light, He reveals His absolute obediential 
 subjection to His Father. (4) On this, having a momentary relief, for 
 it came upon Him, we imagine, by surges, He returns to the three, and 
 finding them sleeping, He addresses them affectingly, particularly 
 <I>Peter,</I> as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:37,38">Mr 14:37, 38</A>.

 He then (5) goes back, not now to kneel, but fell on His face on the
 ground, saying the same words, but with this turn, "If this cup <I>may 
 not pass,</I>" &c.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:42">Mt 26:42</A>)

 --that is, 'Yes, I understand this mysterious silence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:1-6">Ps 22:1-6</A>);

 it may not pass; I am to drink it, and I will'--"Thy will be done!" (6) 
 Again, for a moment relieved, He returns and finds them "sleeping for 
 sorrow," warns them as before, but puts a loving construction upon it, 
 separating between the "willing spirit" and the "weak flesh." (7) Once 
 more, returning to His solitary spot, the surges rise higher, beat more 
 tempestuously, and seem ready to overwhelm Him. To fortify Him for 
 this, "there appeared an angel unto Him from heaven strengthening 
 Him"--not to minister light or comfort (He was to have none of that, 
 and they were not needed nor fitted to convey it), but purely to 
 sustain and brace up sinking nature for a yet hotter and fiercer 
 struggle. And now, He is "in an agony, and prays more earnestly"--even 
 Christ's prayer, it seems, admitted of and now demanded such 
 increase--"and His sweat was as it were great drops [literally, 
 'clots'] of blood falling down to the ground." What was this?  <I>Not 
 His proper sacrificial offering,</I> though essential to it. It was 
 just the internal struggle, apparently hushing itself before, but now 
 swelling up again, convulsing His whole inner man, and this so 
 affecting His animal nature that the sweat oozed out from every pore in 
 thick drops of blood, falling to the ground. It was just <I>shuddering 
 nature</I> and <I>indomitable will</I> struggling together. But again 
 the cry, If it must be, <I>Thy will be done,</I> issues from His lips, 
 and all is over.  "The bitterness of death is past." He has anticipated 
 and rehearsed His final conflict, and won the victory--now on the 
 theater of an <I>invincible will,</I> as then on the arena of the 
 Cross. "I <I>will</I> suffer," is the grand result of Gethsemane: "It 
 is finished" is the shout that bursts from the Cross. The Will without 
 the Deed had been all in vain; but His work was consummated when He 
 carried the now manifested Will into the palpable Deed, "<I>by the 
 which</I> <FONT SIZE=-1>WILL</FONT> <I>we are sanctified</I> <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>THROUGH THE OFFERING OF THE BODY OF</FONT> J<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ESUS</FONT> C<FONT SIZE=-1>HRIST ONCE FOR ALL</FONT>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:10">Heb 10:10</A>).

 (8) At the close of the whole scene, finding them still sleeping (worn 
 out with continued sorrow and racking anxiety), He bids them, with an 
 irony of deep emotion, "sleep on now and take their rest, the hour is 
 come, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners, rise, let 
 us be going, the traitor is at hand." And while He spoke, Judas 
 approached with his armed band. Thus they proved "miserable 
 comforters," broken reeds; and thus in His whole work He was 
 <I>alone,</I> and "of the people there was none with Him."</P>

 told His enemies. In this defense then there seems more than meets the
 eye. "He made Himself the promised Messiah, the Son of God; but in this
 He 'did nothing amiss'; He ate with publicans and sinners, and bade all
 the weary and heavy laden come and rest under His wing; but in this He
 'did nothing amiss': He claimed to be Lord of the Kingdom of God, to
 shut it at will, but also to open it at pleasure even to such as we are;
 but in this He 'did nothing amiss!'" Does His next speech imply <I>less</I>
 than this? Observe: (1) His frank confession and genuine
 self-condemnation. (2) His astonishment and horror at the very different
 state of his fellow's mind. (3) His anxiety to bring him to a better

 sees in Christ the absolute right to dispose of that kingdom to whom He
 pleased. (4) He does not presume to <I>ask</I> a place in that kingdom,
 though that is what he means, but with a humility quite affecting, just
 says, "Lord, <I>remember me</I> when," &c. Yet was there mighty faith in
 that word. If Christ will but "think upon him" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:19">Ne 5:19</A>),

 at that august moment when He "cometh into His kingdom," it will do. 
 "Only assure me that then Thou wilt not forget such a wretch as I, that 
 once hung by Thy side, and I am content." Now contrast with this bright 
 act of faith the darkness even of the apostles' minds, who could hardly 
 be got to believe that their Master would die at all, who now were 
 almost despairing of Him, and who when dead had almost buried their 
 hopes in His grave. Consider, too, the man's previous 
 <I>disadvantages</I> and <I>bad life.</I> And then mark how his faith 
 comes out--not in protestations, "Lord, I cannot doubt, I am firmly 
 persuaded that Thou art Lord of a kingdom, that death cannot disannul 
 Thy title nor impede the assumption of it in due time," &c.--but as 
 having no shadow of doubt, and rising above it as a question 
 altogether, he just says, "Lord, remember me <I>when</I> Thou comest," 
 &c. Was ever faith like this exhibited upon earth? It looks as if the 
 brightest crown had been reserved for the Saviour's head at His darkest 
 moment!</P>
