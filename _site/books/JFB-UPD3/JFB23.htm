 I<FONT SIZE=-1>SAIAH,</FONT> son of Amoz (not Amos); contemporary of Jonah, Amos, Hosea,
 in Israel, but younger than they; and of Micah, in Judah. His call to a
 higher degree of the prophetic office 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:1-13">Isa 6:1-13</A>)

 is assigned to the last year of Uzziah, that is, 754 <FONT
 SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT> The first through fifth chapters belong to the 
 closing years of that reign; not, as some think, to Jotham's reign: in 
 the reign of the latter he seems to have exercised his office only 
 orally, and not to have left any <I>record</I> of his prophecies 
 because they were not intended for all ages. The first through fifth 
 and sixth chapters are all that was designed for the Church universal 
 of the prophecies of the first twenty years of his office. New 
 historical epochs, such as occurred in the reigns of Ahaz and Hezekiah, 
 when the affairs of Israel became interwoven with those of the Asiatic 
 empires, are marked by prophetic writings. The prophets had now to 
 interpret the judgments of the Lord, so as to make the people conscious 
 of His punitive justice, as also of His mercy.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:1-10:4">Isa 7:1-10:4</A>

 belong to the reign of Ahaz. The thirty-sixth through thirty-ninth 
 chapters are historical, reaching to the fifteenth year of Hezekiah;
 probably the tenth through twelfth chapters and all from the thirteenth
 through twenty-sixth chapters, inclusive, belong to the same reign; the
 historical section being appended to facilitate the right understanding
 of these prophecies; thus we have Isaiah's office extending from about
 760 to 713 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, forty-seven years. Tradition
 (<I>Talmud</I>) represents him as having been sawn asunder by Manasseh
 with a wooden saw, for having said that he had seen Jehovah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:20,2Ki+21:16,Heb+11:37">Ex 33:20;
 2Ki 21:16; 
 Heb 11:37</A>).

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:32">2Ch 32:32</A>

 seems to imply that Isaiah survived Hezekiah; but "first and last" is 
 not added, as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+26:22">2Ch 26:22</A>,

 which makes it possible that his history of Hezekiah was only carried 
 up to a certain point. The second part, the fortieth through 
 sixty-sixth chapters, containing complaints of gross idolatry, needs 
 not to be restricted to Manasseh's reign, but is applicable to previous 
 reigns. At the accession of Manasseh, Isaiah would be eighty-four; and 
 if he prophesied for eight years afterwards, he must have endured 
 martyrdom at ninety-two; so Hosea prophesied for sixty years. And 
 Eastern tradition reports that he lived to one hundred and twenty. The 
 conclusive argument against the tradition is that, according to the 
 inscription, all Isaiah's prophecies are included in the time from
 Uzziah to Hezekiah; and the internal evidence accords with this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 His W<FONT SIZE=-1>IFE</FONT>
 is called the <I>prophetess</I> 

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:3">Isa 8:3</A>],

 that is, endowed, as Miriam, with a prophetic gift.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 His C<FONT SIZE=-1>HILDREN</FONT>
 were considered by him as not belonging merely to
 himself; in their names, Shearjashub, "the remnant shall return"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:3">Isa 7:3</A>,

 <I>Margin</I>], and Maher-shalal-hash-baz, "speeding to the spoil, he 
 hasteth to the prey"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:1">Isa 8:1</A>,

 <I>Margin</I>], the two chief points of his prophecies are intimated to 
 the people, the <I>judgments</I> of the Lord on the people and the 
 world, and yet His <I>mercy</I> to the elect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 His G<FONT SIZE=-1>ARMENT</FONT>
 of sackcloth 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+20:2">Isa 20:2</A>),

 too, was a silent preaching by fact; he appears as the embodiment of 
 that repentance which he taught.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 His
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ISTORICAL</FONT>
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>ORKS.</FONT>--History, as written by the prophets, is
 retroverted prophecy. As the past and future alike proceed from the
 essence of God, an inspired insight into the past implies an insight
 into the future, and vice versa. Hence most of the Old Testament
 histories are written by prophets and are classed with their writings;
 the Chronicles being not so classed, cannot have been written by them,
 but are taken from historical monographs of theirs; for example,
 Isaiah's life of Uzziah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+26:22">2Ch 26:22</A>;
 
 also of Hezekiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:32">2Ch 32:32</A>;

 of these latter all that was important for all ages has been preserved 
 to us, while the rest, which was local and temporary, has been 
 lost.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The I<FONT SIZE=-1>NSCRIPTION</FONT>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:1">Isa 1:1</A>)

 applies to the whole book and implies that Isaiah is the author of the 
 second part (the fortieth through sixty-sixth chapters), as well as of 
 the first. Nor do the words, "concerning Judah and Jerusalem"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:1">Isa 1:1</A>],

 oppose the idea that the inscription applies to the whole; for whatever 
 he says against other nations, he says on account of their relation to 
 Judah. So the inscription of Amos, "concerning <I>Israel</I>"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+1:1">Am 1:1</A>],

 though several prophecies follow against foreign nations. E<FONT
 SIZE=-1>WALD</FONT> maintains that the fortieth through sixty-sixth 
 chapters, though spurious, were subjoined to the previous portion, in 
 order to preserve the former. But it is untrue that the first portion 
 is unconnected with those chapters. The former ends with the Babylonian 
 exile

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+39:6">Isa 39:6</A>),

 the latter begins with the coming redemption from it. The portion, the 
 fortieth through forty-sixth chapters, has no heading of its own, a 
 proof that it is closely connected with what precedes, and falls under 
 the general heading in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:1">Isa 1:1</A>.

 J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT> (<I>The Antiquities of the Jews,</I> 11. 
 1, sec. 1, 2) says that Cyrus was induced by the prophecies of Isaiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:28,45:1,13">Isa 44:28; 45:1, 13</A>)

 to aid the Jews in returning and rebuilding the temple

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:1-11">Ezr 1:1-11</A>

 confirms this; Cyrus in his edict there plainly refers to the
 prophecies in the second portion, which assign the kingdoms to him from 
 Jehovah, and the duty of rebuilding the temple. Probably he took from 
 them his historical name Cyrus (<I>Coresh</I>). Moreover, <I>subsequent 
 prophets imitate this second portion,</I> which E<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>WALD</FONT> assigns to later times; for example, compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:1-51:64">Jer 50:1-51:64</A>

 with Isaiah's predictions against Babylon

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Is+13:1-14:23">Is 13:1-14:23</A>].

 "The Holy One of Israel," occurring but three times elsewhere in the 
 Old Testament

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+19:22,Ps+78:41,89:18,Jer+50:29,51:5">2Ki 19:22;
 Ps 78:41; 89:18; 
 Jer 50:29; 51:5</A>], 

 is a favorite expression in the second, as in the first portion of
 Isaiah: it expresses God's covenant faithfulness in fulfilling the
 promises therein: Jeremiah borrows the expression from him. Also
 
 <U>Ecclesiasticus 48:22-25</U> 
 
 ("comforted"), quotes

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:1">Isa 40:1</A>
 
 as Isaiah's. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:17">Lu 4:17</A>
 
 quotes

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:1,2">Isa 61:1, 2</A>

 as Isaiah's, and as read as such by Jesus Christ in the synagogue.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The D<FONT SIZE=-1>EFINITENESS</FONT> of the prophecies is striking: As
 in the second portion of isaiah, so in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:8-10">Mic 4:8-10</A>,

 the <I>Babylonian</I> exile, and the deliverance from it, are foretold
 a hundred fifty years before any hostilities had arisen between Babylon 
 and Judah. On the other hand, all the prophets who foretell the 
 <I>Assyrian</I> invasion coincide in stating, that Judah should be 
 delivered from <I>it,</I> not by Egyptian aid, but directly by the 
 Lord. Again Jeremiah, in the height of the Chaldean prosperity, 
 foretold its conquest by the Medes, who should enter Babylon through 
 the dry bed of the Euphrates on a night of general revelry. No human 
 calculation could have discovered these facts. E<FONT
 SIZE=-1>ICHORN</FONT> terms these prophecies "veiled historical 
 descriptions," recognizing in spite of himself that they are more than 
 general poetical fancies. The fifty-third chapter of Isaiah was 
 certainly written ages before the Messiah, yet it <I>minutely</I> 
 portrays His sufferings: these cannot be Jewish inventions, for the 
 Jews looked for a <I>reigning,</I> not a suffering, Messiah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Rationalists are so far right that
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT>
 P<FONT SIZE=-1>ROPHECIES</FONT>
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>RE ON A</FONT>
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>ENERAL</FONT>
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>ASIS</FONT>
 whereby they are distinguished from soothsaying. They rest on the
 essential idea of God. The prophets, penetrated by this inner knowledge
 of His character, became conscious of the eternal laws by which the
 world is governed: that sin is man's ruin, and must be followed by
 judgment, but that God's covenant mercy to His elect is unchangeable.
 Without prophetism, the elect remnant would have decreased, and even
 God's judgments would have missed their end, by not being recognized as
 such: they would have been unmeaning, isolated facts. Babylon was in
 Isaiah's days under Assyria; it had tried a revolt unsuccessfully: but
 the elements of its subsequent success and greatness were then
 existing. The Holy Ghost enlightened his natural powers to discern this
 its rise; and his spiritual faculties, to foresee its fall, the sure
 consequence, in God's eternal law, of the pride which pagan success
 generates--and also Judah's restoration, as the covenant-people, with
 whom God, according to His essential character, would not be wroth for
 ever. True conversion is the prophet's grand remedy against all evils:
 in this alone consists his politics. Rebuke, threatening, and promise,
 regularly succeed one another. The idea at the basis of all is in
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:7-9,Le+10:3,Am+3:2">Isa 26:7-9;
 Le 10:3;
 Am 3:2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The
 U<FONT SIZE=-1>SE OF THE</FONT>
 P<FONT SIZE=-1>RESENT AND</FONT>
 P<FONT SIZE=-1>RETERITE</FONT>
 in prophecy is no proof that
 the author is later than Isaiah. For <I>seers</I> view the future as
 present, and indicate what is <I>ideally</I> past, not really past; seeing
 things in the light of God, who "calls the things that are not as
 though they were." Moreover, as in looking from a height on a
 landscape, hills seem close together which are really wide apart, so,
 in events foretold, the <I>order, succession,</I> and <I>grouping</I> are
 presented, but the intervals of <I>time</I> are overlooked. The <I>time,</I> however, is sometimes marked 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:12,Da+9:26">Jer 25:12;
 Da 9:26</A>). 

 Thus the deliverance from Babylon, and that effected by Messiah, are in 
 rapid transition grouped together by
 <FONT SIZE=-1>THE</FONT>
 L<FONT SIZE=-1>AW OF</FONT>
 P<FONT SIZE=-1>ROPHETIC</FONT>
 S<FONT SIZE=-1>UGGESTION;</FONT> yet no
 prophet so confounds the two as to make Messiah the leader of Israel
 from Babylon. <I>To the prophet</I> there was probably no double sense; but
 to his spiritual eye the two events, though distinct, lay so near, and
 were <I>so analogous,</I> that he could not separate them in description
 without unfaithfulness to the picture presented before him. The more
 remote and antitypical event, however, namely, Messiah's coming, is that
 to which he always hastens, and which he describes with far more
 minuteness than he does the nearer type; for example, Cyrus (compare
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:1,53:1-12">Isa 45:1
 with Isa 53:1-12</A>).

 In some cases he takes his stand in the midst of events between, for
 example, the humiliation of Jesus Christ, which he views as 
 <I>past,</I> and His glorification, as <I>yet to come,</I> using the 
 future tense as to the latter (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:4-9,10-12">Isa 53:4-9
 with 53:10-12</A>).

 Marks of the time of events are given sparingly in the prophets: yet,
 as to Messiah, definitely enough to create the general expectation of 
 Him at the time that He was in fact born.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The C<FONT SIZE=-1>HALD&AElig;ISMS</FONT>
 alleged against the genuineness of the second
 portion of Isaiah, are found more in the first and undoubted portion.
 They occur in all the Old Testament, especially in the poetical parts,
 which prefer unusual expressions, and are due to the fact that the
 patriarchs were surrounded by Chaldee-speaking people; and in Isaiah's
 time a few Chaldee words had crept in from abroad.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 His S<FONT SIZE=-1>YMBOLS</FONT>
 are few and simple, and his poetical images correct; in
 the prophets, during and after the exile, the reverse holds good;
 Haggai and Malachi are not exceptions; for, though void of bold images,
 their style, unlike Isaiah's, rises little above prose: a clear proof
 that our Isaiah was long before the exile.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Of V<FONT SIZE=-1>ISIONS,</FONT>
 strictly so called, he has but one, that in the sixth
 chapter; even it is more simple than those in later prophets. But he
 often gives S<FONT SIZE=-1>IGNS,</FONT> that is, a present fact as pledge of the more
 distant future; God condescending to the feebleness of man

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:14,37:30,38:7">Isa 7:14; 37:30; 38:7</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The V<FONT SIZE=-1>ARIETIES IN</FONT>
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>IS</FONT>
 S<FONT SIZE=-1>TYLE</FONT>
 do not prove spuriousness, but that he
 varied his style with his subject. The second portion is not so much
 addressed to his contemporaries, as to the future people of the Lord,
 the elect remnant, purified by the previous judgments. Hence its
 tenderness of style, and frequent repetitions 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:1">Isa 40:1</A>):

 for comforting exhortation uses many words; so also the many epithets 
 added to the name of God, intended as stays whereon faith may rest for 
 comfort, so as not to despair. In both portions alike there are 
 peculiarities characteristic of Isaiah; for example, "to be called" 
 equivalent to <I>to be:</I> the repetition of the same words, instead 
 of synonyms, in the parallel members of verses; the interspersing of 
 his prophecies with hymns: "the remnant of olive trees," &c., for the 
 remnant of people who have escaped God's judgments. Also compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:25,Isa+11:6">Isa 65:25
 with Isa 11:6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The C<FONT SIZE=-1>HRONOLOGICAL</FONT> A<FONT SIZE=-1>RRANGEMENT</FONT>
 favors the opinion that Isaiah himself collected his prophecies into
 the volume; not Hezekiah's men, as the <I>Talmud</I> guesses from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:1">Pr 25:1</A>.

 All the portions, the dates of which can be ascertained, stand in the
 right place, except a few instances, where prophecies of similar
 contents are placed together: with the termination of the Assyrian 
 invasion (the thirty-sixth through thirty-ninth chapters) terminated 
 the public life of Isaiah. The second part is his prophetic legacy to 
 the small band of the faithful, analogous to the last speeches of Moses 
 and of Jesus Christ to His chosen disciples.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The E<FONT SIZE=-1>XPECTATION OF</FONT>
 M<FONT SIZE=-1>ESSIAH</FONT>
 is so strong in Isaiah, that J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT>
 <I>To Paulinus</I> calls his book not a prophecy, but the <I>gospel:</I> "He
 is not so much a prophet as an evangelist." Messiah was already shadowed
 forth in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10">Ge 49:10</A>,

 as the Shiloh, or <I>tranquillizer;</I> also in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1-12,45:1-17,72:1-20,110:1-7">Psalms 2, 45, 72, 110</A>.

 Isaiah brings it out more definitely; and, whereas they dwelt on His
 kingly office, Isaiah develops most His priestly and prophetic office;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:1-7">the hundred tenth Psalm</A>

 also had set forth His priesthood, but His <I>kingly</I> rather than,
 as Isaiah, His <I>suffering,</I> priesthood. The latter is especially
 dwelt on in the second part, addressed to <I>the faithful elect;</I> 
 whereas the first part, addressed to <I>the whole people,</I> dwells on 
 Messiah's <I>glory,</I> the antidote to the fears which then filled the 
 people, and the assurance that the kingdom of God, then represented by 
 Judah, would not be overwhelmed by the surrounding nations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 His S<FONT SIZE=-1>TYLE</FONT>
 (H<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGSTENBERG</FONT>,
 <I>Christology of the Old Testament,</I>) is
 simple and sublime; in imagery, intermediate between the poverty of
 Jeremiah and the exuberance of Ezekiel. He shows his command of it in
 varying it to suit his subject.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The F<FONT SIZE=-1>ORM</FONT>
 is mostly that of <I>Hebrew poetical parallelism,</I> with,
 however, a freedom unshackled by undue restrictions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 J<FONT SIZE=-1>UDAH,</FONT> the less apostate people, rather than 
 Israel, was the subject of his prophecies: his residence was mostly at 
 Jerusalem. On his praises, see 
 
 <U>Ecclesiasticus 48:22-25</U>.

 The rabbins say that when the lot used to be taken, a <I>scarlet</I> fillet
 was bound on the scapegoat's head, and after the high priest had
 confessed his and the people's sins over it, the fillet became
 <I>white:</I> the miracle ceased, according to them, forty years before the
 destruction of Jerusalem, that is, exactly when Jesus Christ was
 crucified; a remarkable admission of adversaries. <I>Hebrew</I> for
 "scarlet" radically means <I>double-dyed;</I> so the <I>deep-fixed permanency</I> of sin in the heart, which no mere tears can wash away.

 alone had trespass offerings appointed for them; greater guilt therefore
 needed a greater sacrifice, for, "without shedding of blood there was no

 promised and expected; therefore spiritual Jews must have looked for the

 Isaiah is outside, near the altar in front of the temple. The doors are
 supposed to open, and the veil hiding the Holy of Holies to be
 withdrawn, unfolding to his view a vision of God represented as an
 Eastern monarch, attended by seraphim as His ministers of state

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:19">1Ki 22:19</A>),

 and with a robe and flowing train (a badge of dignity in the East), 
 which filled the temple. This assertion that he had seen God was, 
 according to tradition (not sanctioned by 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:1">Isa 1:1</A>;

 office:

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:9">Isa 6:9</A>,

 according to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:41">Joh 12:41</A>.

 Isaiah could only have "seen" <I>the Son,</I> not the divine essence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:18">Joh 1:18</A>).
 
 The words in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:10">Isa 6:10</A>
 
 are attributed by Paul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:25,26">Ac 28:25, 26</A>)

 to the <I>Holy Ghost.</I> Thus the Trinity in unity is implied; as also 
 by the thrice "Holy"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:3">Isa 6:3</A>).

 Isaiah mentions the robes, temple, and seraphim, but not the form of 
 God Himself. Whatever it was, it was different from the usual Shekinah: 
 that was on the mercy seat, this on a throne; that a cloud and fire, of 
 this no form is specified: over that were the cherubim, over this the 
 seraphim; that had no clothing, this had a flowing robe and train.</P>

 <B>seraphim</B>--nowhere else applied to God's attendant angels; but to
 <I>the fiery flying</I> (not winged, but <I>rapidly moving</I>) serpents, which
 bit the Israelites 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:6">Nu 21:6</A>),

 called so from the poisonous <I>inflammation</I> caused by their bites. 
 <I>Seraph</I> is to burn; implying the <I>burning</I> zeal, dazzling 
 <I>brightness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:11,6:17,Eze+1:13,Mt+28:3">2Ki 2:11; 6:17;
 Eze 1:13; 
 Mt 28:3</A>) 

 and serpent-like <I>rapidity</I> of the seraphim in God's service.
 Perhaps Satan's form as a <I>serpent</I> (<I>nachash</I>) in his 
 appearance to man has some connection with his original form as a 
 seraph of light. The head of the serpent was the symbol of 
 <I>wisdom</I> in Egypt (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:8,2Ki+18:4">Nu 21:8;
 2Ki 18:4</A>). 

 The seraphim, with six wings and one face, can hardly be identified
 with the cherubim, which had four wings (in the temple only <I>two</I>)
 and four faces

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:5-12">Eze 1:5-12</A>).
 
 (But compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:8">Re 4:8</A>).

 The "face" and "feet" imply a human form; something of a serpentine
 form (perhaps a basilisk's head, as in the temples of Thebes) may have 
 been mixed with it: so the cherub was compounded of various animal 
 forms. However, seraph may come from a root meaning "princely," applied 
 in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:13">Da 10:13</A>

 to Michael [M<FONT SIZE=-1>AURER</FONT>]; just as cherub comes from a 
 root (changing <I>m</I> into <I>b</I>), meaning "noble."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>twain</B>--Two wings alone of the six were kept ready for instant flight
 in God's service; two veiled their faces as unworthy to look on the holy
 God, or pry into His secret counsels which they fulfilled

 two covered their feet, or rather the whole of the <I>lower parts</I>

 in token of reverence (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:11">Eze 1:11</A>,

 In the Assyrian inscriptions the name of Rezin, king of Damascus, is
 found among the tributaries of Tiglath-pileser, of whose reign the annals
 of seventeen years have been deciphered. For the historical facts in
 this chapter, compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:37-16:9">2Ki 15:37-16:9</A>.

 Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel, as confederates, advanced against 
 Jerusalem. In the first campaign they "smote Ahaz with a great 
 slaughter"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:5">2Ch 28:5</A>).

 Their object was probably to unite the three kingdoms against Assyria. 
 Egypt seems to have favored the plan, so as to interpose these 
 confederate kingdoms between her own frontier and Assyria (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:18">Isa 7:18</A>,
 
 "Egypt"; and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:4">2Ki 17:4</A>,

 Hoshea's league with Egypt). Rezin and Pekah may have perceived Ahaz' 
 inclination towards Assyria rather than towards their own confederacy; 
 this and the old feud between Israel and Judah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:16">1Ki 12:16</A>)

 occasioned their invasion of Judah. Ahaz, at the <I>second</I> inroad 
 of his enemies (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:1-26,2Ki+15:37,Isa+16:5">2Ch 28:1-26
 and 2Ki 15:37,
 with Isa 16:5</A>),

 smarting under his former defeat, applied to Tiglath-pileser, in spite
 of Isaiah's warning in this chapter, that he should rather rely on God; 
 that king accordingly attacked Damascus, and slew Rezin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:9">2Ki 16:9</A>);

 and probably it was at the same time that he carried away part of 
 Israel captive

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:29">2Ki 15:29</A>),
 
 unless there were <I>two</I> assaults on Pekah--that in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:29">2Ki 15:29</A>,

 the earlier, and that in which Tiglath helped Ahaz subsequently [G. V. 
 S<FONT SIZE=-1>MITH</FONT>]. Ahaz was saved at the sacrifice of Judah's 
 independence and the payment of a large tribute, which continued till 
 the overthrow of Sennacherib under Hezekiah

 or, Mount high for it (literally, "Make high"). So in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:1">Mt 16:1</A>.

 Signs in <I>heaven</I> are contrasted with the signs on earth and below

 "tempt," that is, put God to the proof, as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:7">Mt 4:7</A>,

 by seeking His miraculous interposition without warrant. But here there 
 <I>was</I> the warrant of the prophet of God; to have asked a sign, 
 when thus offered, would not have been a <I>tempting</I> of God. Ahaz' 
 true reason for declining was his resolve not to do God's will, but to 
 negotiate with Assyria, and persevere in his idolatry

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:7,8,2Ki+16:3,4,10">2Ki 16:7, 8, 3, 4, 10</A>).

 Men often excuse their distrust in God, and trust in their own devices, 
 by <I>professed</I> reverence for God. Ahaz may have fancied that 
 though Jehovah was the God of Judea and could work a sign there, that

 have the article, <I>the</I> virgin, some definite one known to the 
 speaker and his hearers; primarily, the woman, then a virgin, about 
 immediately to become the second wife, and bear a child, whose 
 attainment of the age of discrimination (about three years) should be 
 preceded by the deliverance of Judah from its two invaders; its fullest 
 significancy is realized in "<I>the</I> woman"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15">Ge 3:15</A>),

 Language is selected such as, while <I>partially</I> applicable to the
 immediate event, receives its <I>fullest,</I> most appropriate, and 
 exhaustive accomplishment in Messianic events. The New Testament 
 application of such prophecies is not a strained "accommodation"; 
 rather the temporary fulfilment of an adaptation of the far-reaching 
 prophecy to the present passing event, which foreshadows typically the 
 great central end of prophecy, Jesus Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:10">Re 19:10</A>).

 Evidently the wording is such as to apply more fully to Jesus Christ 
 than to the prophet's son; "virgin" applies, in its simplest sense, to 
 the Virgin Mary, rather than to the prophetess who ceased to be a 
 <I>virgin</I> when she "conceived"; "Immanuel," <I>God with us</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:15,16">Isa 7:15, 16</A>)

 those who do not desire to discover them.

 the expression is strikingly changed into, "<I>They</I> shall call";
 when the prophecy received its <I>full</I> accomplishment, no longer is 
 the name Immanuel restricted to the <I>prophetess'</I> view of His 
 character, as in its partial fulfilment in her son; <I>all</I> shall 
 then call (that is, not literally), or <I>regard</I> Him as 
 <I>peculiarly and most fitly characterized by the descriptive name,</I>

 The name in its proper destination was not arbitrary, but 
 characteristic of the individual; sin destroyed the faculty of 
 perceiving the internal being; hence the severance now between the name 
 and the character; in the case of Jesus Christ and many in Scripture, 
 the Holy Ghost has supplied this want [O<FONT

 a little before the giving of this prophecy); so shall the after-coming

 Galilee), the land beyond (but H<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGSTENBERG</FONT>, "by

 Reuben, Gad, and half-Manasseh), the circle (but H<FONT

 "Gentiles" [M<FONT SIZE=-1>AURER</FONT>, H<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ENGSTENBERG</FONT>, &c.]. <I>Galil</I> in <I>Hebrew</I> is a 
 "circle," "circuit," and from it came the name Galilee. North of 
 Naphtali, inhabited by a mixed race of Jews and Gentiles of the 
 bordering Ph&oelig;nician race

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:30,1Ki+9:11">Jud 1:30;

 Besides the recent deportation by Tiglath-pileser, it had been sorely
 smitten by Ben-hadad of Syria, two hundred years before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:20">1Ki 15:20</A>).

 It was after the Assyrian deportation colonized with heathens, by 
 Esar-haddon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:24">2Ki 17:24</A>).
 
 Hence arose the contempt for it on the part of the southern Jews of
 purer blood 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:46,7:52">Joh 1:46; 7:52</A>).

 His ministry; from it were most of His apostles. Foretold in

 Ps 68:27, 28</A>, 

 Jerusalem, the theocratic capital, might readily have known Messiah; to
 compensate less favored Galilee, He ministered mostly there; Galilee's
 very debasement made it feel its need of a Saviour, a feeling not known
 to the self-righteous Jews

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:13">Mt 9:13</A>).

 It was appropriate, too, that He who was both "the Light to lighten the
 Gentiles, and the Glory of His people Israel," should minister chiefly 
 on the border land of <I>Israel,</I> near the <I>Gentiles.</I></P>

 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGSTENBERG</FONT>, retains <I>not</I> thus: "Whose joy thou hadst not
 increased," (that is, hadst <I>diminished</I>). Others, "Hast thou not
 increased the joy?" The very difficulty of the reading, <I>not,</I> makes
 it less likely to be an interpolation.
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ORSLEY</FONT> best explains it: The
 prophet sees in vision a shifting scene, comprehending at one glance the
 history of the Christian Church to remotest times--a land dark and
 thinly peopled--lit up by a sudden light--filled with new
 inhabitants--then struggling with difficulties, and again delivered by
 the utter and final overthrow of their enemies. The influx of Gentile
 converts (represented here by "Galilee of the Gentiles") soon was to be
 followed by the growth of corruption, and the final rise of Antichrist,
 who is to be destroyed, while God's people is delivered, as in the case
 of Gideon's victory over Midian, not by man's prowess, but by the
 special interposition of God.

 shall prove to be the "Prince of peace," and the small Israel under Him

 The predictions as to foreign nations are for the sake of the covenant
 people, to preserve them from despair, or reliance on human
 confederacies, and to strengthen their faith in God: also in order to
 extirpate narrow-minded nationality: God is Jehovah to Israel, not for
 Israel's sake alone, but that He may be thereby Elohim to the nations.
 These prophecies are in their right chronological place, in the
 beginning of Hezekiah's reign; then the nations of Western Asia, on the
 Tigris and Euphrates, first assumed a most menacing aspect.</P>

 which the sides meet; and so the expression comes to mean "<I>the

 dwelling-place of their gods, in the north, in the Himalayan mountains. 
 So the Greeks, in the <I>northern</I> Olympus. The Persian followers of

 Isaiah announces the overthrow of Sennacherib's hosts and desires the
 Ethiopian ambassadors, now in Jerusalem, to bring word of it to their
 own nation; and he calls on the whole world to witness the event

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:3">Isa 18:3</A>).
 
 As

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:12-14">Isa 17:12-14</A>

 announced the presence of the foe, so

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:1-7">Isa 18:1-7</A>
 
 foretells his overthrow.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>1. Woe</B>--The heading in <I>English Version,</I> "God will destroy the
 Ethiopians," is a mistake arising from the wrong rendering "Woe,"
 whereas the <I>Hebrew</I> does not express a threat, but is an <I>appeal</I> calling attention 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:1,Zec+2:6">Isa 55:1;
 Zec 2:6</A>): 

 "Ho." He is not speaking <I>against</I> but <I>to</I> the Ethiopians,
 calling on them to hear his prophetical announcement as to the 
 destruction of their enemies.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>shadowing with wings</B>--rather, "land <I>of the winged bark</I>"; that
 is, "barks with wing-like sails, answering to vessels of bulrushes" in
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:2">Isa 18:2</A>;

 the word "rivers," in the parallelism, also favors it; so the 
 <I>Septuagint</I> and <I>Chaldee</I> [E<FONT SIZE=-1>WALD</FONT>].  
 "Land of the clanging sound of <I>wings,</I>" that is, armies, as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:8">Isa 8:8</A>;

 the rendering "bark," or "ship," is rather dubious [M<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>AURER</FONT>].  The armies referred to are those of Tirhakah, 
 advancing to meet the Assyrians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:9">Isa 37:9</A>).

 In <I>English Version,</I> "shadowing" means 
 <I>protecting</I>--stretching out its <I>wings</I> to defend a feeble 
 people, namely, the Hebrews [V<FONT SIZE=-1>ITRINGA</FONT>]. The
 <I>Hebrew</I> for "wings" is the same as for the idol <I>Cneph,</I> 
 which was represented in temple sculptures with wings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:4">Ps 91:4</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>beyond</B>--Meroe, the island between the "rivers" Nile and Astaboras is
 meant, famed for its commerce, and perhaps the seat of the Ethiopian
 government, hence addressed here as representing the whole empire:
 remains of temples are still found, and the name of "Tirhakah" in the
 inscriptions. This island region was probably the chief part of Queen
 Candace's kingdom 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:27">Ac 8:27</A>).

 For "beyond" others translate less literally "which borderest on."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Ethiopia</B>--literally, "Cush." H<FONT SIZE=-1>ORSLEY</FONT>
 is probably right that the
 <I>ultimate</I> and <I>fullest</I> reference of the prophecy is to the
 restoration of the Jews in the Holy Land through the instrumentality of
 some <I>distant</I> people skilled in navigation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:2,Isa+60:9,10,Ps+45:15,68:31,Zep+3:10">Isa 18:2;
 Isa 60:9, 10;
 Ps 45:15; 68:31; 
 Zep 3:10</A>). 

 Ph&oelig;nician voyagers coasting along would speak of all Western
 <I>remote</I> lands as "beyond" the Nile's mouths. "Cush," too, has a 
 wide sense, being applied not only to Ethiopia, but Arabia-Deserta and 
 Felix, and along the Persian Gulf, as far as the Tigris

 against the common enemy of both Judah and Ethiopia.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>scattered and peeled</B>--rather, "strong and energetic"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+36:10,Ec+2:3">Ps 36:10;

 "Energetic," literally, "sharp"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:8">Hab 1:8</A>,

 <I>Margin;</I> the verb means to "sharpen" a sword,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:15,16">Eze 21:15, 16</A>);

 also "polished." As H<FONT SIZE=-1>ERODOTUS</FONT> (3:20, 114)
 characterizes the Ethiopians as "the tallest and fairest of men," G. V.
 S<FONT SIZE=-1>MITH</FONT> translates, "tall and comely"; literally,
 "extended"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:14">Isa 45:14</A>,

 "men of stature") <I>and polished</I> (the Ethiopians had "smooth,
 glossy skins"). In <I>English Version</I> the reference is to the Jews, 
 <I>scattered</I> outcasts, and loaded with indignity (literally, 
 "having their hair torn off," H<FONT SIZE=-1>ORSLEY</FONT>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>terrible</B>--the <I>Ethiopians</I> famed for warlike prowess
 [R<FONT SIZE=-1>OSENMULLER</FONT>].

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:37">De 28:37</A>).

 Rather, "awfully remarkable" [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ORSLEY</FONT>]. God puts 
 the "terror" of His people into the surrounding nations at the first

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:27,Jos+2:9">Ex 23:27;

 so it shall be again in the latter days

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>from .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. beginning hitherto</B>--so <I>English Version</I> rightly. But
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>ESENIUS</FONT>, "to the terrible nation (of upper Egypt) and further beyond"
 (to the Ethiopians, properly so called).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>meted out</B>--<I>Hebrew,</I> "of line." The measuring-line was used in

 2Ki 21:13; 
 La 2:8</A>).

 Hence, actively, it means here "a people <I>meting out,</I>--an
 all-destroying people"; which suits the context better than "meted," 
 passively [M<FONT SIZE=-1>AURER</FONT>].  H<FONT SIZE=-1>ORSLEY</FONT>, 
 understanding it of <I>the Jews,</I> translates it, "Expecting,

 The nineteenth and twentieth chapters are connected, but with an
 interval between. Egypt had been held by an Ethiopian dynasty, Sabacho,
 Sevechus, or Sabacho II, and Tirhakah, for forty or fifty years.
 Sevechus (called <I>So,</I> the ally of Hoshea,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:4">2Ki 17:4</A>),

 retired from Lower Egypt on account of the resistance of the priests; 
 and perhaps also, as the Assyrians threatened Lower Egypt. On his 
 withdrawal, Sethos, one of the priestly caste, became supreme, having 
 Tanis ("Zoan") or else Memphis as his capital, 718 <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>; while the Ethiopians retained Upper Egypt, with 
 Thebes as its capital, under Tirhakah. A third native dynasty was at 
 Sais, in the west of Lower Egypt; to this at a later period belonged 
 Psammetichus, the first who admitted Greeks into Egypt and its armies; 
 he was one of the dodecarchy, a number of petty kings between whom 
 Egypt was divided, and by aid of foreign auxiliaries overcame the rest, 
 670 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT> To the divisions at this last time, 
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>ESENIUS</FONT> refers 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:2">Isa 19:2</A>;
 
 and Psammetichus,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:4">Isa 19:4</A>,

 "a cruel lord." The dissensions of the ruling castes are certainly
 referred to. But the time referred to is much earlier than that of
 Psammetichus. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:1">Isa 19:1</A>,

 the invasion of Egypt is represented as caused by "the Lord"; and in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:17">Isa 19:17</A>,

 "Judah" is spoken of as "a terror to Egypt," which it could hardly have 
 been <I>by itself.</I> Probably, therefore, the Assyrian invasion of 
 Egypt under Sargon, when Judah was the ally of Assyria, and Hezekiah 
 had not yet refused tribute as he did in the beginning of Sennacherib's 
 reign, is meant. That Assyria was in Isaiah's mind appears from the way 
 in which it is joined with Israel and Egypt in the worship of Jehovah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:24,25">Isa 19:24, 25</A>).

 Thus the dissensions referred to

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:2">Isa 19:2</A>)

 allude to the time of the withdrawal of the Ethiopians from Lower 
 Egypt, probably not without a struggle, especially with the priestly 
 caste; also to the time when Sethos usurped the throne and entered on 
 the contest with the military caste, by the aid of the town 
 populations: when the Saitic dynasty was another cause of division.

 In the reign of Sargon (722-715 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>), the 
 successor of Shalmaneser, an Assyrian invasion of Egypt took place. Its
 success is here foretold, and hence a party among the Jews is warned of 
 the folly of their "expectation" of aid from Egypt or Ethiopia. At a 
 later period

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:1-7">Isa 18:1-7</A>),

 when Tirhakah of Ethiopia was their ally, the Ethiopians are treated as
 <I>friends,</I> to whom God announces the overthrow of the common 
 Assyrian foe, Sennacherib. Egypt and Ethiopia in this chapter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+20:3,4">Isa 20:3, 4</A>)

 are represented as <I>allied together,</I> the result no doubt of fear 
 of the common foe; previously they had been at strife, and the 
 Ethiopian king had, just before Sethos usurpation, withdrawn from 
 occupation of part of Lower Egypt. Hence, "Egypt" is mentioned 
 <I>alone</I> in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:1-25">Isa 19:1-25</A>,

 which refers to a somewhat earlier stage of the same event: a delicate 
 mark of truth. Sargon seems to have been the king who finished the 
 capture of Samaria which Shalmaneser began; the alliance of Hoshea with 
 So or Sabacho II of Ethiopia, and his refusal to pay the usual tribute, 
 provoked Shalmaneser to the invasion. On clay cylindrical seals found 
 in Sennacherib's palace at Koyunjik, the name of Sabacho is deciphered; 
 the two seals are thought, from the inscriptions, to have been attached 
 to the treaty of peace between Egypt and Assyria, which resulted from 
 the invasion of Egypt by Sargon, described in this chapter;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:10">2Ki 18:10</A>

 curiously confirms the view derived from Assyrian inscriptions, that 
 though Shalmaneser began, Sargon finished the conquest of Samaria; 
 "<I>they</I> took it" (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:4-6">2Ki 17:4-6</A>).
 
 In Sargon's palace at Khorsabad,

 inscriptions state that 27,280 Israelites were led captive by the
 founder of the palace. While Shalmaneser was engaged in the siege of 
 Samaria, Sargon probably usurped the supreme power and destroyed him; 
 the siege began in 723 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, and ended in 721 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, the first year of Sargon's reign. Hence 
 arises the paucity of inscriptions of the two predecessors of Sargon,
 Tiglath-pileser and Shalmaneser; the usurper destroyed them, just as 
 Tiglath-pileser destroyed those of Pul (Sardanapalus), the last of the 
 old line of Ninus; the names of his father and grandfather, which have 
 been deciphered in the palace of his son Sennacherib, do not appear in 
 the list of Assyrian kings, which confirms the view that he was a 
 satrap who usurped the throne. He was so able a general that Hezekiah 
 made no attempt to shake off the tribute until the reign of 
 Sennacherib; hence Judah was not invaded now as the lands of the 
 Philistines and Egypt were. After conquering Israel he sent his 
 general, Tartan, to attack the Philistine cities, "Ashdod," &c., 
 preliminary to his invasion of Egypt and Ethiopia; for the line of 
 march to Egypt lay along the southwest coast of Palestine. The 
 inscriptions confirm the prophecy; they tell us he received tribute 
 from a Pharaoh of "Egypt"; besides destroying in part the Ethiopian 
 "No-ammon," or Thebes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:8">Na 3:8</A>);

 also that he warred with the kings of "Ashdod," Gaza, &c., in harmony 
 with Isaiah here; a memorial tablet of him is found in Cyprus also, 
 showing that he extended his arms to that island. His reign was six or 
 seven years in duration, 722-715 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT> [G. V.

 on the Mediterranean, one of the "five" cities of the Philistines. The 
 taking of it was a necessary preliminary to the invasion of Egypt, to 
 which it was the key in that quarter, the Philistines being allies of 
 Egypt. So strongly did the Assyrians fortify it that it stood a 
 twenty-nine years' siege, when it was retaken by the Egyptian 
 Psammetichus.

 M<FONT SIZE=-1>ENANDER</FONT>, the historian, notices a siege of Tyre 
 by Shalmaneser, about the time of the siege of Samaria. Sidon, Acco, 
 and Old Tyre, on the mainland, were soon reduced; but New Tyre, on an 
 island half a mile from the shore, held out for five years. Sargon 
 probably finished the siege.  Sennacherib does not, however, mention it
 among the cities which the Assyrian kings conquered (thirty-sixth and 
 thirty-seventh chapters).  The expression, "Chaldeans"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:13">Isa 23:13</A>),

 The thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth chapters form one prophecy, the
 former part of which denounces God's judgment against His people's
 enemies, of whom Edom is the representative; the second part, of the
 flourishing state of the Church consequent on those judgments. This
 forms the termination of the prophecies of the first part of Isaiah (the
 thirty-sixth through thirty-ninth chapters being historical) and is a
 kind of summary of what went before, setting forth the one main truth,

 This and the thirty-seventh through thirty-ninth chapters form the
 historical appendix closing the first division of Isaiah's prophecies,
 and were added to make the parts of these referring to Assyria more
 intelligible. So

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:1-34">Jer 52:1-34</A>;
 
 compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+25:1-30">2Ki 25:1-30</A>.

 The section occurs almost word for word

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:13,17-20,2Ki+18:14-16,19:1-37">2Ki 18:13, 17-20; 19:1-37</A>);

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:14-16">2Ki 18:14-16</A>,

 however, is additional matter. Hezekiah's "writing" also is in Isaiah,
 not in Kings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:9-20">Isa 38:9-20</A>). 

 We know from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:32">2Ch 32:32</A>

 that Isaiah wrote the acts of Hezekiah. It is, therefore, probable, 
 that his record here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+36:1-39:8">Isa 36:1-39:8</A>)

 was incorporated into the Book of Kings by its compiler. Sennacherib 
 lived, according to Assyrian inscriptions, more than twenty years after 
 his invasion; but as Isaiah survived Hezekiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:32">2Ch 32:32</A>),
 
 who lived upwards of fifteen years after the invasion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:5">Isa 38:5</A>),
 
 the record of Sennacherib's death 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:38">Isa 37:38</A>)

 is no objection to this section having come from Isaiah;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:1-33">2Ch 32:1-33</A>

 is probably an abstract drawn from Isaiah's account, as the chronicler 
 himself implies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:32">2Ch 32:32</A>).

 Pul was probably the last of the old dynasty, and Sargon, a powerful 
 satrap, who contrived to possess himself of supreme power and found a 
 new dynasty (see on

 <A HREF="#Isa20_1">Isa 20:1</A>). 

 No attempt was made by Judah to throw off the Assyrian yoke during his 
 vigorous reign. The accession of his son Sennacherib was thought by 
 Hezekiah the opportune time to refuse the long-paid tribute; Egypt and 
 Ethiopia, to secure an ally against Assyria on their Asiatic frontier, 
 promised help; Isaiah, while opposed to submission to Assyria, advised 
 reliance on Jehovah, and not on Egypt, but his advice was disregarded, 
 and so Sennacherib invaded Judea, 712 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT> He was 
 the builder of the largest of the excavated palaces, that of Koyunjik.  
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>INCKS</FONT> has deciphered his name in the 
 inscriptions. In the third year of his reign, these state that he 
 overran Syria, took Sidon and other Ph&oelig;nician cities, and then
 passed to southwest Palestine, where he defeated the Egyptians and 
 Ethiopians (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:21,19:9">2Ki 18:21; 19:9</A>).

 His subsequent retreat, after his host was destroyed by God, is of 
 course suppressed in the inscriptions. But other particulars inscribed 
 agree strikingly with the Bible; the capture of the "defensed cities of 
 Judah," the devastation of the country and deportation of its 
 inhabitants; the increased tribute imposed on Hezekiah--thirty talents 
 of gold--this <I>exact number being given in both;</I> the silver is 
 set down in the inscriptions at eight hundred talents, in the Bible 
 three hundred; the latter may have been the actual amount carried off, 
 the larger sum may include the silver from the temple doors, pillars, &c.

 Egypt was in part governed by three successive Ethiopian monarchs, for 
 forty or fifty years: Sabacho, Sevechus, and Tirhakah. Sevechus retired 
 from Lower Egypt owing to the resistance of the priests, whereupon 
 Sethos, a prince-priest, obtained supreme power with Tanis (Zoan in 
 Scripture), or Memphis, as his capital. The Ethiopians retained Upper 
 Egypt under Tirhakah, with Thebes as the capital. Tirhakah's fame as a 
 conqueror rivalled that of Sesostris; he, and one at least, of the 
 Pharaohs of Lower Egypt, were Hezekiah's allies against Assyria. The 
 tidings of his approach made Sennacherib the more anxious to get 
 possession of Jerusalem before his arrival.

 their position at each end of the mercy seat, while the Shekinah, and 
 the awful name, J<FONT SIZE=-1>EHOVAH</FONT>, in written letters, were 
 in the intervening space. They are so inseparably associated with the 
 manifestation of God's glory, that whether the Lord is at rest or in 
 motion, they always are mentioned with Him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+7:89,Ps+18:10">Nu 7:89;

 (1) They are first mentioned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:24">Ge 3:24</A>)

 "on the edge of" (as "on the east" may be translated) Eden; the
 <I>Hebrew</I> for "placed" is properly to "place in a tabernacle,"
 which implies that this was a local tabernacle in which the symbols of
 God's presence were manifested suitably to the altered circumstances in
 which man, after the fall, came before God. It was here that Cain and
 Abel, and the patriarchs down to the flood, presented their offerings:
 and it is called "the presence of the Lord"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:16">Ge 4:16</A>).

 When those symbols were removed at the close of that early patriarchal
 dispensation, small models of them were made for domestic use, called, 
 in <I>Chaldee,</I> "seraphim" or "teraphim." (2) The cherubim, in the 
 Mosaic tabernacle and Solomon's temple, were the same in form as those 
 at the outskirts of Eden: compound figures, combining the 
 distinguishing properties of several creatures: the ox, chief among the 
 tame and useful animals; the lion among the wild ones; the eagle among 
 birds; and man, the head of all (the original headship of man over the 
 animal kingdom, about to be restored in Jesus Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:4-8">Ps 8:4-8</A>,

 is also implied in this combination). They are, throughout Scripture, 
 represented as distinct from God; they could not be likenesses of Him 
 which He forbade in any shape. (3) They are introduced in the third or 
 gospel dispensation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:6">Re 4:6</A>)

 as "<I>living creatures</I>" (not so well translated "beasts" in 
 <I>English Version</I>), not angels, but beings closely connected with 
 the redeemed Church. So also in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:5-25,10:1-22">Eze 1:5-25; 10:1-22</A>.

 Thus, throughout the three dispensations, they seem to be symbols of
 those who in every age should officially study and proclaim the 
 manifold wisdom of God.

 The simoon belongs rather to Africa and Arabia than Palestine, and 
 ordinarily could not produce such a destructive effect. Some few of the 
 army, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:21">2Ch 32:21</A>

 seems to imply, survived and accompanied Sennacherib home.  H<FONT
 SIZE=-1>ERODOTUS</FONT> (2.141) gives an account confirming Scripture 
 in so far as the sudden discomfiture of the Assyrian army is concerned. 
 The Egyptian priests told him that Sennacherib was forced to retreat 
 from Pelusium owing to a multitude of field mice, sent by one of their 
 gods, having gnawed the Assyrians' <I>bow-strings</I> and 
 <I>shield-straps.</I> Compare the language

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:33">Isa 37:33</A>),

 "He shall not shoot an <I>arrow</I> there, nor come before it with 
 <I>shields,</I>" which the Egyptians corrupted into their version of 
 the story.  Sennacherib was as the time with a part of his army, not at 
 Jerusalem, but on the Egyptian frontier, southwest of Palestine. The
 sudden destruction of the host near Jerusalem, a considerable part of 
 his whole army, as well as the advance of the Ethiopian Tirhakah, 
 induced him to retreat, which the Egyptians accounted for in a way 
 honoring to their own gods. The mouse was the Egyptian emblem of 
 destruction. The <I>Greek</I> Apollo was called <I>Sminthian,</I> from 
 a Cretan word for "a mouse," as a tutelary god of agriculture, he was 
 represented with one foot upon a mouse, since field mice hurt corn. The 
 Assyrian inscriptions, of course, suppress their own defeat, but 
 nowhere boast of having taken Jerusalem; and the only reason to be 
 given for Sennacherib not having, amidst his many subsequent 
 expeditions recorded in the monuments, returned to Judah, is the 
 terrible calamity he had sustained there, which convinced him that 
 Hezekiah was under the divine protection.  R<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>AWLINSON</FONT> says, In Sennacherib's account of his wars with 
 Hezekiah, inscribed with cuneiform characters in the hall of the palace 
 of Koyunjik, built by him (a hundred forty feet long by a hundred 
 twenty broad), wherein even the Jewish physiognomy of the captives is 
 portrayed, there occurs a remarkable passage; after his mentioning his 
 taking two hundred thousand captive Jews, he adds, "Then I prayed unto 
 God"; the only instance of an inscription wherein the name of G<FONT

 Psalm probably commemorates Judah's deliverance. It occurred in one

 Nimrod, its founder; his name means "exceedingly impious rebel"; he
 subverted the existing patriarchal order of society, by setting up a
 system of chieftainship, founded on conquest; the hunting field was his
 training school for war; he was of the race of Ham, and transgressed the
 limits marked by God

 should go forward, or go back, ten degrees. Hezekiah replied, "It is a 
 light thing (a less decisive miracle) for the shadow to go down (its 
 usual direction) ten degrees: nay, but let it return backward ten 
 degrees"; so Isaiah cried to Jehovah that it should be so, and it was 
 so (compare

 <B>sundial of Ahaz</B>--H<FONT SIZE=-1>ERODOTUS</FONT> (2.109)
 states that the sundial and the
 division of the day into twelve hours, were invented by the Babylonians;
 from them Ahaz borrowed the invention. He was one, from his connection
 with Tiglath-pileser, likely to have done so 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:7,10">2Ki 16:7, 10</A>).

 "Shadow of the degrees" means the shadow made on the degrees.  J<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT> thinks these degrees were <I>steps ascending</I> 
 to the palace of Ahaz; the time of day was indicated by the number of 
 steps reached by the shadow. But probably a sundial, strictly so 
 called, is meant; it was of such a size, and so placed, that Hezekiah, 
 when convalescent, could witness the miracle from his chamber. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:21,22,2Ki+20:9">Isa 38:21, 22
 with 2Ki 20:9</A>,

 the point where Isaiah turned back to announce God's gracious answers 
 to Hezekiah. Hence this particular sign was given. The retrogression of 
 the shadow may have been effected by refraction; a cloud denser than 
 the air interposing between the gnomon and dial would cause the 
 phenomenon, which does not take from the miracle, for God gave him the 
 choice whether the shadow should go forward or back, and regulated the 
 time and place. B<FONT SIZE=-1>OSANQUET</FONT> makes the fourteenth 
 year of Hezekiah to be 689 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, the known year of 
 a solar eclipse, to which he ascribes the recession of the shadow. At 
 all events, there is no need for supposing any revolution of the 
 relative positions of the sun and earth, but merely an effect produced 
 on the shadow

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:9-11">2Ki 20:9-11</A>);

 <B>1. Merodach-baladan</B>--For a hundred fifty years before the overthrow
 of Nineveh by Cyaxares the Mede, a succession of rulers, mostly viceroys
 of Assyria, ruled Babylon, from the time of Nabonassar, 747 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT> That
 date is called "the Era of Nabonassar." Pul or Phallukha was then
 expelled, and a new dynasty set up at Nineveh, under Tiglath-pileser.
 Semiramis, Pul's wife, then retired to Babylon, with Nabonassar, her
 son, whose advent to the throne of Babylon, after the overthrow of the
 old line at Nineveh, marked a new era. Sometimes the viceroys of Babylon
 made themselves, for a time, independent of Assyria; thus
 Merodach-baladan at this time did so, encouraged by the Assyrian
 disaster in the Jewish campaign. He had done so before, and was defeated
 in the first year of Sennacherib's reign, as is recorded in cuneiform
 characters in that monarchs palace of Koyunjik. Nabopolassar was the
 first who established, <I>permanently,</I> his independence; his son,
 Nebuchadnezzar, raised Babylon to the position which Nineveh once
 occupied; but from the want of stone near the Lower Euphrates, the
 buildings of Babylon, formed of sun-dried brick, have not stood the wear
 of ages as Nineveh has.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:2">Jer 50:2</A>).

 Often kings took their names from their gods, as if peculiarly under 
 their tutelage. So Belshazzar from Bel.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Baladan</B>--means "Bel is his lord." The chronicle of
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> contains
 a fragment of B<FONT SIZE=-1>EROSUS</FONT>,
 stating that Acises, an Assyrian viceroy, usurped
 the supreme command at Babylon. Merodach- (or Berodach-) baladan
 murdered him and succeeded to the throne. Sennacherib conquered
 Merodach-baladan and left Esar-haddon, his son, as governor of Babylon.
 Merodach-baladan would naturally court the alliance of Hezekiah, who,
 like himself, had thrown off the yoke of the Assyrian king, and who
 would be equally glad of the Babylonian alliance against Assyria; hence
 arose the excessive attention which he paid to the usurper.

 "The princes of Babylon sent to enquire of the wonder that was done in 
 the land"; namely, the recession of the shadow on Ahaz' sundial; to the 
 Chaldean astronomers, such a fact would be especially interesting, the 
 dial having been invented at Babylon.</P>

 The former were local and temporary in their reference. These belong to
 the distant future, and are world-wide in their interest; the
 deliverance from Babylon under Cyrus, which he here foretells by
 prophetic suggestion, carries him on to the greater deliverance under
 Messiah, the Saviour of Jews and Gentiles in the present eclectic
 Church, and the restorer of Israel and Head of the world-wide kingdom,
 literal and spiritual, ultimately. As Assyria was the hostile world
 power in the former part, which refers to Isaiah's own time, so Babylon
 is so in the latter part, which refers to a period long subsequent. The
 connecting link, however, is furnished

 can her "iniquity" be said to be "pardoned," or <I>fully</I> expiated

 Jehovah being their leader; so it shall be at the coming restoration of

 the coming of the Lord [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>].  John, though he

 Nebuchadnezzar had subdued Egypt, Ethiopia (<I>Hebrew, Cush</I>), and Saba

 probably Meroe of Ethiopia, a great island formed by the Astaboras and 
 the Nile, conquered by Cambyses, successor of Cyrus). Cyrus received 
 these from God with the rest of the Babylonian dominions, in 
 consideration of his being about to deliver Israel. However, the 
 reference may be to the three years' war in which Sargon overcame these 
 countries, and so had his attention diverted from Israel (see on

 <A HREF="#Isa20_1">Isa 20:1</A>)

 [V<FONT SIZE=-1>ITRINGA</FONT>]. But the reference is probably more

 This is the first time Cyrus is <I>named</I> expressly; and that, a
 hundred fifty years before the time when in 550 <FONT

 <I>Persian khorschid,</I> "the sun"; kings often taking their names 
 from the gods; the sun was worshipped as a god in Persia.

 <I>English Version</I> is more graphic. Cyrus, according to 
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>, heard of this prophecy of Isaiah
 delivered so long before; hence he was induced to do that which was so 
 contrary to Oriental policy, to aid in restoring the captive Jews and 
 rebuilding their temple and city.</P>

 capture, the inner gates, leading from the streets to the river, were
 left open; for there were walls along each side of the Euphrates with
 gates, which, had they been kept shut, would have hemmed the invading
 hosts in the bed of the river, where the Babylonians could have easily
 destroyed them. Also, the gates of the palace were left open, so that
 there was access to every part of the city; and such was its extent,
 that they who lived in the extremities were taken prisoners before the
 alarm reached the center of the palace.

 chapter end with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:12">Isa 52:12</A>.

 This section, from here to end of the fifty-third chapter settles the 
 controversy with the Jews, if Messiah be the person meant; and with 
 infidels, if written by Isaiah, or at any time before Christ. The 
 correspondence with the life and death of Jesus Christ is so minute, 
 that it could not have resulted from conjecture or accident. An 
 impostor could not have shaped <I>the course of events</I> so as to 
 have made his character and life appear to be a fulfilment of it.  The 
 writing is, moreover, <I>declaredly prophetic.</I> The quotations of it 
 in the New Testament show: (1) that it was, before the time of Jesus, a 
 recognized part of the Old Testament; (2) that it refers to Messiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:17,Mk+15:28,Lu+22:37,Joh+12:38,Ac+8:28-35,Ro+10:16,1Pe+2:21-25">Mt 8:17;
 Mr 15:28; 
 Lu 22:37; 
 Joh 12:38; 
 Ac 8:28-35; 
 Ro 10:16; 
 1Pe 2:21-25</A>).

 The indirect allusions to it still more clearly prove the Messianic
 interpretation; so universal was that interpretation, that it is simply 
 <I>referred to</I> in connection with the atoning virtue of His death, 
 without being formally quoted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:12,Ro+4:25,1Co+15:3,2Co+5:21,1Pe+1:19,2:21-25,1Jo+3:5">Mr 9:12;
 Ro 4:25;
 1Co 15:3;
 2Co 5:21;
 1Pe 1:19; 2:21-25;
 1Jo 3:5</A>).

 The genuineness of the passage is certain; for the Jews <I>would</I>
 not have forged it, since it is opposed to <I>their</I> notion of 
 Messiah, as a triumphant temporal prince. The Christians <I>could</I> 
 not have forged it; for the Jews, the enemies of Christianity, are "our 
 librarians" [P<FONT SIZE=-1>ALEY</FONT>]. The Jews try to evade its
 force by the figment of two Messiahs, one a suffering Messiah (Ben 
 Joseph), the other a triumphant Messiah (Ben David). H<FONT
 SIZE=-1>ILLEL</FONT> maintained that Messiah has already come in the 
 person of Hezekiah. B<FONT SIZE=-1>UXTORF</FONT> states that many of 
 the modern Rabbins believe that He has been come a good while, but will 
 not manifest Himself because of the sins of the Jews. But the ancient 
 Jews, as the Chaldee paraphrast, Jonathan, refer it to Messiah; so the 
 <I>Medrasch Tauchuma</I> (a commentary on the Pentateuch); also Rabbi 
 Moses Haddarschan (see H<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGSTENBERG</FONT>, 
 <I>Christology of the Old Testament</I>). Some explain it of <I>the
 Jewish people,</I> either in the Babylonish exile, or in their present 
 sufferings and dispersion. Others, the <I>pious</I> portion of the 
 nation taken collectively, whose sufferings made a vicarious 
 satisfaction for the ungodly. Others, Isaiah, or Jeremiah [G<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ESENIUS</FONT>], the <I>prophets collectively.</I> But an 
 <I>individual</I> is plainly described: he suffers <I>voluntarily, 
 innocently,</I> patiently, and as the efficient cause of the 
 righteousness of His people, which holds good of none other but Messiah

 arises from not seeing that the prophet takes his stand <I>in the
 midst</I> of the scenes which he describes as future. The greater 
 nearness of the first advent, and the interval between it and the 
 second, are implied by the use of the <I>past tense</I> as to the

 The speaker, according to H<FONT SIZE=-1>ORSLEY</FONT>,
 personates the repenting Jews in the
 latter ages of the world coming over to the faith of the Redeemer; the
 whole is their penitent confession. This view suits the context

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:7-9">Isa 52:7-9</A>),

 which is not to be fully realized until Israel is restored. However, 
 primarily, it is the abrupt exclamation of the prophet: "Who hath 
 believed our report," that of Isaiah and the other prophets, as to 
 Messiah? The infidel's objection from the unbelief of the Jews is 
 anticipated and hereby answered: that unbelief and the cause of it 
 (Messiah's humiliation, whereas <I>they</I> looked for One coming to 
 reign) were foreseen and foretold.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>1. report</B>--literally, "the thing heard," referring to which sense
 Paul says, "So, then, faith cometh by <I>hearing</I>"

 The prophet, as if present during Messiah's ministry on earth, is
 deeply moved to see <I>how few believed</I> on Him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:4,Mk+6:6,9:19,Ac+1:15">Isa 49:4;
 Mr 6:6; 9:19; 
 Ac 1:15</A>). 

 <I>Two</I> reasons are given why all <I>ought</I> to have believed: (1)
 The "report" of the "ancient prophets." (2) "The arm of Jehovah" 
 exhibited in Messiah while on earth. In H<FONT SIZE=-1>ORSLEY'S</FONT> 
 view, this will be the penitent confession of the Jews, "How few of our 
 nation, in Messiah's days, believed in Him!"</P>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:11">Joh 1:11</A>),

 Messiah was observed <I>by God,</I> who ordered the most minute

 comeliness (attractiveness) <I>that we should look</I> (with delight) on
 Him."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>there is</B>--rather, "was." The studied reticence of the New 
 Testament as to His form, stature, color, &c., was designed to prevent 
 our dwelling on the bodily, rather than on His moral beauty, holiness, 
 love, &c., also a providential protest against the making and 
 veneration of images of Him. The letter of P. L<FONT SIZE=-1>ENTULUS</FONT> 
 to the emperor Tiberius, describing His person, is spurious; so also
 the story of His sending His portrait to Abgar, king of Edessa; and the 
 alleged impression of His countenance on the handkerchief of Veronica. 
 The former part of this verse refers to His birth and childhood; the 
 latter to His first public appearance [V<FONT SIZE=-1>ITRINGA</FONT>].</P>

 uses "sicknesses" figuratively for <I>sins,</I> the cause of them.  
 Christ took on Himself all man's "infirmities;" so as to remove them; 
 the bodily by direct miracle, grounded on His participation in human 
 infirmities; those of the soul by His vicarious suffering, which did

 "wicked" sins more openly in "his way"; the "unrighteous" refers to the
 more subtle workings of sin in the "thoughts." All are guilty in the
 latter respect, thought many fancy themselves safe, because not openly
 "wicked in ways" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:11">Ps 94:11</A>).

 The parallelism is that of gradation.  The progress of the penitent is 
 to be from negative reformation, "forsaking his way," and a farther 
 step, "his thoughts," to positive repentance, "returning to the Lord" 
 (the only true repentance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:10">Zec 12:10</A>),

 and making God <I>his</I> God, along with the other children of God 
 (the crowning point; <I>appropriation</I> of God <I>to ourselves:</I> 
 "to <I>our</I> God"). "Return" implies that man originally walked with 
 God, but has apostatized. Isaiah saith, "<I>our</I> God," the God of 
 the believing Israelites; those themselves redeemed desire others to 
 come to <I>their</I> God

 <I>for,</I> though "the wicked" man's "<I>ways,</I>" and "the 
 unrighteous man's <I>thoughts,</I>" are so aggravated as to seem 
 unpardonable, God's "thoughts" and "ways" in pardoning are not 
 regulated by the proportion of the former, as man's would be towards 
 his fellow man who offended him; compare the "for"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:6,Joh+8:44">Jude 6;
 Joh 8:44</A>). 

 From his peculiar connection with the earth and man, it has been
 conjectured that the exciting cause of his rebellion was God's 
 declaration that human nature was to be raised into union with the 
 Godhead; this was "the truth" concerning the person of the Son of God 
 which "he abode not in"; it galled his pride that a lower race was to 
 be raised to that which he had aspired to

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:6">1Ti 3:6</A>).

 How exultingly he might say, when man fell through him, "<I>God</I> 
 would raise manhood into union with Himself; <I>I</I> have brought it 
 down below the beasts by sin!" At that very moment and spot he was told 
 that the seed of the abhorred race, man, should bruise his head

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:8">1Jo 3:8</A>).

 He was raised up for this, to show forth God's glory

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:16,Ro+9:17">Ex 9:16;
 Ro 9:17</A>).

 In his unfallen state he may have been God's vicegerent over the earth 
 and the animal kingdom before man: this will account for his assuming
 the form of a serpent

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:1">Ge 3:1</A>).

 Man succeeded to that office

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:19,20">Ge 2:19, 20</A>),

 but forfeited it by sin, whence Satan became "prince of this world";

 lost inheritance

 heaven
