 <B>7. children of Israel were fruitful</B>--They were living in a land 
 where, according to the testimony of an ancient author, mothers 
 produced three and four sometimes at a birth; and a modern writer 
 declares "the females in Egypt, as well among the human race as among 
 animals, surpass all others in fruitfulness." To this natural 
 circumstance must be added the fulfilment of the promise made to
 Abraham.</P>

 <B>8. Now there arose up a new king</B>--About sixty years after the 
 death of Joseph a revolution took place--by which the old dynasty was 
 overthrown, and upper and lower Egypt were united into one kingdom.  
 Assuming that the king formerly reigned in Thebes, it is probable that 
 he would know nothing about the Hebrews; and that, as foreigners and 
 shepherds, the new government would, from the first, regard them with 
 dislike and scorn.</P>

 <B>9, 10. he said .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Behold, the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. children 
 of Israel are more and mightier than we</B>--They had risen to great 
 prosperity--as during the lifetime of Joseph and his royal patron, they 
 had, probably, enjoyed a free grant of the land. Their increase and 
 prosperity were viewed with jealousy by the new government; and as 
 Goshen lay between Egypt and Canaan, on the border of which latter 
 country were a number of warlike tribes, it was perfectly conformable 
 to the suggestions of worldly policy that they should enslave and 
 maltreat them, through apprehension of their joining in any invasion by 
 those foreign rovers. The new king, who neither knew the name nor cared 
 for the services of Joseph, was either <I>Amosis,</I> or one of his
 immediate successors [O<FONT SIZE=-1>SBURN</FONT>].</P>

 <A NAME="Ex1_11"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;


 <B>11. Therefore they did set over them taskmasters</B>--Having first
 obliged them, it is thought, to pay a ruinous rent and involved them in
 difficulties, that new government, in pursuance of its oppressive
 policy, degraded them to the condition of serfs--employing them exactly
 as the laboring people are in the present day (driven in companies or
 bands), in rearing the public works, with taskmasters, who anciently
 had sticks--now whips--to punish the indolent, or spur on the too
 languid. All public or royal buildings, in ancient Egypt, were built by
 captives; and on some of them was placed an inscription that no free
 citizen had been engaged in this servile employment.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>they built for Pharaoh treasure cities</B>--These two store-places
 were in the land of Goshen; and being situated near a border liable to
 invasion, they were fortified cities (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:1-12:16">2Ch 11:1-12:16</A>).

 Pithom (<I>Greek, Patumos</I>), lay on the eastern Pelusiac branch of
 the Nile, about twelve Roman miles from Heliopolis; and Raamses, called 
 by the <I>Septuagint</I> Heroopolis, lay between the same branch of the 
 Nile and the Bitter Lakes. These two fortified cities were situated, 
 therefore, in the same valley; and the fortifications, which Pharaoh 
 commanded to be built around both, had probably the same common object, 
 of obstructing the entrance into Egypt, which this valley furnished the 
 enemy from Asia [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGSTENBERG</FONT>].</P>

 <B>13, 14. The Egyptians .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. made their lives bitter with
 hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick</B>--Ruins of great brick
 buildings are found in all parts of Egypt. The use of crude brick,
 baked in the sun, was universal in upper and lower Egypt, both for
 public and private buildings; <I>all</I> but the temples themselves
 were of crude brick. It is worthy of remark that more bricks bearing
 the name of Thothmes III, who is supposed to have been the king of
 Egypt at the time of the Exodus, have been discovered than of any other
 period [W<FONT SIZE=-1>ILKINSON</FONT>]. Parties of these brickmakers
 are seen depicted on the ancient monuments with "taskmasters," some 
 standing, others in a sitting posture beside the laborers, with their 
 uplifted sticks in their hands.</P>

 <B>15. the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives</B>--Two only
 were spoken to--either they were the heads of a large corporation 
 [L<FONT SIZE=-1>ABORDE</FONT>], or, by tampering with these two, the 
 king designed to terrify the rest into secret compliance with his 
 wishes [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>].</P>

 <A NAME="Ex1_16"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>16. if it be a son, then ye shall kill him</B>--Opinions are
 divided, however, what was the method of destruction which the king did
 recommend. Some think that the "stools" were low seats on which these 
 obstetric practitioners sat by the bedside of the Hebrew women; and 
 that, as they might easily discover the sex, so, whenever a boy 
 appeared, they were to strangle it, unknown to its parents; while 
 others are of opinion that the "stools" were stone troughs, by the 
 river side--into which, when the infants were washed, they were to be, 
 as it were, accidentally dropped.</P>

 <A NAME="Ex1_17"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>17. But the midwives feared God</B>--Their faith inspired them with 
 such courage as to risk their lives, by disobeying the mandate of a 
 cruel tyrant; but it was blended with weakness, which made them shrink 
 from speaking the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
 truth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>20, 21. God dealt well with the midwives</B>--This represents God as
 rewarding them for telling a lie. This difficulty is wholly removed by
 a more correct translation. To "make" or "build up a house" in
 <I>Hebrew</I> idiom, means to have a numerous progeny. The passage then
 should be rendered thus: "God protected the midwives, and the people
 waxed very mighty; and because the midwives feared, the Hebrews grew
 and prospered."</P>

 <B>1. there went a man of the house of Levi,</B> &c. Amram was the
 husband and Jochebed the wife (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:2,Nu+26:59">Ex 6:2;

 some years before the infanticidal edict.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. the woman .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bare a son,</B> &c.--Some extraordinary
 appearance of remarkable comeliness led his parents to augur his future
 greatness.  Beauty was regarded by the ancients as a mark of the divine
 favor.

 <B>hid him three months</B>--The parents were a pious couple, and the 
 measures they took were prompted not only by parental attachment, but 
 by a strong faith in the blessing of God prospering their endeavors to 
 save the infant.</P>

 strong, and tough reed.

 <B>slime</B>--the mud of the Nile, which, when hardened, is very 
 tenacious.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>pitch</B>--mineral tar. Boats of this description are seen daily 
 floating on the surface of the river, with no other caulking than Nile 
 mud (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:2">Isa 18:2</A>),

 and they are perfectly watertight, unless the coating is forced off by 
 stormy weather.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>flags</B>--a general term for sea or river weed. The chest was not, 
 as is often represented, committed to the bosom of the water but laid 
 on the bank, where it would naturally appear to have been drifted by 
 the current and arrested by the reedy thicket. The spot is 
 traditionally said to be the Isle of Rodah, near Old Cairo.</P>

 <B>5. the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the 
 river</B>--The occasion is thought to have been a religious solemnity 
 which the royal family opened by bathing in the sacred stream. Peculiar 
 sacredness was attached to those portions of the Nile which flowed near 
 the temples.  The water was there fenced off as a protection from the 
 crocodiles; and doubtless the princess had an enclosure reserved for 
 her own use, the road to which seems to have been well known to 
 Jochebed.

 <A NAME="Ex2_6"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>6-9. when she had opened it, she saw the child</B>--The narrative is 
 picturesque. No tale of romance ever described a plot more skilfully 
 laid or more full of interest in the development. The expedient of the 
 ark, the slime and pitch, the choice of the time and place, the appeal 
 to the sensibilities of the female breast, the stationing of the sister 
 as a watch of the proceedings, her timely suggestion of a nurse, and 
 the engagement of the mother herself--all bespeak a more than ordinary 
 measure of ingenuity as well as intense solicitude on the part of the 
 parents. But the origin of the scheme was most probably owing to a 
 divine suggestion, as its success was due to an overruling Providence, 
 who not only preserved the child's life, but provided for his being 
 trained in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Hence it is said to 
 have been done by faith

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:23">Heb 11:23</A>),

 either in the general promise of deliverance, or some special 
 revelation made to Amram and Jochebed--and in this view, the pious 
 couple gave a beautiful example of a firm reliance on the word of God, 
 united with an active use of the most suitable means.</P>

 <B>10. she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter</B>--Though it must have 
 been nearly as severe a trial for Jochebed to part with him the second 
 time as the first, she was doubtless reconciled to it by her belief in 
 his high destination as the future deliverer of Israel. His age when 
 removed to the palace is not stated; but he was old enough to be well 
 instructed in the principles of the true religion; and those early 
 impressions, deepened by the power of divine grace, were never 
 forgotten or effaced.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he became her son</B>--by adoption, and his high rank afforded him 
 advantages in education, which in the Providence of God were made 
 subservient to far different purposes from what his royal patroness 
 intended.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>she called his name Moses</B>--His parents might, as usual, at the 
 time of his circumcision, have given him a name, which is traditionally 
 said to have been Joachim. But the name chosen by the princess, whether 
 of Egyptian or Hebrew origin, is the only one by which he has ever been 
 known to the church; and it is a permanent memorial of the painful 
 incidents of his birth and infancy.</P>

 <B>11. in those days, when Moses was grown</B>--not in age and stature 
 only, but in power as well as in renown for accomplishments and 
 military prowess

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:22">Ac 7:22</A>).

 There is a gap here in the sacred history which, however, is supplied 
 by the inspired commentary of Paul, who has fully detailed the reasons 
 as well as extent of the change that took place in his worldly 
 condition; and whether, as some say, his royal mother had proposed to 
 make him coregent and successor to the crown, or some other 
 circumstances, led to a declaration of his mind, he determined to 
 renounce the palace and identify himself with the suffering people of 
 God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:24-29">Heb 11:24-29</A>).

 The descent of some great sovereigns, like Diocletian and Charles V, 
 from a throne into private life, is nothing to the sacrifice which 
 Moses made through the power of faith.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he went out unto his brethren</B>--to make a full and systematic 
 inspection of their condition in the various parts of the country where 
 they were dispersed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:23">Ac 7:23</A>),

 and he adopted this proceeding in pursuance of the patriotic purpose 
 that the faith, which is of the operation of God, was even then forming 
 in his heart.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew</B>--one of the taskmasters 
 scourging a Hebrew slave without any just cause

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:24">Ac 7:24</A>),

 and in so cruel a manner, that he seems to have died under the 
 barbarous treatment--for the conditions of the sacred story imply such 
 a fatal issue. The sight was new and strange to him, and though 
 pre-eminent for meekness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:3">Nu 12:3</A>),
 
 he was fired with indignation.</P>

 <A NAME="Ex2_12"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>12. he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand</B>--This act of 
 Moses may seem and indeed by some has been condemned as rash and 
 unjustifiable--in plain terms, a deed of assassination. But we must not 
 judge of his action in such a country and age by the standard of law 
 and the notions of right which prevail in our Christian land; and, 
 besides, not only is it not spoken of as a crime in Scripture or as 
 distressing the perpetrator with remorse, but according to existing 
 customs among nomadic tribes, he was bound to avenge the blood of a 
 brother. The person he slew, however, being a government officer, he 
 had rendered himself amenable to the laws of Egypt, and therefore he 
 endeavored to screen himself from the consequences by concealment of 
 the corpse.</P>

 <A NAME="Ex2_13"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>13, 14. two men of the Hebrews strove together</B>--His benevolent 
 mediation in this strife, though made in the kindest and mildest 
 manner, was resented, and the taunt of the aggressor showing that 
 Moses' conduct on the preceding day had become generally known, he 
 determined to consult his safety by immediate flight

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:27">Heb 11:27</A>).

 These two incidents prove that neither were the Israelites yet ready to 
 go out of Egypt, nor Moses prepared to be their leader

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:20">Jas 1:20</A>).

 It was by the staff and not the sword--by the meekness, and not the 
 wrath of Moses that God was to accomplish that great work of 
 deliverance. Both he and the people of Israel were for forty years more 
 to be cast into the furnace of affliction, yet it was therein that He 
 had chosen them

 <B>dwelt in the land of Midian</B>--situated on the eastern shore of 
 the gulf of the Red Sea and occupied by the posterity of Midian the son 
 of Cush. The territory extended northward to the top of the gulf and 
 westward far across the desert of Sinai. And from their position near 
 the sea, they early combined trading with pastoral pursuits

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:28">Ge 37:28</A>).

 The headquarters of Jethro are supposed to have been where Dahab-Madian 
 now stands; and from Moses coming direct to that place, he may have 
 travelled with a caravan of merchants. But another place is fixed by 
 tradition in Wady Shuweib, or Jethro's valley, on the east of the 
 mountain of Moses.

 officers were usually conjoined, he was the ruler also of the people 
 called Cushites or Ethiopians, and like many other chiefs of pastoral 
 people in that early age, he still retained the faith and worship of 
 the true God.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>seven daughters</B>--were shepherdesses to whom Moses was favorably 
 introduced by an act of courtesy and courage in protecting them from 
 the rude shepherds of some neighboring tribe at a well. He afterwards 
 formed a close and permanent alliance with this family by marrying one 
 of the daughters, Zipporah, "a little bird," called a Cushite or 
 Ethiopian

 <B>he led the flock to the backside of the desert</B>--that is, on the 
 west of the desert [G<FONT SIZE=-1>ESENIUS</FONT>], assuming Jethro's 
 headquarters to have been at Dahab. The route by which Moses led his 
 flock must have been west through the wide valley called by the Arabs, 
 Wady-es-Zugherah [R<FONT SIZE=-1>OBINSON</FONT>], which led into the 
 interior of the wilderness.

 or some think from its being the old abode of "the glory"; or finally 
 from its being the theater of transactions most memorable in the 
 history of the true religion to Horeb--rather, "Horeb-ward."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Horeb</B>--that is, "dry," "desert," was the general name for the 
 mountainous district in which Sinai is situated, and of which it is a 
 part. (See on

 <A HREF="#Ex19_2">Ex 19:2</A>).

 It was used to designate the region comprehending that immense range of 
 lofty, desolate, and barren hills, at the base of which, however, there 
 are not only many patches of verdure to be seen, but almost all the 
 valleys, or <I>wadys,</I> as they are called, show a thin coating of 
 vegetation, which, towards the south, becomes more luxuriant. The Arab 
 shepherds seldom take their flocks to a greater distance than one day's 
 journey from their camp. Moses must have gone at least two days' 
 journey, and although he seems to have been only following his pastoral 
 course, that region, from its numerous springs in the clefts of the 
 rocks being the chief resort of the tribes during the summer heats, the 
 Providence of God led him thither for an important purpose.</P>

 <B>2, 3. the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of 
 fire</B>--It is common in Scripture to represent the elements and
 operations of nature, as winds, fires, earthquakes, pestilence, 
 everything enlisted in executing the divine will, as the "angels" or 
 messengers of God. But in such cases God Himself is considered as 
 really, though invisibly, present. Here the preternatural fire may be 
 primarily meant by the expression "angel of the Lord"; but it is clear 
 that under this symbol, the Divine Being was present, whose name is 
 given

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:4,6">Ex 3:4, 6</A>),

 that desert abounds, and which is generally dry and brittle, so much 
 so, that at certain seasons, a spark might kindle a district far and 
 wide into a blaze. A fire, therefore, being in the midst of such a 
 desert bush was a "great sight." It is generally supposed to have been 
 emblematic of the Israelites' condition in Egypt--oppressed by a
 grinding servitude and a bloody persecution, and yet, in spite of the 
 cruel policy that was bent on annihilating them, they continued as 
 numerous and thriving as ever. The reason was "God was in the midst of 
 them." The symbol may also represent the present state of the Jews, as 
 well as of the Church generally in the world.</P>

 manifestations which God anciently made of Himself were always 
 accompanied by clear, unmistakable signs that the communications were 
 really from heaven.  This certain evidence was given to Moses. He saw a 
 fire, but no human agent to kindle it; he heard a voice, but no human 
 lips from which it came; he saw no living Being, but One was in the 
 bush, in the heat of the flames, who knew him and addressed him by

 <B>5. put off thy shoes</B>--The direction was in conformity with a 
 usage which was well known to Moses, for the Egyptian priests observed 
 it in their temples, and it is observed in all Eastern countries where 
 the people take off their shoes or sandals, as we do our hats. But the 
 Eastern idea is not precisely the same as the Western. With us, the 
 removal of the hat is an expression of reverence for the place we 
 enter, or rather of Him who is worshipped there. With them the removal 
 of the shoes is a confession of personal defilement and conscious 
 unworthiness to stand in the presence of unspotted holiness.</P>

 announcing Himself in His covenant character, and by the welcome

 circumstances of this miraculous appearance, were such as to give him 
 an illustrious display of God's faithfulness to His promises. The

 Marvellous had been His condescension and patience in dealing with 
 Moses; and now every remaining scruple was removed by the unexpected 
 and welcome intelligence that his brother Aaron was to be his 
 colleague. God knew from the beginning what Moses would do, but He 
 reserves this motive to the last as the strongest to rouse his languid 
 heart, and Moses now fully and cordially complied with the call. If we

 that were given him, we must admire his candor and honesty in recording 
 it.</P>

 led during his illness to a strict self-examination, he was deeply 
 pained and grieved at the thought of having, to please his wife, 
 postponed or neglected the circumcision of one of his sons, probably 
 the younger. To dishonor that sign and seal of the covenant was 
 criminal in any Hebrew, peculiarly so in one destined to be the leader 
 and deliverer of the Hebrews; and he seems to have felt his sickness as 
 a merited chastisement for his sinful omission. Concerned for her 
 husband's safety, Zipporah overcomes her maternal feelings of aversion 
 to the painful rite, performs herself, by means of one of the sharp 
 flints with which that part of the desert abounds, an operation which 
 her husband, on whom the duty devolved, was unable to do, and having 
 brought the bloody evidence, exclaimed in the painful excitement of her

 from the privilege of religious worship, and as there was reason to 
 fear that a continued neglect of divine ordinances would draw down upon 
 them the judgments of offended heaven, they begged permission to go 
 three days' journey into the desert--a place of seclusion--where their 
 sacrificial observances would neither suffer interruption nor give 
 umbrage to the Egyptians. In saying this, they concealed their ultimate 
 design of abandoning the kingdom, and by making this partial request at 
 first, they probably wished to try the king's temper before they 
 disclosed their intentions any farther. But they said only what God had 
 put in their mouths

 ancient bricks are nearly all stamped with the name of a king, and they 
 were formed, as they are still in Lower Egypt, of clay mixed with 
 chopped straw and dried or hardened in the sun. The Israelites were

 it to pass.  This passage has occasioned much discussion; and it has 
 been thought by many to intimate that as the name Jehovah was not known 
 to the patriarchs, at least in the full bearing or practical experience 
 of it, the honor of the disclosure was reserved to Moses, who was the 
 first sent with a message in the name of Jehovah, and enabled to attest 
 it by a series of public miracles.</P>

 to any more communications

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:12">Ex 14:12</A>).

 Even the faith of Moses himself was faltering; and he would have
 abandoned the enterprise in despair had he not received a positive
 command from God to revisit the people without delay, and at the same 
 time renew their demand on the king in a more decisive and peremptory

 look on the circumcision of any part as denoting perfection, signified 
 its deficiency or unsuitableness by uncircumcision. The words here 
 express how painfully Moses felt his want of utterance or persuasive 
 oratory. He seems to have fallen into the same deep despondency as his 
 brethren, and to be shrinking with nervous timidity from a difficult, 
 if not desperate, cause. If he had succeeded so ill with the people, 
 whose dearest interests were all involved, what better hope could he 
 entertain of his making more impression on the heart of a king elated 
 with pride and strong in the possession of absolute power? How 
 strikingly was the indulgent forbearance of God displayed towards His 
 people amid all their backwardness to hail His announcement of 
 approaching deliverance!  No perverse complaints or careless 
 indifference on their part retarded the development of His gracious 
 purposes. On the contrary, here, as generally, the course of His 
 providence is slow in the infliction of judgments, while it moves more 
 quickly, as it were, when misery is to be relieved or benefits
 conferred.</P>

 as he would expect the ministers of his own gods to do the same works, 
 the contest, in the nature of the case, would be one of miracles. 
 Notice has already been taken of the rod of Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:2">Ex 4:2</A>),

 but rods were carried also by all nobles and official persons in the
 court of Pharaoh. It was an Egyptian custom, and the rods were symbols
 of authority or rank. Hence God commanded His servants to use a
 rod.</P>

 <B>11. Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers,</B> 
 &c.--His object in calling them was to ascertain whether this doing of 
 Aaron's was really a work of divine power or merely a feat of magical 
 art. The magicians of Egypt in modern times have been long celebrated 
 adepts in charming serpents, and particularly by pressing the nape of 
 the neck, they throw them into a kind of catalepsy, which renders them 
 stiff and immovable--thus seeming to change them into a rod. They 
 conceal the serpent about their persons, and by acts of legerdemain 
 produce it from their dress, stiff and straight as a rod. Just the same 
 trick was played off by their ancient predecessors, the most renowned 
 of whom, Jannes and Jambres

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:8">2Ti 3:8</A>),

 were called in on this occasion.  They had time after the summons to 
 make suitable preparations--and so it appears they succeeded by their 
 "enchantments" in practising an illusion on the senses.</P>

 first impressions, they were soon dispelled; and when he found his

 men.</P>

 <B>15. Get thee unto Pharaoh</B>--Now began those appalling miracles of 
 judgment by which the God of Israel, through His ambassadors, proved 
 His sole and unchallengeable supremacy over all the gods of Egypt, and 
 which were the natural phenomena of Egypt, at an unusual season, and in 
 a miraculous degree of intensity. The court of Egypt, whether held at 
 Rameses, or Memphis, or Tanis in the field of Zoan

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:12">Ps 78:12</A>),

 was the scene of those extraordinary transactions, and Moses must have
 resided during that terrible period in the immediate neighborhood.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water</B>--for the purpose 
 of ablutions or devotions perhaps; for the Nile was an object of 
 superstitious reverence, the patron deity of the country. It might be 
 that Moses had been denied admission into the palace; but be that as it 
 may, the river was to be the subject of the first plague, and 
 therefore, he was ordered to repair to its banks with the 
 miracle-working rod, now to be raised, not in demonstration, but in 
 judgment, if the refractory spirit of the king should still refuse 
 consent to Israel's departure for their sacred rites.</P>

 <B>17-21. Aaron lifted up the rod and smote the waters,</B>
 &c.--Whether the water was changed into real blood, or only the 
 appearance of it (and Omnipotence could effect the one as easily as the 
 other), this was a severe calamity. How great must have been the 
 disappointment and disgust throughout the land when the river became of 
 a blood red color, of which they had a national abhorrence; their 
 favorite beverage became a nauseous draught, and the fish, which formed 
 so large an article of food, were destroyed.  [See on

 <A HREF="JFB04.htm#Nu11_5">Nu 11:5</A>.]

 The immense scale on which the plague was inflicted is seen by its 
 extending to "the streams," or branches of the Nile--to the "rivers," 
 the canals, the "ponds" and "pools," that which is left after an 
 overflow, the reservoirs, and the many domestic vessels in which the 
 Nile water was kept to filter. And accordingly the sufferings of the 
 people from thirst must have been severe. Nothing could more humble the 
 pride of Egypt than this dishonor brought on their national god.</P>

 therefore their imitation must have been on a small scale --the only 
 drinkable water available being dug among the sands. It must have been 
 on a sample or specimen of water dyed red with some coloring matter. 
 But it was sufficient to serve as a pretext or command for the king to 
 turn unmoved and go to his house.</P>

 <B>1. the Lord spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh</B>--The duration of 
 the first plague for a whole week must have satisfied all that it was 
 produced not by any accidental causes, but by the agency of omnipotent 
 power. As a judgment of God, however, it produced no good effect, and 
 Moses was commanded to wait on the king and threaten him, in the event 
 of his continued obstinacy, with the infliction of a new and different 
 plague. As Pharaoh's answer is not given, it may be inferred to have

 instrument of affliction, whether from reverence or abhorrence, was an 
 object of national superstition with the Egyptians, the god Ptha being 
 represented with a frog's head. But the vast numbers, together with 
 their stench, made them an intolerable nuisance so that the king was so 
 far humbled as to promise that, if Moses would intercede for their 
 removal, he would consent to the departure of Israel, and in compliance 
 with this appeal, they were withdrawn at the very hour named by the 
 monarch himself. But many, while suffering the consequences of their 
 sins, make promises of amendment and obedience which they afterwards 
 forget; and so Pharaoh, when he saw there was a respite, was again 
 hardened

 the original term. In ordinary circumstances they embitter life in 
 Eastern countries, and therefore the <I>terrible</I> nature of this 
 infliction on Egypt may be imagined when no precautions could preserve 
 from their painful sting. The very smallness and insignificance of 
 these fierce insects made them a dreadful scourge. The magicians never 
 attempted any imitation, and what neither the blood of the river nor 
 the nuisance of the frogs had done, the visitation of this tiny enemy 
 constrained them to acknowledge "this is the finger of God"--properly

 to meet him while walking on the banks of the Nile and repeat his 
 request for the liberation of Israel, threatening in case of continued 
 refusal to cover every house from the palace to the cottage with swarms 
 of flies--while, as a proof of the power that accomplished this 
 judgment, the land of Goshen should be exempted from the calamity. The 
 appeal was equally vain as before, and the predicted evil overtook the 
 country in the form of what was not "flies," such as we are accustomed 
 to, but divers sorts of flies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:45">Ps 78:45</A>),

 the gad fly, the cockroach, the Egyptian beetle, for all these are 
 mentioned by different writers. They are very destructive, some of them 
 inflicting severe bites on animals, others destroying clothes, books, 
 plants, every thing. The worship of flies, particularly of the beetle, 
 was a prominent part of the religion of the ancient Egyptians. The 
 employment of these winged deities to chastise them must have been 
 painful and humiliating to the Egyptians while it must at the same time 
 have strengthened the faith of the Israelites in the God of their 
 fathers as the only object of worship.</P>

 the king followed the course of expediency; he proposed to let them 
 free to engage in their religious rites within any part of the kingdom. 
 But true to his instructions, Moses would accede to no such 
 arrangement; he stated a most valid reason to show the danger of it, 
 and the king having yielded so far as to allow them a brief holiday 
 <I>across the border,</I> annexed to this concession a request that 
 Moses would entreat with Jehovah for the removal of the plague. He 
 promised to do so, and it was removed the following day. But no sooner 
 was the pressure over than the spirit of Pharaoh, like a bent bow, 
 sprang back to its wonted obduracy, and, regardless of his promise, he 
 refused to let the people depart.</P>

 application was made to Pharaoh in behalf of the Israelites by Moses, 
 who was instructed to tell him that, if he persisted in opposing their 
 departure, a pestilence would be sent among all the flocks and herds of 
 the Egyptians, while those of the Israelites would be spared. As he 
 showed no intention of keeping his promise, he was still a mark for the 
 arrows of the Almighty's quiver, and the threatened plague of which he
 was forewarned was executed. But it is observable that in this instance
 it was not inflicted through the instrumentality or waving of Aaron's
 rod, but directly by the hand of the Lord, and the fixing of the
 precise time tended still further to determine the true character of
 the calamity

 that there were still some left; but a great many died of each 
 herd--the mortality was frequent and widespread. The adaptation of this 
 judgment consisted in Egyptians venerating the more useful animals such 
 as the ox, the cow, and the ram; in all parts of the country temples 
 were reared and divine honors paid to these domesticated beasts, and

 That this epidemic did not arise from natural causes was evident from 
 its taking effect from the particular action of Moses done in the sight 
 of Pharaoh. The attitude he assumed was similar to that of Eastern 
 magicians, who, "when they pronounce an imprecation on an individual, a 
 village, or a country, take the ashes of cows' dung (that is, from a 
 common fire) and throw them in the air, saying to the objects of their 
 displeasure, such a sickness or such a curse shall come upon you"

 <B>18. I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail,</B> &c.--The 
 seventh plague which Pharaoh's hardened heart provoked was that of 
 hail, a phenomenon which must have produced the greatest astonishment 
 and consternation in Egypt as rain and hailstones, accompanied by 
 thunder and lightning, were very rare occurrences.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>such as hath not been in Egypt</B>--In the Delta, or lower Egypt, 
 where the scene is laid, rain occasionally falls between January and 
 March--hail is not unknown, and thunder sometimes heard. But a storm, 
 not only exhibiting all these elements, but so terrific that hailstones 
 of immense size fell, thunder pealed in awful volleys, and lightning 
 swept the ground like fire, was an unexampled calamity.</P>

 <B>20, 21. He that feared the word of the Lord .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. regarded

 the impending tempest--the cattle seem to have been sent out to graze, 
 which is from January to April, when alone pasturage can be obtained, 
 and accordingly the cattle were in the fields. This storm occurring at 
 that season, not only struck universal terror into the minds of the 
 people, but occasioned the destruction of all--people and 
 cattle--which, in neglect of the warning, had been left in the fields, 
 as well as of all vegetation

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:25">Ex 9:25</A>].

 It was the more appalling because hailstones in Egypt are small and of 
 little force; lightning also is scarcely ever known to produce fatal 
 effects; and to enhance the wonder, not a trace of any storm was found 
 in Goshen

 seriously impress the mind of Pharaoh, and, under the weight of his 
 convictions, he humbles himself to confess he has done wrong in 
 opposing the divine will. At the same time he calls for Moses to 
 intercede for cessation of the calamity. Moses accedes to his earnest 
 wishes, and this most awful visitation ended. But his repentance proved 
 a transient feeling, and his obduracy soon became as great as

 <B>31, 32. the flax and the barley was smitten,</B> &c.--The 
 peculiarities that are mentioned in these cereal products arise from 
 the climate and physical constitution of Egypt. In that country flax 
 and barley are almost ripe when wheat and rye (spelt) are green. And 
 hence the flax must have been "bolled"--that is, risen in stalk or 
 podded in February, thus fixing the particular month when the event 
 took place. Barley ripens about a month earlier than wheat. Flax and 
 barley are generally ripe in March, wheat and rye (properly, spelt) in 
 April.</P>

 there, and the permanent record of them still, might furnish a salutary 
 and impressive lesson to the Church down to the latest ages. Worldly 
 historians might have described them as extraordinary occurrences that

 renew the request, so often made and denied, with an assurance that an 
 unfavorable answer would be followed on the morrow by an invasion of 
 locusts. This species of insect resembles a large, spotted, red and 
 black, double-winged grasshopper, about three inches or less in length, 
 with the two hind legs working like hinged springs of immense strength 
 and elasticity. Perhaps no more terrible scourge was ever brought on a 
 land than those voracious insects, which fly in such countless numbers 
 as to darken the land which they infest; and on whatever place they 
 alight, they convert it into a waste and barren desert, stripping the 
 ground of its verdure, the trees of their leaves and bark, and 
 producing in a few hours a degree of desolation which it requires the 
 lapse of years to repair.</P>

 suffered serious losses from the late visitations, and the prospect of
 such a calamity as that which was threatened and the magnitude of which
 former experience enabled them to realize, led them to make a strong
 remonstrance with the king. Finding himself not seconded by his
 counsellors in his continued resistance, he recalled Moses and Aaron,
 and having expressed his consent to their departure, inquired who were
 to go. The prompt and decisive reply, "all," neither man nor beast
 shall remain, raised a storm of indignant fury in the breast of the
 proud king. He would permit the grown-up men to go away; but no other
 terms would be listened to.</P>

 he is unwilling to grant, he makes a signal to his attendants, who rush 
 forward and, seizing the obnoxious suppliant by the neck, drag him out 
 of the chamber with violent haste. Of such a character was the 
 impassioned scene in the court of Egypt when the king had wrought 
 himself into such a fit of uncontrollable fury as to treat 
 ignominiously the two venerable representatives of the Hebrew
 people.</P>

 <B>13-19. the Lord brought an east wind</B>--The rod of Moses was again
 raised, and the locusts came. They are natives of the desert and are
 only brought by an east wind into Egypt, where they sometimes come in
 sun-obscuring clouds, destroying in a few days every green blade in the
 track they traverse. Man, with all his contrivances, can do nothing to
 protect himself from the overwhelming invasion. Egypt has often
 suffered from locusts. But the plague that followed the wave of the
 miraculous rod was altogether unexampled. Pharaoh, fearing
 irretrievable ruin to his country, sent in haste for Moses, and
 confessing his sin, implored the intercession of Moses, who entreated
 the Lord, and a "mighty strong west wind took away the locusts."</P>

 of the loose outer cloth being drawn up and fastened in the girdle, so 
 as to leave the leg and knee free for motion. As to the other, the 
 Orientals never wear shoes indoors, and the ancient Egyptians, as

 The exclusion of leaven for seven days would not be attended with

 becomes sour, and it is kept from one day to another for the purpose of 
 preserving leaven in readiness. Thus even were there none in all the 
 country, it could be got within twenty-four hours

 <B>29. at midnight the Lord smote all the first-born in the land of

 instituted feast in the singular manner described, the threatened 
 calamity overtook the Egyptians. It is more easy to imagine than 
 describe the confusion and terror of that people suddenly roused from 
 sleep and enveloped in darkness--none could assist their neighbors when 
 the groans of the dying and the wild shrieks of mourners were heard 
 everywhere around. The hope of every family was destroyed at a stroke.  
 This judgment, terrible though it was, evinced the equity of divine 
 retribution. For eighty years the Egyptians had caused the male 
 children of the Israelites to be cast into the river

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+1:16">Ex 1:16</A>],

 and now all their own first-born fell under the stroke of the 
 destroying angel. They were made, in the justice of God, to feel 
 something of what they had made His people feel. Many a time have the 
 hands of sinners made the snares in which they have themselves been 
 entangled, and fallen into the pit which they have dug for the 
 righteous

 And it is probable that, in expectation of their departure, which the 
 king on one pretext or another delayed, the Israelites had been 
 assembled there as a general rendezvous. In journeying from Rameses to 
 Palestine, there was a choice of two routes--the one along the shores 
 of the Mediterranean to El-Arish, the other more circuitous round the 
 head of the Red Sea and the desert of Sinai. The latter Moses was 
 directed to take

 above that age is as nearly as possible the half of the total number of 
 males, the whole male population of Israel, on this computation, would

 of marine plants with which it abounds. But the name of the Red Sea is 
 not so easily traced. Some think it was given from its contiguity to 
 the countries of Edom ("red"); others derive it from its coral rocks; 
 while a third class ascribe the origin of the name to an extremely red 
 appearance of the water in some parts, caused by a numberless multitude 
 of very small mollusca. This sea, at its northern extremity, separates 
 into two smaller inlets--the eastern called anciently the Elanitic 
 gulf, now the gulf of Akaba; and the western the Heroopolite gulf, now 
 the gulf of Suez, which, there can be no doubt, extended much more to 
 the north anciently than it does now. It was toward the latter the

 <B>2. Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and 
 encamp</B>--The Israelites had now completed their three days' journey, 
 and at Etham the decisive step would have to be taken whether they 
 would celebrate their intended feast and return, or march onwards by 
 the head of the Red Sea into the desert, with a view to a final 
 departure. They were already on the borders of the desert, and a short 
 march would have placed them beyond the reach of pursuit, as the 
 chariots of Egypt could have made little progress over dry and yielding 
 sand. But at Etham, instead of pursuing their journey eastward with the 
 sea on their right, they were suddenly commanded to diverge to the 
 south, keeping the gulf on their left; a route which not only detained 
 them lingering on the confines of Egypt, but, in adopting it, they 
 actually turned their backs on the land of which they had set out to 
 obtain the possession. A movement so unexpected, and of which the 
 ultimate design was carefully concealed, could not but excite the 
 astonishment of all, even of Moses himself, although, from his implicit 
 faith in the wisdom and power of his heavenly Guide, he obeyed. The 
 object was to entice Pharaoh to pursue, in order that the moral effect, 
 which the judgments on Egypt had produced in releasing God's people 
 from bondage, might be still further extended over the nations by the 
 awful events transacted at the Red Sea.

 appeared to have fallen by entering that defile, he could intercept 
 them. He believed them now entirely in his power, the mountain chain 
 being on one side, the sea on the other, so that, if he pursued them in 
 the rear, escape seemed impossible.</P>

 reappears! He had been convinced, but not converted--overawed, but not 
 sanctified by the appalling judgments of heaven. He bitterly repented 
 of what he now thought a hasty concession. Pride and revenge, the honor 
 of his kingdom, and the interests of his subjects, all prompted him to 
 recall his permission to reclaim those runaway slaves and force them to 
 their wonted labor. Strange that he should yet allow such 
 considerations to obliterate or outweigh all his painful experience of 
 the danger of oppressing that people. But those whom the Lord has

 evidently composed the king's guard, amounting to six hundred, and they 
 are called "chosen," literally, "third men"; three men being allotted 
 to each chariot, the charioteer and two warriors. As to "the chariots 
 of Egypt," the common cars contained only two persons, one for driving 
 and the other for fighting; sometimes only one person was in the 
 chariot, the driver lashed the reins round his body and fought; 
 infantry being totally unsuitable for a rapid pursuit, and the 
 Egyptians having had no cavalry, the word "riders" is in the 
 grammatical connection applied to war chariots employed, and these were 
 of light construction, open behind, and hung on small wheels.</P>

 deep dismay and absolute despair at the sight of this armed host 
 receives a satisfactory explanation from the fact that the civilized 
 state of Egyptian society required the absence of all arms, except when

 formidable of which was the vengeance of a seditious and desperate 
 multitude; but his meek, unruffled, magnanimous composure presents one 
 of the sublimest examples of moral courage to be found in history. And 
 whence did his courage arise? He saw the miraculous cloud still

 would cut the sea in that line. The <I>Hebrew</I> word <I>kedem,</I>

 signification, <I>previous;</I> so that this verse might, perhaps, be 
 rendered, "the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong 
 <I>previous</I> wind all that night"; a rendering which would remove 
 the difficulty of supposing the host of Israel marched over on the 
 sand, in the teeth of a rushing column of wind, strong enough to heap 
 up the waters as a wall on each side of a dry path, and give the

 doubtless enriched them with arms, which they had not before. The

 to this point; and where the sea, not above two miles broad, could be 
 crossed in a short time.  The vast majority, however, who have examined 
 the spot, reject this opinion, and fix the passage, as does local 
 tradition, about ten or twelve miles further down the shore at Wady 
 Tawarik. "The time of the miracle was the whole night, at the season of 
 the year, too, when the night would be about its average length. The 
 sea at that point extends from six and a half to eight miles in 
 breadth. There was thus ample time for the passage of the Israelites 
 from any part of the valley, especially considering their excitement 
 and animation by the gracious and wonderful interposition of Providence 
 in their behalf" [W<FONT SIZE=-1>ILSON</FONT>].</P>

 <B>1. Then sang Moses and the children of Israel</B>--The scene of this
 thanksgiving song is supposed to have been at the landing place on the
 eastern shore of the Red Sea, at Ayoun Musa, "the fountains of Moses."
 They are situated somewhat farther northward along the shore than the
 opposite point from which the Israelites set out. But the line of the
 people would be extended during the passage, and one extremity of it
 would reach as far north as these fountains, which would supply them
 with water on landing. The time when it was sung is supposed to have
 been the morning after the passage. This song is, by some hundred
 years, the oldest poem in the world. There is a sublimity and beauty
 in the language that is unexampled. But its unrivalled superiority
 arises not solely from the splendor of the diction. Its poetical
 excellencies have often drawn forth the admiration of the best judges,

 children of Israel generally were qualified to commit to memory or to 
 appreciate the beauties of this inimitable song. But they might 
 perfectly understand its pervading strain of sentiment; and, with the 
 view of suitably improving the occasion, it was thought necessary that 
 all, old and young, should join their united voices in the rehearsal of

 found growing around all brackish fountains. But neither of these
 shrubs are known by the natives to possess such natural virtues. It is
 far more likely that God miraculously endowed some tree with the
 property of purifying the bitter water--a tree employed as the medium,

 tree, but the power of God (compare

 <B>2. the whole congregation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. murmured against Moses and
 Aaron</B>--Modern travellers through the desert of Sinai are accustomed
 to take as much as is sufficient for the sustenance of men and beasts
 during forty days. The Israelites having been rather more than a month
 on their journey, their store of corn or other provisions was
 altogether or nearly exhausted; and there being no prospect of
 procuring any means of subsistence in the desert, except some wild
 olives and wild honey 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:13">De 32:13</A>),

 <B>3. Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of 
 Egypt</B>--How unreasonable and absurd the charge against Moses and 
 Aaron!  how ungrateful and impious against God! After all their 
 experience of the divine wisdom, goodness, and power, we pause and 
 wonder over the sacred narrative of their hardness and unbelief. But 
 the expression of feeling is contagious in so vast a multitude, and 
 there is a feeling of solitude and despondency in the desert which 
 numbers cannot dispel; and besides, we must remember that they were men 
 engrossed with the <I>present</I>--that the Comforter was not then 
 given--and that they were destitute of all visible means of sustenance 
 and cut off from every visible comfort, with only the promises of an 
 <I>unseen</I> God to look to as the ground of their hope. And though we 
 may lament they should tempt God in the wilderness and freely admit 
 their sin in so doing, we can be at no loss for a reason why those who 
 had all their lives been accustomed to walk by <I>sight</I> should, in 
 circumstances of unparalleled difficulty and perplexity, find it hard 
 to walk by <I>faith.</I> Do not even <I>we</I> find it difficult to 
 walk by faith through the wilderness of this world, though in the light 
 of a clearer revelation, and under a nobler leader than Moses?  [F<FONT

 <B>13-31. at even the quails came up, and covered the camp</B>--This
 bird is of the gallinaceous kind [that is, relating to the order of
 heavy-bodied, largely terrestrial birds], resembling the red partridge,
 but not larger than the turtledove. They are found in certain seasons
 in the places through which the Israelites passed, being migratory
 birds, and they were probably brought to the camp by "a wind from the
 Lord" as on another occasion

 <B>and in the morning .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a small round thing
 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. manna</B>--There is a gum of the same name distilled in
 this desert region from the tamarisk, which is much prized by the
 natives, and preserved carefully by those who gather it. It is
 collected early in the morning, melts under the heat of the sun, and is
 congealed by the cold of night. In taste it is as sweet as honey, and
 has been supposed by distinguished travellers, from its whitish color,
 time, and place of its appearance, to be the manna on which the 
 Israelites were fed: so that, according to the views of some, it was a 
 production indigenous to the desert; according to others, there was a 
 miracle, which consisted, however, only in the preternatural 
 arrangements regarding its supply. But more recent and accurate 
 examination has proved this gum of the tarfa-tree to be wanting in all 
 the principal characteristics of the Scripture manna. It exudes only in 
 small quantities, and not every year; it does not admit of being baked

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:8">Nu 11:8</A>)
 
 or boiled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:23">Ex 16:23</A>).
 
 Though it may be exhaled by the heat and afterwards fall with the dew,
 it is a medicine, not food--it is well known to the natives of the
 desert, while the Israelites were strangers to theirs; and in taste as
 well as in the appearance of double quantity on Friday, none on
 Sabbath, and in not breeding worms, it is essentially different from
 the manna furnished to the Israelites.</P>

 mere fact of such a multitude being fed for forty years in the 
 wilderness, where no food of any kind is to be obtained, will show the 
 utter impossibility of their subsisting on a natural production of the 
 kind and quantity as this tarfa-gum [see on

 <B>1. the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of 
 Sin</B>--In the succinct annals of this book, those places only are 
 selected for particular notice by the inspired historian, which were 
 scenes memorable for their happy or painful interest in the history of 
 the Israelites. A more detailed itinerary is given in the later books 
 of Moses, and we find that here two stations are omitted

 <B>pitched in Rephidim</B>--now believed, on good grounds, to be Wady 
 Feiran, which is exactly a day's march from Mount Sinai, and at the 
 entrance of the Horeb district. It is a long circuitous defile about 
 forty feet in breadth, with perpendicular granite rocks on both sides. 
 The wilderness of Sin through which they approached to this valley is 
 very barren, has an extremely dry and thirsty aspect, little or no 
 water, scarcely even a dwarfish shrub to be seen, and the only shelter 
 to the panting pilgrims is under the shadow of the great overhanging
 cliffs.</P>

 <B>2, 3. the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that 
 we may drink,</B> &c.--The want of water was a privation, the severity 
 of which we cannot estimate, and it was a great trial to the 
 Israelites, but their conduct on this new occasion was outrageous; it 
 amounted even to "a tempting of the Lord." It was an opposition to His 
 minister, a distrust of His care, an indifference to His kindness, an 
 unbelief in His providence, a trying of His patience and fatherly 
 forbearance.</P>

 <B>4. Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, What shall I do unto this 
 people?</B>--His language, instead of betraying any signs of resentment 
 or vindictive imprecation on a people who had given him a cruel and 
 unmerited treatment, was the expression of an anxious wish to know what 
 was the best to be done in the circumstances (compare

 the infant Saviour was lodged

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:9">Mt 2:9</A>].

 And from the rod-smitten rock there forthwith gushed a current of pure 
 and refreshing water. It was perhaps the greatest miracle performed by 
 Moses, and in many respects bore a resemblance to the greatest of 
 Christ's: being done without ostentation and in the presence of a few 
 chosen witnesses

 <B>8. Then came Amalek</B>--Some time probably elapsed before they were
 exposed to this new evil; and the presumption of there being such an
 interval affords the only ground on which we can satisfactorily account
 for the altered, the better, and former spirit that animated the people
 in this sudden contest. The miracles of the manna and the water from
 the rock had produced a deep impression and permanent conviction that
 God was indeed among them; and with feelings elevated by the conscious
 experience of the Divine Presence and aid, they remained calm,
 resolute, and courageous under the attack of their unexpected foe.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>fought with Israel</B>--The language implies that no occasion had 
 been furnished for this attack; but, as descendants of Esau, the 
 Amalekites entertained a deep-seated grudge against them, especially as 
 the rapid prosperity and marvellous experience of Israel showed that 
 the blessing contained in the birthright was taking effect. It seems to 
 have been a mean, dastardly, insidious surprise on the rear

 This is the earliest notice of a young warrior destined to act a 
 prominent part in the history of Israel. He went with a number of 
 picked men.  There is not here a wide open plain on which the battle 
 took place, as according to the rules of modern warfare. The Amalekites 
 were a nomadic tribe, making an irregular attack on a multitude 
 probably not better trained than themselves, and for such a conflict 
 the low hills and open country around this wady would afford ample

 "desert of Sinai" is that wild and desolate region which occupies the

 and red granite, and of valleys for the most part bare of verdure.

 <B>and there Israel camped before the mount</B>--Sinai, so called from 
 Seneh, or acacia bush. It is now called Jebel Musa. Their way into the 
 interior of the gigantic cluster was by Wady Feiran, which would lead 
 the bulk of the hosts with their flocks and herds into the high valleys 
 of Jebel Musa, with their abundant springs, especially into the great 
 thoroughfare of the desert--the longest, widest, and most continuous of 
 all the valleys, the Wady-es-Sheikh, while many would be scattered 
 among the adjacent valleys; so that thus secluded from the world in a 
 wild and sublime amphitheatre of rocks, they "camped before the mount." 
 "In this valley--a long flat valley--about a quarter of a mile in 
 breadth, winding northwards, Israel would find ample room for their 
 encampment. Of all the wadys in that region, it seems the most suitable

 <B>Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob,</B> &c.--The object for 
 which Moses went up was to receive and convey to the people the message 
 contained in these verses, and the purport of which was a general 
 announcement of the terms on which God was to take the Israelites into 
 a close and peculiar relation to Himself. In thus negotiating between 
 God and His people, the highest post of duty which any mortal man was 
 ever called to occupy, Moses was still but a servant. The only Mediator 
 is Jesus Christ

 through the medium of the senses; and so He who knew what was in man 
 signalized His descent at the inauguration of the ancient church, by 
 all the sensible tokens of august majesty that were fitted to produce 
 the conviction that He is the great and terrible God. The whole 
 multitude must have anticipated the event with feelings of intense 
 solemnity and awe. The extraordinary preparations enjoined, the 
 ablutions and rigid abstinence they were required to observe, the 
 barriers erected all round the base of the mount, and the stern 
 penalties annexed to the breach of any of the conditions, all tended to 
 create an earnest and solemn expectation which increased as the

 imagination can conceive connected with the ideas of grandeur and of 
 awe. But all was in keeping with the character of the law about to be 
 proclaimed. As the mountain burned with fire, God was exhibited as a 
 consuming fire to the transgressors of His law. The thunder and 
 lightning, more awful amid the deep stillness of the region and 
 reverberating with terrific peals among the mountains, would rouse the 
 universal attention; a thick cloud was an apt emblem of the dark and 
 shadowy dispensation (compare

 <B>17. Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with 
 God</B>--Wady-er-Raheh, where they stood, has a spacious sandy plain; 
 immediately in front of Es Suksafeh, considered by R<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OBINSON</FONT> to be the mount from which the law was given. 
 "We measured it, and estimate the whole plain at two geographical miles 
 long, and ranging in breadth from one-third to two-thirds of a mile, or 
 as equivalent to a surface of one square mile. This space is nearly 
 doubled by the recess on the west, and by the broad and level area of 
 Wady-es-Sheikh on the east, which issues at right angles to the plain, 
 and is equally in view of the front and summit of the mount. The 
 examination convinced us that here was space enough to satisfy all the 
 requisitions of the Scripture narrative, so far as it relates to the 
 assembling of the congregation to receive the law. Here, too, one can 
 see the fitness of the injunction to set bounds around the mount, that 
 neither man nor beast might approach too near, for it rises like a 
 perpendicular wall." But Jebel Musa, the old traditional Sinai, and the 
 highest peak, has also a spacious valley, Wady Sebaiyeh, capable of 
 holding the people. It is not certain on which of these two they 
 stood.</P>

 fourfold; for an ox fivefold, because of its greater utility in labor;

 remainder, the owners of fields not being allowed to reap or collect 
 the fruits of the vineyard or oliveyard during the course of this

 All the males were enjoined to repair to the tabernacle and afterwards 
 the temple, and the women frequently went. The institution of this 
 national custom was of the greatest importance in many ways: by keeping 
 up a national sense of religion and a public uniformity in worship, by 
 creating a bond of unity, and also by promoting internal commerce among 
 the people. Though the absence of all the males at these three 
 festivals left the country defenseless, a special promise was given of 
 divine protection, and no incursion of enemies was ever permitted to 
 happen on those occasions.</P>

 It must have been a deeply impressive, as well as instructive scene,
 for it taught the Israelites that the covenant was made with them only 
 through the sprinkling of blood--that the divine acceptance of 
 themselves and services, was only by virtue of an atoning sacrifice, 
 and that even the blessings of the <I>national</I> covenant were 
 promised and secured to them only through grace. The ceremonial,

 and he evinced the piety as well as humility of his character, in
 readily complying with the command to invest his brother with the 
 sacred office, though it involved the perpetual exclusion of his own 
 family. The appointment was a special act of God's sovereignty, so
 that there could be no ground for popular umbrage by the selection of 
 Aaron's family, with whom the office was inalienably established and

 In material, elaborate embroidery, and color, it had an imposing 
 splendor. The tabernacle being adapted to the infantine aid of the
 church, it was right and necessary that the priests' garments should be 
 of such superb and dazzling appearance, that the people might be 
 inspired with a due respect for the ministers as well as the rites of 
 religion. But they had also a further meaning; for being all made of 
 linen, they were symbolical of the truth, purity, and other qualities 
 in Christ that rendered Him such a high priest as became us.</P>

 curiously embroidered, and dyed with variegated colors, and further 
 enriched with golden tissue, the threads of gold being either 
 originally interwoven or afterwards inserted by the embroiderer. It was 
 short--reaching from the breast to a little below the loins--and though 
 destitute of sleeves, retained its position by the support of straps 
 thrown over each shoulder. These straps or braces, connecting the one 
 with the back, the other with the front piece of which the tunic was 
 composed, were united on the shoulder by two onyx stones, serving as 
 buttons, and on which the names of the twelve tribes were engraved, and 
 set in golden encasements. The symbolical design of this was, that the 
 high priest, who bore the names along with him in all his ministrations 
 before the Lord, might be kept in remembrance of his duty to plead 
 their cause, and supplicate the accomplishment of the divine promises 
 in their favor. The ephod was fastened by a girdle of the same costly 
 materials, that is, dyed, embroidered, and wrought with threads of 
 gold. It was about a handbreadth wide and wound twice round the upper 
 part of the waist; it fastened in front, the ends hanging down at great 
 length

 the precious stones in it. There were twelve different stones, 
 containing each the name of a tribe, and arranged in four rows, three 
 in each. The Israelites had acquired a knowledge of the lapidary's art 
 in Egypt, and the amount of their skill in cutting, polishing, and 
 setting precious stones, may be judged of by the diamond forming one of 
 the engraved ornaments on this breastplate. A ring was attached to each 
 corner, through which the golden chains were passed to fasten this 
 brilliant piece of jewelry at the top and bottom tightly on the breast 
 of the ephod.</P>

 They received the name because the bearing of them qualified the high
 priest to consult the divine oracle on all public or national 
 emergencies, by going into the holy place--standing close before the 
 veil and putting his hand upon the Urim and Thummim, he conveyed a 
 petition from the people and asked counsel of God, who, as the 
 Sovereign of Israel, gave response from the midst of His glory. Little, 
 however, is known about them. But it may be remarked that Egyptian 
 judges wore on the breast of their official robes a representation of 
 Justice, and the high priest in Israel long officiated also as a judge; 
 so that some think the Urim and Thummim had a reference to his judicial 
 functions.</P>

 The high priest's was of a sky-blue color. The binding at the neck was

 <B>1. hallow them, to minister unto me in the priest's office</B>--The 
 act of inaugurating the priests was accompanied by ceremonial 
 solemnities well calculated not only to lead the people to entertain 
 exalted views of the office, but to impress those functionaries 
 themselves with a profound sense of its magnitude and importance. In 
 short, they were taught to know that the service was for them as well 
 as for the people; and every time they engaged in a new performance of 
 their duties, they were reminded of their personal interest in the 
 worship, by being obliged to offer for themselves, before they were 
 qualified to offer as the representatives of the people.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>this is the thing that thou shalt do</B>--Steps are taken at the 
 beginning of a society, which would not be repeated when the social

 <B>wash them with water. And .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. take the garments</B>--The 
 manner in which these parts of the ceremonial were performed is 
 minutely described, and in discovering their symbolical import, which 
 indeed, is sufficiently plain and obvious, we have inspired authority 
 to guide us. It signified the necessity and importance of moral purity 
 or holiness

 In like manner, the investiture with the holy garments signified their
 being clothed with righteousness

 and equipped as men active and well-prepared for the service of God;
 the anointing the high priest with oil denoted that he was to be filled 
 with the influences of the Spirit, for the edification and delight of 
 the church

 <B>10-22. And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the 
 tabernacle</B>--This part of the ceremonial consisted of three 
 sacrifices: (1) The sacrifice of a bullock, as a sin offering; and in 
 rendering it, the priest was directed to put his hand upon the head of 
 his sacrifice, expressing by that act a consciousness of personal 
 guilt, and a wish that it might be accepted as a vicarious 
 satisfaction. (2) The sacrifice of a ram as a burnt offering

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:15-18">Ex 29:15-18</A>).

 The ram was to be wholly burnt, in token of the priest's dedication of
 himself to God and His service. The sin offering was first to be 
 presented, and <I>then</I> the burnt offering; for until guilt be 
 removed, no acceptable service can be performed. (3) There was to be a 
 peace offering, called "the ram of consecration"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:19-22">Ex 29:19-22</A>).

 And there was a marked peculiarity in the manner in which this other
 ram was to be disposed of. The former was for the glory of God--this 
 was for the comfort of the priest himself; and as a sign of a mutual 
 covenant being ratified, the blood of the sacrifice was divided--part 
 sprinkled on the altar round about, and part upon the persons and 
 garments of the priests. Nay, the blood was, by a singular act, 
 directed to be put upon the extremities of the body, thereby signifying 
 that the benefits of the atonement would be applied to the whole nature 
 of man. Moreover, the flesh of this sacrifice was to be divided, as it 
 were, between God and the priest--part of it to be put into his hand to 
 be waved up and down, in token of its being offered to God, and then it 
 was to be burnt upon the altar; the other part was to be eaten by the 
 priests at the door of the tabernacle--that feast being a symbol of 
 communion or fellowship with God. These ceremonies, performed in the 
 order described, showed the qualifications necessary for the priests.

 <B>2-4. foursquare</B>--the meaning of which is not that it was to be 
 entirely of a cubical form, but that upon its upper and under surface, 
 it showed four equal sides. It was twice as high as it was broad, being 
 twenty-one inches broad and three feet six inches high. It had "horns"; 
 its top or flat surface was surmounted by an ornamental ledge or rim, 
 called a crown, and it was furnished at the sides with rings for 
 carriage. Its only accompanying piece of furniture was a golden censer 
 or pan, in which the incense was set fire to upon the altar. Hence it 
 was called the altar of incense, or the "golden altar"

 from the profuse degree in which it was gilded or overlaid with the
 precious metal. This splendor was adapted to the early age of the 
 church, but in later times, when the worship was to be more spiritual, 
 the altar of incense is prophetically described as not of gold but of 
 wood, and double the size of that in the tabernacle, because the church 
 should be vastly extended

 altar was in the middle between the table of showbread and the 
 candlestick next the holy of holies, at equal distances from the north 
 and south walls; in other words, it occupied a spot on the outside of 
 the great partition veil, but directly in front of the mercy seat, 
 which was within that sacred enclosure; so that although the priest who 
 ministered at this altar could not behold the mercy seat, he was to 
 look towards it, and present his incense in that direction. This was a 
 special arrangement, and it was designed to teach the important lesson 
 that, though we cannot with the eye of sense, see the throne of grace, 
 we must "direct our prayer to it and look up"

 <B>7, 8. Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense</B>--literally, 
 "incense of spices"--Strong aromatic substances were burnt upon this 
 altar to counteract by their odoriferous fragrance the offensive fumes 
 of the sacrifices; or the incense was employed in an offering of 
 tributary homage which the Orientals used to make as a mark of honor to 
 kings; and as God was Theocratic Ruler of Israel, <I>His</I> palace was 
 not to be wanting in a usage of such significancy. Both these ends were 
 served by this altar--that of fumigating the apartments of the sacred 
 edifice, while the pure lambent flame, according to Oriental notions, 
 was an honorary tribute to the majesty of Israel's King. But there was 
 a far higher meaning in it still; for as the tabernacle was not only a 
 palace for Israel's King, but a place of worship for Israel's God, this 
 altar was immediately connected with a religious purpose. In the style 
 of the sacred writers, incense was a symbol or emblem of prayer

 Re 5:8; 8:3</A>).

 From the uniform combination of the two services, it is evident that
 the incense was an emblem of the prayers of sincere worshippers 
 ascending to heaven in the cloud of perfume; and, accordingly, the 
 priest who officiated at this altar typified the intercessory office of 
 Christ

 they being not numbered. Assuming the shekel of the sanctuary to be 
 about half an ounce troy, though nothing certain is known about it, the 
 sum payable by each individual was two and four pence. This was not a 
 voluntary contribution, but a ransom for the soul or lives of the 
 people. It was required from all classes alike, and a refusal to pay 
 implied a wilful exclusion from the privileges of the sanctuary, as 
 well as exposure to divine judgments. It was probably the same impost 
 that was exacted from our Lord

 standing at the entrance it would be a familiar object, it possessed 
 great interest and importance from the baptismal purposes to which it 
 was applied. No data are given by which its form and size can be 
 ascertained; but it was probably a miniature pattern of Solomon's--a

 into a basin. This laver was provided for the priests alone. But in the 
 Christian dispensation, all believers are priests, and hence the 
 apostle exhorts them how to draw near to God

 mentioned by Moses is the same as that with which we are familiar.

 one hundred twenty pounds, troy weight.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>hin</B>--a word of Egyptian origin, equal to ten pints. Being mixed 
 with the olive oil--no doubt of the purest kind--this composition 
 probably remained always in a liquid state, and the strictest 
 prohibition issued against using it for any other purpose than 
 anointing the tabernacle and its furniture.</P>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>onycha</B>--supposed to be an odoriferous shell;

 <B>galbanum</B>--a gum resin from an umbelliferous plant.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>frankincense</B>--a dry, resinous, aromatic gum, of a yellow color, 
 which comes from a tree in Arabia, and is obtained by incision of the 
 bark. This incense was placed within the sanctuary, to be at hand when
 the priest required to burn on the altar. The art of compounding 
 unguents and perfumes was well known in Egypt, where sweet-scented 
 spices were extensively used not only in common life, but in the ritual 
 of the temples. Most of the ingredients here mentioned have been found 
 on minute examination of mummies and other Egyptian relics; and the 
 Israelites, therefore, would have the best opportunities of acquiring 
 in that country the skill in pounding and mixing them which they were 
 called to exercise in the service of the tabernacle. But the recipe for 
 the incense as well as for the oil in the tabernacle, though it 
 receives illustration from the customs of Egypt, was peculiar, and 
 being prescribed by divine authority, was to be applied to no common or 
 inferior purpose.</P>

 <B>2. See, I have called</B>--Though the instructions about the 
 tabernacle were privately communicated to Moses, it was plainly 
 impossible that he could superintend the work in person, amid the 
 multiplicity of his other duties. A head director or builder was 
 selected by God Himself; and the nomination by such high authority 
 removed all ground of jealousy or discontent on the part of any who 
 might have thought their merits overlooked (compare

 a confidential trust in the ancient Church of God, he has his family 
 and lineage recorded with marked distinction. He belonged to the tribe 
 of Judah, which, doubtless for wise and weighty reasons, God all along 
 delighted to honor; and he was the grandson of Hur, a pious patriot

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:12">Ex 17:12</A>),

 who was associated, by a special commission, with Aaron in the
 government of the people during the absence of Moses. Moreover, it may
 be noticed that a Jewish tradition affirms Hur to be the husband of 
 Miriam; and if this tradition may be relied on, it affords an

 charge of both the plain and ornamental work, which the building of the 
 sacred edifice required. When God has any special work to be 
 accomplished, He always raises up instruments capable of doing it; and 
 it is likely that He had given to the son of Uri that strong natural 
 aptitude and those opportunities of gaining mechanical skill, with an 
 ultimate view to this responsible office. Notwithstanding that his 
 grand duty was to conform with scrupulous fidelity to the pattern 
 furnished, there was still plenty of room for inventive talent and 
 tasteful exactness in the execution; and his natural and acquired gifts 
 were enlarged and invigorated for the important work.</P>

 <B>12-17. Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep</B>--The reason for the 
 fresh inculcation of the fourth commandment at this particular period 
 was, that the great ardor and eagerness, with which all classes betook 
 themselves to the construction of the tabernacle, exposed them to the 
 temptation of encroaching on the sanctity of the appointed day of rest.
 They might suppose that the erection of the tabernacle was a sacred 
 work, and that it would be a high merit, an acceptable tribute, to 
 prosecute the undertaking without the interruption of a day's repose; 
 and therefore the caution here given, at the commencement of the 
 undertaking, was a seasonable admonition.</P>

 <B>1. when the people saw that Moses delayed</B>--They supposed that he
 had lost his way in the darkness or perished in the fire.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron</B>--rather, 
 "against" Aaron in a tumultuous manner, to compel him to do what they 
 wished. The incidents related in this chapter disclose a state of
 popular sentiment and feeling among the Israelites that stands in 
 singular contrast to the tone of profound and humble reverence they 
 displayed at the giving of the law. Within a space of little more than 
 thirty days, their impressions were dissipated. Although they were 
 still encamped upon ground which they had every reason to regard as 
 holy; although the cloud of glory that capped the summit of Sinai was 
 still before their eyes, affording a visible demonstration of their 
 being in close contact, or rather in the immediate presence, of God, 
 they acted as if they had entirely forgotten the impressive scenes of 
 which they had been so recently the witnesses.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us</B>--The 
 <I>Hebrew</I> word rendered "gods" is simply the name of God in its 
 plural form. The image made was single, and therefore it would be 
 imputing to the Israelites a greater sin than they were guilty of, to 
 charge them with renouncing the worship of the true God for idols. The 
 fact is, that they required, like children, to have something to strike 
 their senses, and as the Shekinah, "the glory of God," of which they 
 had hitherto enjoyed the sight, was now veiled, they wished for some 
 visible material object as the symbol of the divine presence, which 
 should go before them as the pillar of fire had done.</P>

 <B>2. Aaron said, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Break off .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
 earrings</B>--It was not an Egyptian custom for young men to wear 
 earrings, and the circumstance, therefore, seems to point out "the 
 mixed rabble," who were chiefly <I>foreign</I> slaves, as the 
 ringleaders in this insurrection. In giving direction to break their 
 earrings, Aaron probably calculated on gaining time; or, perhaps, on 
 their covetousness and love of finery proving stronger than their 
 idolatrous propensity. If such were his expectations, they were doomed 
 to signal disappointment. Better to have calmly and earnestly 
 remonstrated with them, or to have preferred duty to expediency, 
 leaving the issue in the hands of Providence.</P>

 <A NAME="Ex32_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. all the people brake off the golden earrings</B>--The Egyptian 
 rings, as seen on the monuments, were round massy plates of metal; and 
 as they were rings of this sort the Israelites wore, their size and 
 number must, in the general collection, have produced a large store of 
 the precious metal.</P>

 <B>4. fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten
 calf</B>--The words are transposed, and the rendering should be, "he
 framed with a graving tool the image to be made, and having poured the
 liquid gold into the mould, he made it a molten calf." It is not said
 whether it was of life size, whether it was of solid gold or merely a
 wooden frame covered with plates of gold. This idol seems to have been
 the god Apis, the chief deity of the Egyptians, worshipped at Memphis
 under the form of a live ox, three years old. It was distinguished by a
 triangular white spot on its forehead and other peculiar marks. Images
 of it in the form of a whole ox, or of a calf's head on the end of a
 pole, were very common; and it makes a great figure on the monuments
 where it is represented in the van of all processions, as borne aloft
 on men's shoulders.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of 
 the land of Egypt</B>--It is inconceivable that they, who but a few 
 weeks before had witnessed such amazing demonstrations of the true God, 
 could have suddenly sunk to such a pitch of infatuation and brutish 
 stupidity, as to imagine that human art or hands could make a god that 
 should go before them. But it must be borne in mind, that though by 
 election and in name they were the people of God, they were as yet, in 
 feelings and associations, in habits and tastes, little, if at all 
 different, from Egyptians. They meant the calf to be an image, a 
 visible sign or symbol of Jehovah, so that their sin consisted not in a 
 breach of the <FONT SIZE=-1>FIRST</FONT>

 that they had not renounced the worship of Jehovah, but in accordance 
 with Egyptian notions, had formed an image with which they had been 
 familiar, to be the visible symbol of the divine presence. But there 
 seems to have been much of the revelry that marked the feasts of the

 divine purpose. The covenant made with the patriarchs had been
 ratified in the most solemn manner; it <I>could</I> not and never was 
 intended that it <I>should</I> be broken. But the manner in which God 
 spoke to Moses served two important purposes--it tended to develop the 
 faith and intercessory patriotism of the Hebrew leader, and to excite

 them of the privileges they had fondly fancied were so secure.</P>

 arrested the revellers in the midst of their carnival, and his act of 
 righteous indignation when he dashed on the ground the tables of the 
 law, in token that as they had so soon departed from their covenant

 it was "burned in the fire," to cast it into ingots of suitable size
 for the operations which follow--"grounded to powder"; the powder of 
 malleable metals can be ground so fine as to resemble dust from the 
 wings of a moth or butterfly; and these dust particles will float in 
 water for hours, and in a running stream for days. These operations of 
 grinding were intended to show contempt for such worthless gods, and 
 the Israelites would be made to remember the humiliating lesson by the 
 state of the water they had drunk for a time [N<FONT

 were usually ended with great use of sweet wine, the nauseous draught

 <B>that I may know what to do unto thee</B>--The language is 
 accommodated to the feeble apprehensions of men. God judges the state 
 of the heart by the tenor of the conduct. In the case of the 
 Israelites, He cherished a design of mercy; and the moment He discerned 
 the first symptoms of contrition, by their stripping off their 
 ornaments, as penitents conscious of their error and sincerely 
 sorrowful, this fact added its weight to the fervency of Moses'

 the leader--in a part of which he heard cases and communed with God 
 about the people's interests; hence called "the tabernacle of the

 <B>1. the like unto the first</B>--God having been reconciled to 
 repentant Israel, through the earnest intercession, the successful 
 mediation of Moses, means were to be taken for the restoration of the 
 broken covenant. Intimation was given, however, in a most intelligible 
 and expressive manner, that the favor was to be restored with some 
 memento of the rupture; for at the former time God Himself had provided 
 the materials, as well as written upon them. Now, Moses was to prepare 
 the stone tables, and God was only to retrace the characters originally

 and sanctity that marked its first delivery. The whole transaction was 
 ordered so as to impress the people with an awful sense of the holiness 
 of God; and that it was a matter of no trifling moment to have

 them, it is evident that they must have been light, and of no great 
 dimensions--probably flat slabs of shale or slate, such as abound in 
 the mountainous region of Horeb. An additional proof of their 
 comparatively small size appears in the circumstance of their being 
 deposited in the ark of the most holy place

 over the tabernacle, it seems to have resumed its usual position on the 
 summit of the mount. It was the shadow of God manifest to the outward 
 senses; and, at the same time, of God manifest in the flesh. The emblem 
 of a cloud seems to have been chosen to signify that, although He was 
 pleased to make known much about himself, there was more veiled from 
 mortal view. It was to check presumption and engender awe and give a 
 humble sense of human attainments in divine knowledge, as now man sees, 
 but darkly.</P>

 now He makes Himself known in the glory of His grace and
 goodness--attributes that were to be illustriously displayed in the 
 future history and experience of the church. Being about to republish 
 His law--the sin of the Israelites being forgiven and the deed of 
 pardon about to be signed and sealed by renewing the terms of the

 <B>1. Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of
 Israel,</B> &c.--On the occasion referred to in the opening of this

 a magnificent tabernacle for the regular worship of God, as well as of 
 the leading articles that were required to furnish that sacred edifice

 <B>20, 21. all the congregation of Israel departed from the presence of 
 Moses</B>--No exciting harangues were made, nor had the people Bibles 
 at home in which they could compare the requirements of their leader 
 and see if these things were so. But they had no doubt as to his 
 bearing to them the will of God, and they were impressed with so strong 
 a sense of its being their duty, that they made a spontaneous offer of 
 the best and most valuable treasures they possessed.</P>

 <A NAME="Ex35_21"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>21. they came, every one whose heart stirred him up</B>--One 
 powerful element doubtless of this extraordinary open-hearted 
 liberality was the remembrance of their recent transgression, which 
 made them "zealous of good works" (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:11">2Co 7:11</A>).

 But along with this motive, there were others of a higher and nobler
 kind--a principle of love to God and devotedness to His service, an 
 anxious desire to secure the benefit of His presence, and gratitude for 
 the tokens of His divine favor: it was under the combined influence of 
 these considerations that the people were so willing and ready to pour 
 their contributions into that exchequer of the sanctuary.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>every one whom his spirit made willing</B>--Human nature is always 
 the same, and it is implied that while an extraordinary spirit of pious 
 liberality reigned in the bosoms of the people at large, there were 
 exceptions--some who were too fond of the world, who loved their 
 possessions more than their God, and who could not part with these; no, 
 not for the service of the tabernacle.</P>

 <A NAME="Ex35_22"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>22. they came, both men and women,</B> &c.--literally, "the men over 
 and above the women"; a phraseology which implies that the women acted 
 a prominent part, presented their offerings <I>first,</I> and then were 
 followed by as many of their male companions as were similarly 
 disposed.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>brought bracelets,</B> &c.--There was in that early age no money in 
 the form of coins or bullion. What money passed current with the 
 merchant consisted of rings which were weighed, and principally of 
 ornaments for personal decoration. Astonishment at the abundance of 
 their ornaments is at an end when we learn that costly and elegant 
 ornaments abounded in proportion as clothing was simple and scarce 
 among the Egyptians, and some, entirely divested of clothing, yet wore 
 rich necklaces [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGSTENBERG</FONT>]. Among people with
 Oriental sentiments and tastes, scarcely any stronger proof could have 
 been given of the power of religion than their willingness not only to 
 lay aside, but to devote those much-valued trinkets to the house of 
 God; and thus all, like the Eastern sages, laid the best they had at 
 the service of God.</P>

 But now that the collection had been made, the materials were 
 contributed, and the operations of building about to be commenced, it 
 was with the greatest propriety he reminded the people that the 
 individuals entrusted with the application of their gold and silver had 
 been nominated to the work by authority to which all would bow.</P>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+38:22,39:22,27">Ex 38:22; 39:22, 27</A>).

 And in perfect harmony with the testimony of the monuments is the
 account given by Moses to the artists who were divinely taught the arts
 necessary for the embellishment of the tabernacle. Others, whose 
 limited means did not admit of these expensive contributions, offered 
 their gratuitous services in fabricating such articles of tapestry as 
 were needed; arts which the Israelitish females learned as bondwomen, 
 in the houses of Egyptian princes.</P>

 <B>1. Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise-hearted 
 man,</B> &c.--Here is an illustrious example of zeal and activity in 
 the work of the Lord. No unnecessary delay was allowed to take place; 
 and from the moment the first pole was stuck in the ground till the 
 final completion of the sacred edifice, he and his associates labored 
 with all the energies both of mind and body engaged in the work. And 
 what was the mainspring of their arduous and untiring diligence? They 
 could be actuated by none of the ordinary motives that give impulse to 
 human industry, by no desire for the acquisition of gain; no ambition 
 for honor; no view of gratifying a mere love of power in directing the 
 labors of a large body of men. They felt the stimulus--the strong 
 irresistible impulse of higher and holier motives--obedience to the 
 authority, zeal for the glory, and love to the service of God.</P>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had 
 brought,</B> &c.--It appears that the building was begun after the 
 first few contributions were made; it was progressively carried on, and 
 no necessity occurred to suspend operations even for the shortest 
 interval, from want of the requisite materials.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning,</B>
 &c.--Moses, in common with other Oriental magistrates, had his morning
 levees for receiving the people (see on

 <A HREF="#Ex18_13">Ex 18:13</A>); 

 and it was while he was performing his magisterial duties that the
 people brought unto him freewill offerings every morning. Some who had 
 nothing but their manual labor to give would spend a great part of the 
 night in hastening to complete their self-imposed task before the early 
 dawn; others might find their hearts constrained by silent meditations 
 on their beds to open their coffers and give a part of their hoarded 
 treasure to the pious object. All whose hearts were touched by piety, 
 penitence, or gratitude, repaired with eager haste into the presence of 
 Moses, not as heretofore, to have their controversies settled, but to 
 lay on his tribunal their contributions to the sanctuary of God

 enough,</B> &c.--By the calculations which the practised eyes of the 
 workmen enabled them to make, they were unanimously of the opinion that 
 the supply already far exceeded the demand and that no more 
 contributions were required. Such a report reflects the highest honor 
 on their character as men of the strictest honor and integrity, who, 
 notwithstanding they had command of an untold amount of the most 
 precious things and might, without any risk of human discovery, have 
 appropriated much to their own use, were too high principled for such 
 acts of peculation. Forthwith, a proclamation was issued to stop 
 further contributions

 will be apt to say, "Why do such works with the hammer, when they could
 have been cast so much easier--a process they were well acquainted
 with?" The only answer that can be given is, that it was done according
 to order. We have no doubt but there were reasons for so distinctive
 an order, something significant, which has not been revealed to us
 [N<FONT SIZE=-1>APIER</FONT>]. The whole of that sacred building was
 arranged with a view to inculcate through every part of its apparatus
 the great fundamental principles of revelation. Every object was
 symbolical of important truth--every piece of furniture was made the
 hieroglyphic of a doctrine or a duty--on the floor and along the sides
 of that movable edifice was exhibited, by emblematic signs addressed to
 the eye, the whole remedial scheme of the gospel. How far this
 spiritual instruction was received by every successive generation of
 the Israelites, it may not be easy to determine. But the tabernacle,
 like the law of which it was a part, was a schoolmaster to Christ

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:24,25">Ga 3:24, 25</A>].

 Just as the walls of schools are seen studded with pictorial figures, 
 by which the children, in a manner level to their capacities and suited 
 to arrest their volatile minds, are kept in constant and familiar 
 remembrance of the lessons of piety and virtue, so the tabernacle was 
 intended by its furniture and all its arrangements to serve as a 
 "shadow of good things to come"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:1">Heb 10:1</A>].

 In this view, the minute description given in this chapter respecting
 the ark and mercy seat, the table of showbread, the candlestick, the 
 altar of incense, and the holy oil, were of the greatest utility and 
 importance; and though there are a few things that are merely 
 ornamental appendages, such as the knops and the flowers, yet, in 
 introducing these into the tabernacle, God displayed the same wisdom 
 and goodness as He has done by introducing real flowers into the 
 kingdom of nature to engage and gratify the eye of man.</P>

 that other six months had been occupied in building it. So long a

 occasions, there is reason to believe that on the inauguration day the 
 people were summoned from their tents--were all drawn up as a vast 
 assemblage, yet in calm and orderly arrangement, around the newly 
 erected tabernacle.</P>

 <A NAME="Ex40_34"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>34. a cloud</B>--literally, "<I>The</I> cloud," the mystic cloud 
 which was the well-known symbol of the Divine Presence. After remaining 
 at a great distance from them on the summit of the mount, it appeared 
 to be in motion; and if many among them had a secret misgiving about 
 the issue, how the fainting heart would revive, the interest of the 
 moment intensely increase, and the tide of joy swell in every bosom, 
 when that symbolic cloud was seen slowly and majestically descending 
 towards the plain below and covering the tabernacle. The entire and 
 universal concealment of the tabernacle within the folds of an 
 impervious cloud was not without a deep and instructive meaning; it was 
 a protection to the sacred edifice from the burning heats of the 
 Arabian climate; it was a token of the Divine Presence; and it was also 
 an emblem of the Mosaic dispensation, which, though it was a revelation 
 from heaven, yet left many things hid in obscurity; for it was a dark 
 cloud compared with the bright cloud, which betokened the clearer and 
 fuller discoveries of the divine character and glory in the gospel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:5">Mt 17:5</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle</B>--that is, light and
 fire, a created splendor, which was the peculiar symbol of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:5">1Jo 1:5</A>).

 Whether this light was inherent in the cloud or not, it emanated from
 it on this occasion, and making its entry, not with the speed of a
 lightning flash as if it were merely an electric spark, but in majestic
 splendor, it passed through the outer porch into the interior of the
 most holy place 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:10,Joh+1:14">1Ki 8:10;
 Joh 1:14</A>).

 Its miraculous character is shown by the fact, that, though "it filled
 the tabernacle," not a curtain or any article of furniture was so much
 as singed.</P>

 <A NAME="Ex40_35"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>35. Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the 
 congregation</B>--How does this circumstance show the incapacity of 
 man, in his present state, to look upon the unveiled perfections of the
 Godhead! Moses could not endure the unclouded effulgence, nor the
 sublimest of the prophets

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:5">Isa 6:5</A>).

 But what neither Moses nor the most eminent of God's messengers to the
 ancient church through the weakness of nature could endure, we can all
 now do by an exercise of faith; looking unto Jesus, who reflected with
 chastened radiance the brightness of the Father's glory; and who,
 having as the Forerunner for us, entered within the veil, has invited
 us to come boldly to the mercy seat. While Moses was compelled, through
 the influence of overwhelming awe, to stand aloof and could not enter
 the tabernacle, Christ entered into the holy place not made with hands;
 nay, He is Himself the true tabernacle, filled with the glory of God,
 ever with the grace and truth which the Shekinah typified. What great
 reason we have to thank God for Jesus Christ, who, while He Himself was
 the brightness of the Father's glory, yet exhibited that glory in so
 mild and attractive a manner, as to allure us to draw near with
 confidence and love into the Divine Presence!</P>

 <A NAME="Ex40_36"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>36. when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle</B>--In 
 journeying through the sandy, trackless deserts of the East, the use of 
 torches, exhibiting a cloud of smoke by day and of fire by night, has 
 been resorted to from time immemorial. The armies of Darius and 
 Alexander were conducted on their marches in this manner [F<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ABER</FONT>]. The Arab caravans in the present day observe the 
 same custom; and materials for these torches are stored up among other 
 necessary preparations for a journey. Live fuel, hoisted in chafing 
 dishes at the end of long poles, and being seen at a great distance, 
 serves, by the smoke in the daytime and the light at night, as a better 
 signal for march than the sound of a trumpet, which is not heard at the 
 extremities of a large camp [L<FONT SIZE=-1>ABORDE</FONT>]. This
 usage, and the miracle related by Moses, mutually illustrate each 
 other. The usage leads us to think that the miracle was necessary, and 
 worthy of God to perform; and, on the other hand, the miracle of the 
 cloudy pillar, affording double benefit of shade by day and light at 
 night, implies not only that the usage was not unknown to the Hebrews, 
 but supplied all the wants which they felt in common with other 
 travellers through those dreary regions [F<FONT SIZE=-1>ABER</FONT>, 
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ESS,</FONT> G<FONT SIZE=-1>RANDPIERRE</FONT>]. But its
 peculiar appearance, unvarying character, and regular movements, 
 distinguished it from all the common atmospheric phenomena. It was an 
 invaluable boon to the Israelites, and being recognized by all classes 
 among that people as the symbol of the Divine Presence, it guided their 
 journeys and regulated their encampments (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+29:1-11,105:1-45">Ps 29:1-11; 105:1-45</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>38. the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle,</B> &c.--While it
 had hitherto appeared sometimes in one place, sometimes in another, it
 was now found on the tabernacle only; so that from the moment that
 sanctuary was erected, and the glory of the Lord had filled the sacred
 edifice, the Israelites had to look to the place which God had chosen
 to put His name there, in order that they might enjoy the benefit of a
 heavenly Guide

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:15-23">Nu 9:15-23</A>).

 In like manner, the church had divine revelation for its guide from the
 first--long before the W<FONT SIZE=-1>ORD</FONT> of God existed in a
 written form; but ever since the setting up of that sacred canon, it 
 rests on that as its tabernacle and there only is it to be found. It 
 accompanies us wherever we are or go, just as the cloud led the way of 
 the Israelites. It is always accessible and can be carried in our 
 pockets when we walk abroad; it may be engraved on the inner tablets of 
 our memories and our hearts; and so true, faithful, and complete a
 guide is it, that there is not a scene of duty or of trial through
 which we may be called to pass in the world, but it furnishes a clear,
 a safe, and unerring direction
