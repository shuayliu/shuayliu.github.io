 Hebrew poetry is unique in its kind; in essence, the most sublime; in
 form, marked by a simplicity and ease which flow from its sublimity.
 "<I>The Spirit of the</I> L<FONT SIZE=-1>ORD</FONT> <I>spake by me</I>
 [the Hebrew poet], <I>and his word was in my tongue</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:2">2Sa 23:2</A>).

 Even the music was put under the charge of spiritually gifted men; and 
 one of the chief musicians, Heman, is called "the king's seer in the 
 words of God"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+25:1,5">1Ch 25:1, 5</A>).

 King David is stated to have <I>invented instruments of music</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:5">Am 6:5</A>).

 There is not in Hebrew poetry the artistic rhythm of form which appears
 in the classical poetry of Greece and Rome, but it amply makes up for 
 this by its fresh and graceful naturalness.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Early specimens of Hebrew poetry occur; for example, Lamech's skeptical
 parody of Enoch's prophecy, or, as others think, lamentation for a
 homicide committed in those lawless times in self-defense

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:23">Ge 4:23</A>;
 
 compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14,Ex+32:18,Nu+21:14,15,17,18,27">Jude 14; 
 Ex 32:18; 
 Nu 21:14, 15, 17, 18, 27</A>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:7,8,18,24:3,15">Nu 23:7, 8, 18; 24:3, 15</A>).

 The poetical element appears much more in the Old than in the New
 Testament. The poetical <I>books</I> are exclusively those of the Old
 Testament; and in the Old Testament itself, the portions that are the
 most fundamental (for example, the Pentateuch of Moses, the lawgiver,
 in its main body), are those which have in them least of the poetical
 element in form. Elijah, the father of the prophets, is quite free of
 poetical art. The succeeding prophets were not strictly poets, except
 in so far as the ecstatic state in inspiration lifted them to poetic
 modes of thought and expression. The prophet was more of an inspired
 teacher than a poet. It is when the sacred writer acts as the
 representative of the <I>personal experiences</I> of the children of
 God and of the Church, that poetry finds its proper sphere.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The use of poetry in Scripture was particularly to supply the want not
 provided for by the law, namely, of <I>devotional forms</I> to express
 in private, and in public joint worship, <I>the feelings</I> of pious 
 Israelites. The schools of the prophets fostered and diffused a 
 religious spirit among the people; and we find them using lyric 
 instruments to accompany their prophesyings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:5">1Sa 10:5</A>).

 However, it was David, who specially matured the lyric effusions of 
 devotion into a perfection which they had not before attained.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Another purpose which Psalmody, through David's inspired productions,
 served, was to <I>draw forth from under the typical forms of legal 
 services their hidden essence and spirit, adapting them to the various 
 spiritual exigencies of individual and congregational life. Nature,</I> 
 too, is in them shown to speak the glory and goodness of the invisible, 
 yet ever present God. A handbook of devotion was furnished to the 
 Israelite whereby he could enter into the true spirit of the services 
 of the sanctuary, and so feel the need of that coming Messiah, of whom 
 especially the Book of Psalms testifies throughout. We also, in our 
 Christian dispensation, need its help in our devotions. Obliged as we 
 are, notwithstanding our higher privileges in most respects, to walk by 
 faith rather than by sight in a greater degree than they, we find the 
 Psalms, with their realizing expression of the felt nearness of God, 
 the best repertory whence to draw <I>divinely sanctioned language,</I> 
 wherewith to express our prayers and thanksgivings to God, and our 
 breathings after holy communion with our fellow saints.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As to the objection raised against the spirit of revenge which breathes
 in some psalms, the answer is: a wide distinction is to be drawn 
 between personal vindictiveness and the desire for God's honor being 
 vindicated. Personal revenge, not only in the other parts of Scripture, 
 but also in the Psalms, in theory and in practice, is alike reprobated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:4,5,Le+19:18,Job+31:29,30,Ps+7:4,5,8,11,12,Pr+25:21,22">Ex 23:4, 5;
 Le 19:18;
 Job 31:29, 30;
 Ps 7:4, 5, 8, 11, 12;
 Pr 25:21, 22</A>),

 which corresponds to David's practice in the case of his unrelenting 
 enemy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+24:5-6,26:8-10">1Sa 24:5-6; 26:8-10</A>).

 On the other hand, the people of God have always desired that whatever
 mars the cause of God, as for instance the prosperity of the enemies of
 God and His Church, should be brought to an end

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:12,35:27,40:16,79:6,10">Ps 10:12; 35:27; 40:16; 79:6, 10</A>).

 It is well for us, too, in our dispensation of love, to be reminded by 
 these psalms of the danger of lax views as to God's hatred of sin; and 
 of the need there is that we should altogether enter into the mind of 
 God on such points at the same time that we seek to convert all men to 
 God (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+16:1,Ps+139:21,Isa+66:24,Re+14:10">1Sa 16:1;
 Ps 139:21; 
 Isa 66:24; 
 Re 14:10</A>).</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some psalms are composed of twenty-two parallel sentences or strophes 
 of verses, beginning with words of which the initial letters correspond 
 with the Hebrew letters (twenty-two) in their order (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:1-40,Ps+119:1-176">Ps 37:1-40
 and Ps 119:1-176</A>).

 So also Lamentations. This arrangement was designed as a help to the 
 memory and is found only in such compositions as do not handle a 
 distinct and progressive subject, but a series of pious reflections, in 
 the case of which the precise order was of less moment. The Psalmist in 
 adopting it does not slavishly follow it; but, as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:1-22">Psalm 25</A>,

 he deviates from it, so as to make the form, when needful, bend to the 
 sense. Of these poems there are twelve in all in the Hebrew Bible

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:1-22,34:1-22,37:1-40,111:1-10,112:1-10,119:1-176,145:1-21">Ps 25:1-22;
 34:1-22; 37:1-40; 111:1-10; 112:1-10; 119:1-176; 145:1-21</A>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:10-31,La+1:1-4:22">Pr 31:10-31;
 La 1:1-4:22</A>).</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The great excellence of the Hebrew principle of versification, namely,
 parallelism, or "thought rhythm" [E<FONT SIZE=-1>WALD</FONT>], is that,
 while the poetry of every other language, whose versification depends
 on the regular recurrences of certain sounds, suffers considerably by
 translation, Hebrew poetry, whose rhythm depends on the parallel
 correspondence of similar <I>thoughts,</I> loses almost nothing in
 being translated--the Holy Spirit having thus presciently provided for
 its ultimate translation into every language, without loss to the
 sense. Thus in our <I>English Version,</I> Job and Psalms, though but
 translations, are eminently poetical. On parallelism, see my

 <A HREF="JFB18.htm#Introduction">Introduction to Job</A>.

 Thus also a clue is given to the <I>meaning</I> in many passages, the 
 sense of the word in one clause being more fully set forth by the 
 corresponding word in the succeeding parallel clause. In the Masoretic 
 punctuation of the Hebrew, the metrical arrangement is marked by the 
 distinctive accents. It accords with the divine inspiration of 
 Scripture poetry, that the <I>thought</I> is more prominent than the 
 form, the kernel than the shell.  The Hebrew poetic rhythm resembled 
 our blank verse, without, however, metrical <I>feet.</I> There is a 
 <I>verbal rhythm</I> above that of prose; but as the true Hebrew 
 pronunciation is lost, the rhythm is but imperfectly recognized.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The peculiarity of the Hebrew poetical age is that it was <I>always
 historic</I> and <I>true, not mythical,</I> as the early poetical ages
 of all other nations. Again, its poetry is distinguished from prose by
 the use of <I>terms decidedly poetic.</I> David's lament over Jonathan
 furnishes a beautiful specimen of another feature found in Hebrew
 poetry, <I>the strophe:</I> three strophes being marked by the
 recurrence three times of the dirge sung by the chorus; the first dirge
 sung by the whole body of singers, representing Israel; the second, by
 a chorus of damsels; the third, by a chorus of youths

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:17-27">2Sa 1:17-27</A>).</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The lyrical poetry, which is the predominant style in the Bible and is 
 especially terse and sententious, seems to have come from an earlier
 kind resembling the more modern Book of Proverbs (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:23,24">Ge 4:23, 24</A>).

 The Oriental mind tends to embody thought in pithy gnomes, maxims, and 
 proverbs. "The poetry of the Easterns is a string of pearls. Every word 
 has life. Every proposition is condensed wisdom. Every thought is 
 striking and epigrammatical" (K<FONT SIZE=-1>ITTO</FONT>, <I>Biblical 
 Cyclop&aelig;dia</I>). We are led to the same inference from the term 
 <I>Maschal,</I> a "proverb" or "similitude," being used to designate 
 <I>poetry in general.</I> "Hebrew poetry, in its origin, was a painting
 to the eye, a parable or teaching by likenesses discovered by the
 popular mind, expressed by the popular tongue, and adopted and polished
 by the national poet." Solomon, under inspiration, may have embodied in
 his Proverbs such of the pre-existing popular wise sayings as were
 sanctioned by the Spirit of God.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Hebrew title for the Psalms, <I>Tehilim,</I> means "hymns," that
 is, joyous praises (sometimes accompanied with dancing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:1-20,Jdg+5:1-31">Ex 15:1-20;
 Jud 5:1-31</A>),

 not exactly answering to the <I>Septuagint</I> title, <I>Psalms,</I> 
 that is, "lyrical odes," or songs accompanied by an instrument. The
 title, <I>Tehilim,</I> "hymns," was probably adopted on account of 
 <I>the use made of the Psalms in divine service,</I> though only a part 
 can be strictly called songs of praise, others being <I>dirges,</I> and 
 very many <I>prayers</I> (whence in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:20">Ps 72:20</A>,

 David styles all his previous compositions, <I>the prayers of 
 David</I>). Sixty-five bear the title, "lyrical odes" 
 (<I>Mizmorim</I>), while only one is styled <I>Tehilah</I> or "Hymn." 
 From the title being Psalms in the <I>Septuagint</I> and New Testament, 
 and also in the <I>Peshito,</I> it is probable that Psalms 
 (<I>Mizmorim</I>) or "lyrical odes," was the old title before
 <I>Tehilim.</I> </P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Epic poetry,</I> as having its proper sphere in a <I>mythical heroic
 age,</I> has no place among the Hebrews of the Old Testament Scripture 
 age. For in their earliest ages, namely, the patriarchal, <I>not 
 fable</I> as in Greece, Rome, Egypt, and all heathen nations, but 
 <I>truth</I> and <I>historic reality</I> reigned; so much so, that the 
 poetic element, which is the offspring of the imagination, is found 
 less in those earlier, than in the later, ages. The Pentateuch is 
 almost throughout historic prose. In the subsequent uninspired age, in 
 Tobit we have some approach to the Epos.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Drama,</I> also, in the full modern sense, is not found in Hebrew
 literature. This was due, not to any want of intellectual culture, as 
 is fully shown by the high excellence of their lyric and didactic 
 poetry, but to their earnest character, and to the solemnity of the 
 subjects of their literature. The dramatic element appears in Job, more 
 than in any other book in the Bible; there are the <I>dramatis 
 person&aelig;,</I> a plot, and the "denouement" prepared for by Elihu, 
 the fourth friend's speech, and brought about by the interposition of 
 Jehovah Himself.  Still it is not a strict drama, but rather an 
 inspired debate on a difficult problem of the divine government 
 exemplified in Job's case, with historic narrative, prologue, and 
 epilogue. The Song of Solomon, too, has much of the dramatic cast. See 
 my

 <A HREF="JFB18.htm#Introduction">Introductions to Job</A>
 
 and
 
 <A HREF="JFB22.htm#Introduction">Song of Solomon</A>.

 The <I>style</I> of many psalms is very dramatic, transitions often 
 occurring from one to another person, without introduction, and 
 especially from speaking indirectly <I>of</I> God to addresses 
 <I>to</I> God; thus in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:1,2">Ps 32:1, 2</A>,

 David makes a general introduction, "Blessed is the man whose iniquity
 is forgiven," &c.; then in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:3-7">Ps 32:3-7</A>,

 he passes to addressing God directly;

 then in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:8">Ps 32:8</A>,

 without preface God is introduced, directly speaking, in answer to the
 previous prayer; then in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:10,11">Ps 32:10, 11</A>,

 again he resumes indirect speaking <I>of</I> God, and addresses himself 
 in conclusion to the righteous. These quick changes of person do not 
 startle us, but give us a stronger sense of his habitual converse with
 God than any assertions could do. Compare also in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:8-10">Ps 132:8-10</A>,

 the prayer, "Arise, O Lord, into <I>thy rest;</I> thou, and the ark of
 thy strength. Let thy <I>priests be clothed with righteousness;</I> and
 let <I>thy saints shout for joy.</I> For thy servant David's sake turn
 not away the face of thine anointed," with God's direct answer, which 
 follows in almost the words of the prayer, "The Lord hath sworn unto 
 <I>David,</I>" &c.

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:11-18">Ps 132:11-18</A>].

 "This is <I>my rest</I> for ever

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:14">Ps 132:14</A>].

 I will <I>clothe her priests with salvation:</I> and <I>her saints
 shall shout aloud for joy.</I>" Thus also in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1-12">second Psalm</A>,

 various personages are introduced, dramatically acting and
 speaking--the confederate nations

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1-3">Ps 2:1-3</A>],

 Jehovah

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:4-6">Ps 2:4-6</A>],

 the Messiah

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:7-9">Ps 2:7-9</A>],

 and the Psalmist

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:10-12">Ps 2:10-12</A>].</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 A frequent feature is <I>the alternate succession of parts,</I>
 adapting the several psalms to alternate recitation by two 
 <I>semi-choruses</I> in the temple-worship, followed by a <I>full 
 chorus</I> between the parts or at the end. (So

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:15,21,31">Ps 107:15, 21, 31</A>).

 D<FONT SIZE=-1>E</FONT> B<FONT SIZE=-1>URGH</FONT>, in his valuable 
 commentary on the Psalms, remarks, "Our cathedral service exemplifies 
 the form of chanting the Psalms, except that the <I>semi-chorus</I> is 
 alternately <I>a whole verse,</I> instead of alternating, as of old, 
 <I>the half verse;</I> while <I>the full chorus</I> is the 'gloria' at 
 the end of each Psalm."</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In conclusion, besides its unique point of excellence, its divine
 inspiration, Hebrew poetry is characterized as being essentially
 national, yet eminently catholic, speaking to the heart and spiritual
 sensibilities of universal humanity. Simple and unconstrained, it is
 distinguished by a natural freshness which is the result of its genuine
 truthfulness. The Hebrew poet sought not self or his own fame, as did
 heathen poets, but he was inspired by the Spirit of God to meet a
 pressing want which his own and his nation's spiritual aspirations
 after God made to be at once a necessity and a delight. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:1,2">2Sa 23:1, 2</A>,

 "The sweet Psalmist of Israel said, The Spirit of the L<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ORD</FONT> spake by me," &c.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 E<FONT SIZE=-1>WALD</FONT> rightly remarks that several odes of the
 highest poetic excellence are not included (for example, the songs of
 Moses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:1-19,De+32:1-43">Ex 15:1-19
 and De 32:1-43</A>;
 
 of Deborah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:1-31">Jud 5:1-31</A>;
 
 of Hannah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:1-10">1Sa 2:1-10</A>;
 
 of Hezekiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:9-20">Isa 38:9-20</A>;
 
 of Habakkuk,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:1-19">Hab 3:1-19</A>;
 
 and even David's dirge over Saul and Jonathan,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:17-18">2Sa 1:17-18</A>).

 The selection of the Psalms collected in one book was made not so much
 with reference to the beauty of the pieces, as to their adaptation for
 public worship. Still one overruling Spirit ordered the selection and
 arrangement of the contents of the book, as one pervading tone and
 subject appear throughout, Christ in His own inner life as the God-man,
 and in His past, present, and future relations to the Church and the
 world.  I<FONT SIZE=-1>SAAC</FONT> T<FONT SIZE=-1>AYLOR</FONT> well
 calls the Psalms, "The Liturgy of the spiritual life"; and 
 L<FONT SIZE=-1>UTHER</FONT>, "A Bible in miniature."</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <I>principle of the order</I> in which the Psalms are given to us,
 though not always discoverable, is in some cases clear, and shows the
 arrangement to be unmistakably the work of the Spirit, not merely that
 of the collector. Thus 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22+1-31">Psalm 22</A>

 plainly portrays the dying agonies of Messiah;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:1-6">Psalm 23</A>,

 His peaceful rest in Paradise after His death on the cross; and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:1-10">Psalm 24</A>,

 His glorious ascension into heaven.</P>
