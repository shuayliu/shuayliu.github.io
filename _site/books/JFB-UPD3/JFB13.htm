 The great northern desert of Arabia, including the entire neck, was
 colonized by these tribes; and if we can recover, in the modern
 geography of this part of the country, Arab tribes bearing the names of
 those patriarchs, that is, names corresponding with those preserved in
 the original catalogue of Scripture, we obtain at once so many
 evidences, not of mere similarity, but of absolute identification

 In that passage they are called "the sons of Mahol," which, however, is 
 to be taken not as a proper name, but appellatively for "sons of music, 
 dancing," &c. The traditional fame of their great sagacity and 
 acquirements had descended to the time of Solomon and formed a standard 
 of comparison for showing the superior wisdom of that monarch. Jewish

 In that passage he is called Ithra an Israelite; and there seems no 
 reason why, in the early days of David, anyone should be specially 
 distinguished as an Israelite. The presumption is in favor of the 
 reading followed by the <I>Septuagint,</I> which calls him "Jetra the 
 Jezreelite." The circumstance of his settling in another tribe, or of a 
 woman marrying out of her own tribe, was sufficiently rare and singular

 Jezreel.</P>

 property of Machir, who was so desirous of a male heir. He was grandson
 of Joseph. The wife of Machir was of the tribe of Manasseh

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:41,De+3:14">Nu 32:41;
 De 3:14</A>)

 "the son of Manasseh." This designation implies that his inheritance
 lay in that tribe in right of his grandmother; in other words, his 
 <I>maternal</I> and <I>adopting</I> great-grandfather was Machir the 
 son of Manasseh. Jair, inheriting his property, was his lineal 
 representative; and accordingly this is expressly stated to be the 
 case; for the village group of "Havoth-Jair" was awarded to him in that 
 tribe, in consequence of his valiant and patriotic exploits. This 
 arrangement, however, took place previous to the law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+36:1-13">Nu 36:1-13</A>),

 by which it was enacted that heiresses were to marry in their own 
 tribe. But this instance of Jair shows that in the case of a man
 obtaining an inheritance in another tribe it required him to become 
 thoroughly incorporated with it as a representative of the family 
 through which the inheritance was received. He had been adopted into 
 Manasseh, and it would never have been imagined that he was other than 
 "a son of Manasseh" naturally, had not this passage given information 
 supplementary to that of the passage in Numbers.</P>

 <B>35. Sheshan gave his daughter to Jarha his servant to wife</B>--The
 adoption and marriage of a foreign slave in the family where he is
 serving, is far from being a rare or extraordinary occurrence in
 Eastern countries. It is thought, however, by some to have been a
 connection not sanctioned by the law of Moses
 [M<FONT SIZE=-1>ICHAELIS</FONT>]. But this is
 not a well-founded objection, as the history of the Jews furnishes not
 a few examples of foreign proselytes in the same manner obtaining an
 inheritance in Israel; and doubtless Jarha had previously embraced the
 Jewish faith in place of the grovelling idolatries of his native Egypt.
 In such a case, therefore, there could be no legal difficulty. Being a
 foreign slave, he had no inheritance in a different tribe to injure by
 this connection; while his marriage with Sheshan's daughter led to his
 adoption into the tribe of Judah, as well as his becoming heir of the
 family property.</P>

 seventeen reigns. But this was the promised reward of David's piety.

 <B>9, 10. Jabez</B>--was, as many think, the son of Coz, or Kenaz, and 
 is here eulogized for his sincere and fervent piety, as well, perhaps, 
 as for some public and patriotic works which he performed. The Jewish 
 writers affirm that he was an eminent doctor in the law, whose
 reputation drew so many scribes around him that a town was called by
 his name

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:55">1Ch 2:55</A>);

 and to the piety of his character this passage bears ample testimony.
 The memory of the critical circumstances which marked his birth was 
 perpetuated in his name (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:15">Ge 35:15</A>);

 and yet, in the development of his high talents or distinguished worth 
 in later life, his mother must have found a satisfaction and delight 
 that amply compensated for all her early trials. His prayer which is 
 here recorded, and which, like Jacob's, is in the form of a vow

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+28:20">Ge 28:20</A>),
 
 seems to have been uttered when he was entering on an important or
 critical service, for the successful execution of which he placed
 confidence neither on his own nor his people's prowess, but looked
 anxiously for the aid and blessing of God. The enterprise was in all
 probability the expulsion of the Canaanites from the territory he
 occupied; and as this was a war of extermination, which God Himself had
 commanded, His blessing could be the more reasonably asked and expected
 in preserving them from all the evils to which the undertaking might
 expose him. In these words, "that it may not grieve me," and which
 might be more literally rendered, "that I may have no more sorrow,"
 there is an allusion to the meaning of his name, Jabez, signifying
 "grief"; and the import of this petition is, Let me not experience the
 grief which my name implies, and which my sins may well produce.</P>

 The marriage must have taken place in the wilderness. The barriers of a
 different national language and national religion kept the Hebrews
 separate from the Egyptians; but they did not wholly prevent
 intimacies, and even occasional intermarriages between private
 individuals of the two nations. Before such unions, however, could be
 sanctioned, the Egyptian party must have renounced idolatry, and this
 daughter of Pharaoh, as appears from her name, had become a convert to
 the worship of the God of Israel.</P>

 early times certain trades were followed by particular families among
 the Hebrews, apparently in hereditary succession. Their knowledge of
 the art of linen manufacture had been, most probably, acquired in

 <B>1. Now the sons of Reuben</B>--In proceeding to give this genealogy,
 the sacred historian states, in a parenthesis 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+5:1,2">1Ch 5:1, 2</A>),

 the reason why it was not placed first, as Reuben was the oldest son of 
 Jacob. The birthright, which by a foul crime he had forfeited, implied 
 not only dominion, but a double portion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:17">De 21:17</A>);

 and both of these were transferred to Joseph, whose two sons having 
 been adopted as the children of Jacob

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:5">Ge 48:5</A>),

 received each an allotted portion, as forming two distinct tribes in 
 Israel. Joseph then was entitled to the precedency; and yet, as his 
 posterity was not mentioned first, the sacred historian judged it 
 necessary to explain that "the genealogy was not to be reckoned after 
 the birthright," but with a reference to a superior honor and privilege 
 that had been conferred on Judah--not the man, but the tribe, whereby 
 it was invested with the pre-eminence over all the other tribes, and 
 out of it was to spring David with his royal lineage, and especially 
 the great Messiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:14">Heb 7:14</A>).

 These were the two reasons why, in the order of enumeration, the 
 genealogy of Judah is introduced before that of Reuben.</P>

 the history of this tribe, which never took any part in the public
 affairs or movements of the nation, is comprised in "the multiplication
 of their cattle in the land of Gilead," in their wars with the Bedouin
 sons of Hagar, and in the simple labors of pastoral life. They had the
 right of pasture over an extensive mountain range--the great
 wilderness of Kedemoth

 archery, were invaded in the time of Joshua by a confederate army of 
 the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half Manasseh, who, probably incensed by 
 the frequent raids of those marauding neighbors, took reprisals in men 
 and cattle, dispossessed almost all of the original inhabitants, and 
 colonized the district themselves. Divine Providence favoured, in a 
 remarkable manner, the Hebrew army in this just war.</P>

 might have been expected to take place in the form or dialectic 
 pronunciation of the names of those cities; and this will sufficiently 
 account for the variations that are found in the lists as enumerated

 taking "Aher" as a common noun, render the passage thus, "and Hushim,

 therefore denote not individuals, but the heads of their respective

 <B>21. whom the men of Gath .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. slew,</B> &c.--This interesting little
 episode gives us a glimpse of the state of Hebrew society in Egypt; for
 the occurrence narrated seems to have taken place before the Israelites
 left that country. The patriarch Ephraim was then alive, though he must
 have arrived at a very advanced age; and the Hebrew people, at all
 events those of them who were his descendants, still retained their
 pastoral character. It was in perfect consistency with the ideas and
 habits of Oriental shepherds that they should have made a raid on the
 neighboring tribe of the Philistines for the purpose of plundering
 their flocks. For nothing is more common among them than hostile
 incursions on the inhabitants of towns, or on other nomad tribes with
 whom they have no league of amity. But a different view of the incident
 is brought out, if, instead of "because," we render the Hebrew particle
 "when" they came down to take their cattle, for the tenor of the
 context leads rather to the conclusion that "the men of Gath" were the
 aggressors, who, making a sudden foray on the Ephraimite flocks, killed
 the shepherds including several of the sons of Ephraim. The calamity
 spread a deep gloom around the tent of their aged father, and was the
 occasion of his receiving visits of condolence from his distant
 relatives, according to the custom of the East, which is remarkably
 exemplified in the history of Job

 <B>1. Now Benjamin begat,</B> &c.--This chapter contains some supplementary
 particulars in addition to what has been already said regarding the
 tribe of Benjamin
 (see on

 <A HREF="#1Ch7_6">1Ch 7:6</A>). 

 The names of many of the persons mentioned are different from those 
 given by Moses--a diversity which may be accounted for in part on 
 grounds formerly stated, namely, either that the persons had more than 
 one name, or that the word "sons" is used in a loose sense for 
 grandsons or descendants. But there are other circumstances to be taken 
 into account in considering the details of this chapter; namely, first, 
 that the genealogies of the Benjamites were disordered or destroyed by 
 the almost total extermination of this tribe

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:11-48">Jud 20:11-48</A>);

 secondly, that a great number of Benjamites, born in Assyria, are
 mentioned here, who returned from the long captivity in Babylon, and
 established themselves--some in Jerusalem, others in different parts of
 Judea. There were more returned from Babylon of the families belonging
 to this tribe than to any other except Judah; and hence many strange
 names are here introduced; some of which will be found in the list of
 the restored exiles (compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:1-70">Ezr 2:1-70</A>).</P>

 <B>6. these are the sons of Ehud</B>--most probably the judge of Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+3:15">Jud 3:15</A>).

 His descendants, who had at first been established in Geba in Benjamin,
 emigrated in a body under the direction of Gera

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+8:7">1Ch 8:7</A>)

 to Manahath, where their increased numbers would find more ample 
 accommodation. Manahath was within the territory of Judah.</P>

 <A NAME="1Ch8_8"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>8. Shaharaim begat children in the country of Moab</B>--He had probably
 been driven to take refuge in that foreign land on the same calamitous
 occasion that forced Elimelech to emigrate thither 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:1">Ru 1:1</A>).

 But, destitute of natural affection, he forsook or divorced his two 
 wives, and in the land of his sojourn married a third, by whom he had 
 several sons. But there is another explanation given of the conduct of 
 this Benjamite polygamist. His children by Hushim are mentioned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+8:11">1Ch 8:11</A>),

 while his other wife is unnoticed. Hence it has been thought probable 
 that it is Baara who is mentioned under the name of Hodesh, so called 
 because her husband, after long desertion, returned and cohabited with 
 her as before.</P>

 <B>1. all Israel were reckoned by genealogies</B>--From the beginning of
 the Hebrew nation, public records were kept, containing a registration
 of the name of every individual, as well as the tribe and family to
 which he belonged. "The book of the kings of Israel and Judah" does not
 refer to the two canonical books that are known in Scripture by that
 name, but to authenticated copies of those registers, placed under the
 official care of the sovereigns; and as a great number of the
 Israelites 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:3">1Ch 9:3</A>)

 took refuge in Judah during the invasion of Shalmaneser, they carried 
 the public records along with them. The genealogies given in the 
 preceding chapters were drawn from the public records in the archives 
 both of Israel and Judah; and those given in this chapter relate to the 
 period subsequent to the restoration; whence it appears (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+3:17-24">1Ch 3:17-24</A>)

 that the genealogical registers were kept during the captivity in 
 Babylon. These genealogical tables, then, are of the highest authority 
 for truth and correctness, the earlier portion being extracted from the 
 authenticated records of the nation; and as to those which belong to 
 the time of the captivity, they were drawn up by a contemporary writer, 
 who, besides enjoying the best sources of information, and being of the 
 strictest integrity, was guided and preserved from all error by divine 
 inspiration.</P>

 <A NAME="1Ch9_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions</B>--This chapter
 relates wholly to the first returned exiles. Almost all the names recur
 in Nehemiah 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+11:1-36">Ne 11:1-36</A>),

 although there are differences which will be explained there. The same 
 division of the people into four classes was continued after, as before 
 the captivity; namely, the priests, Levites, natives, who now were 
 called by the common name of Israelites, and the Nethinims

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:27,Ezr+2:43,8:20">Jos 9:27;
 Ezr 2:43; 8:20</A>). 

 When the historian speaks of "the first inhabitants that dwelt in their
 possessions," he implies that there were others who afterwards returned 
 and settled in possessions not occupied by the first. Accordingly, we 
 read of a great number returning successively under Ezra, Nehemiah, and 
 at a later period. And some of those who returned to the ancient 
 inheritance of their fathers, had lived before the time of the 
 captivity

 which doubtless was kept constantly closed except for the monarch's 
 use; and although there was no king in Israel on the return from the 
 captivity, yet the old ceremonial was kept up, probably in the hope 
 that the scepter would, ere long, be restored to the house of David. It 
 is an honor by which Eastern kings are distinguished, to have a gate 
 exclusively devoted to their own special use, and which is kept 
 constantly closed, except when he goes out or returns

 the heathen to vow to a national or favorite deity, that, in the event

 They are here described as those who held strongly with him 
 (<I>Margin</I>) to make him king, &c. In these words the sacred 
 historian assigns a reason for introducing the list of their names, 
 immediately after his account of the election of David as king, and the 
 conquest of Jerusalem; namely, that they assisted in making David king. 
 In the original form of the list, and the connection in which it occurs 
 in Samuel, there is no reference to the choice of a king; and even in 
 this passage it is only in the clause introduced into the 
 superscription that such a reference occurs [K<FONT

 of the well of
 Beth-lehem</B>--(See on

 <A HREF="JFB10.htm#2Sa23_15">2Sa 23:15</A>). 

 This chivalrous act evinces the enthusiastic devotion of David's men, 
 that they were ready to gratify his smallest wish at the risk of their 
 lives. It is probable that, when uttering the wish, David had no 
 recollection of the military posted at Beth-lehem. It is generally 
 taken for granted that those who fought a way to the well of Beth-lehem 
 were the three champions just mentioned [see on

 reversion. The accession of the Benjamites who came first and their 
 resolution to share his fortunes must have been particularly grateful

 Amasai or Amasa, who, by the secret impulse of the Spirit, assured him
 of their strong attachment and their zealous service from a unanimous

 <B>1-3. David consulted .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And let us bring again the ark of our
 God</B>--Gratitude for the high and splendid dignity to which he had
 been elevated would naturally, at this period, impart a fresh animation
 and impulse to the habitually fervent piety of David; but, at the same
 time, he was animated by other motives. He fully understood his
 position as ruler under the theocracy, and, entering on his duties, he
 was resolved to fulfil his mission as a constitutional king of Israel.
 Accordingly, his first act as a sovereign related to the interests of
 religion. The ark being then the grand instrument and ornament of it,
 he takes the opportunity of the official representatives of the nation
 being with him, to consult them about the propriety of establishing it
 in a more public and accessible locality. The assembly at which he
 spoke of this consisted of the Sheloshim, princes of thousands

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:1">2Sa 6:1</A>).

 During the reign of the late king, the ark had been left in culpable 
 neglect. Consequently the people had, to a great extent, been careless 
 about the ordinances of divine worship, or had contented themselves 
 with offering sacrifices at Gibeon, without any thought of the ark, 
 though it was the chief and most vital part of the tabernacle. The duty 
 and advantages of this religious movement suggested by the king were 
 apparent, and the proposal met with universal approval.</P>

 The alliance with this neighboring king, and the important advantages 
 derived from it, were among the most fortunate circumstances in David's 
 reign. The providence of God appeared concurrent with His promise in 
 smoothing the early course of his reign. Having conquered the Jebusites 
 and made Zion the royal residence, he had now, along with internal 
 prosperity, established an advantageous treaty with a neighboring 
 prince; and hence, in immediate connection with the mention of this 
 friendly league, it is said, "David perceived that the Lord had

 David was enabled to erect not only a palace for himself, but to

 prevails, each wife has a separate house or suite of apartments for 
 herself and children.

 tabernacle, which Moses had constructed in the wilderness and which had
 hitherto served the purpose of a sacred covering, was to be left at
 Gibeon, either because of the unwillingness of the inhabitants to part
 with such a venerable relic, or because there was no use for it in
 Jerusalem, where a more solid and sumptuous edifice was contemplated.
 If it appear surprising that David "made him houses" before he prepared
 this new tabernacle, it should be remembered that he had received no
 divine intimation respecting such a work.</P>

 reflection had led to a discovery of the cause of the painful 
 catastrophe that marred the first attempt. In preparing for the solemn

 regulated in strict conformity to the law

 <B>7. Then on that day David delivered first this psalm</B>--Among the other
 preparations for this solemn inauguration, the royal bard had composed
 a special hymn for the occasion. Doubtless it had been previously in
 the hands of Asaph and his assistants, but it was now publicly
 committed to them as they entered for the first time on the performance
 of their sacred duties. It occupies the greater part of this chapter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:8-36">1Ch 16:8-36</A>),

 and seems to have been compiled from other psalms of David, previously 
 known to the Israelites, as the whole of it will be found, with very 
 slight variations, in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:1-13,105:1-15,106:47,48">Ps 96:1-13; 105:1-15; 106:47, 48</A>.

 In the form, however, in which it is given by the sacred historian, it
 seems to have been the first psalm given for use in the tabernacle 
 service. Abounding, as it does, with the liveliest ascriptions of 
 praise to God for the revelation of His glorious character and the 
 display of His marvellous works and containing, as it does, so many 
 pointed allusions to the origin, privileges, and peculiar destiny of 
 the chosen people, it was admirably calculated to animate the devotions 
 and call forth the gratitude of the assembled multitude.</P>

 In the former, the author of the doxology utters the "amen" himself,
 while in the latter the people are exhorted to say "amen." This may 
 arise from the fact that the latter psalm originally concluded with the 
 injunction to say "amen." But in this historical account of the 
 festival, it was necessary to relate that the people obeyed this 
 injunction on the occasion referred to, and therefore the words "let 
 them praise," were altered into "and they praised" [B<FONT

 brought, Zadok and the priests subordinate to him were stationed at
 Gibeon to perform the sacred service before the ancient tabernacle
 which still remained there.</P>

 Thus, in the time of David, the worship was performed at two places, 
 where the sacred things that had been transmitted from the age of Moses 
 were preserved. Before the Ark in Jerusalem, Asaph and his brethren 
 officiated as singers, Obed-edom and Hosah served as doorkeepers, and 
 Benaiah and Jahaziel blew the trumpets. While at the tabernacle and 
 burnt offering in Gibeon, Heman and Jeduthun presided over the sacred 
 music, the sons of Jeduthun were door keepers, and Zadok, with his 
 suite of attendant priests, offered the sacrifices.</P>

 distinctly stated, whereas in the parallel passage

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:1">2Sa 8:1</A>)

 it was only described in a general way. Gath was the "Metheg-ammah," or
 "arm-bridle," as it is there called--either from its supremacy as the 
 capital over the other Philistine towns, or because, in the capture of 
 that important place and its dependencies, he obtained the complete 
 control of his restless neighbors.</P>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:3">2Sa 8:3</A>),

 which was probably the original form of the name, was derived from 
 Hadad, a Syrian deity.  It seems to have become the official and 
 hereditary title of the rulers of that kingdom.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Zobah</B>--Its situation is determined by the words "unto" or "towards
 Hamath," a little to the northeast of Damascus, and is supposed by some
 to be the same place as in earlier times was called Hobah 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:15">Ge 14:15</A>).
 
 Previous to the rise of Damascus, Zobah was the capital of the kingdom
 which held supremacy among the petty states of Syria.

 David is said to have taken seven hundred horsemen, whereas here it is

 the two narratives seems to have originated with a transcriber in 
 confounding the two Hebrew letters which indicate the numbers, and in 
 neglecting to mark or obscure the points over one of them. We have no 
 means of ascertaining whether seven hundred or seven thousand be the 
 more correct. Probably the former should be adopted [D<FONT

 numerous and formidable host), while he directed his brother Abishai,
 with a suitable detachment, to attack the Ammonites. Joab's address
 before the engagement displays the faith and piety that became a
 commander of the Hebrew people. The mercenaries being defeated, the
 courage of the Ammonites failed; so that, taking flight, they
 entrenched themselves within the fortified walls.</P>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of
 Ammon</B>--The former campaign had been disastrous, owing chiefly to the
 hired auxiliaries of the Ammonites; and as it was necessary, as well as
 just, that they should be severely chastised for their wanton outrage on
 the Hebrew ambassadors, Joab ravaged their country and invested their
 capital, Rabbah. After a protracted siege, Joab took one part of it, the
 lower town or "city of waters," insulated by the winding course of the
 Jabbok. Knowing that the fort called "the royal city" would soon fall,
 he invited the king to come in person, and have the honor of storming
 it. The knowledge of this fact (mentioned in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:26">2Sa 12:26</A>)

 enables us to reconcile the two statements--"David tarried at

 <B>1. Satan stood up against Israel</B>--God, by withdrawing His grace at this
 time from David
 (see on

 <A HREF="JFB10.htm#2Sa24_1">2Sa 24:1</A>),

 permitted the tempter to prevail over him. As the result of this 
 successful temptation was the entail of a heavy calamity as a 
 punishment from God upon the people, it might be said that "Satan stood 
 up against Israel."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>number Israel</B>--In the act of taking the census of a people, there is
 not only no evil, but much utility. But numbering Israel--that people
 who were to become as the stars for multitude, implying a distrust of
 the divine promise, was a sin; and though it had been done with
 impunity in the time of Moses, at that enumeration each of the people
 had contributed "half a shekel towards the building of the tabernacle,"
 that there might be no plague among them when he numbered them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:12">Ex 30:12</A>).

 Hence the numbering of that people was in itself regarded as an 
 undertaking by which the anger of God could be easily aroused; but when 
 the arrangements were made by Moses for the taking of the census, God 
 was not angry because the people were numbered for the express purpose 
 of the tax for the sanctuary, and the money which was thus collected 
 ("the atonement money,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:16">Ex 30:16</A>)

 appeased Him.  Everything depended, therefore, upon the design of the 
 census [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ERTHEAU</FONT>].  The sin of David numbering the 
 people consisted in its being either to gratify his pride to ascertain 
 the number of warriors he could muster for some meditated plan of 
 conquest; or, perhaps, more likely still, to institute a regular and 
 permanent system of taxation, which he deemed necessary to provide an 
 adequate establishment for the monarchy, but which was regarded as a 
 tyrannical and oppressive exaction--an innovation on the liberty of the 
 people--a departure from ancient usage unbecoming a king of Israel.</P>

 <B>5. Joab gave the sum of the number of the children of Israel</B>--It
 amounted to one million one hundred thousand men in Israel, capable of
 bearing arms, inclusive of the three hundred thousand military

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+27:1-9">1Ch 27:1-9</A>),

 which, being already enlisted in the royal service, were not reckoned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:9">2Sa 24:9</A>),

 and to four hundred seventy thousand men in Judah, omitting thirty 
 thousand which formed an army of observation stationed on the 
 Philistine frontier

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:1">2Sa 6:1</A>).

 So large a population at this early period, considering the limited 
 extent of the country and comparing it with the earlier census

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:1-65">Nu 26:1-65</A>),

 were not warriors 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:5">1Ch 21:5</A>),

 not being numbered (see on

 <A HREF="JFB04.htm#Nu1_47">Nu 1:47-54</A>).

 The population of Benjamin had been taken (see on

 <A HREF="#1Ch7_6">1Ch 7:6-11</A>),

 and the register preserved in the archives of that tribe. This, 
 however, was taken on another occasion, and by other agency than that 
 of Joab. The non-numbering of these two tribes might have originated in 
 the special and gracious providence of God, partly because Levi was 
 devoted to His service, and Benjamin had become the least of all the 
 tribes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+21:1-25">Jud 21:1-25</A>);

 and partly because God foresaw that they would remain faithful to the
 house of David in the division of the tribes, and therefore He would 
 not have them diminished [P<FONT SIZE=-1>OOLE</FONT>]. From the course 
 followed in this survey (see on

 <A HREF="JFB10.htm#2Sa24_4">2Sa 24:4-8</A>),
 
 it would appear that Judah and Benjamin were the last tribes that were
 to be visited; and that, after the census in Judah had been finished,
 Joab, before entering on that of Benjamin, had to return to Jerusalem,
 where the king, now sensible of his great error, gave orders to stop all
 further proceedings in the business. Not only the remonstrance of Joab
 at the first, but his slow progress in the survey 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:8">2Sa 24:8</A>)

 endowed with a prophetic gift, yet, in matters relating to himself or
 his kingdom, he was in the habit of consulting the Lord through the
 medium of the priests; and when he failed to do so, a prophet was sent
 on extraordinary occasions to admonish or chastise him. Gad, a private
 friend, was occasionally employed as the bearer of these prophetic
 messages.</P>

 occupied would end at wheat harvest. The common way of threshing corn
 is by spreading it out on a high level area, and driving backwards and
 forwards upon it two oxen harnessed to a clumsy sledge with three
 rollers and some sharp spikes. The driver sits on his knees on the box,
 while another person is employed in drawing back the straw and
 separating it from the grain underneath. By this operation the chaff is
 very much chopped, and the grain threshed out.</P>

 irregular in its form, and measures about sixty feet in one direction

 Araunah, selected by David, and continued by Solomon and Zerubbabel as 
 "the unhewn stone" on which to build the altar [BARTLETT, <I>Walks

 on the same rule as that followed by Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:3">Nu 4:3</A>),

 namely, from thirty years. But he saw afterwards that this rule might 
 be beneficially relaxed, and that the enrolment of Levites for their 
 proper duties might be made from twenty years of age. The ark and 
 tabernacle being now stationary at Jerusalem, the labor of the Levites 
 was greatly diminished, as they were no longer obliged to transport its 
 heavy furniture from place to place. The number of thirty-eight 
 thousand Levites, exclusive of priests, was doubtless more than 
 sufficient for the ordinary service of the tabernacle. But this pious 
 king thought that it would contribute to the glory of the Lord to 
 employ as many officers in his divine service as possible. These first 
 rules, however, which David instituted, were temporary, as very 
 different arrangements were made after the ark had been deposited in 
 the tabernacle of Zion.</P>

 Abiathar is mentioned as the person conjoined in David's time with
 Zadok, in the collegiate exercise of the high priesthood. Some think 
 that the words have been transposed, reading Abiathar, the son of 
 Ahimelech. But there is no ground for regarding the text as faulty. The 
 high priests of the line of Ithamar were the following: Ahiah or 
 Ahimelech, his son Abiathar, his son Ahimelech. We frequently find the 
 grandfather and grandson called by the same name (see list of high 
 priests of the line of Eleazar,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:30-41">1Ch 6:30-41</A>).
 
 Hence the author of the Chronicles was acquainted with Ahimelech, son
 of Abiathar, who, for some reason, discharged the duties of high priest
 in David's reign, and during the lifetime of his father (for Abiathar

 manner in presence of the king, the princes, the two high priests, and
 the chiefs of the priestly and Levitical families. The heads of
 families belonging to Eleazar and Ithamar were alternately brought
 forward to draw, and the name of each individual, as called, registered
 by an attendant secretary. To accommodate the casting of the lots to
 the inequality of the number, there being sixteen fathers' houses of
 Eleazar, and only eight of Ithamar, it was arranged that every house of
 Ithamar should be followed by two of Eleazar, or, what is the same
 thing, that every two houses of Eleazar should be followed by one of
 Ithamar. If, then, we suppose a commencement to have been made by
 Eleazar, the order would be as follows: one and two, Eleazar; three,
 Ithamar; four and five, Eleazar; six, Ithamar; seven and eight,
 Eleazar; nine, Ithamar; and so forth [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ERTHEAU</FONT>].
 The lot determined also the order of the priests' service. That of the
 Levites was afterwards distributed by the same arrangement

 this very suitable heading, "And their Levitical brethren over the

 <B>1. came in and went out month by month</B>--Here is an account of the
 standing military force of Israel. A militia formed, it would seem, at
 the beginning of David's reign (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+27:7">1Ch 27:7</A>)

 was raised in the following order: Twelve legions, corresponding to the 
 number of tribes, were enlisted in the king's service. Each legion 
 comprised a body of twenty-four thousand men, whose term of service was 
 a month in rotation, and who were stationed either at Jerusalem or in 
 any other place where they might be required. There was thus always a 
 force sufficient for the ordinary purposes of state, as well as for 
 resisting sudden attacks or popular tumults; and when extraordinary 
 emergencies demanded a larger force, the whole standing army could 
 easily be called to arms, amounting to two hundred eighty-eight 
 thousand, or to three hundred thousand, including the twelve thousand 
 officers that naturally attended on the twelve princes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+27:16-24">1Ch 27:16-24</A>).

 Such a military establishment would be burdensome neither to the 
 country nor to the royal treasury; for attendance on this duty being a 
 mark of honor and distinction, the expense of maintenance would be 
 borne probably by the militiaman himself, or furnished out of the 
 common fund of his tribe.  Nor would the brief period of actual service 
 produce any derangement of the usual course of affairs; for, on the 
 expiry of the term, every soldier returned to the pursuits and duties 
 of private life during the other eleven months of the year. Whether the 
 same individuals were always enrolled, cannot be determined. The 
 probability is, that provided the requisite number was furnished, no 
 stricter scrutiny would be made. A change of men might, to a certain 
 degree, be encouraged, as it was a part of David's policy to train all 
 his subjects to skill in arms; and to have made the enlistment fall 
 always on the same individuals would have defeated that purpose. To 
 have confined each month's levy rigidly within the limits of one tribe 
 might have fallen hard upon those tribes which were weak and small. The 
 rotation system being established, each division knew its own month, as 
 well as the name of the commander under whom it was to serve. These 
 commanders are styled, "the chief fathers," that is, the hereditary 
 heads of tribes who, like chieftains of clans, possessed great power 
 and influence.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>captains of thousands and hundreds</B>--The legions of twenty-four
 thousand were divided into regiments of one thousand, and these again
 into companies of a hundred men, under the direction of their
 respective subalterns, there being, of course, twenty-four captains of
 thousands, and two hundred forty centurions.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>16. over the tribes of Israel: the ruler</B>--This is a list of the
 hereditary chiefs or rulers of tribes at the time of David's numbering
 the people. Gad and Asher are not included; for what reason is unknown.
 The tribe of Levi had a prince 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+27:17">1Ch 27:17</A>),

 as well as the other tribes; and although it was ecclesiastically 
 subject to the high priest, yet in all civil matters it had a chief or 
 head, possessed of the same authority and power as in the other tribes, 
 only his jurisdiction did not extend to the priests.</P>

 the <I>lawfulness</I> of the measure, while its <I>expediency</I> was

 mentioned

 <B>for the footstool of our God</B>--God seated between the cherubim, at
 the two extremities of the ark, might be said to be enthroned in His
 glory, and the coverlet of the ark to be His footstool.

 spiritual state of the world, of which the temple at Jerusalem was to be
 a type, would be presided over by One who was to be pre-eminently the
 Prince of Peace, and therefore would be represented not so fitly by
 David, whose mission had been a preparatory one of battle and conquest,
 as by his son, who should reign in unbroken peace.</P>

 enthronement of myself and family; it was the grace of God which chose
 the tribe, the family, the person--myself in the first instance, and
 now Solomon, to whom, as the Lord's anointed, you are all bound to
 submit. Like that of Christ, of whom he was a type, the appointment of
 Solomon to the kingdom above all his brethren was frequently
 pre-intimated

 they were emblematical of rapid motion, the throne or seat was spoken
 of as a chariot 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:10,99:1">Ps 18:10; 99:1</A>).

 It is quite clear that in all these directions David was not guided by
 his own taste, or by a desire for taking any existing model of 
 architecture, but solely by a regard to the express revelation of the 
 divine will. In a vision, or trance, the whole edifice, with its 
 appurtenances, had been placed before his eyes so vividly and 
 permanently, that he had been able to take a sketch of them in the 
 models delivered to Solomon.</P>

 kingdom escaped the woe pronounced

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:16">Ec 10:16</A>).

 Mere childhood in a prince is not always a misfortune to a nation, as 
 there are instances of the government being wisely administered during 
 a minority. Solomon himself is a most illustrious proof that a young 
 prince may prove a great blessing; for when he was but a mere child, 
 with respect to his age, no nation was happier. His father, however, 
 made this address before Solomon was endowed with the divine gift of 
 wisdom, and David's reference to his son's extreme youth, in connection 
 with the great national undertaking he had been divinely appointed to 
 execute, was to apologize to this assembly of the estates--or, rather, 
 to assign the reason of his elaborate preparations for the work.</P>

 <B>3, 4. Moreover .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have of mine own proper good,</B> &c.--In addition
 to the immense amount of gold and silver treasure which David had
 already bequeathed for various uses in the service of the temple, he
 now made an additional contribution destined to a specific
 purpose--that of overlaying the walls of the house. This voluntary gift
 was from the private fortune of the royal donor, and had been selected
 with the greatest care. The gold was "the gold of Ophir," then esteemed
 the purest and finest in the world

 Isa 13:12</A>).

 The amount was three thousand talents of gold and seven thousand
 talents of refined silver.</P>

 Le 8:33; 
 1Ki 13:33</A>). 

 The meaning is, that whoever would contribute voluntarily, as he had
 done, would be offering a freewill offering to the Lord. It was a 
 sacrifice which every one of them could make, and in presenting which 
 the offerer himself would be the priest. David, in asking freewill 
 offerings for the temple, imitated the conduct of Moses in reference to 
 the tabernacle

 <P>Though it has been the common practice of Eastern monarchs to hoard
 vast sums for the accomplishment of any contemplated project, this
 amount so far exceeds not only every Oriental collection on record, but
 even the bounds of probability, that it is very generally allowed that
 either there is a corruption of the text in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:14">1Ch 22:14</A>,

 or that the reckoning of the historian was by the Babylonian, which was
 only a half, or the Syrian, which was only a fifth part, of the Hebrew 
 talent.  This would bring the Scripture account more into accordance 
 with the statements of J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>, as well as within 
 the range of credibility.</P>
