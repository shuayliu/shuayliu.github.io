 they had, in the partition of Israel and Judah, fallen to the share of

 <B>2-8. Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber</B>--This
 lattice was either a <I>part</I> of the wooden parapet, or fence, which
 surrounds the flat roofs of houses, and over which the king was
 carelessly leaning when it gave way; or it might be an opening like a
 skylight in the roof itself, done over with lattice-work, which, being
 slender or rotten, the king stepped on and slipped through. This latter
 supposition is most probably the true one, as Ahaziah did not fall
 either into the street or the court, but "in his upper chamber."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>inquire of Baalzebub</B>--Anxious to learn whether he should recover from
 the effects of this severe fall, he sent to consult Baalzebub, that is,
 the god of flies, who was considered the patron deity of medicine. A
 temple to that idol was erected at Ekron, which was resorted to far and
 wide, though it afterwards led to the destruction of the place

 Am 1:8; 
 Zep 2:4</A>). 

 "After visiting Ekron, 'the god of flies' is a name that gives me no
 surprise. The flies there swarmed, in fact so innumerably, that I could 
 hardly get any food without these troublesome insects getting into it"

 carried on all communications between the invisible God and His chosen
 people [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGSTENBERG</FONT>].
 This angel commissioned Elijah to meet the
 king's messengers, to stop them peremptorily on the idolatrous errand,
 and convey by them to the king information of his approaching death.
 This consultation of an idol, being a breach of the fundamental law of
 the kingdom 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:3,De+5:7">Ex 20:3;
 De 5:7</A>), 

 was a daring and deliberate rejection of the national religion. The
 Lord, in making this announcement of his death, designed that he should 
 see in that event a judgment for his idolatry.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4. Thou shalt not come down from that bed</B>--On being taken up, he had
 probably been laid on the divan--a raised frame, about three feet
 broad, extended along the sides of a room, covered with cushions and
 mattresses--serving, in short, as a sofa by day and a bed by night, and
 ascended by steps.

 <B>Elijah departed</B>--to his ordinary abode, which was then at Mount
 Carmel

 sheep or goatskins

 or of camel's haircloth--the coarser manufacture of this material like
 our rough haircloth. The Dervishes and Bedouins are attired in this 
 wild, uncouth manner, while their hair flows loose on the head, their 
 shaggy cloak is thrown over their shoulders and tied in front on the 
 breast, naked, except at the waist, round which is a skin girdle--a 
 broad, rough leathern belt.  Similar to this was the girdle of the 
 prophets, as in keeping with their coarse garments and their stern, 
 uncompromising office.</P>

 <B>9. Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty</B>--Any appearance of
 cruelty that there is in the fate of the two captains and their men
 will be removed, on a full consideration of the circumstances. God
 being the King of Israel, Ahaziah was bound to govern the kingdom
 according to the divine law; to apprehend the Lord's prophet, for
 discharging a commanded duty, was that of an impious and notorious
 rebel. The captains abetted the king in his rebellion; and they
 exceeded their military duty by contemptuous insults.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>man of God</B>--In using this term, they either spoke derisively, believing
 him to be no true prophet; or, if they regarded him as a true prophet,
 the summons to him to surrender himself bound to the king was a still
 more flagrant insult; the language of the second captain being worse
 than that of the first.</P>

 <B>1-7. when the Lord would take up Elijah</B>--A revelation of this event had
 been made to the prophet; but, unknown to him, it had also been
 revealed to his disciples, and to Elisha in particular, who kept
 constantly beside him.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Gilgal</B>--This Gilgal (Jiljil) was near Ebal and Gerizim; a school of the
 prophets was established there. At Beth-el there was also a school of the
 prophets, which Elijah had founded, notwithstanding that place was the
 headquarters of the calf-worship; and at Jericho there was another

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:4">2Ki 2:4</A>].

 In travelling to these places, which he had done through the impulse of
 the Spirit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:2,4-6">2Ki 2:2, 4-6</A>),

 Elijah wished to pay a farewell visit to these several institutions,
 which lay on his way to the place of ascension and, at the same time, 
 from a feeling of humility and modesty, to be in solitude, where there 
 would be no eye-witnesses of his glorification. All his efforts, 
 however, to prevail on his attendant to remain behind, were fruitless. 
 Elisha knew that the time was at hand, and at every place the sons of 
 the prophets spoke to him of the approaching removal of his master. 
 Their last stage was at the Jordan. They were followed at a distance by 
 fifty scholars of the prophets, from Jericho, who were desirous, in 
 honor of the great occasion, to witness the miraculous translation of 
 the prophet. The revelation of this striking event to so many was a 
 necessary part of the dispensation; for it was designed to be under the 
 law, like that of Enoch in the patriarchal age, a visible proof of 
 another state, and a type of the resurrection of Christ.</P>

 his entreaty, would grant it.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me</B>--This request was not,
 as is commonly supposed, for the power of working miracles exceeding
 the magnitude and number of his master's, nor does it mean a higher
 endowment of the prophetic spirit; for Elisha was neither superior to,
 nor perhaps equally great with, his predecessor. But the phrase, "a
 double portion," was applied to the first-born 

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:17">De 21:17</A>],

 observation of which would keep him in the attitude of an anxious
 waiter, as well as suppliant for the favor.</P>

 <B>went up by a whirlwind</B>--a tempest or storm wind accompanied with vivid

 <B>the chariot of Israel, and the horseman thereof</B>--that is, that as
 earthly kingdoms are dependent for their defense and glory upon warlike
 preparations, there a single prophet had done more for the preservation
 and prosperity of Israel than all her chariots and horsemen.

 witnessed by the scholars of the prophets from Jericho, they forthwith
 recognized the pre-eminence of Elisha, as now the prophet of Israel.</P>

 miraculous passage of the Jordan, they had not witnessed the ascension.
 They imagined that he might have been cast by the whirlwind on some
 mountain or valley; or, if he had actually been admitted into heaven,
 they expected that his body would still be remaining somewhere on
 earth. In compliance with their importunity, he gave them permission,
 but told them what the result would be.</P>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:51">1Ki 22:51</A>).

 To reconcile the statements in the two passages, we must suppose that
 Ahaziah, having reigned during the seventeenth and the greater part of 
 the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat, was succeeded by his brother Joram 
 or Jehoram, in the end of that eighteenth year, or else that Ahaziah, 
 having reigned two years in conjunction with his father, died at the 
 end of that period when Jehoram ascended the throne. His policy was as 
 hostile as that of his predecessors to the true religion; but he made 
 some changes. Whatever was his motive for this alteration--whether 
 dread of the many alarming judgments the patronage of idolatry had 
 brought upon his father; or whether it was made as a small concession 
 to the feelings of Jehoshaphat, his ally, he abolished idolatry in its 
 gross form and restored the symbolic worship of God, which the kings of 
 Israel, from the time of Jeroboam, had set up as a partition wall 
 between their subjects and those of Judah.</P>

 southern bend of the Dead Sea. Jehoshaphat however preferred it, partly
 because the part of the Moabite territory at which they would arrive,
 was the most defenseless; and partly because he would thereby enlist,

 quarrelled and deluged the field with their mutual slaughter; so that,
 rushing to their camp in full expectation of great spoil, they were met
 by the Israelites, who, prepared for battle, fought and pursued them.

 hill, and she stopped not in her ascent till she had disburdened her
 heavy-laden spirit at Elisha's feet. The violent paroxysm of grief into
 which she fell on approaching him, appeared to Gehazi an act of
 disrespect to his master; he was preparing to remove her when the
 prophet's observant eye perceived that she was overwhelmed with some
 unknown cause of distress. How great is a mother's love! how wondrous
 are the works of Providence! The Shunammite had not sought a son from
 the prophet--her child was, in every respect, the free gift of God. Was
 she then allowed to rejoice in the possession for a little, only to be
 pierced with sorrow by seeing the corpse of the cherished boy? Perish,
 doubt and unbelief! This event happened that "the works of God should
 be made manifest" in His prophet, "and for the glory of God."</P>

 size. Necromancers used to send their staff with orders to the
 messengers to let it come in contact with nothing by the way that might
 dissipate or destroy the virtue imparted to it. Some have thought that
 Elisha himself entertained similar ideas, and was under an impression
 that the actual application of his staff would serve as well as the
 touch of his hand. But this is an imputation dishonorable to the
 character of the prophet. He wished to teach the Shunammite, who
 obviously placed too great dependence upon him, a memorable lesson to
 look to God. By sending his servant forward to lay his staff on the
 child, he raised [the Shunammite's] expectations, but, at the same
 time, taught her that his own help was unavailing--"there was neither
 voice, nor hearing." The command, to salute no man by the way, showed the
 urgency of the mission, not simply as requiring the avoidance of the
 tedious and unnecessary greetings so common in the East

 <B>15, 16. he returned to the man of God</B>--After the miraculous cure,
 Naaman returned to Elisha, to whom he acknowledged his full belief in
 the sole supremacy of the God of Israel and offered him a liberal
 reward. But to show that he was not actuated by the mercenary motives
 of the heathen priests and prophets, Elisha, though he accepted
 presents on other occasions

 <B>8-12. the king of Syria warred against Israel</B>--This seems to have been
 a sort of guerrilla warfare, carried on by predatory inroads on
 different parts of the country. Elisha apprised King Jehoram of the
 secret purpose of the enemy; so, by adopting precautionary measures, he
 was always enabled to anticipate and defeat their attacks. The
 frequency of his disappointments having led the Syrian king to suspect
 some of his servants of carrying on a treacherous correspondence with
 the enemy, he was informed about Elisha, whose apprehension he
 forthwith determined to effect. This resolution was, of course,
 grounded on the belief that however great the knowledge of Elisha might
 be, if seized and kept a prisoner, he could no longer give information
 to the king of Israel.</P>

 The opening of the eyes, which Elisha prayed for, were those of the

 ordinary eye. The horses and chariots were symbols of the divine power 
 (see on

 <B>he led them to Samaria</B>--When they were arrived in the midst of the
 capital, their eyes, at Elisha's request, were opened, and they then
 became aware of their defenseless condition, for Jehoram had received
 private premonition of their arrival. The king, so far from being
 allowed to slay the enemies who were thus unconsciously put in his
 power, was recommended to entertain them with liberal hospitality and
 then dismiss them to their own country. This was humane advice; it was
 contrary to the usage of war to put war captives to death in cold
 blood, even when taken by the point of the sword, much more those whom
 the miraculous power and providence of God had unexpectedly placed at
 his disposal. In such circumstances, kind and hospitable treatment was
 every way more becoming in itself, and would be productive of the best
 effects. It would redound to the credit of the true religion, which
 inspired such an excellent spirit into its professors; and it would not
 only prevent the future opposition of the Syrians but make them stand
 in awe of a people who, they had seen, were so remarkably protected by
 a prophet of the Lord. The latter clause of

 humbled on account of his own and the nation's sins; otherwise he would
 not have vowed vengeance on the prophet's life. The true explanation
 seems to be, that Elisha having counselled him not to surrender, with
 the promise, on condition of deep humiliation, of being delivered, and
 he having assumed the signs of contrition without receiving the
 expected relief, regarded Elisha who had proved false and faithless as

 Jehoram was a wicked king and most of his courtiers would resemble

 to the true religion. A meeting, probably a prayer-meeting, of those

 restoration of the Shunammite's son when she made her appearance to

 article of bedding is generally a thick quilt of wool or cotton, so 
 that, with its great weight, when steeped in water, it would be a fit 
 instrument for accomplishing the murderous purpose, without leaving any 
 marks of violence. It has been supposed by many doubtful that Hazael 
 purposely murdered the king. But it is common for Eastern people to 
 sleep with their faces covered with a mosquito net; and, in some cases 
 of fever, they dampen the bedclothes. Hazael, aware of those chilling 
 remedies being usually resorted to, might have, with an honest 
 intention, spread a refreshing cover over him. The rapid occurrence of

 be chosen, being at the very top of the gate building, and fully in
 view of the people and military in the open ground in front of the
 building [K<FONT SIZE=-1>ITTO</FONT>].
 The popularity of Jehu with the army thus favored the

 proclamation as king, and the top of the stairs was taken as a most

 <B>17-24. there stood a watchman on the tower of Jezreel</B>--The Hebrew
 palaces, besides being situated on hills had usually towers attached to
 them, not only for the pleasure of a fine prospect, but as posts of
 useful observation. The ancient watchtower of Jezreel must have
 commanded a view of the whole region eastward, nearly down to the
 Jordan. Beth-shan stands on a rising ground about six or seven miles
 below it, in a narrow part of the plain; and when Jehu and his retinue
 reached that point between Gilboa and Beth-shan, they could be fully
 descried by the watchman on the tower. A report was made to Joram in
 his palace below. A messenger on horseback was quickly despatched down
 into the plain to meet the ambiguous host and to question the object of
 their approach. "Is it peace?" We may safely assume that this messenger
 would meet Jehu at the distance of three miles or more. On the report
 made of his being detained and turned into the rear of the still
 advancing troops, a second messenger was in like manner despatched, who
 would naturally meet Jehu at the distance of a mile or a mile and a
 half down on the plain. He also being turned into the rear, the
 watchman now distinctly perceived "the driving to be like the driving
 of Jehu, the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously." The alarmed
 monarch, awakened to a sense of his impending danger, quickly summoned
 his forces to meet the crisis. Accompanied by Ahaziah, king of Judah,
 the two sovereigns ascended their chariots to make a feeble resistance
 to the impetuous onset of Jehu, who quickly from the plain ascended the
 steep northern sides of the site on which Jezreel stood, and the
 conflicting parties met "in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite,"
 where Joram was quickly despatched by an arrow from the strong arm of
 Jehu. We were impressed with the obvious accuracy of the sacred
 historian; the <I>localities</I> and <I>distances</I> being such as seem
 naturally to be required by the incidents related, affording just time
 for the transactions to have occurred in the order in which they are

 strongholds of that city on the news of Jehu's conspiracy. It may be 
 inferred from the tenor of Jehu's letters that their first intention 
 was to select the fittest of the royal family and set him up as king.  
 Perhaps this challenge of Jehu was designed as a stroke of policy on 
 his part to elicit their views, and to find out whether they were

 to impress their minds with the idea that so wholesale a massacre was 
 the result of the divine judgments denounced on the house of Ahab; and 
 the effect of it was to prepare the public mind for hearing, without 
 horror, of a similar revolting tragedy which was soon after 
 perpetrated, namely, the extinction of all the influential friends and 
 supporters of the dynasty of Ahab, including those of the royal house 
 of Judah.</P>

 <B>19. call unto me all the prophets of Baal</B>--The votaries of Baal are
 here classified under the several titles of prophets, priests, and
 servants, or worshippers generally. They might be easily convened into
 one spacious temple, as their number had been greatly diminished both
 by the influential ministrations of Elijah and Elisha, and also from
 the late King Joram's neglect and discontinuance of the worship. Jehu's
 appointment of a solemn sacrifice in honor of Baal, and a summons to
 all his worshippers to join in its celebration, was a deep-laid plot,
 which he had resolved upon for their extinction, a measure in perfect
 harmony with the Mosaic law, and worthy of a constitutional king of
 Israel. It was done, however, not from religious, but purely political
 motives, because he believed that the existence and interests of the
 Baalites were inseparably bound up with the dynasty of Ahab and because
 he hoped that by their extermination he would secure the attachment of
 the far larger and more influential party who worshipped God in Israel.
 Jehonadab's concurrence must have been given in the belief of his being
 actuated solely by the highest principles of piety and zeal.</P>

 This massacre she was incited to perpetrate--partly from a
 determination not to let David's family outlive hers; partly as a

 who was bent on destroying the whole of Ahab's posterity to which she
 belonged

 of Jehoash.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers,</B> &c.--He could scarcely have
 obtained such a general convocation except at the time, or on pretext,
 of a public and solemn festival. Having revealed to them the secret of
 the young king's preservation and entered into a covenant with them for
 the overthrow of the tyrant, he then arranged with them the plan and
 time of carrying their plot into execution
 (see on

 <A HREF="JFB14.htm#2Ch22_10">2Ch 22:10-23:21</A>).

 The conduct of Jehoiada, who acted the leading and chief part in this
 conspiracy, admits of an easy and full justification; for, while
 Athaliah was a usurper, and belonged to a race destined by divine
 denunciation to destruction, even his own wife had a better and
 stronger claim to the throne; the sovereignty of Judah had been
 divinely appropriated to the family of David, and therefore the young
 prince on whom it was proposed to confer the crown, possessed an
 inherent right to it, of which a usurper could not deprive him.
 Moreover, Jehoiada was most probably the high priest, whose official
 duty it was to watch over the due execution of God's laws, and who in
 his present movement, was encouraged and aided by the countenance and
 support of the chief authorities, both civil and ecclesiastical, in the
 country. In addition to all these considerations, he seems to have been
 directed by an impulse of the Divine Spirit, through the counsels and
 exhortations of the prophets of the time.</P>

 this, and by it the king bound himself to rule according to the divine 
 law, while the people engaged to submit, to give him allegiance as the 
 Lord's anointed. The immediate fruit of this renewal of the covenant

 rules

 collection not proving so productive as was expected (the dilatoriness
 of the priests was the chief cause of the failure), a new arrangement
 was proposed. A chest was placed by the high priest at the entrance
 into the temple, into which the money given by the people for the
 repairs of the temple was to be put by the Levites who kept the door.
 The object of this chest was to make a separation between the money
 to be raised for the building from the other moneys destined for the
 general use of the priests, in the hope that the people would be more
 liberal in their contributions when it was known that their offerings
 would be devoted to the special purpose of making the necessary
 repairs. The duty of attending to this work was no longer to devolve on
 the priests, but to be undertaken by the king.</P>

 performed in the open air upon a level plot of ground, daubed over with
 a covering to prevent, as much as possible, the earth, sand, or gravel
 from rising; a great quantity of them all, notwithstanding this
 precaution, must unavoidably be taken up with the grain; at the same
 time the straw is shattered to pieces. Hence it is a most significant
 figure, frequently employed by Orientals to describe a state of
 national suffering, little short of extermination

 prophetic predecessor, who did not die.

 These words seem to have been a complimentary phrase applied to one who
 was thought an eminent guardian and deliverer of his country. The 
 particular application of them to Elisha, who, by his counsels and 
 prayer, had obtained many glorious victories for Israel, shows that the 
 king possessed some measure of faith and trust, which, though weak, was 
 accepted, and called forth the prophet's dying benediction.</P>

 a herald, sometimes by a king or general making a public and formal
 discharge of an arrow into the enemy's country. Elisha directed Joash
 to do this, as a symbolical act, designed to intimate more fully and
 significantly the victories promised to the king of Israel over the
 Syrians. His laying his hands upon the king's hands was to represent
 the power imparted to the bow shot as coming from the Lord through the
 medium of the prophet. His shooting the first arrow eastward--to that
 part of his kingdom which the Syrians had taken and which was east of
 Samaria--was a declaration of war against them for the invasion. His
 shooting the other arrows into the ground was in token of the number of
 victories he was taken to gain; but his stopping at the third betrayed
 the weakness of his faith; for, as the discharged arrow signified a
 victory over the Syrians, it is evident that the more arrows he shot
 the more victories he would gain. As he stopped so soon, his conquests
 would be incomplete.</P>

 beginning campaigns in ancient times. Predatory bands from Moab
 generally made incursions at that time on the lands of Israel. The
 bearers of a corpse, alarmed by the appearance of one of these bands,
 hastily deposited, as they passed that way, their load in Elisha's
 sepulchre, which might be easily done by removing the stone at the
 mouth of the cave. According to the Jewish and Eastern custom, his
 body, as well as that of the man who was miraculously restored, was not
 laid in a coffin, but only swathed; so that the bodies could be brought
 into contact, and the object of the miracle was to stimulate the king's
 and people of Israel's faith in the still unaccomplished predictions of
 Elisha respecting the war with the Syrians. Accordingly the historian
 forthwith records the historical fulfilment of the prediction

 they intend to convey unwelcome truths or a contemptuous sneer. This
 was the design of the admonitory fable related by Joash in his reply.
 The thistle, a low shrub, might be chosen to represent Amaziah, a petty
 prince; the cedar, the powerful sovereign of Israel, and the wild beast
 that trampled down the thistle the overwhelming army with which Israel
 could desolate Judah. But, perhaps, without making so minute an
 application, the parable may be explained generally, as describing in a
 striking manner the effects of pride and ambition, towering far beyond
 their natural sphere, and sure to fall with a sudden and ruinous crash.

 surprised him ere he had completed his military preparations. Pouring a 
 large army into the territory of Judah, he encountered Amaziah in a 
 pitched battle, routed his army, and took him prisoner. Then having 
 marched to Jerusalem

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:13">2Ki 14:13</A>],

 he not only demolished part of the city walls, but plundered the
 treasures of the palace and temple. Taking hostages to prevent any 
 further molestation from Judah, he terminated the war.  Without leaving 
 a garrison in Jerusalem, he returned to his capital with all convenient 
 speed, his presence and all his forces being required to repel the 
 troublesome incursions of the Syrians.</P>

 <B>19. Pul the king of Assyria</B>--This is the first Assyrian king after
 Nimrod who is mentioned in biblical history. His name has been recently
 identified with that of Phalluka on the monuments of Nineveh, and that
 of Menahem discovered also.

 the Assyrian" 

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:13">Ho 5:13</A>].

 The two statements may be reconciled thus: "Pul, of his own motion,
 induced, perhaps, by the expedition of Menahem against Thapsacus, 
 advanced against the kingdom of Israel; then Menahem sent him a 
 thousand talents in order not only to divert him from his plans of 
 conquest, but at the same time to purchase his friendship and aid for 
 the establishment of his own precarious sovereignty. So Menahem did not 
 properly invite the Assyrian into the land, but only changed the enemy 
 when marching against the country, by this tribute, into a confederate 
 for the security of his usurped dominion. This the prophet Hosea, less 
 concerned about the historical fact than the disposition betrayed 
 therein, might very well censure as a going of Ephraim to the Assyrians

 The character of this king's reign, the voluptuousness and religious
 degeneracy of all classes of the people, are graphically portrayed in 
 the writings of Isaiah, who prophesied at that period. The great 
 increase of worldly wealth and luxury in the reigns of Azariah and 
 Jotham had introduced a host of corruptions, which, during his reign, 
 and by the influence of Ahaz, bore fruit in the idolatrous practices of 
 every kind which prevailed in all parts of the kingdom (see

 aid from the Assyrian monarch, to purchase which he sent the treasures

 that heathen city, Ahaz saw an altar with which he was greatly
 captivated. Forthwith a sketch of it was transmitted to Jerusalem, with
 orders to Urijah the priest to get one constructed according to the
 Damascus model, and let this new altar supersede the old one in the
 temple. Urijah, with culpable complaisance, acted according to his

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:30">2Ki 15:30</A>

 may be reconciled with the present passage in the following manner:
 Hoshea conspired against Pekah in the twentieth year of the latter, 
 which was the eighteenth of Jotham's reign. It was two years before 
 Hoshea was acknowledged king of Israel, that is, in the fourth of Ahaz, 
 and twentieth of Jotham. In the twelfth year of Ahaz his reign began to 
 be tranquil and prosperous [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALMET</FONT>].</P>

 rites of Baal, nor compelled the people to adhere to the symbolic
 worship of the calves.
 [See on

 <A HREF="JFB14.htm#2Ch30_1">2Ch 30:1</A>.]

 In these respects, Hoshea acted as became a constitutional king of
 Israel. Yet, through the influence of the nineteen princes who had 
 swayed the scepter before him (all of whom had been zealous patrons of 
 idolatry, and many of whom had been also infamous for personal crimes), 
 the whole nation had become so completely demoralized that the 
 righteous judgment of an angry Providence impended over it.</P>

 years, Hoshea, determined on throwing off the Assyrian yoke, withheld
 the stipulated tribute. Shalmaneser, incensed at this rebellion,
 proclaimed war against Israel. This was in the sixth year of Hoshea's
 reign.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he had sent messengers to So, king of Egypt</B>--the Sabaco of the classic
 historians, a famous Ethiopian who, for fifty years, occupied the
 Egyptian throne, and through whose aid Hoshea hoped to resist the
 threatened attack of the Assyrian conqueror. But Shalmaneser,
 marching against [Hoshea], scoured the whole country of Israel,
 besieged the capital Samaria, and carried the principal inhabitants
 into captivity in his own land, having taken the king himself, and
 imprisoned him for life. This ancient policy of transplanting a
 conquered people into a foreign land, was founded on the idea that,
 among a mixed multitude, differing in language and religion, they would
 be kept in better subjection, and have less opportunity of combining
 together to recover their independence.</P>

 through which they flow, is peculiarly of this character. The
 Nestorians repair to it with their numerous flocks, spending the summer
 on the banks or in the highlands of the Chabor or the Zab. Considering
 the high authority we possess for regarding Gozan and Zozan as one
 name, there can be no doubt that this is the Gozan referred to in this
 passage.

 who established his headquarters at Beth-el, and taught them how they
 should fear the Lord. It is not said that he took a copy of the 
 Pentateuch with him, out of which he might teach them.  <I>Oral 
 teaching</I> was much better fitted for the superstitious people than 
 instruction out of a written book. He could teach them more effectually 
 by word of mouth. Believing that he would adopt the best and simplest 
 method for them, it is unlikely that he took the written law with him, 
 and so gave origin to the Samaritan copy of the Pentateuch [D<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>AVIDSON</FONT>, <I>Criticism</I>]. Besides, it is evident from 
 his being one of the exiled priests, and from his settlement at 
 Beth-el, that he was not a Levite, but one of the calf-worshipping 
 priests.  Consequently his instructions would be neither sound nor 
 efficient.</P>

 <B>1, 2. Hezekiah .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. began to reign. Twenty and five years
 old</B>--According to this statement (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:2">2Ki 16:2</A>),

 he must have been born when his father Ahaz was no more than eleven
 years old.  Paternity at an age so early is not unprecedented in the 
 warm climates of the south, where the human frame is matured sooner 
 than in our northern regions. But the case admits of solution in a 
 different way.  It was customary for the later kings of Israel to 
 assume their son and heir into partnership in the government during 
 their lives; and as Hezekiah began to reign in the third year of Hoshea

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:1">2Ki 18:1</A>),
 
 and Hoshea in the twelfth year of Ahaz

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:1">2Ki 17:1</A>),

 it is evident that Hezekiah began to reign in the fourteenth year of
 Ahaz his father, and so reigned two or three years before his father's 
 death. So that, at the beginning of his reign in conjunction with his 
 father, he might be only twenty-two or twenty-three, and Ahaz a few 
 years older than the common calculation makes him. Or the case may be 
 solved thus: As the ancient writers, in the computation of time, take 
 notice of the year they mention, whether finished or newly begun, so 
 Ahaz might be near twenty-one years old at the beginning of his reign, 
 and near seventeen years older at his death; while, on the other hand, 
 Hezekiah, when he began to reign, might be just entering into his 
 twenty-fifth year, and so Ahaz would be near fourteen years old when 
 his son Hezekiah was born--no uncommon age for a young man to become a 
 father in southern latitudes [P<FONT SIZE=-1>ATRICK</FONT>].</P>

 might, like the pot of manna and Aaron's rod, have remained an
 interesting and instructive monument of the divine goodness and mercy 
 to the Israelites in the wilderness: and it must have required the 
 exercise of no small courage and resolution to destroy it. But in the 
 progress of degeneracy it had become an object of idolatrous worship 
 and as the interests of true religion rendered its demolition 
 necessary, Hezekiah, by taking this bold step, consulted both the glory 
 of God and the good of his country.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it</B>--It is
 not to be supposed that this superstitious reverence had been paid to
 it ever since the time of Moses, for such idolatry would not have been
 tolerated either by David or by Solomon in the early part of his reign,
 by Asa or Jehoshaphat had they been aware of such a folly. But the
 probability is, that the introduction of this superstition does not
 date earlier than the time when the family of Ahab, by their alliance
 with the throne of Judah, exercised a pernicious influence in paving
 the way for all kinds of idolatry. It is possible, however, as some
 think, that its origin may have arisen out of a misapprehension of
 Moses' language 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:8">Nu 21:8</A>).

 Serpent-worship, how revolting soever it may appear, was an extensively
 diffused form of idolatry; and it would obtain an easier reception in 
 Israel because many of the neighboring nations, such as the Egyptians 
 and Ph&oelig;nicians, adored idol gods in the form of serpents as the
 emblems of health and immortality.</P>

 similar testimony borne to him 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:25">2Ki 23:25</A>).

 But even he was surpassed by Hezekiah, who set about a national
 reformation at the beginning of his reign, which Josiah did not. The 
 pious character and the excellent course of Hezekiah was prompted, 
 among other secondary influences, by a sense of the calamities his 
 father's wicked career had brought on the country, as well as by the 
 counsels of Isaiah.</P>

 <B>7, 8. he rebelled against the king of Assyria</B>--that is, the yearly
 tribute his father had stipulated to pay, he, with imprudent haste,
 withdrew. Pursuing the policy of a truly theocratic sovereign, he was,
 through the divine blessing which rested on his government, raised to a
 position of great public and national strength. Shalmaneser had
 withdrawn from Palestine, being engaged perhaps in a war with Tyre, or
 probably he was dead. Assuming, consequently, that full independent
 sovereignty which God had settled on the house of David, he both shook
 off the Assyrian yoke, and, by an energetic movement against the
 Philistines, recovered from that people the territory which they had
 taken from his father Ahaz

 The following account of Sennacherib's invasion of Judah and the
 remarkable destruction of his army, is repeated almost verbatim in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:1-33,Isa+36:1-37:38">2Ch 32:1-33
 and Isa 36:1-37:38</A>.

 The expedition seems to have been directed against Egypt, the conquest
 of which was long a leading object of ambition with the Assyrian 
 monarchs.  But the invasion of Judah necessarily preceded, that country 
 being the key to Egypt, the highway through which the conquerors from 
 Upper Asia had to pass. Judah had also at this time formed a league of 
 mutual defense with Egypt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:24">2Ki 18:24</A>).

 Moreover, it was now laid completely open by the transplantation of
 Israel to Assyria. Overrunning Palestine, Sennacherib laid siege to the 
 fortress of Lachish, which lay seven Roman miles from Eleutheropolis, 
 and therefore southwest of Jerusalem on the way to Egypt [R<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OBINSON</FONT>].  Among the interesting illustrations of sacred 
 history furnished by the recent Assyrian excavations, is a series of 
 bas-reliefs, representing the siege of a town, which the inscription on 
 the sculpture shows to be Lachish, and the figure of a king, whose name 
 is given, on the same inscription, as Sennacherib. The legend, 
 sculptured over the head of the king, runs thus: "Sennacherib, the 
 mighty king, king of the country of Assyria, sitting on the throne of 
 judgment before the city of Lachish [Lakhisha], I give permission for 
 its slaughter" [<I>Nineveh and Babylon</I>].  This minute confirmation 
 of the truth of the Bible narrative is given not only by the name 
 Lachish, which is contained in the inscription, but from the 
 physiognomy of the captives brought before the king, which is 
 unmistakably Jewish.</P>

 feeling himself unable to resist so mighty a conqueror who was menacing 
 Jerusalem itself, Hezekiah made his submission. The payment of 300 
 talents of silver, and 30 talents of gold--&pound;351,000--brought a 
 temporary respite; but, in raising the imposed tribute, he was obliged 
 not only to drain all the treasures of the palace and the temple, but 
 even to strip the doors and pillars of the sacred edifice of the gold 
 that adorned them.</P>

 letter to Hezekiah, in order that he might force the king of Judah to 
 an immediate surrender of his capital. This letter, couched in the same 
 vaunting and imperious style as the speech of Rab-shakeh, exceeded it 
 in blasphemy, and contained a larger enumeration of conquered places, 
 with the view of terrifying Hezekiah and showing him the utter 
 hopelessness of all attempts at resistance.</P>

 <B>14-19. Hezekiah received the letter .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and went up into the house
 of the Lord</B>--Hezekiah, after reading it, hastened into the temple,
 spread it in the childlike confidence of faith before the Lord, as
 containing taunts deeply affecting the divine honor, and implored
 deliverance from this proud defier of God and man. The devout spirit of
 this prayer, the recognition of the Divine Being in the plenitude of
 His majesty--so strikingly contrasted with the fancy of the Assyrians
 as to His merely local power; his acknowledgment of the conquests
 obtained over other lands; and of the destruction of their wooden idols
 which, according to the Assyrian practice, were committed to the
 flames--because their tutelary deities were no gods; and the object for
 which he supplicated the divine interposition--that all the
 kingdoms of the earth might know that the Lord was the only God--this
 was an attitude worthy to be assumed by a pious theocratic king of the
 chosen people.</P>

 the prophet announced to the king that his prayer was heard. The
 prophetic message consisted of three different portions:--<I>First,</I> Sennacherib is apostrophized 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+19:21-28">2Ki 19:21-28</A>)

 in a highly poetical strain, admirably descriptive of the turgid
 vanity, haughty pretensions, and presumptuous impiety of the Assyrian 
 despot.  <I>Secondly,</I> Hezekiah is addressed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+19:29-31">2Ki 19:29-31</A>),

 and a sign is given him of the promised deliverance--namely, that for
 two years the presence of the enemy would interrupt the peaceful 
 pursuits of husbandry, but in the third year the people would be in 
 circumstances to till their fields and vineyards and reap the fruits as 
 formerly.  <I>Thirdly,</I> the issue of Sennacherib's invasion is 
 announced

 an arrow, not even from the most powerful engine which throws missiles
 to the greatest distance, nor shall he occupy any part of the ground
 before the city by a fence, a mantelet, or covering for men employed in
 a siege, nor cast (raise) a bank (mound) of earth, overtopping the city
 walls, whence he may see and command the interior of the city. None of
 these, which were the principal modes of attack followed in ancient
 military art, should Sennacherib be permitted to adopt. Though the army
 under Rab-shakeh marched towards Jerusalem and encamped at a little
 distance with a view to blockade it, they delayed laying siege to it,
 probably waiting till the king, having taken Lachish and Libnah, should
 bring up his detachment, that with all the combined forces of Assyria
 they might invest the capital. So determined was this invader to
 conquer Judah and the neighboring countries 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:7">Isa 10:7</A>),

 that nothing but a divine interposition could have saved Jerusalem. It
 might be supposed that the powerful monarch who overran Palestine and 
 carried away the tribes of Israel, would leave memorials of his deeds 
 on sculptured slabs, or votive bulls. A long and minute account of this 
 expedition is contained in the Annals of Sennacherib, a translation of 
 which has recently been made into English, and, in his remarks upon it, 
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>OLONEL</FONT> R<FONT SIZE=-1>AWLINSON</FONT> says the

 the secondary agent employed in the destruction of the Assyrian army,

 The destruction was during the night; the officers and soldiers, being
 in full security, were negligent; their discipline was relaxed; the 
 camp guards were not alert, or perhaps they themselves were the first 
 taken off, and those who slept, <I>not wrapped up,</I> imbibed the

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:28-32">Isa 10:28-32</A>).

 The early chariot track near Beyrout is on the rocky edge of Lebanon,
 which is skirted by the ancient Lycus (Nahr-el Kelb).  On the 
 perpendicular face of the limestone rock, at different heights, are 
 seen slabs with Assyrian inscriptions, which having been deciphered, 
 are found to contain the name of Sennacherib. Thus, by the preservation 
 of these tablets, the wrath of the Assyrian invaders is made to praise 
 the Lord.

 was assassinated by his two sons, whom, it is said, he intended to
 sacrifice to pacify the gods and dispose them to grant him a return of

 and his kingdom was invaded in the fourteenth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:13">2Ki 18:13</A>),

 it is evident that this sudden and severe illness must have occurred in
 the very year of the Syrian invasion. Between the threatened attack and 
 the actual appearance of the enemy, this incident in Hezekiah's history 
 must have taken place. But according to the usage of the sacred 
 historian, the story of Sennacherib is completed before entering on 
 what was personal to the king of Judah (see also

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:36-38:1">Isa 37:36-38:1</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Set thine house in order</B>--Isaiah, being of the blood royal, might have
 access to the king's private house. But since the prophet was
 commissioned to make this announcement, the message must be considered
 as referring to matters of higher importance than the settlement of the
 king's domestic and private affairs. It must have related chiefly to
 the state of his kingdom, he having not as yet any son (compare

 He had kept the conditions as faithfully as human infirmity admitted;
 and as he had been all along free from any of those great crimes by 
 which, through the judgment of God, human life was often suddenly cut 
 short, his great grief might arise partly from the love of life, partly 
 from the obscurity of the Mosaic dispensation, where life and 
 immortality had not been fully brought to light, and partly from his 
 plans for the reformation of his kingdom being frustrated by his death. 
 He pleaded the fulfilment of the promise.</P>

 experience, both by the prolongation of his life, and his deliverance
 from the Assyrians.

 <B>8-11. Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What will be the sign that the Lord
 shall heal me</B>--His recovery in the course of nature was so unlooked
 for, that the king asked for some token to justify his reliance on the
 truth of the prophet's communication; and the sign he specified was
 granted to him. The shadow of the sun went back upon the dial of Ahaz
 the ten degrees it had gone down. Various conjectures have been formed
 as to this dial. The word in the original is "degrees," or "steps," and
 hence many commentators have supposed that it was a stair, so artfully
 contrived, that the shadows on the steps indicated the hours and course
 of the sun. But it is more probable that it was a proper instrument,
 and, from the Hebrews having no term to designate it, that it was one
 of the foreign novelties imported from Babylon by Ahaz. It seems to
 have been of such magnitude, and so placed in the court, that Isaiah
 could point to it, and the king see it, from his chamber. The
 retrogression of the sun's shadow on the dial was miraculously
 accomplished by the omnipotent power of God; but the phenomenon was
 temporary, local, confined to the notice, and intended for the
 satisfaction, only of Hezekiah and his court.</P>

 off the yoke, and asserting his independence, made with varying 
 success, a long and obstinate resistance [R<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>AWLINSON</FONT>, <I>Outlines</I>].  The message of 
 congratulation to Hezekiah, was, in all likelihood, accompanied with 
 proposals for a defensive alliance against their common Assyrian enemy. 
 The king of Judah, flattered with this honor, showed the ambassadors 
 all his treasures, his armory and warlike stores; and his motive for 
 this was evidently that the Babylonian deputies might be the more 
 induced to prize his friendship.</P>

 Sennacherib as exhausted his treasury (compare

 But, after the destruction of Sennacherib, presents were brought him
 from various quarters, out of respect to a king who, by his faith and 
 prayer, saved his country; and besides, it is by no means improbable 
 that from the corpses in the Assyrian camp, all the gold and silver he 
 had paid might be recovered. The vain display, however, was offensive 
 to his divine liege lord, who sent Isaiah to reprove him. The answer he 
 gave the prophet

 been born three years after his father's recovery; and his minority,
 spent under the influence of guardians who were hostile to the
 religious principles and reforming policy of his father, may account in
 part for the anti-theocratic principles of his reign. The work of
 religious reformation which Hezekiah had zealously carried on was but
 partially accomplished. There was little appearance of its influence on
 the heart and manners of the people at large. On the contrary, the true
 fear of God had vanished from the mass of the people; corruption and
 vice increased, and were openly practised 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:7">Isa 28:7</A>,

 &c.) by the degenerate leaders, who, having got the young prince
 Manasseh into their power, directed his education, trained him up in 
 their views, and seduced him into the open patronage of idolatry. 
 Hence, when he became sovereign, he introduced the worship of idols, 
 the restoration of high places, and the erection of altars or pillars 
 to Baal, and the placing, in the temple of God itself, a graven image 
 of Asherah, the sacred or symbolic tree, which represented "all the

 Chaldea into the land of Israel to pursue their gainful occupations,
 especially during the reigns of the latter kings; and Manasseh was not
 only their liberal patron, but zealous to appear himself an adept in
 the arts. He raised them to be an influential class at his court, as

 <B>3, 4. in the eighteenth year of king Josiah</B>--Previous to this period,
 he had commenced the work of national reformation. The preliminary
 steps had been already taken; not only the builders were employed, but
 money had been brought by all the people and received by the Levites at
 the door, and various other preparations had been made. But the course
 of this narrative turns on one interesting incident which happened in
 the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign, and hence that date is
 specified. In fact the whole land was thoroughly purified from every
 object and all traces of idolatry. The king now addressed himself to
 the repair and embellishment of the temple and gave directions to
 Hilkiah the high priest to take a general survey, in order to ascertain
 what was necessary to be done

 was the temple copy which, had been laid 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:25,26">De 31:25, 26</A>)

 beside the ark in the most holy place. During the ungodly reigns of
 Manasseh and Amon--or perhaps under Ahaz, when the temple itself had 
 been profaned by idols, and the ark also

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:3">2Ch 35:3</A>)

 removed from its site; it was somehow lost, and was now found again

 it was by the latter shown and read to the king. It is thought, with
 great probability, that the passage read to the king, and by which the 
 royal mind was so greatly excited, was a portion of Deuteronomy, the 
 twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth chapters, in which is 
 recorded a renewal of the national covenant, and an enumeration of the 
 terrible threats and curses denounced against all who violated the law, 
 whether prince or people. The impressions of grief and terror which the 
 reading produced on the mind of Josiah have seemed to many 
 unaccountable. But, as it is certain from the extensive and familiar 
 knowledge displayed by the prophets, that there were numbers of other 
 copies in popular circulation, the king must have known its sacred 
 contents in some degree. But he might have been a stranger to the 
 passage read him, or the reading of it might, in the peculiar 
 circumstances, have found a way to his heart in a manner that he never 
 felt before. His strong faith in the divine word, and his painful 
 consciousness that the woeful and long-continued apostasies of the 
 nation had exposed them to the infliction of the judgments denounced, 
 must have come with overwhelming force on the heart of so pious a 
 prince.</P>

 to avert the threatened calamities from his kingdom and people. Knowing 
 the richness of the divine clemency and grace to the penitent, he

 accompanied by the collective body of the inhabitants, went in solemn 
 procession to the temple, where he ordered the book of the law to be

 commandments of the Lord. It was an occasion of solemn interest,

 of officiating on high places, and presenting such sacrifices as were

 worship was the true God, were prohibited in the law

 were usually dedicated to that divinity, from the supposed idea that
 the sun himself was drawn in a chariot by horses. In some cases these
 horses were sacrificed; but more commonly they were employed either in
 the sacred processions to carry the images of the sun, or for the
 worshippers to ride in every morning to welcome his rise. It seems that
 the idolatrous kings, Ahaz, Manasseh, and Amon, or their great
 officers, proceeded on these horses early on each day from the east
 gate of the temple to salute and worship the sun at his appearing above

 only defiled, "the high places on the hill of corruption." It is most

 Samaria and all the territory formerly occupied by the ten tribes,
 destroying the altars and temples of the high places, consigning the
 Asherim to the flames, putting to death the priests of the high places,

 idolatrous priests, and strewing the burnt ashes of their bones upon

 so early did he indicate a feeling hostile to the interests of his
 Assyrian liege lord, by forming a league with Egypt. Nebuchadnezzar 
 sent his generals to besiege Jerusalem, as Jeremiah had foretold

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:28,34:20">Jer 22:28; 34:20</A>),

 and soon after he followed in person. Convinced of the hopelessness of
 making any effectual resistance, Jehoiachin, going to the camp of the 
 besiegers, surrendered

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:12">2Ki 24:12</A>),

 in the expectation, probably, of being allowed to retain his throne as
 a vassal of the Assyrian empire. But Nebuchadnezzar's clemency towards 
 the kings of Judah was now exhausted, so that Jehoiachin was sent as a 
 captive to Babylon, according to Jeremiah's prediction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:24">Jer 22:24</A>),

 his generals, and officers. This happened in the eighth year of
 Nebuchadnezzar's reign, computing from the time when he was associated 
 with his father in the government. Those that were left consisted 
 chiefly of the poorer sort of people and the unskilled workmen. The 
 palace and the temple were ransacked. The smaller golden vessels had 
 been taken on the first capture of Jerusalem and placed by 
 Nebuchadnezzar in the temple of his god as tokens of victory. They were 
 used by Belshazzar at his impious feast

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:2">Da 5:2</A>],

 <B>1. Nebuchadnezzar .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. came .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. against Jerusalem</B>--Incensed by the
 revolt of Zedekiah, the Assyrian despot determined to put an end to the
 perfidious and inconstant monarchy of Judea. This chapter narrates his
 third and last invasion, which he conducted in person at the head of an
 immense army, levied out of all the tributary nations under his sway.
 Having overrun the northern parts of the country and taken almost all
 the fenced cities 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:7">Jer 34:7</A>),

 he marched direct to Jerusalem to invest it. The date of the beginning

 Jer 39:1; 52:4-6</A>);

 from which it appears, that, with a brief interruption caused by
 Nebuchadnezzar's marching to oppose the Egyptians who were coming to
 its relief but who retreated without fighting, the siege lasted a year
 and a half. So long a resistance was owing, not to the superior skill
 and valor of the Jewish soldiers, but to the strength of the city
 fortifications, on which the king too confidently relied (compare

 <B>22-26. Nebuchadnezzar .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. made Gedaliah .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
 ruler</B>--The people permitted to remain were, besides the king's 
 daughters, a few court attendants and others

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:7">Jer 40:7</A>)

 too insignificant to be removed, only the peasantry who could till the
 land and dress the vineyards. Gedaliah was Jeremiah's friend

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+26:24">Jer 26:24</A>),

 and having, by the prophet's counsel, probably fled from the city as
 abandoned of God, he surrendered himself to the conqueror

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:2,17">Jer 38:2, 17</A>),

 and being promoted to the government of Judea, fixed his provincial
 court at Mizpeh. He was well qualified to surmount the difficulties of 
 ruling at such a crisis. Many of the fugitive Jews, as well as the 
 soldiers of Zedekiah who had accompanied the king in his flight to the 
 plains of Jericho, left their retreats

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:11,12">Jer 40:11, 12</A>)

 promised them on complying with this condition, security on oath that 
 they would retain their possessions and enjoy the produce of their land

 <B>25. Ishmael .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and
 smote Gedaliah</B>--He had found refuge with Baalis, king of the Ammonites,
 and he returned with a bad design, being either instigated by envy of a
 governor not descended from the house of David, or bribed by Baalis to
 murder Gedaliah. The generous governor, though apprised of his
 intentions, refused to credit the report, much less to sanction the
 proposal made by an attached friend to cut off Ishmael. The consequence
 was, that he was murdered by this same Ishmael, when entertaining him
 in his own house

 <B>27. seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of
 Jehoiachin</B>--corresponding with the year of Nebuchadnezzar's death,
 and his son Evil-merodach's ascension to the throne.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Evil-merodach .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. did lift up the head of Jehoiachin .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and spake
 kindly</B>--gave him liberty upon parole. This kindly feeling is said to
 have originated in a familiar acquaintance formed in prison, in which
 Evil-merodach had lain till his father's death, on account of some
 malversation while acting as regent during Nebuchadnezzar's seven
 years' illness 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:32,33">Da 4:32, 33</A>).

 But doubtless the improvement in Zedekiah's condition is to be traced
 to the overruling providence and grace of Him who still cherished 
 purposes of love to the house of David

 granted him for the maintenance of his exiled court.</P>
