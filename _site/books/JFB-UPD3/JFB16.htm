 <B>1. Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah</B>--This eminently pious and patriotic
 Jew is to be carefully distinguished from two other persons of the same
 name--one of whom is mentioned as helping to rebuild the walls of
 Jerusalem 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:16">Ne 3:16</A>),

 and the other is noticed in the list of those who accompanied 
 Zerubbabel in the first detachment of returning exiles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:2,Ne+7:7">Ezr 2:2;
 Ne 7:7</A>). 

 Though little is known of his genealogy, it is highly probable that he
 was a descendant of the tribe of Judah and the royal family of David.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>in the month Chisleu</B>--answering to the close of November and the
 larger part of December.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Shushan the palace</B>--the capital of ancient Susiana, east of the
 Tigris, a province of Persia. From the time of Cyrus it was the
 favorite winter residence of the Persian kings.</P>

 <B>2, 3. Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of
 Judah</B>--Hanani is called his brother 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:2">Ne 7:2</A>).

 But as that term was used loosely by Jews as well as other Orientals, 
 it is probable that no more is meant than that he was of the same 
 family. According to J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>, Nehemiah, while 
 walking around the palace walls, overheard some persons conversing in 
 the Hebrew language. Having ascertained that they had lately returned 
 from Judea, he was informed by them, in answer to his eager enquiries, 
 of the unfinished and desolate condition of Jerusalem, as well as the 
 defenseless state of the returned exiles. The commissions previously 
 given to Zerubbabel and Ezra extending only to the repair of the temple 
 and private dwellings, the walls and gates of the city had been allowed 
 to remain a mass of shattered ruins, as they had been laid by the 
 Chaldean siege.</P>

 <B>4. when I heard these words, that I sat down .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and mourned .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
 and fasted, and prayed</B>--The recital deeply affected the patriotic
 feelings of this good man, and no comfort could he find but in earnest
 and protracted prayer, that God would favor the purpose, which he seems
 to have secretly formed, of asking the royal permission to go to
 Jerusalem.</P>

 <B>1. it came to pass in the month Nisan</B>--This was nearly four months
 after he had learned the desolate and ruinous state of Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:1">Ne 1:1</A>).
 
 The reasons for so long a delay cannot be ascertained.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>I took up the wine, and gave it unto the
 king</B>--X<FONT SIZE=-1>ENOPHON</FONT> has
 particularly remarked about the polished and graceful manner in which
 the cupbearers of the Median, and consequently the Persian, monarchs
 performed their duty of presenting the wine to their royal master.
 Having washed the cup in the king's presence and poured into their left
 hand a little of the wine, which they drank in his presence, they then
 handed the cup to him, not grasped, but lightly held with the tips of
 their thumb and fingers. This description has received some curious
 illustrations from the monuments of Assyria and Persia, on which the
 cupbearers are frequently represented in the act of handing wine to the
 king.</P>

 <A NAME="Ne2_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2-5. the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad?</B>--It was 
 deemed highly unbecoming to appear in the royal presence with any weeds 
 or signs of sorrow

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+4:2">Es 4:2</A>);

 and hence it was no wonder that the king was struck with the dejected 
 air of his cupbearer, while that attendant, on his part, felt his 
 agitation increased by his deep anxiety about the issue of the 
 conversation so abruptly begun. But the piety and intense earnestness 
 of the man immediately restored [Nehemiah] to calm self-possession and 
 enabled him to communicate, first, the cause of his sadness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:3">Ne 2:3</A>),

 and next, the patriotic wish of his heart to be the honored instrument 
 of reviving the ancient glory of the city of his fathers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>6-9. the queen also sitting by him</B>--As the Persian monarchs did not
 admit their wives to be present at their state festivals, this must
 have been a private occasion. The queen referred to was probably
 Esther, whose presence would tend greatly to embolden Nehemiah in
 stating his request; and through her influence, powerfully exerted it
 may be supposed, also by her sympathy with the patriotic design, his
 petition was granted, to go as deputy governor of Judea, accompanied by
 a military guard, and invested with full powers to obtain materials for
 the building in Jerusalem, as well as to get all requisite aid in
 promoting his enterprise.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>I set him a time</B>--Considering the great despatch made in raising
 the walls, it is probable that this leave of absence was limited at
 first to a year or six months, after which he returned to his duties in
 Shushan. The circumstance of fixing a set time for his return, as well
 as entrusting so important a work as the refortification of Jerusalem
 to his care, proves the high favor and confidence Nehemiah enjoyed at
 the Persian court, and the great estimation in which his services were
 held. At a later period he received a new commission for the better
 settlement of the affairs of Judea and remained governor of that
 province for twelve years

 <A NAME="Ne2_7"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>7. letters be given me to the governors beyond the river</B>--The Persian
 empire at this time was of vast extent, reaching from the Indus to the
 Mediterranean. The Euphrates was considered as naturally dividing it
 into two parts, eastern and western
 (see on

 <A HREF="JFB15.htm#Ezr5_3">Ezr 5:3</A>).</P>

 <A NAME="Ne2_8"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>8. according to the good hand of my God upon me</B>--The piety of Nehemiah
 appears in every circumstance. The conception of his patriotic design,
 the favorable disposition of the king, and the success of the
 undertaking are all ascribed to God.</P>

 <A NAME="Ne2_10"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>10. Sanballat the Horonite</B>--Horonaim being a town in Moab, this person,
 it is probable, was a Moabite.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite</B>--The term used indicates him to have
 been a freed slave, elevated to some official dignity. These were
 district magistrates under the government of the satrap of Syria; and
 they seem to have been leaders of the Samaritan faction.</P>

 <A NAME="Ne2_11"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>11, 12. So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days</B>--Deeply
 affected with the desolations of Jerusalem, and uncertain what course
 to follow, he remained three days before informing any one of the
 object of his mission 

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:17,18">Ne 2:17, 18</A>].

 At the end of the third day, accompanied with a few attendants, he 
 made, under covert of night, a secret survey of the walls and gates

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:13-15">Ne 2:13-15</A>].</P>

 Jaffa gate, near the tower of Hippicus.

 <B>even before the dragon well</B>--that is, fountain on the opposite side of
 the valley.

 there ran a common sewer to the brook Kedron and the valley of Hinnom.</P>

 <B>I went on to the gate of the fountain</B>--that is, Siloah, from which
 turning round the fount of Ophel.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under
 me to pass</B>--that is, by the sides of this pool (Solomon's) there being
 water in the pool, and too much rubbish about it to permit the passage
 of the beast.</P>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned</B>--the gate
 leading to the valley of Jehoshaphat, east of the city. He went out by
 this gate, and having made the circuit of the city, went in by it again

 <B>16-18. the rulers knew not</B>--The following day, having assembled the
 elders, Nehemiah produced his commission and exhorted them to assist in
 the work. The sight of his credentials, and the animating strain of his
 address and example, so revived their drooping spirits that they
 resolved immediately to commence the building, which they did, despite
 the bitter taunts and scoffing ridicule of some influential men.</P>

 <B>1. Then Eliashib the high priest</B>--the grandson of Jeshua, and the
 first high priest after the return from Babylon.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>rose up with his brethren the priests</B>--that is, set an example by
 commencing the work, their labors being confined to the sacred
 localities.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and they builded the sheep gate</B>--close to the temple. Its name arose
 either from the sheep market, or from the pool of Bethesda, which was
 there 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:2">Joh 5:2</A>).

 There the sheep were washed and then taken to the temple for sacrifice.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>they sanctified it, and set up the doors</B>--Being the common entrance
 into the temple, and the first part of the building repaired, it is
 probable that some religious ceremonies were observed in gratitude for
 its completion. "It was the first-fruits, and therefore, in the
 sanctification of it, the whole lump and building was sanctified"
 [P<FONT SIZE=-1>OOLE</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the tower of Meah</B>--This word is improperly considered, in our
 version, as the name of a tower; it is the <I>Hebrew</I> word for "a
 hundred," so that the meaning is: they not only rebuilt the sheep gate,
 but also a hundred cubits of the wall, which extended as far as the
 tower of Hananeel.</P>

 <A NAME="Ne3_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. next unto him builded the men of Jericho,</B> &c.--The wall was
 divided into portions, one of which was assigned respectively to each
 of the great families which had returned from the captivity. This
 distribution, by which the building was carried on in all parts
 simultaneously with great energy, was eminently favorable to despatch.
 "The villages where the restorers resided being mostly mentioned, it
 will be seen that this circumstance affords a general indication of the
 part of the wall upon which they labored, such places being on that
 side of the city nearest their place of abode; the only apparent
 exception being, perhaps, where they repaired more than their piece.
 Having completed their first undertaking (if they worked any more),
 there being no more work to be done on the side next their residence,
 or having arrived after the repairs on that part of the city nearest
 them under operation were completed, they would go wherever their
 services would be required"

 <B>1. when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth</B>--The
 Samaritan faction showed their bitter animosity to the Jews on
 discovering the systematic design of refortifying Jerusalem. Their
 opposition was confined at first to scoffs and insults, in heaping
 which the governors made themselves conspicuous, and circulated all
 sorts of disparaging reflections that might increase the feelings of
 hatred and contempt for them in their own party. The weakness of the
 Jews in respect of wealth and numbers, the absurdity of their purpose
 apparently to reconstruct the walls and celebrate the feast of
 dedication in one day, the idea of raising the walls on their old
 foundations, as well as using the charred and mouldering debris of the
 ruins as the materials for the restored buildings, and the hope of such
 a parapet as they could raise being capable of serving as a fortress of
 defense--these all afforded fertile subjects of hostile ridicule.</P>

 here may seem harsh, cruel, and vindictive; but it must be remembered
 that Nehemiah and his friends regarded those Samaritan leaders as
 enemies to the cause of God and His people, and therefore as deserving
 to be visited with heavy judgments. The prayer, therefore, is to be
 considered as emanating from hearts in which neither hatred, revenge,
 nor any inferior passion, but a pious and patriotic zeal for the glory

 <B>7-21. But .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when Sanballat .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. heard that the walls .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. were
 made up, and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the breaches .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. stopped</B>--The rapid progress of
 the fortifications, despite all their predictions to the contrary,
 goaded the Samaritans to frenzy. So they, dreading danger from the
 growing greatness of the Jews, formed a conspiracy to surprise them,
 demolish their works, and disperse or intimidate the builders. The plot
 being discovered, Nehemiah adopted the most energetic measures for
 ensuring the common safety, as well as the uninterrupted building of the
 walls. Hitherto the governor, for the sake of despatch, had set all his
 attendants and guards on the work--now half of them were withdrawn to be
 constantly in arms. The workmen labored with a trowel in one hand and a
 sword in the other; and as, in so large a circuit, they were far removed
 from each other, Nehemiah (who was night and day on the spot, and, by
 his pious exhortations and example, animated the minds of his people)
 kept a trumpeter by his side, so that, on any intelligence of a surprise
 being brought to him, an alarm might be immediately sounded, and
 assistance rendered to the most distant detachment of their brethren. By
 these vigilant precautions, the counsels of the enemy were defeated, and
 the work was carried on apace. God, when He has important public work
 to do, never fails to raise up instruments for accomplishing it, and in
 the person of Nehemiah, who, to great natural acuteness and energy added
 fervent piety and heroic devotion, He provided a leader, whose high
 qualities fitted him for the demands of the crisis. Nehemiah's vigilance
 anticipated every difficulty, his prudent measures defeated every
 obstruction, and with astonishing rapidity this Jerusalem was made again
 "a city fortified."</P>

 <B>1-5. there was a great cry of the people .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. against their
 brethren</B>--Such a crisis in the condition of the Jews in
 Jerusalem--fatigued with hard labor and harassed by the machinations of
 restless enemies, the majority of them poor, and the bright visions
 which hope had painted of pure happiness on their return to the land of
 their fathers being unrealized--must have been very trying to their
 faith and patience. But, in addition to these vexatious oppressions,
 many began to sink under a new and more grievous evil. The poor made
 loud complaints against the rich for taking advantage of their
 necessities, and grinding them by usurious exactions. Many of them had,
 in consequence of these oppressions, been driven to such extremities
 that they had to mortgage their lands and houses to enable them to pay
 the taxes to the Persian government, and ultimately even to sell their
 children for slaves to procure the means of subsistence. The condition
 of the poorer inhabitants was indeed deplorable; for, besides the
 deficient harvests caused by the great rains

 <B>6-12. I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words</B>--When
 such disorders came to the knowledge of the governor, his honest
 indignation was roused against the perpetrators of the evil. Having
 summoned a public assembly, he denounced their conduct in terms of just
 severity. He contrasted it with his own in redeeming with his money
 some of the Jewish exiles who, through debt or otherwise, had lost
 their personal liberty in Babylon. He urged the rich creditors not only
 to abandon their illegal and oppressive system of usury, but to restore
 the fields and vineyards of the poor, so that a remedy might be put to
 an evil the introduction of which had led to much actual disorder, and
 the continuance of which would inevitably prove ruinous to the newly
 restored colony, by violating the fundamental principles of the Hebrew
 constitution. The remonstrance was effectual. The conscience of the
 usurious oppressors could not resist the touching and powerful appeal.
 With mingled emotions of shame, contrition, and fear, they with one
 voice expressed their readiness to comply with the governor's
 recommendation. The proceedings were closed by the parties binding
 themselves by a solemn oath, administered by the priests, that they
 would redeem their pledge, as well as by the governor invoking, by the
 solemn and significant gesture of shaking a corner of his garment, a
 malediction on those who should violate it. The historian has taken
 care to record that the people did according to this promise.</P>

 both of the opulence and the disinterestedness of Nehemiah. As he
 declined, on conscientious grounds, to accept the lawful emoluments
 attached to his government, and yet maintained a style of princely
 hospitality for twelve years out of his own resources, it is evident
 that his office of cup-bearer at the court of Shushan must have been

 <B>2-4. Then Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me</B>--The Samaritan leaders,
 convinced that they could not overcome Nehemiah by open arms, resolved
 to gain advantage over him by deceit and stratagem. With this in view,
 under pretext of terminating their differences in an amicable manner,
 they invited him to a conference. The place of rendezvous was fixed "in
 <I>some one</I> of the villages in the plain of Ono." "In the villages"
 is, <I>Hebrew,</I> "in Cephirim," or "Chephirah," the name of a town in
 the territory of Benjamin 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:17,18:26">Jos 9:17; 18:26</A>).

 Nehemiah, however, apprehensive of some intended mischief, prudently
 declined the invitation. Though it was repeated four times, 
 [Nehemiah's] uniform answer was that his presence could not be 
 dispensed with from the important work in which he was engaged. This 
 was one, though not the only, reason. The principal ground of his 
 refusal was that his seizure or death at their hands would certainly 
 put a stop to the further progress of the fortifications.</P>

 <B>5-9. Then sent Sanballat his servant .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the fifth time with an open
 letter in his hand</B>--In Western Asia, letters, after being rolled up
 like a map, are flattened to the breadth of an inch; and instead of
 being sealed, they are pasted at the ends. In Eastern Asia, the
 Persians make up their letters in the form of a roll about six inches
 long, and a bit of paper is fastened round it with gum, and sealed with
 an impression of ink, which resembles our printers' ink, but it is not
 so thick. Letters were, and are still, sent to persons of distinction
 in a bag or purse, and even to equals they are enclosed--the tie being
 made with a colored ribbon. But to inferiors, or persons who are to be
 treated contemptuously, the letters were sent open--that is, not
 enclosed in a bag. Nehemiah, accustomed to the punctillious ceremonial
 of the Persian court, would at once notice the want of the usual
 formality and know that it was from designed disrespect. The strain of
 the letter was equally insolent. It was to this effect: The
 fortifications with which he was so busy were intended to strengthen
 his position in the view of a meditated revolt: he had engaged prophets
 to incite the people to enter into his design and support his claim to
 be their native king; and, to stop the circulation of such reports,
 which would soon reach the court, he was earnestly besought to come to
 the wished-for conference. Nehemiah, strong in the consciousness of his
 own integrity, and penetrating the purpose of this shallow artifice,
 replied that there were no rumors of the kind described, that the idea
 of a revolt and the stimulating addresses of hired demagogues were
 stories of the writer's own invention, and that he declined now, as
 formerly, to leave his work.</P>

 <B>10-14. Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah,</B> &c.--This man was
 the son of a priest, who was an intimate and confidential friend of
 Nehemiah. The young man claimed to be endowed with the gift of
 prophecy. Having been secretly bribed by Sanballat, he, in his
 pretended capacity of prophet, told Nehemiah that his enemies were that
 night to make an attempt upon his life. He advised him, at the same
 time, to consult his safety by concealing himself in the sanctuary, a
 crypt which, from its sanctity, was strong and secure. But the
 noble-minded governor determined at all hazards to remain at his post,
 and not bring discredit on the cause of God and religion by his
 unworthy cowardice in leaving the temple and city unprotected. This
 plot, together with a secret collusion between the enemy and the nobles
 of Judah who were favorably disposed towards the bad Samaritan in
 consequence of his Jewish connections 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:18">Ne 6:18</A>),

 the undaunted courage and vigilance of Nehemiah were enabled, with the 
 blessing of God, to defeat, and the erection of the walls thus built in 
 troublous times

 was happily completed

 in the brief space of fifty-two days. So rapid execution, even 
 supposing some parts of the old wall standing, cannot be sufficiently 
 accounted for, except by the consideration that the builders labored 
 with the ardor of religious zeal, as men employed in the work of 
 God.</P>

 <B>2. I gave my brother Hanani .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. charge over Jerusalem</B>--If, as is
 commonly supposed, Nehemiah was now contemplating a return to Shushan
 according to his promise, it was natural that he should wish to entrust
 the custody of Jerusalem and the management of its civic affairs to men
 on whose ability, experience, and fidelity, he could confide. Hanani, a
 near relative 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:2">Ne 1:2</A>),

 was one, and with him was associated, as colleague, Hananiah, "the 
 ruler of the palace"--that is, the marshal or chamberlain of the 
 viceregal court, which Nehemiah had maintained in Jerusalem. The high 
 religious principle, as well as the patriotic spirit of those two men, 
 recommended them as pre-eminently qualified for being invested with an 
 official trust of such peculiar importance. 

 <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and feared God above many</B>--The piety of Hananiah is especially 
 mentioned as the ground of his eminent fidelity in the discharge of all 
 his duties and, consequently, the reason of the confidence which 
 Nehemiah reposed in him; for he was fully persuaded that Hananiah's
 fear of God would preserve him from those temptations to treachery and
 unfaithfulness which he was likely to encounter on the governor's
 departure from Jerusalem.</P>

 <B>3. Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot,</B>
 &c.--In the East it is customary to open the gates of a city at
 sunrise, and to bar them at sunset--a rule which is very rarely, and
 not except to persons of authority, infringed upon. Nehemiah
 recommended that the gates of Jerusalem should not be opened so early;
 a precaution necessary at a time when the enemy was practising all
 sorts of dangerous stratagems, to ensure that the inhabitants were all
 astir and enjoyed the benefit of clear broad daylight for observing the
 suspicious movements of any enemy. The propriety of regularly barring
 the gates at sunset was, in this instance, accompanied with the
 appointment of a number of the people to act as sentinels, each
 mounting guard in front of his own house.</P>

 <A NAME="Ne7_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4. Now the city was large and great</B>--The walls being evidently built
 on the old foundations, the city covered a large extent of surface, as
 all Oriental towns do, the houses standing apart with gardens and
 orchards intervening. This extent, in the then state of Jerusalem, was
 the more observable as the population was comparatively small, and the
 habitations of the most rude and simple construction--mere wooden sheds
 or coverings of loose, unmortared stones.</P>

 <B>5. my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles,</B> &c.--The
 arrangement about to be described, though dictated by mere common
 prudence, is, in accordance with the pious feelings of Nehemiah,
 ascribed not to his own prudence or reflection, but to the grace of God
 prompting and directing him. He resolved to prepare a register of the
 returned exiles, containing an exact record of the family and ancestral
 abode of every individual. While thus directing his attention, he
 discovered a register of the first detachment who had come under the
 care of Zerubbabel. It is transcribed in the following verses, and
 differs in some few particulars from that given in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:1-61">Ezr 2:1-61</A>.

 But the discrepancy is sufficiently accounted for from the different
 circumstances in which the two registers were taken; that of Ezra 
 having been made up at Babylon, while that of Nehemiah was drawn out in 
 Judea, after the walls of Jerusalem had been rebuilt. The lapse of so 
 many years might well be expected to make a difference appear in the 
 catalogue, through death or other causes; in particular, one person 
 being, according to Jewish custom, called by different names. Thus 
 Hariph

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:24">Ne 7:24</A>)
 
 is the same as Jorah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:18">Ezr 2:18</A>),
 
 Sia

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:47">Ne 7:47</A>)

 the same as Siaha 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:44">Ezr 2:44</A>),

 &c. Besides other purposes to which this genealogy of the nobles,
 rulers, and people was subservient, one leading object contemplated by 
 it was to ascertain with accuracy the parties to whom the duty legally 
 belonged of ministering at the altar and conducting the various 
 services of the temple. For guiding to exact information in this 
 important point of enquiry, the possession of the old register of 
 Zerubbabel was invaluable.</P>

 <B>1. all the people gathered themselves together as one man</B>--The
 occasion was the celebration of the feast of the seventh month

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:73">Ne 7:73</A>).

 The beginning of every month was ushered in as a sacred festival; but 
 this, the commencement of the seventh month, was kept with 
 distinguished honor as "the feast of trumpets," which extended over two 
 days. It was the first day of the seventh ecclesiastical year, and the 
 new year's day of the Jewish civil year, on which account it was held 
 as "a great day." The place where the general concourse of people was 
 held was "at the water gate," on the south rampart. Through that gate 
 the Nethinims or Gibeonites brought water into the temple, and there 
 was a spacious area in front of it.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of
 Moses</B>--He had come to Jerusalem twelve or thirteen years previous
 to Nehemiah. He either remained there or had returned to Babylon in
 obedience to the royal order, and for the discharge of important
 duties. He had returned along with Nehemiah, but in a subordinate
 capacity. From the time of Nehemiah's appointment to the dignity of
 <I>tirshatha,</I> Ezra had retired into private life. Although cordially
 and zealously co-operating with the former patriot in his important
 measures of reform, the pious priest had devoted his time and attention
 principally toward producing a complete edition of the canonical
 Scriptures. The public reading of the Scriptures was required by the
 law to be made every seventh year; but during the long period of the
 captivity this excellent practice, with many others, had fallen into
 neglect, till revived, on this occasion. That there was a strong and
 general desire among the returned exiles in Jerusalem to hear the word
 of God read to them indicates a greatly improved tone of religious
 feeling.</P>

 <B>4. Ezra .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. stood upon a pulpit of wood</B>--Not made in the form known
 to us, but only a raised scaffold or platform, broad enough to allow
 fourteen persons to stand with ease upon it. Ezra's duty was very
 laborious, as he continued reading aloud from morning until midday, but
 his labor was lightened by the aid of the other priests present. Their
 presence was of importance, partly to show their cordial agreement with
 Ezra's declaration of divine truth; and partly to take their share with
 him in the important duty of publicly reading and expounding the
 Scripture.</P>

 the Levites, who assisted him, translated it sentence by sentence into
 Chaldee, the vernacular dialect which the exiles spoke in Babylon.
 Others maintain that the duty of these Levites consisted in explaining
 to the people, many of whom had become very ignorant, what Ezra had
 read.</P>

 sense of their national sins, impressively brought to their remembrance
 by the reading of the law and its denunciations, affected the hearts of
 the people with penitential sorrow. But notwithstanding the painful
 remembrances of their national sins which the reading of the law
 awakened, the people were exhorted to cherish the feelings of joy and
 thankfulness associated with a sacred festival
 (see on

 The day immediately after that feast, the twenty-third, had been 
 occupied in separating the delinquents from their unlawful wives, as 
 well, perhaps, as in taking steps for keeping aloof in future from 
 unnecessary intercourse with the heathen around them. For although this 
 necessary measure of reformation had been begun formerly by Ezra

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+10:1-17">Ezr 10:1-17</A>),

 and satisfactorily accomplished at that time (in so far as he had 
 information of the existing abuses, or possessed the power of 
 correcting them) yet it appears that this reformatory work of Ezra had 
 been only partial and imperfect. Many cases of delinquency had escaped, 
 or new defaulters had appeared who had contracted those forbidden 
 alliances; and there was an urgent necessity for Nehemiah again to take 
 vigorous measures for the removal of a social evil which threatened the 
 most disastrous consequences to the character and prosperity of the 
 chosen people. A solemn fast was now observed for the expression of 
 those penitential and sorrowful feelings which the reading of the law 
 had produced, but which had been suppressed during the celebration of 
 the feast; and the sincerity of their repentance was evinced by the 
 decisive steps taken for the correction of existing abuses in the 
 matter of marriage.</P>

 This solemn diet of worship, which probably commenced at the morning 
 sacrifice, was continued for six hours, that is, till the time of the 
 evening sacrifice. The worship which they gave to the Lord their God, 
 at this season of solemn national humiliation, consisted in 
 acknowledging and adoring His great mercy in the forgiveness of their 
 great and multiplied offenses, in delivering them from the merited 
 judgments which they had already experienced or which they had reason 
 to apprehend, in continuing amongst them the light and blessings of His 
 word and worship, and in supplicating the extension of His grace and 
 protection.</P>

 placed at convenient distances, to prevent confusion and the voice of
 one drowning those of the others.

 <B>cried with a loud voice unto the Lord</B>--Such an exertion, of course,
 was indispensably necessary, in order that the speakers might be heard
 by the vast multitude congregated in the open air. But these speakers
 were then engaged in expressing their deep sense of sin, as well as
 fervently imploring the forgiving mercy of God; and "crying with a loud
 voice" was a natural accompaniment of this extraordinary prayer
 meeting, as violent gestures and vehement tones are always the way in
 which the Jews, and other people in the East, have been accustomed to
 give utterance to deep and earnest feelings.</P>

 <B>6-38. Thou, even thou, art Lord alone,</B> &c.--In this solemn and
 impressive prayer, in which they make public confession of their sins,
 and deprecate the judgments due to the transgressions of their fathers,
 they begin with a profound adoration of God, whose supreme majesty and
 omnipotence is acknowledged in the creation, preservation, and
 government of all. Then they proceed to enumerate His mercies and
 distinguished favors to them as a nation, from the period of the call
 of their great ancestor and the gracious promise intimated to him in
 the divinely bestowed name of Abraham, a promise which implied that he
 was to be the Father of the faithful, the ancestor of the Messiah, and
 the honored individual in whose seed all the families of the earth
 should be blessed. Tracing in full and minute detail the signal
 instances of divine interposition for their deliverance and their
 interest--in their deliverance from Egyptian bondage--their miraculous
 passage through the Red Sea--the promulgation of His law--the
 forbearance and long-suffering shown them amid their frequent
 rebellions--the signal triumphs given them over their enemies--their
 happy settlement in the promised land--and all the extraordinary
 blessings, both in the form of temporal prosperity and of religious
 privilege, with which His paternal goodness had favored them above all
 other people, they charge themselves with making a miserable requital.
 They confess their numerous and determined acts of disobedience. They
 read, in the loss of their national independence and their long
 captivity, the severe punishment of their sins. They acknowledge that,
 in all heavy and continued judgments upon their nation, God had done
 right, but they had done wickedly. And in throwing themselves on His
 mercy, they express their purpose of entering into a national covenant,
 by which they pledge themselves to dutiful obedience in future.</P>

 <B>29-37. to observe and do all the commandments,</B> &c.--This national
 covenant, besides containing a solemn pledge of obedience to the divine
 law generally, specified their engagement to some particular duties,
 which the character and exigency of the times stamped with great
 urgency and importance, and which may be summed up under the following
 heads: that they abstain from contracting matrimonial alliances with
 the heathen; that they would rigidly observe the sabbath; that they
 would let the land enjoy rest and remit debts every seventh year; that
 they would contribute to the maintenance of the temple service, the
 necessary expenses of which had formerly been defrayed out of the
 treasury of the temple

 and that they would make an orderly payment of the priests' dues. A 
 minute and particular enumeration of the first-fruits was made, that 
 all might be made fully aware of their obligations, and that none might 
 excuse themselves on pretext of ignorance from withholding taxes which 
 the poverty of many, and the irreligion of others, had made them

 repentance for their national sins, of which apostasy from the service
 of the true God was the chief, and under the yet fresh and painful
 remembrance of their protracted captivity, they vowed, and (feeling the
 impulse of ardent devotion as well as of gratitude for their
 restoration) flattered themselves they would never forget their vow, to
 be the Lord's.</P>

 <B>1. the rulers .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dwelt at Jerusalem</B>--That city 
 being the metropolis of the country, it was right and proper that the 
 seat of government should be there. But the exigency of the times 
 required that special measures should be taken to insure the residence 
 of an adequate population for the custody of the buildings and the 
 defense of the city. From the annoyances of restless and malignant 
 enemies, who tried every means to demolish the rising fortifications, 
 there was some danger attending a settlement in Jerusalem. Hence the 
 greater part of the returned exiles, in order to earn as well as secure 
 the rewards of their duty, preferred to remain in the country or the 
 provincial towns. To remedy this state of things, it was resolved to
 select every tenth man of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin by lot, to 
 become a permanent inhabitant of the capital. The necessity of such an 
 expedient commended it to the general approval. It was the more readily 
 submitted to because the lot was resorted to on all the most critical
 conjunctures of the Jewish history, and regarded by the people as a
 divine decision

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:18">Pr 18:18</A>).

 This awakened strongly the national spirit; and patriotic volunteers 
 came forward readily to meet the wishes of the authorities, a service 
 which, implying great self-denial as well as courage, was reckoned in 
 the circumstances of so much importance as entitled them to the public 
 gratitude. No wonder that the conduct of these volunteers drew forth 
 the tribute of public admiration; for they sacrificed their personal 
 safety and comfort for the interests of the community because Jerusalem 
 was at that time a place against which the enemies of the Jews were 
 directing a thousand plots. Therefore, residence in it at such a 
 juncture was attended with expense and various annoyances from which a 
 country life was entirely free.</P>

 <B>in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their
 cities</B>--The returned exiles, who had come from Babylon, repaired
 generally, and by a natural impulse, to the lands and cities throughout
 the country which had been anciently assigned them.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Israel</B>--This general name, which designated the descendants of Jacob
 before the unhappy division of the two kingdoms under Rehoboam, was
 restored after the captivity, the Israelites being then united with the
 Jews, and all traces of their former separation being obliterated.
 Although the majority of the returned exiles belonged to the tribes of
 Judah and Benjamin, they are here called Israel because a large number
 out of all the tribes were now intermingled, and these were principally
 the occupiers of the rural villages, while none but those of Judah and
 Benjamin resided in Jerusalem.

 according as they had opportunity.

 arose not only from the Jewish and Oriental practice of changing or
 modifying the names of persons from a change of circumstances, but from 
 the alterations that must have been produced in the course of time. The 
 catalogue in Chronicles contains those who came with the first 
 detachment of returned exiles, while the list in this passage probably 
 included also those who returned with Ezra and Nehemiah; or it was most 
 probably made out afterwards, when several had died, or some, who had 
 been inserted as going on the journey, remained, and others came in 
 their stead.</P>

 This duty was very properly assigned to the sons of Asaph; for, though 
 they were Levites, they did not repair in rotation to Jerusalem, as the

 <B>27-43. at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem</B>--This ceremony 
 of consecrating the wall and gates of the city was an act of piety on 
 the part of Nehemiah, not merely to thank God in a general way for 
 having been enabled to bring the building to a happy completion, but 
 especially because that city was the place which He had chosen. It also 
 contained the temple which was hallowed by the manifestation of His 
 presence, and anew set apart to His service. It was on these accounts 
 that Jerusalem was called "the holy city," and by this public and 
 solemn act of religious observance, after a long period of neglect and 
 desecration, it was, as it were, restored to its rightful proprietor.
 The dedication consisted in a solemn ceremonial, in which the leading 
 authorities, accompanied by the Levitical singers, summoned from all 
 parts of the country, and by a vast concourse of people, marched in 
 imposing procession round the city walls, and, pausing at intervals to
 engage in united praises, prayer, and sacrifices, supplicated the
 continued presence, favor, and blessing on "the holy city." "<I>The
 assembly convened near Jaffa Gate, where the procession commences.</I>

 Persian court to Jerusalem, his absence having extended over a
 considerable period. The transaction here described probably took place
 on one of the periodical occasions for the public readings of the law,
 when the people's attention was particularly directed to some
 violations of it which called for immediate correction. There is
 another instance afforded, in addition to those which have already
 fallen under our notice, of the great advantages resulting from the
 public and periodical reading of the divine law. It was an established
 provision for the religious instruction of the people, for diffusing a
 knowledge and a reverence for the sacred volume, as well as for
 removing those errors and corruptions which might, in the course of
 time, have crept in.

 <B>the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of
 God for ever</B>--that is, not be incorporated into the Israelitish
 kingdom, nor united in marriage relations with that people

 This appeal to the authority of the divine law led to a dissolution of 
 all heathen alliances

 <B>4, 5. before this</B>--The practice of these mixed marriages, in open
 neglect or violation of the law, had become so common, that even the
 pontifical house, which ought to have set a better example, was
 polluted by such an impure mixture.

 <B>Eliashib the priest .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was allied unto Tobiah</B>--This person was the
 high priest

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:1">Ne 3:1</A>),

 who, by virtue of his dignified office, had the superintendence and
 control of the apartments attached to the temple. The laxity of his 
 principles, as well as of his practice, is sufficiently apparent from 
 his contracting a family connection with so notorious an enemy of 
 Israel as Tobiah. But his obsequious attentions had carried him much 
 farther; for to accommodate so important a person as Tobiah on his 
 occasional visits to Jerusalem, Eliashib had provided him a splendid 
 apartment in the temple. The introduction of so gross an impropriety 
 can be accounted for in no other way than by supposing that in the 
 absence of the priests and the cessation of the services, the temple 
 was regarded as a common public building, which might, in the 
 circumstances, be appropriated as a palatial residence.</P>

 <B>6-9. But in all this was not I at Jerusalem</B>--Eliashib (concluding
 that, as Nehemiah had departed from Jerusalem, and, on the expiry of
 his allotted term of absence, had resigned his government, he had gone
 not to return) began to use great liberties, and, there being none left
 whose authority or frown he dreaded, allowed himself to do things most
 unworthy of his sacred office, and which, though in unison with his own
 irreligious character, he would not have dared to attempt during the
 residence of the pious governor. Nehemiah resided twelve years as
 governor of Jerusalem, and having succeeded in repairing and
 refortifying the city, he at the end of that period returned to his
 duties in Shushan. How long [Nehemiah] remained there is not expressly
 said, but "after certain days," which is a Scripture phraseology for a
 year or a number of years, he obtained leave to resume the government
 of Jerusalem; to his deep mortification and regret, he found matters in
 the neglected and disorderly state here described. Such gross
 irregularities as were practised, such extraordinary corruptions as had
 crept in, evidently imply the lapse of a considerable time. Besides,
 they exhibit the character of Eliashib, the high priest, in a most
 unfavorable light; for while he ought, by his office, to have preserved
 the inviolable sanctity of the temple and its furniture, his influence
 had been directly exercised for evil; especially he had given
 permission and countenance to a most indecent outrage--the
 appropriation of the best apartments in the sacred building to a
 heathen governor, one of the worst and most determined enemies of the
 people and the worship of God. The very first reform Nehemiah on his
 second visit resolved upon, was the stopping of this gross profanation
 [by Eliashib]. The chamber which had been polluted by the residence of
 the idolatrous Ammonite was, after undergoing the process of ritual
 purification

 <B>10-13. And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been
 given them</B>--The people, disgusted with the malversations of
 Eliashib, or the lax and irregular performance of the sacred rites,
 withheld the tithes, so that the ministers of religion were compelled
 for their livelihood to withdraw to their patrimonial possessions in
 the country. The temple services had ceased; all religious duties had
 fallen into neglect. The money put into the sacred treasury had been
 squandered in the entertainment of an Ammonite heathen, an open and
 contemptuous enemy of God and His people. The return of the governor
 put an end to these disgraceful and profane proceedings. He
 administered a sharp rebuke to those priests to whom the management of
 the temple and its services was committed, for the total neglect of
 their duties, and the violation of the solemn promises which they had
 made to him at his departure. He upbraided them with the serious charge
 of having not only withheld from men their dues, but of having robbed
 God, by neglecting the care of His house and service. And thus having
 roused them to a sense of duty and incited them to testify their godly
 sorrow for their criminal negligence by renewed devotedness to their
 sacred work, Nehemiah restored the temple services. He recalled the
 dispersed Levites to the regular discharge of their duties; while the
 people at large, perceiving that their contributions would be no longer
 perverted to improper uses, willingly brought in their tithes as
 formerly. Men of integrity and good report were appointed to act as
 trustees of the sacred treasures, and thus order, regularity, and
 active service were re-established in the temple.</P>

 <B>15-22. In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine-presses on the
 sabbath</B>--The cessation of the temple services had been necessarily
 followed by a public profanation of the Sabbath, and this had gone so
 far that labor was carried on in the fields, and fish brought to the
 markets on the sacred day. Nehemiah took the decisive step of ordering
 the city gates to be shut, and not to be opened, till the Sabbath was
 past; and in order to ensure the faithful execution of this order, he
 stationed some of his own servants as guards, to prevent the
 introduction of any commodities on that day. On the merchants and
 various dealers finding admission denied them, they set up booths
 outside the walls, in hopes of still driving a traffic with the
 peasantry; but the governor threatened, if they continued, to adopt
 violent measures for their removal. For this purpose a body of Levites
 was stationed as sentinels at the gate, with discretionary powers to
 protect the sanctification of the Sabbath.</P>
