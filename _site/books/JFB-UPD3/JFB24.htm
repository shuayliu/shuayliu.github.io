 J<FONT SIZE=-1>EREMIAH,</FONT> son of Hilkiah, one of the ordinary priests, dwelling in
 Anathoth of Benjamin 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:1">Jer 1:1</A>),

 not the Hilkiah the high priest who discovered the book of the law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:8">2Ki 22:8</A>);

 had he been the same, the designation would have been "<I>the</I> 
 priest", or "<I>the</I> high priest".  Besides, his residence at 
 Anathoth shows that he belonged to the line of Abiathar, who was 
 deposed from the high priesthood by Solomon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:26-35">1Ki 2:26-35</A>),

 after which the office remained in Zadok's line.  Mention occurs of 
 Jeremiah in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:25,36:12,21">2Ch 35:25; 36:12, 21</A>.

 In 629 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT> the thirteenth year of King Josiah,
 while still very young

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:5">Jer 1:5</A>),
 
 he received his prophetical call in Anathoth 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:2">Jer 1:2</A>);

 and along with Hilkiah the high priest, the prophetess Huldah, and the 
 prophet Zephaniah, he helped forward Josiah's reformation of religion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:1-25">2Ki 23:1-25</A>).

 Among the first charges to him was one that he should go and proclaim 
 God's message in Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:2">Jer 2:2</A>).

 He also took an official tour to announce to the cities of Judah the 
 contents of the book of the law, found in the temple

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:6">Jer 11:6</A>)

 five years after his call to prophesy. On his return to Anathoth, his 
 countrymen, offended at his reproofs, conspired against his life. To 
 escape their persecutions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:21">Jer 11:21</A>),
 
 as well as those of his own family

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:6">Jer 12:6</A>),

 he left Anathoth and resided at Jerusalem. During the eighteen years of 
 his ministry in Josiah's reign he was unmolested; also during the three 
 months of Jehoahaz or Shallum's reign

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:10-12">Jer 22:10-12</A>).

 On Jehoiakim's accession it became evident that Josiah's reformation 
 effected nothing more than a forcible repression of idolatry and the 
 establishment of the worship of God outwardly. The priests, prophets, 
 and people then brought Jeremiah before the authorities, urging that he 
 should be put to death for his denunciations of evil against the city

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+26:8-11">Jer 26:8-11</A>).

 The princes, however, especially Ahikam, interposed in his behalf

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+26:16,24">Jer 26:16, 24</A>),
 
 but he was put under restraint, or at least deemed it prudent not to
 appear in public. In the fourth year of Jehoiakim (606 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>), he was
 commanded to write the predictions given orally through him, and to
 read them to the people. Being "shut up", he could not himself go into
 the house of the Lord 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:5">Jer 36:5</A>);

 he therefore deputed Baruch, his amanuensis, to read them in public on 
 the fast day. The princes thereupon advised Baruch and Jeremiah to hide 
 themselves from the king's displeasure. Meanwhile they read the roll to 
 the king, who was so enraged that he cut it with a knife and threw it 
 into the fire; at the same time giving orders for the apprehension of 
 the prophet and Baruch. They escaped Jehoiakim's violence, which had 
 already killed the prophet Urijah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+26:20-23">Jer 26:20-23</A>).

 Baruch rewrote the words, with additional prophecies, on another roll

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:27-32">Jer 36:27-32</A>).

 In the three months' reign of Jehoiachin or Jeconiah, he prophesied the 
 carrying away of the king and the queen mother

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:18,22:24-30">Jer 13:18; 22:24-30</A>;
 
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:12">2Ki 24:12</A>).

 In this reign he was imprisoned for a short time by Pashur

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:1-18">Jer 20:1-18</A>),

 the chief governor of the Lord's house; but at Zedekiah's accession he
 was free

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+37:4">Jer 37:4</A>),

 for the king sent to him to "inquire of the Lord" when Nebuchadnezzar
 came up against Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:1-3,37:3">Jer 21:1-3,
 &c.; Jer 37:3</A>).

 The Chaldeans drew off on hearing of the approach of Pharaoh's army

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+37:5">Jer 37:5</A>);

 but Jeremiah warned the king that the Egyptians would forsake him, and 
 the Chaldeans return and burn up the city

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+37:7,8">Jer 37:7, 8</A>).

 The princes, irritated at this, made the departure of Jeremiah from the 
 city during the respite a pretext for imprisoning him, on the 
 allegation of his deserting to the Chaldeans

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:1-5">Jer 38:1-5</A>).

 He would have been left to perish in the dungeon of Malchiah, but for 
 the intercession of Ebed-melech, the Ethiopian

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:6-13">Jer 38:6-13</A>).

 Zedekiah, though he consulted Jeremiah in secret yet was induced by his 
 princes to leave Jeremiah in prison

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:14-28">Jer 38:14-28</A>)

 until Jerusalem was taken. Nebuchadnezzar directed his captain, 
 Nebuzar-adan, to give him his freedom, so that he might either go to 
 Babylon or stay with the remnant of his people as he chose. As a true 
 patriot, notwithstanding the forty and a half years during which his 
 country had repaid his services with neglect and persecution, he stayed 
 with Gedaliah, the ruler appointed by Nebuchadnezzar over Judea

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:6">Jer 40:6</A>).

 After the murder of Gedaliah by Ishmael, Johanan, the recognized ruler 
 of the people, in fear of the Chaldeans avenging the murder of 
 Gedaliah, fled with the people to Egypt, and forced Jeremiah and Baruch 
 to accompany him, in spite of the prophet's warning that the people 
 should perish if they went to Egypt, but be preserved by remaining in 
 their land

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:1-43:13">Jer 41:1-43:13</A>).

 At Tahpanhes, a boundary city on the Tanitic or Pelustan branch of the 
 Nile, he prophesied the overthrow of Egypt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:8-13">Jer 43:8-13</A>).

 Tradition says he died in Egypt.  According to the P<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>SEUDO</FONT>-E<FONT SIZE=-1>PIPHANIUS</FONT>, he was stoned at 
 Taphn&aelig; or Tahpanhes. The Jews so venerated him that they believed 
 he would rise from the dead and be the forerunner of Messiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:14">Mt 16:14</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 H<FONT SIZE=-1>AVERNICK</FONT> observes that the combination of features in Jeremiah's
 character proves his divine mission; mild, timid, and susceptible of
 melancholy, yet intrepid in the discharge of his prophetic functions,
 not sparing the prince any more than the meanest of his subjects--the
 Spirit of prophecy controlling his natural temper and qualifying him
 for his hazardous undertaking, without doing violence to his
 individuality. Zephaniah, Habakkuk, Daniel, and Ezekiel were his
 contemporaries. The last forms a good contrast to Jeremiah, the Spirit
 in his case acting on a temperament as strongly marked by firmness as
 Jeremiah's was by shrinking and delicate sensitiveness. Ezekiel views
 the nation's sins as opposed to righteousness--Jeremiah, as productive
 of misery; the former takes the objective, the latter the subjective,
 view of the evils of the times. Jeremiah's style corresponds to his
 character: he is peculiarly marked by pathos, and sympathy with the
 wretched; his Lamentations illustrate this; the whole series of elegies
 has but one object--to express sorrow for his fallen country; yet the
 lights and images in which he presents this are so many, that the
 reader, so far from feeling it monotonous, is charmed with the variety
 of the plaintive strains throughout. The language is marked by
 Aram&aelig;isms, which probably was the ground of
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME'S</FONT> charge that the
 style is "rustic". L<FONT SIZE=-1>OWTH</FONT>
 denies the charge and considers him in
 portions not inferior to Isaiah. His heaping of phrase on phrase, the
 repetition of stereotyped forms--and these often <I>three times</I>--are due
 to his affected feelings and to his desire to intensify the expression
 of them; he is at times more concise, energetic, and sublime,
 especially against foreign nations, and in the rhythmical parts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The principle of the arrangement of his prophecies is hard to 
 ascertain. The order of kings was--Josiah (under whom he prophesied 
 eighteen years), Jehoahaz (three months), Jehoiakim (eleven years), 
 Jeconiah (three months), Zedekiah (eleven years). But his prophecies 
 under Josiah (the first through twentieth chapters) are immediately
 followed by a portion under Zedekiah (the twenty-first chapter). Again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+24:8-10">Jer 24:8-10</A>,

 as to Zedekiah, comes in the midst of the section as to Jehoahaz,
 Jehoiakim, and Jeconiah (the twenty-second, twenty-third, twenty-fifth
 chapters, &c.) So the thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth chapters as to
 Jehoiakim, follow the twenty-seventh, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth,
 thirty-third, thirty-fourth chapters, as to Zedekiah; and the
 forty-fifth chapter, dated the fourth year of Jehoiakim, comes after
 predictions as to the Jews who fled to Egypt after the overthrow of
 Jerusalem. E<FONT SIZE=-1>WALD</FONT> thinks the present arrangement
 substantially Jeremiah's own; the various portions are prefaced by the
 same formula, "The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:1,11:1,18:1,21:1,25:1,30:1,32:1,34:1,8,35:1,40:1,44:1">Jer 7:1;
 11:1; 18:1; 21:1; 25:1; 30:1; 32:1; 34:1, 8; 35:1; 40:1; 44:1</A>;

 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:1,46:1,47:1,49:34">Jer 14:1; 46:1; 47:1; 49:34</A>).

 Notes of time mark other divisions more or less historical

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+26:1,27:1,36:1,37:1">Jer 26:1; 27:1; 36:1; 37:1</A>).

 Two other portions are distinct of themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:1,45:1">Jer 29:1; 45:1</A>).

 The second chapter has the shorter introduction which marks the
 beginning of a strophe; the third chapter seems imperfect, having as
 the introduction merely "saying"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:1">Jer 3:1</A>,

 <I>Hebrew</I>). Thus in the poetical parts, there are twenty-three
 sections divided into strophes of from seven to nine verses, marked 
 some way thus, "The Lord said also unto me". They form five books: I. 
 The Introduction, first chapter II. Reproofs of the Jews, the second 
 through twenty-fourth chapters, made up of seven sections: (1) the 
 second chapter (2) the third through sixth chapters; (3) the seventh 
 through tenth chapters; (4) the eleventh through thirteenth chapters; 
 (5) the fourteenth through seventeenth chapters; (6) the seventeenth 
 through nineteenth and twentieth chapters; (7) the twenty-first through 
 twenty-fourth chapters. III. Review of all nations in two sections: the 
 twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth through forty-ninth chapters, with a 
 historical appendix of three sections, (1) the twenty-sixth chapter; 
 (2) the twenty-seventh chapter; (3) the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth 
 chapters. IV. Two sections picturing the hopes of <I>brighter 
 times,</I> (1) the thirtieth and thirty-first chapters; (2) the 
 thirty-second and thirty-third chapters; and an historical appendix in 
 three sections: (1)

 (2) 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+45:1-5">Jer 45:1-5</A>.

 Subsequently, in Egypt, he added

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:13-26">Jer 46:13-26</A>

 to the previous prophecy as to Egypt; also the three sections, the 
 thirty-seventh through thirty-ninth chapters; fortieth through 
 forty-third chapters; and forty-fourth chapter. The fifty-second 
 chapter was probably (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:64">Jer 51:64</A>)

 an appendix from a later hand, taken from

 The prophecies against the several foreign nations stand in a different 
 order in the <I>Hebrew</I> from that of the <I>Septuagint;</I> also the 
 prophecies against them in the <I>Hebrew</I> (the forty-sixth through 
 fifty-first chapters) are in the <I>Septuagint</I> placed after

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:14">Jer 25:14</A>,

 forming the twenty-sixth and thirty-first chapters; the remainder of 
 the twenty-fifth chapter of the <I>Hebrew</I> is the thirty-second 
 chapter of the <I>Septuagint.</I> Some passages in the <I>Hebrew</I>

 are not found in the <I>Septuagint;</I> the <I>Greek</I> translators 
 must have had a different recension before them; probably an earlier 
 one. The <I>Hebrew</I> is probably the latest and fullest edition from 
 Jeremiah's own hand. See on

 <A HREF="#Jer25_13">Jer 25:13</A>.

 The canonicity of his prophecies is established by quotations of them
 in the New Testament (see

 Many of these figurative acts being either not possible, or not
 probable, or decorous, seem to have existed only in the mind of the
 prophet as part of his inward vision. [So
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>]. The world he moved in
 was not the sensible, but the spiritual, world. Inward acts were,
 however, when it was possible and proper, materialized by outward
 performance, but not always, and necessarily so. The internal act made a
 naked statement more impressive and presented the subject when extending
 over long portions of space and time more concentrated. The

 Our case is desperate; we are hopelessly abandoned to our sins and

 Belonging to an earlier period than the twenty-first chapter, namely,
 the reigns of Shallum or Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, and Jeconiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:10,13,20">Jer 22:10, 13, 20</A>).

 Jeremiah often groups his prophecies, not by chronological order, but 
 by <I>similarity of subjects;</I> thus

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:3">Jer 22:3</A>
 
 corresponds to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:12">Jer 21:12</A>.

 G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT> thinks that Jeremiah here <I>repeats</I> 
 to Zedekiah what he had announced to that king's predecessors 
 <I>formerly</I> (namely, his brother and brother's son), of a similar 
 bearing, and which had since come to pass; a warning to Zedekiah. 
 Probably, in <I>arranging</I> his prophecies they were grouped for the 
 first time in the present order, designed by the Holy Spirit to set 
 forth the series of kings of Judah, all four alike, failing in 
 "righteousness," followed at last by the "King," <I>a righteous Branch 
 raised unto David,</I> in the house of Judah, "the Lord our 
 righteousness"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:6">Jer 23:6</A>).

 The unrighteousness of Zedekiah suggested the review of his 
 predecessors' failure in the same respects, and consequent punishment, 
 which ought to have warned him, but did not.</P>

 Dying saints are justly to be envied, while living sinners are to be 
 pitied. The allusion is to the great weeping of the people at the death 
 of Josiah, and on each anniversary of it, in which Jeremiah himself 
 took a prominent part

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:24,25">2Ch 35:24, 25</A>).

 The name "Shallum" is here given in irony to Jehoahaz, who reigned but 
 three months; as if he were a second Shallum, son of Jabesh, who 
 reigned only <I>one month</I> in Samaria

 Shallum means "retribution," a name of no good omen to him [G<FONT
 SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT>]; originally the people called him 
 <I>Shallom,</I> indicative of <I>peace</I> and prosperity. But Jeremiah 
 applies it in irony.

 calls Shallum the <I>fourth</I> son of Josiah. The people raised him to 
 the throne before his brother Eliakim or Jehoiakim, though the latter 
 was the older

 perhaps on account of Jehoiakim's extravagance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:13,15">Jer 22:13, 15</A>).

 Jehoiakim was put in Shallum's (Jehoahaz') stead by Pharaoh-necho.
 Jeconiah, his son, succeeded. Zedekiah (Mattaniah), uncle of Jeconiah, 
 and brother of Jehoiakim and Jehoahaz, was last of all raised to the 
 throne by Nebuchadnezzar.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>He shall not return</B>--The people perhaps entertained hopes of Shallum's
 return from Egypt, in which case they would replace him on the throne,
 and thereby free themselves from the oppressive taxes imposed by
 Jehoiakim.</P>

 not left unburied on the way, as Jehoiakim, yet was not honored at her 
 death with royal lamentations, such as would have been poured forth 
 over her at Jerusalem. He notices the beauty of Jeremiah's manner in

 he names him, but in the third person, to imply that God puts him to a

 held the throne by divine authority, would have been treason.

 The seventy years probably begin from the fourth year of Jehoiakim,
 when Jerusalem was first captured, and many captives, as well as the
 treasures of the temple, were carried away; they end with the first
 year of Cyrus, who, on taking Babylon, issued an edict for the
 restoration of the Jews

 if they had followed immediately

 there would have been no propriety in the observation in the verse. The

 part of the book, and not in the immediate context. It was in this very 
 year, the fourth of Jehoiakim

 subsequent time, when he completed the whole work, including the 
 forty-sixth through fifty-first chapters, Jeremiah himself inserted the 
 clause, "all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath 
 prophesied against all the nations." The prophecies in question may 
 have been repeated, as others in Jeremiah, more than once; so in the

 The priests, through envy of his holy zeal, were more his enemies than
 the princes, whose office was more secular than religious. A prophet
 could not legally be put to death unless he prophesied <I>in the name

 Jeremiah stood, and how wonderful the providence of God in preserving 
 him), <I>nevertheless</I> the hand of Ahikam," &c. [G<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LASSIUS</FONT>]. The context, however, implies rather that the 
 words are the continuation of the previous speech of the elders. They 
 adduce another instance besides that of Micah, though of a different 
 kind, namely, that of Urijah: he suffered for his prophecies, but they 
 <I>imply,</I> though they do not venture to <I>express</I> it, that 
 thereby sin has been added to sin, and that it has done no good to 
 Jehoiakim, for that the notorious condition of the state at this time 
 shows that a heavier vengeance is impending if they persevere in such 
 acts of violence [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>].</P>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:34">2Ki 23:34</A>).

 This explains the readiness with which he got the Egyptians to give up 
 Urijah to him, when that prophet had sought an asylum in Egypt. Urijah 
 was faithful in delivering his message, but faulty in leaving his work, 
 so God permitted him to lose his life, while Jeremiah was protected in 
 danger. The path of duty is often the path of safety.</P>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:29">Mt 23:29</A>).

 Hence his interference here in behalf of Jeremiah is what we should 
 expect from his past association with that good king. His son, 
 Gedaliah, followed in his father's steps, so that he was chosen by the 
 Babylonians as the one to whom they committed Jeremiah for safety after 
 taking Jerusalem, and on whose loyalty they could depend in setting him

 reading given in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, fifteen years before it

 supported under trials in his prophetic career in the interim

 <B>1. in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah</B>--The Jews often divided
 any period into two halves, <I>the beginning</I> and <I>the end.</I> As Zedekiah
 reigned eleven years, the fourth year would be called the <I>beginning</I> of his reign, especially as during the first three years affairs were in
 such a disturbed state that he had little power or dignity, being a
 tributary; but in the fourth year he became strong in power.

 The main point intended was that the restoration from Babylon should be
 complete. But, doubtless, the false prophet foretold Jeconiah's return

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:12-15">2Ki 24:12-15</A>),

 epithet before "Hananiah"; except in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+28:12">Jer 28:12</A>,

 where "<I>the prophet</I>" has been inserted in <I>English Version.</I>

 predictions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+18:21,22">De 18:21, 22</A>).

 "Would that what you say were true!" I prefer the safety of my country 
 even to my own estimation. The prophets had no pleasure in announcing 
 God's judgment, but did so as a matter of stern duty, not thereby 
 divesting themselves of their natural feelings of sorrow for their 
 country's woe.  Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:32,Ro+9:3">Ex 32:32;
 Ro 9:3</A>, 

 as instances of how God's servants, intent only on the glory of God and
 the salvation of the country, forgot self and uttered wishes in a state 
 of feeling transported out of themselves. So Jeremiah wished not to
 diminish aught from the word of God, though as a Jew he uttered the 
 wish for his people [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>].</P>

 But <I>evil</I> here includes <I>all</I> the calamities flowing from
 <I>war,</I> not merely <I>famine,</I> but also <I>desolation,</I> &c. 
 <I>Evil,</I> being the more difficult reading, is less likely to be the 
 interpolated one than <I>famine,</I> which probably originated in 
 copying the parallel passages.</P>

 <A NAME="Jer28_9"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>9. peace</B>--Hananiah had given no warning as to the need of conversion,
 but had foretold <I>prosperity</I> unconditionally. Jeremiah does not say
 that all are true prophets who foretell truths in any instance (which

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:1,2">De 13:1, 2</A>,

 disproves); but asserts only the converse, namely, that whoever, as 
 Hananiah, predicts what the event does not confirm, is a false prophet. 
 There are two tests of prophets: (1) The event,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+18:22">De 18:22</A>.
 
 (2) The word of God,

 Impious audacity to break what God had appointed as a solemn pledge of 
 the fulfilment of His word. Hence Jeremiah deigns no reply

 (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+28:16">Jer 28:16</A>).

 The same false prophets who, by urging the Jews to rebel, had caused
 them to throw off the then comparatively <I>easy</I> yoke of Babylon, 
 thereby brought on them a <I>more severe</I> yoke imposed by that city. 
 "Yokes of iron," alluding to

 It is better to take up a light cross in our way, than to pull a 
 heavier on our own heads. We may escape destroying providences by 
 submitting to humbling providences. So, spiritually, contrast the "easy 
 yoke" of Christ with the "yoke of bondage" of the law

 She reigned jointly with her son.

 Zedekiah himself goes to Babylon; <I>here</I> he <I>sends</I> 
 ambassadors. Whatever was the object of the embassy, it shows that 
 Zedekiah only reigned at the pleasure of the king of Babylon, who might 
 have restored Jeconiah, had he pleased. Hence, Zedekiah permitted 
 Jeremiah's letter to be sent, not only as being led by Hananiah's death 
 to attach greater credit to the prophet's words, but also as the letter 
 accorded with his own wish that the Jews should remain in Chaldea till 
 Jeconiah's death.

 some respect for sacred things. So in

 therefore they should build houses, as Babylon is to be for long their

 Not only bear the Babylonian yoke patiently, but <I>pray for</I> your

 people's own morbid appetite to be deceived; for example, Aaron and the
 golden calf

 their removal to Babylon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:1">Jer 40:1</A>).

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:17,18">Mt 2:17, 18</A>

 quotes this as fulfilled in the massacre of the innocents under Herod. 
 "A lesser and a greater event, of different times, may answer to the 
 single sense of one passage of Scripture, until the prophecy is 
 <I>exhausted</I>" [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]. Besides the temporary 
 reference to the exiles in Babylon, the Holy Spirit foreshadowed 
 ultimately Messiah's exile in Egypt, and the desolation caused in the 
 neighborhood of Rachel's tomb by Herod's massacre of the children, 
 whose mothers had "sons of sorrow" (<I>Ben-oni</I>), just as Rachel 
 had. The return of Messiah (the representative of Israel) from Egypt, 
 and the future restoration of Israel, both the literal and the 
 spiritual (including the innocents), at the Lord's second advent, are 
 antitypical of the restoration of Israel from Babylon, which is the 
 ground of consolation held out here by Jeremiah. The clause, "They were 
 not," that is, were dead

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:13">Ge 42:13</A>),
 
 does not apply so strictly to the exiles in Babylon as it does to the
 history of Messiah and His people--past, present, and future. So the
 words, "There is hope in thine end," are to be fulfilled ultimately,
 when Rachel shall meet her murdered children at the resurrection, at the
 same time that literal Israel is to be restored. "They were not," in
 <I>Hebrew,</I> is <I>singular; each was not:</I> each mother at the Beth-lehem
 massacre had but <I>one</I> child to lament, as the limitation of age in
 Herod's order, "two years and under," implies; this use of the
 <I>singular</I> distributively (the mothers weeping severally,
 <I>each for her own</I> child), is a coincidence between the prophecy of
 the Beth-lehem massacre and the event, the more remarkable as not being
 obvious: the <I>singular,</I> too, is appropriate as to <I>Messiah</I> in His
 Egyptian exile, who was to be a leading object of Rachel's lamentation.</P>

 Mary compassing Christ in her womb.</I> This view is favored:--(1) By 
 the connection; it gives a reason why the exiles should desire a return 
 to their country, namely, because Christ was conceived there. (2) The 
 word "created" implies a divine power put forth in the creation of a 
 body in the Virgin's womb by the Holy Ghost for the second Adam, such 
 as was exerted in creating the first Adam

 G<FONT SIZE=-1>ATAKER</FONT> thinks that the purchaser

 redemption were in the <I>sealed</I> copy, which the parties might not
 choose to be known to the witnesses, and which were therefore not in the
 <I>open</I> copy. The sealed copy, when opened after the seventy years'
 captivity, would greatly confirm the faith of those living at that time.
 The "law and custom" refer, probably, not merely to the sealing up of
 the conditions and details of purchase, but also to the law of
 redemption, according to which, at the return to Judea, the deed would
 show that Jeremiah had bought the field by his right as next of kin

 By the obedience of the Rechabites to their father, Jeremiah condemns
 the disobedience of the Jews to God their Father. The Holy Spirit has
 arranged Jeremiah's prophecies by the <I>moral</I> rather than the
 chronological connection. From the history of an event fifteen years
 before, the Jews, who had brought back their manumitted servants into
 bondage, are taught how much God loves and rewards obedience, and hates
 and punishes disobedience.</P>

 the Jews in Judea and Egypt after the <I>taking</I> of the city, blended

 in the confusion at the burning of the city he seems to have been led 
 away in chains with the other captives, and not till he reached Ramah 
 to have gained full liberty. Nebuzara-dan had his quarters at Ramah, in 
 Benjamin; and there he collected the captives previous to their removal 
 to Babylon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+39:11">Jer 39:11</A>).
 
 Jeremiah's "chains" for a time were due to the negligence of those to
 whom he had been committed; or else to Nebuzara-dan's wish to upbraid
 the people with their perverse ingratitude in imprisoning Jeremiah

 After the completion of the prophecies and histories appertaining to the
 Jewish people and kings, Jeremiah subjoins one referring to an
 individual, Baruch; even as there are subjoined to the epistles of Paul
 addressed to churches, epistles to individuals, some of which were prior
 in date to the former. Afterwards follow the prophecies referring to
 other nations, closing the book
 [G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT>]. The date of the events here
 told is eighteen years before the taking of the city; this chapter in
 point of time follows the thirty-sixth chapter. Baruch seems to have
 been regularly employed by Jeremiah to commit his prophecies to writing

 but he was four years subsequently overcome at Carchemish, by
 Nebuchadnezzar, as is foretold here; and lost all the territory which 
 had been subject to the Pharaohs west of the Euphrates, and between it 
 and the Nile. The prediction would mitigate the Jews' grief for Josiah,

 After the predictions of judgment to be inflicted on other nations by
 Babylon, follows this one against Babylon itself, the longest prophecy,
 consisting of one hundred verses. The date of utterance was the fourth
 year of Zedekiah, when Seraiah, to whom it was committed, was sent to
 Babylon 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:59,60">Jer 51:59, 60</A>).

 The repetitions in it make it likely that it consists of prophecies 
 uttered at different times, now collected by Jeremiah to console the 
 Jews in exile and to vindicate God's ways by exhibiting the final doom 
 of Babylon, the enemy of the people of God, after her long prosperity. 
 The style, imagery, and dialogues prove its genuineness in opposition 
 to those who deny this. It shows his faithfulness; though under 
 obligation to the king of Babylon, he owed a higher one to God, who 
 directed him to prophesy against Babylon.</P>

 Jeremiah, having already (thirty-ninth and fortieth chapters) given the 
 history in the proper place, was not likely to repeat it here. Its 
 canonical authority as inspired is shown by its being in the 
 <I>Septuagint version.</I> It contains the capture and burning of 
 Jerusalem, &c., Zedekiah's punishment, and the better treatment of 
 Jehoiachin under Evil-merodach, down to his death. These last events 
 were probably subsequent to Jeremiah's time.</P>
