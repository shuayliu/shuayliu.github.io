 The <FONT SIZE=-1>OBJECT OF THE EPISTLE</FONT>.--Thessalonica was at 
 this time capital of the Roman second district of Macedonia 
 [L<FONT SIZE=-1>IVY</FONT>, <I>Histories,</I> 45.29]. It lay on the bay
 of Therme, and has always been, and still is, under its modern name
 Saloniki, a place of considerable commerce. After his imprisonment and
 scourging at Philippi, Paul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:2">1Th 2:2</A>)

 passed on to Thessalonica; and in company with Silas

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:1-9">Ac 17:1-9</A>)
 
 and Timotheus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:3,17:14">Ac 16:3; 17:14</A>,
 
 compare with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:1,3:1-6,2Th+1:1">1Th 1:1; 3:1-6;
 2Th 1:1</A>)

 founded the Church there. The Jews, as a body, rejected the Gospel when
 preached for three successive sabbaths

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:2">Ac 17:2</A>);

 but some few "believed and consorted with Paul and Silas, and of the 
 devout (that is, proselytes to Judaism) Greeks a great multitude, and 
 of the chief women not a few." The believers received the word 
 joyfully, notwithstanding trials and persecutions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:6,2:13">1Th 1:6; 2:13</A>)

 from their own countrymen and from the Jews

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:14-16">1Th 2:14-16</A>).

 His stay at Thessalonica was doubtless not limited to the three weeks 
 in which were the three sabbaths specified in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:2">Ac 17:2</A>;
 
 for his laboring there with his hands for his support

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:9,2Th+3:8">1Th 2:9;
 2Th 3:8</A>), 

 his receiving supplies there more than once from Philippi

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:16">Php 4:16</A>),
 
 his making many converts from the Gentiles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:9">1Th 1:9</A>;
 
 and as two oldest manuscripts read,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:4">Ac 17:4</A>,

 "of the devout <I>and</I> of the Greeks a great multitude,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:4">Ac 17:4</A>),

 and his appointing ministers--all imply a longer residence. Probably as 
 at Pisidian Antioch

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:46">Ac 13:46</A>),
 
 at Corinth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:6,7">Ac 18:6, 7</A>),

 and at Ephesus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:8,9">Ac 19:8, 9</A>),

 having preached the Gospel to the Jews, when they rejected it, he 
 turned to the Gentiles. He probably thenceforth held the Christian 
 meetings in the house of Jason

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:5">Ac 17:5</A>),

 perhaps "the kinsman" of Paul mentioned in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:21">Ro 16:21</A>.

 His great subject of teaching to them seems to have been the coming and 
 kingdom of Christ, as we may infer from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:10,2:12,19,3:13,4:13-18,5:1-11,23,24">1Th 1:10;
 2:12, 19; 3:13; 4:13-18; 5:1-11, 23, 24</A>;

 and that they should walk worthy of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:12,4:1">1Th 2:12; 4:1</A>).

 And it is an undesigned coincidence between the two Epistles and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:5,9">Ac 17:5, 9</A>,

 that the very charge which the assailants of Jason's house brought
 against him and other brethren was, "These do contrary to the decrees 
 of C&aelig;sar, saying that there is another <I>king,</I> one Jesus." 
 As in the case of the Lord Jesus Himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:33-37,19:12">Joh 18:33-37; 19:12</A>;

 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:64">Mt 26:64</A>),

 they perverted the doctrine of the coming kingdom of Christ into a 
 ground for the charge of treason against C&aelig;sar. The result was, 
 Paul and Silas were obliged to flee under the cover of night to Berea; 
 Timothy had probably preceded him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:10,14">Ac 17:10, 14</A>).

 But the Church had been planted, and ministers appointed; nay, more, 
 they virtually became missionaries themselves for which they possessed 
 facilities in the extensive commerce of their city, and both by word 
 and example were extending the Gospel in Macedonia, Achaia, and 
 elsewhere

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:7,8">1Th 1:7, 8</A>).

 From Berea, also. Paul, after having planted a Scripture-loving Church, 
 was obliged to flee by the Thessalonian Jews who followed him thither. 
 Timothy (who seems to have come to Berea separately from Paul and 
 Silas, compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:10,14">Ac 17:10,
 with Ac 17:14</A>)

 and Silas remained there still, when Paul proceeded by sea to Athens.
 While there he more than once longed to visit the Thessalonians again, 
 and see personally their spiritual state, and "perfect that which was 
 lacking in their faith"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:10">1Th 3:10</A>);

 but (probably using the Thessalonian Jews as his instruments,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:27">Joh 13:27</A>)
 
 "Satan hindered" him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:18">1Th 2:18</A>;
 
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:13">Ac 17:13</A>).

 He therefore sent Timotheus, who seems to have followed him to Athens 
 from Berea

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:15">Ac 17:15</A>),

 immediately on his arrival to Thessalonica

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:1">1Th 3:1</A>);

 glad as he would have been of Timothy's help in the midst of the cavils 
 of Athenian opponents, he felt he must forego that help for the sake of 
 the Thessalonian Church. Silas does not seem to have come to Paul <I>at 
 Athens</I> at all, though Paul had desired him and Timothy to "come to 
 him with all speed"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:15">Ac 17:15</A>);

 but seems with Timothy (who from Thessalonica called for him at Berea) 
 to have joined Paul <I>at Corinth</I> first; compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:1,5">Ac 18:1, 5</A>,

 "When Silas and Timothy were come from <I>Macedonia.</I>" The Epistle 
 makes no mention of Silas <I>at Athens,</I> as it does of Timothy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:1">1Th 3:1</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Timothy's account of the Thessalonian Church was highly favorable.
 They abounded in faith and charity and reciprocated his desire to see
 them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:6-10">1Th 3:6-10</A>).

 Still, as nothing human on earth is perfect, there were some defects. 
 Some had too exclusively dwelt on the doctrine of Christ's coming 
 kingdom, so as to neglect the sober-minded discharge of present duties

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:11,12">1Th 4:11, 12</A>).

 Some who had lost relatives by death, needed comfort and instruction in 
 their doubts as to whether they who died before Christ's coming would 
 have a share with those found alive in His kingdom then to be revealed. 
 Moreover, also, there had been committed among them sins against 
 chastity and sobriety

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:5-7">1Th 5:5-7</A>),
 
 as also against charity 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:3-10,5:13,15">1Th 4:3-10; 5:13, 15</A>).

 There were, too, symptoms in some of want of respectful love and
 subordination to their ministers; others treated slightingly the 
 manifestations of the Spirit in those possessing His gifts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:19">1Th 5:19</A>).

 To give spiritual admonition on these subjects, and at the same time 
 commend what deserved commendation, and to testify his love to them, 
 was the object of the Epistle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <FONT SIZE=-1>PLACE OF WRITING IT</FONT> was doubtless Corinth,
 where Timothy and Silas rejoined him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:5">Ac 18:5</A>)

 soon after he arrived there (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:17">1Th 2:17</A>)
 
 in the autumn of <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 52.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <FONT SIZE=-1>TIME OF WRITING</FONT> was evidently immediately 
 after having received from Timothy the tidings of their state

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:6">1Th 3:6</A>)

 in the winter of <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 52, or early in 53. For it 
 was written not long after the conversion of the Thessalonians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:8,9">1Th 1:8, 9</A>),

 while Paul could speak of himself as only <I>taken from them for a 
 short season</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:17">1Th 2:17</A>).

 Thus this Epistle was <I>first in date of all Paul's extant 
 Epistles.</I> The Epistle is written in the joint names of Paul, Silas, 
 and Timothy, the three founders of the Thessalonian Church. The plural 
 first person "we," is used everywhere, except in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:18,3:5,5:27">1Th 2:18; 3:5; 5:27</A>.

 "We" is the true reading,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:13">1Th 4:13</A>.
 
 The <I>English Version</I> "I," in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:9">1Th 4:9</A>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:1,23">1Th 5:1, 23</A>,

 is not supported by the original [E<FONT SIZE=-1>DMUNDS</FONT>].</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <FONT SIZE=-1>STYLE</FONT> is calm and equable, in accordance with the subject
 matter, which deals only with Christian duties in general, taking for
 granted the great doctrinal truths which were not as yet disputed.
 There was no deadly error as yet to call forth his more vehement bursts
 of feeling and impassioned argument. The earlier Epistles, as we should
 expect, are moral and practical. It was not until Judaistic and
 legalizing errors arose at a later period that he wrote those Epistles
 (for example, Romans and Galatians) which unfold the cardinal doctrines
 of grace and justification by faith. Still, later the Epistles from his
 Roman prison confirm the same truths. And last of all, the Pastoral
 Epistles are suited to the more developed ecclesiastical constitution
 of the Church, and give directions as to bishops and deacons, and
 correct abuses and errors of later growth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prevalence of the Gentile element in this Church is shown by the
 fact that these two Epistles are among the very few of Paul's writings
 in which no quotation occurs from the Old Testament.</P>

 <B>1. Paul</B>--He does not add "an apostle," because in their case, as 
 in that of the Philippians (see on

 <A HREF="JFB50.htm#Php1_1">Php 1:1</A>), 

 his apostolic authority needs not any substantiation. He writes 
 familiarly as to faithful friends, not but that his apostleship was 
 recognized among them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:6">1Th 2:6</A>).

 On the other hand, in writing to the Galatians, among whom some had 
 called in question his apostleship, he strongly asserts it in the 
 superscription. An undesigned propriety in the Epistles, evincing 
 genuineness.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Silvanus</B>--a "chief man among the brethren" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:22">Ac 15:22</A>),

 and a "prophet"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:32">Ac 15:32</A>),

 and one of the deputies who carried the decree of the Jerusalem council 
 to Antioch. His age and position cause him to be placed before 
 "Timothy," then a youth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:1,1Ti+4:12">Ac 16:1;
 1Ti 4:12</A>).
 
 Silvanus (the Gentile expanded form of "Silas") is called in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:12">1Pe 5:12</A>,
 
 "a faithful brother" (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:19">2Co 1:19</A>).

 They both aided in planting the Thessalonian Church, and are therefore 
 included in the address. This, the first of Paul's Epistles, as being 
 written before various evils crept into the churches, is without the 
 censures found in other Epistles. So realizing was their Christian 
 faith, that they were able hourly to look for the Lord Jesus.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>unto the church</B>--not merely as in the Epistles to Romans, 
 Ephesians, Colossians, Philippians, "to the saints," or "the faithful 
 at Thessalonica." Though as yet they do not seem to have had the 
 <I>final</I> Church organization under <I>permanent</I> "bishops" and 
 deacons, which appears in the later Epistles (See on

 <A HREF="JFB50.htm#Php1_1">Php 1:1</A>;
 
 <A HREF="JFB54.htm#Introduction">1</A> 
 
 and

 <A HREF="JFB55.htm#Introduction">2 Timothy</A>).

 Yet he designates them by the honorable term "Church," implying their
 status as not merely isolated believers, but a corporate body with
 spiritual rulers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:12,2Co+1:1,Ga+1:2">1Th 5:12;
 2Co 1:1; 
 Ga 1:2</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>in</B>--implying <I>vital union.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>God the Father</B>--This marks that they were no longer <I>heathen.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the Lord Jesus Christ</B>--This marks that they were not <I>Jews,</I> but
 Christians.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Grace be unto you, and peace</B>--that ye may have in God that
 <I>favor and peace</I> which men withhold
 [A<FONT SIZE=-1>NSELM</FONT>]. This is the salutation
 in all the Epistles of Paul, except the three pastoral ones, which have
 "grace, mercy, and peace." Some of the oldest manuscripts support,
 others omit the clause following, "from God our Father and the Lord
 Jesus Christ." It may have crept in from

 The structure of the sentences in this and the following verses, each
 successive sentence repeating with greater fulness the preceding, 
 characteristically marks Paul's abounding love and thankfulness in 
 respect to his converts, as if he were seeking by words heaped on words 
 to convey some idea of his exuberant feelings towards them.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>We</B>--I, Silvanus, and Timotheus.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:9">Ro 1:9</A>

 supports A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> in translating, "making mention of 
 you in our prayers without ceasing"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:3">1Th 1:3</A>).

 Thus, "without ceasing," in the second clause, answers in parallelism 
 to "always," in the first.</P>

 <A NAME="1Th1_3"> </A>

 <B>3. work of faith</B>--<I>the working reality of your faith;</I> its alacrity

 an otiose assent; but a <I>realizing, working faith;</I> not "in word only,"
 but in <I>one</I> continuous chain of "work" (singular, not plural,
 <I>works</I>),

 So "the work of faith" in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:11">2Th 1:11</A>
 
 implies its <I>perfect development</I> (compare

 The other governing substantives similarly mark respectively the
 characteristic manifestation of the grace which follows each in the
 genitive. <I>Faith, love,</I> and <I>hope,</I> are the three great Christian
 graces

 His slightly distinguishing himself here from his fellow missionaries, 
 whom throughout this Epistle he associates with himself in the plural, 
 accords with the fact that Silvanus and Timothy stayed at Berea when
 Paul went on to Athens; where subsequently Timothy joined him, and was 
 thence sent <I>by Paul alone</I> to Thessalonica

 <I>Paul</I> in this case, by inspiration, was enabled to say; the 
 hindrance was from Satan. G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT> thinks Satan's 
 mode of hindering Paul's journey to Thessalonica was by instigating the 
 Stoic and Epicurean philosophers to cavil, which entailed on Paul the 
 necessity of replying, and so detained him; but he seems to have left 
 Athens leisurely

 This implies that he sent Timothy <I>from Athens,</I> whither the 
 latter had followed him. However, the "we" favors A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LFORD'S</FONT> view that the determination to send Timothy was 
 formed during the hasty consultation of Paul, Silas, and Timothy, 
 <I>previous to his departure from Berea,</I> and that then he with them 
 "resolved" to be "left alone" at Athens, when he should arrive there: 
 Timothy and Silas not accompanying him, but remaining at Berea. Thus 
 the "I,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:5">1Th 3:5</A>,

 will express that the <I>act</I> of sending Timothy, when he arrived at 
 Athens, was <I>Paul's,</I> while the determination that Paul should be 
 left alone at Athens, was that of the brethren as well as himself, at 
 Berea, whence he uses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:1">1Th 3:1</A>,

 "we." The non-mention of Silas at Athens implies that he did not follow 
 Paul to Athens as was at first intended; but Timothy did.  Thus the 
 history,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:14,15">Ac 17:14, 15</A>,

 accords with the Epistle. The word "left behind" (<I>Greek</I>) implies 
 that Timothy had been with him <I>at Athens.</I> It was an act of 
 self-denial for their sakes that Paul deprived himself of the presence 
 of Timothy at Athens, which would have been so cheering to him in the 
 midst of philosophic cavillers; but from love to the Thessalonians, he 
 is well content to be left all "alone" in the great city.</P>

 <B>2. minister of God and our fellow labourer</B>--Some oldest manuscripts
 read, "fellow workman with God"; others, "minister of God." The former
 is probably genuine, as copyists probably altered it to the latter to
 avoid the bold phrase, which, however, is sanctioned by

 The <I>English Version</I> reading is not well supported, and is
 plainly compounded out of the two other readings. Paul calls Timothy 
 "our <I>brother</I>" here; but in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:17">1Co 4:17</A>,

 "my <I>son.</I>" He speaks thus highly of one so lately ordained, both 
 to impress the Thessalonians with a high respect for the delegate sent 
 to them, and to encourage Timothy, who seems to have been of a timid 
 character

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>ITTMANN</FONT> explains
 it, "That no man should, amidst his calamities, be <I>allured</I> by the

 The correspondence of the event to the prediction powerfully confirms
 faith: "Forewarned, forearmed" [E<FONT SIZE=-1>DMUNDS</FONT>]. The

 "abound" a more <I>comparative</I> force, "make you <I>full</I> (supplying
 'that which is lacking,'

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:10">1Th 3:10</A>)

 accomplished in the past, but a <I>present progressive</I> work. So the 
 Church of England Catechism, "<I>sanctifieth</I> (present) all the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:13">1Th 4:13</A>,

 that the removal of <I>ignorance</I> as to the sleeping believers would 
 remove undue grief respecting them. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:13">1Th 4:13</A>,

 "hope." Hence it appears our <I>hope</I> rests on our <I>faith</I> ("if 
 we believe"). "As surely as we all believe that Christ died and rose 
 again (the very doctrine specified as taught at Thessalonica,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:3">Ac 17:3</A>),

 <I>so also</I> will God bring <I>those laid to sleep by Jesus</I> with 
 Him (Jesus)." (So the order and balance of the members of the 
 <I>Greek</I> sentence require us to translate). Believers are laid in 
 sleep by Jesus, and so will be brought back from sleep with Jesus in 
 His train when He comes. The disembodied souls are not here spoken of; 
 the reference is to the sleeping <I>bodies.</I> The facts of Christ's 
 experience are repeated in the believer's. He died and then rose: so 
 believers shall die and then rise with Him. But in His case 
 <I>death</I> is the term used,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:3,6">1Co 15:3, 6</A>,

 &c.; in theirs, <I>sleep;</I> because His death has taken for them the 
 sting from death. The same Hand that shall raise them is that which 
 <I>laid them to sleep.</I> "Laid to sleep by Jesus," answers to "dead 
 in Christ"

 <B>15. by the word of the Lord</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "in," that is, <I>in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:35">1Ki 20:35</A>.

 This is the "mystery," a truth once hidden, now revealed, which Paul 
 shows

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:51,52">1Co 15:51, 52</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>prevent</B>--that is, "anticipate." So far were the early Christians 
 from regarding their departed brethren as <I>anticipating</I> them in 
 entering glory, that they needed to be assured that those who remain to 
 the coming of the Lord "will not anticipate them that are asleep." The 
 "we" means <I>whichever of us</I> are alive and remain unto the coming 
 of the Lord. The Spirit designed that believers in each successive age 
 should live in continued expectation of the Lord's coming, not knowing
 but that <I>they</I> should be among those found alive at His coming

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:42">Mt 24:42</A>).

 It is a sad fall from this blessed hope, that <I>death</I> is looked 
 for by most men, rather than the coming of our Lord. Each successive 
 generation in its time and place represents the generation which shall 
 actually survive till His coming

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:13,Ro+13:11,1Co+15:51,Jam+5:9,1Pe+4:5,6">Mt 25:13;
 Ro 13:11; 
 1Co 15:51; 
 Jas 5:9; 
 1Pe 4:5, 6</A>). 

 The Spirit subsequently revealed by Paul that which is not inconsistent
 with the expectation here taught of the Lord's coming at any time; 
 namely, that His coming would not be until there should be a "falling 
 away first"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:2,3">2Th 2:2, 3</A>);

 but as symptoms of this soon appeared, none could say but that still 
 this precursory event might be realized, and so the Lord come in his 
 day. Each successive revelation fills in the details of the general 
 outline first given. So Paul subsequently, while still looking mainly 
 for the Lord's coming to clothe him with his body from heaven, looks 
 for going to be with Christ in the meanwhile

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:1-10,Php+1:6,23,3:20,21,4:5">2Co 5:1-10;

 E<FONT SIZE=-1>DMUNDS</FONT> well says, The "we" is an affectionate
 identifying of ourselves with our fellows of all ages, as members of 
 the same body, under the same Head, Christ Jesus. So

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:21">1Th 5:21</A>)

 was needed, not to receive "all" pretended revelations as divine,

 means of testing them existed in the Church, in those who had the

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>RENCH</FONT> better regards "wholly" as meaning, "having
 perfectly attained the moral <I>end,</I>" namely, to be a full-grown 
 man in Christ. "Whole," <I>complete,</I> with no grace which ought to 
 be wanting in a Christian.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>24. Faithful</B>--to His covenant promises

 1Co 1:9; 10:23; 
 Php 1:6</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he that calleth you</B>--God, the caller of His people, will cause His
 calling not to fall short of its designed end.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>do it</B>--preserve and present you blameless at the coming of Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:23,Ro+8:30,1Pe+5:10">1Th 5:23;
 Ro 8:30; 
 1Pe 5:10</A>). 

 You must not look at the foes before and behind, on the right hand and
 on the left, but to God's faithfulness to His promises, God's zeal for 
 His honor, and God's love for those whom He calls.</P>

 <A NAME="1Th5_25"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>25.</B> Some oldest manuscripts read, "Pray ye <I>also</I> for
 (literally, '<I>concerning</I>') us"; make us and our work the subject 
 of your prayers, even as <I>we</I> have been just praying for you

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:23">1Th 5:23</A>).

 Others omit the "also." The clergy need much the prayers of their
 flocks. Paul makes the same request in the Epistles to Romans, 
 Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Philemon, and in Second 
 Corinthians; not so in the Epistles to Timothy and Titus, whose 
 intercessions, as his spiritual sons, he was already sure of; nor in 
 the Epistles, I Corinthians, and Galatians, as these Epistles abound in 
 rebuke.</P>

 <A NAME="1Th5_26"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>26.</B> Hence it appears this Epistle was first handed to the elders, who
 communicated it to "the brethren."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>holy kiss</B>--pure and chaste. "A kiss of charity" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:14">1Pe 5:14</A>).

 A token of Christian fellowship in those days (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:45,Ac+20:37">Lu 7:45;
 Ac 20:37</A>), 

 as it is a common mode of salutation in many countries. The custom
 hence arose in the early Church of passing the kiss through the
 congregation at the holy communion
 [J<FONT SIZE=-1>USTIN</FONT> M<FONT SIZE=-1>ARTYR</FONT>,
 <I>Apology,</I> 1.65; <I>Apostolic Constitutions,</I> 2.57], the men 
 kissing the men, and the women the women, in the Lord. So in the Syrian 
 Church each takes his neighbor's right hand and gives the salutation, 
 "Peace."</P>

 <A NAME="1Th5_27"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>27. I charge</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "I adjure you."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>read unto all</B>--namely, publicly in the congregation at a 
 particular time. The <I>Greek</I> aorist tense implies a single act 
 done at a particular time. The earnestness of his adjuration implies 
 how solemnly important he felt this divinely inspired message to be. 
 Also, as this was the <FONT SIZE=-1>FIRST</FONT> of the Epistles of the 
 New Testament, he makes this the occasion of a solemn charge, that so 
 its being publicly read should be a sample of what should be done in 
 the case of the others, just as the Pentateuch and the Prophets were 
 publicly read under the Old Testament, and are still read in the 
 synagogue. Compare the same injunction as to the public reading of the
 Apocalypse, the <FONT SIZE=-1>LAST</FONT> of the New Testament canon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:3">Re 1:3</A>).

 The "all" includes women and children, and especially those who could
 not read it themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:12,Jos+8:33-35">De 31:12;
 Jos 8:33-35</A>). 

 What Paul commands with an adjuration, Rome forbids under a curse
 [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>].  Though these Epistles had difficulties, 
 the laity were all to hear them read

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:11,2Pe+3:10">1Pe 4:11;
 2Pe 3:10</A>; 
 
 even the very young,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:5,3:15">2Ti 1:5; 3:15</A>).

 "Holy" is omitted before "brethren" in most of the oldest manuscripts,
 though some of them support it.</P>

 <A NAME="1Th5_28"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>28.</B> (See on

 <A HREF="JFB47.htm#2Co13_14">2Co 13:14</A>.) 

 Paul ends as he began

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:1">1Th 1:1</A>),

 with "grace." The oldest manuscripts omit "Amen," which probably was 
 the response of the Church after the public reading of the Epistle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The subscription is a comparatively modern addition. The Epistle was
 not, as it states, written from Athens, but from Corinth; for it is 
 written in the names of Silas and Timothy (besides Paul), who did not 
 join the apostle before he reached the latter city
