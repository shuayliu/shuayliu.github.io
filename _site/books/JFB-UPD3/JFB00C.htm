 This constitutes the second division, the others being the Law and 
 Hagiographa. It included Joshua, Judges, First and Second Samuel, First 
 and Second Kings, called <I>the former prophets;</I> and Isaiah, 
 Jeremiah, Ezekiel, &c., to Malachi, <I>the latter prophets.</I> Daniel 
 is excluded, because, though highly endowed with prophetic gifts, he 
 <I>had not filled the prophetic office:</I> his book is therefore 
 classed with the Hagiographa. Ezra probably commenced, and others 
 subsequently completed, the arrangement of the canon. The prophets were 
 not mere predictors. Their <I>Hebrew</I> name, <I>nabi,</I> comes from 
 a root "to boil up as a fountain" (G<FONT SIZE=-1>ESENIUS</FONT>);
 hence the fervor of inspiration

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:21">2Pe 1:21</A>).

 Others interpret it as from an <I>Arabic</I> root 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:16">Ex 4:16</A>,

 "spokesman" of God, the Holy Ghost supplying him with words); 
 communicated by <I>dreams</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:28,Job+33:14-17">Joe 2:28;
 Job 33:14-17</A>

 --no instance of this occurs in Isaiah); or <I>visions,</I> the scene
 being made to pass before their mind

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:1">Isa 1:1</A>);

 or <I>trance, ecstasy</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:4,16,Eze+1:3,3:14">Nu 24:4, 16;
 Eze 1:3; 3:14</A>);

 not depriving them, however, of free
 conscious agency

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:7,9,1Co+14:32">Jer 20:7, 9;
 1Co 14:32</A>).</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These P<FONT SIZE=-1>ECULIAR</FONT> F<FONT SIZE=-1>ORMS</FONT> of 
 inspiration distinguish <I>prophets,</I> strictly so called, from Moses 
 and others, though inspired

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:6-8">Nu 12:6-8</A>).

 Hence their name <I>seers.</I> Hence, too, the poetical cast of their
 style, though less restricted, owing to their practical tendency, by
 the outward forms observed in strictly poetical books. Hence, too, the
 union of music with prophesying

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:5">1Sa 10:5</A>).

 This ecstatic state, though exalted, is not the highest: for Jesus
 Christ was never in it, nor Moses. It was rendered necessary by the
 frailty of the prophets, and the spiritual obtuseness of the people. It
 accordingly predominates in the Old Testament, but is subordinate in
 the New Testament, where the Holy Ghost by the fulness of His ordinary
 gifts renders the extraordinary less necessary. After the time of the
 Mosaic economy, the idea of a prophet was regularly connected with the
 prophetic <I>office</I>--not conferred by men, but by God. In this they 
 differ from mystics whose pretended inspiration is for themselves: 
 prophetism is <I>practical,</I> not dreamy and secluded; the prophet's 
 inspiration is theirs only as God's messengers to the people. His 
 ordinary servants and <I>regular</I> teachers of the people were the
 priests; the prophets distinguished from them by inspiration, were 
 designed to <I>rouse</I> and <I>excite.</I> In Israel, however, as 
 distinguished from Judah (as there was no true priesthood) the prophets 
 were the <I>regular</I> and only ministers of God. Prophecy in Israel 
 needed to be supported more powerfully: therefore the "schools" were 
 more established; and more striking prophetic deeds (for example, 
 Elijah's and Elisha's) are recorded, than in Judah. The law was their 
 basis 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:16,20">Isa 8:16, 20</A>),
 
 both its form and spirit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:2,13:1-3">De 4:2; 13:1-3</A>);

 at times they looked forward to a day when its ever-living spirit would 
 break its then imperfect form for a freer and more perfect development

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:16,31:31">Jer 3:16; 31:31</A>);

 but they altered not a tittle in their own days. 
 E<FONT  SIZE=-1>ICHORN</FONT> well calls Moses' song

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:1-47">De 32:1-47</A>)

 the Magna Charta of prophecy. The fulfilment of their predictions was 
 to be the <I>sign</I> of their being real prophets of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+18:22">De 18:22</A>);

 also, their speaking in the name of no other but the true God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+18:20">De 18:20</A>).

 Prophecy was the only sanctioned indulgence of the craving after
 knowledge of future events, which is so prevalent in the East

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+18:10,11">De 18:10, 11</A>).

 For a momentary inspiration the mere beginning of spiritual life 
 sufficed, as in Balaam's case; but for a continuous mission, the
 prophet must be converted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:7">Isa 6:7</A>).

 In Samuel's days 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:8,19:20">1Sa 10:8; 19:20</A>)

 begin the prophetic "schools." These were associations of men, more or 
 less <I>endowed with the Spirit,</I> in which the feebler were helped 
 by those of greater spiritual powers: so at Beth-el and Gilgal

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:3,4:38,6:21">2Ki 2:3; 4:38; 6:21</A>).

 Only the leaders stood in immediate communion with God, while the rest
 were joined to Him through their mediation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:15,2Ki+8:13">1Ki 19:15;
 2Ki 8:13</A>);

 the former acted through the latter as their
 instruments 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:16,2Ki+9:1,2">1Ki 19:16;
 2Ki 9:1, 2</A>).

 The bestowal of prophetic gifts was not, however, limited to these
 schools

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:14,15">Am 7:14, 15</A>).</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As to S<FONT SIZE=-1>YMBOLIC</FONT> A<FONT SIZE=-1>CTIONS,</FONT> many 
 of them are not <I>actual</I> but only parts of the prophetic 
 <I>visions,</I> internal not external facts, being impossible or 
 indecent

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:1-10,25:12-38,Ho+1:2-11">Jer 13:1-10; 25:12-38; 
 Ho 1:2-11</A>).

 Still the internal actions, when possible and proper, were often 
 expressed externally

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:11">1Ki 22:11</A>).

 Those purely internal express the subject more strikingly than a naked 
 statement could.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Other C<FONT SIZE=-1>RITERIA</FONT> of a true prophet, besides the two 
 above, were, <I>the accordance of his addresses with the law;</I> his 
 <I>not promising prosperity without repentance;</I> his <I>own 
 assurance of his divine mission</I> (sometimes received reluctantly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:8,9,26:12">Jer 20:8, 9; 26:12</A>),

 <I>producing that inward assurance of the truth in others,</I> which is 
 to them a stronger proof from the Spirit of God, than even outward 
 miracles and arguments: his pious life, fortitude in suffering, and 
 freedom from fanaticism, confirm these criteria. Miracles, though 
 proofs, are not to be trusted without the negative criteria

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:2">De 13:2</A>).

 Predictions fulfilled in the prophet's lifetime established his
 authority thenceforth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:19,Jer+22:11-12,Eze+12:12,13,24:1-27">1Sa 3:19;
 Jer 22:11-12; 
 Eze 12:12,13; 24:1-27</A>).</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As to their P<FONT SIZE=-1>ROMULGATION,</FONT> it was usually oral, 
 before the assembled people, and afterwards revised in writing. The 
 second part of Isaiah and Ezekiel 40-48 were probably not given orally,
 but in writing.  Before Isaiah's and his contemporaries' time, 
 prophecies were not <I>written,</I> as not being intended for universal 
 use. But now a larger field was opened. To the worldly power of heathen 
 nations which threatened to destroy the theocracy is henceforth opposed 
 the kingdom of God, about to conquer all through Messiah, whose coming 
 concerns all ages. The lesser prophets give the quintessence of the 
 prophecies of their respective authors. An instance of the mode of 
 collecting and publishing prophecies occurs

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:4-14">Jer 36:4-14</A>).

 Those of the later prophets rest on those of the earlier

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:4,7:7,12">Zec 1:4; 7:7, 12</A>).

 E<FONT SIZE=-1>WALD</FONT> fancies that a great number of prophetic 
 rolls have been lost. But the fact of the prophets often alluding to 
 writings which we have, and never to those which it can be 
 <I>proved</I> we have not, makes it likely that we have all those 
 predictions which were committed to writing; the care bestowed on them 
 as divine, and the exact knowledge of them long after

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+26:18,19">Jer 26:18, 19</A>),
 
 confirm this view.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The A<FONT SIZE=-1>RRANGEMENT</FONT> is chronological; but as the 
 twelve lesser prophets are regarded as one work, and the three last of 
 them lived later than Jeremiah and Ezekiel, the former are put after 
 the latter. The lesser prophets are arranged chronologically, except 
 Hosea, who being the largest, is placed first, though some were earlier 
 than he; also Jonah, who seems to have been the earliest of <I>the 
 latter prophets.</I></P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As to T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT> M<FONT SIZE=-1>ESSIAH,</FONT> no
 <I>single</I> prophet gives a complete view of Him: this is made up of
 the various aspects of Him in different prophecies combined; just as
 His life in the Gospels is one under a fourfold aspect. In the first
 part of Isaiah, addressed to the whole people, the prominent idea is
 His triumph, as King, the design being there to remove their fears of
 the surrounding nations; in the second, addressed to the elect remnant,
 He is exhibited as Prophet and Priest, Himself being the sacrifice.</P>
