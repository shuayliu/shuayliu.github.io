 <B>1. I</B>--emphatical. <I>I</I> personally, for my part. On Gaius or 
 Caius, see my

 <A HREF="JFB63.htm#Introduction"><I>Introduction</I></A>
 
 before Second Epistle.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>love in the truth</B>--

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:1">2Jo 1</A>).

 "Beloved" is repeated often in this Epistle, indicating strong
 affection

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:1,2,5,11">3Jo 1, 2, 5, 11</A>).</P>

 <A NAME="3Jo1_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. above all things</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "<I>concerning</I> all 
 things": so A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>: <I>in all respects.</I> But 
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>AHL</FONT> justifies <I>English Version</I> (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:8">1Pe 4:8</A>).

 Of course, since his <I>soul's prosperity</I> is presupposed, "above 
 all things" does not imply that John wishes Gaius' bodily health above 
 that of his soul, but as the <I>first</I> object to be desired <I>next 
 after spiritual health.</I> I know you are prospering in the concerns 
 of your soul. I wish you similar prosperity in your body.  Perhaps John 
 had heard from the brethren

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:3">3Jo 3</A>)

 that Gaius was in bad health, and was tried in other ways

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:10">3Jo 10</A>),

 to which the wish,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:2">3Jo 2</A>,
 
 refers.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>prosper</B>--in general.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>be in health</B>--in particular.</P>

 <A NAME="3Jo1_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. testified of the truth that is in thee</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "of" 
 (or '<I>to</I>') thy truth": thy share of that truth in which thou 
 walkest [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>even as thou</B>--in contrast to Diotrephes 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:9">3Jo 9</A>).</P>

 <A NAME="3Jo1_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4. my children</B>--members of the Church: confirming the view that 
 the "elect lady" is a Church.</P>

 <A NAME="3Jo1_5"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>5. faithfully</B>--an act becoming a faithful man.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>whatsoever thou doest</B>--a distinct <I>Greek</I> word from the 
 former "doest": translate, "workest": whatsoever work, or labor of 
 love, thou dost perform. So

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:10">Mt 26:10</A>,

 "She hath wrought a good <I>work</I> upon me."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and to strangers</B>--The oldest manuscripts, "and that (that is, 
 and those brethren) strangers." The fact of the brethren whom thou 
 didst entertain being "strangers," enhances the love manifested in the 
 act.</P>

 <A NAME="3Jo1_6"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>6. borne witness of thy charity before the church</B>--to stimulate
 others by the good example. The brethren so entertained by Gaius were
 missionary evangelists 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:7">3Jo 7</A>);

 and, probably, in the course of narrating their missionary labors for
 the edification of the Church where John then was, incidentally 
 mentioned the loving hospitality shown them by Gaius.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>bring forward on their journey</B>--"If thou (<I>continue to</I>) 
 forward on their journey" by giving them provisions for the way.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>after a godly sort</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "in a manner worthy of God," 
 whose ambassadors they are, and whose servant thou art. He who honors 
 God's missionary servants

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:7">3Jo 7</A>),

 honors God.</P>

 <A NAME="3Jo1_7"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>7. his name's sake</B>--Christ's.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>went forth</B>--as missionaries.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>taking nothing</B>--refusing to <I>receive</I> aught by way of pay, 
 or maintenance, though justly entitled to it, as Paul at Corinth and at 
 Thessalonica.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Gentiles</B>--the Christians just gathered out by their labors from 
 among the heathen. As Gaius himself was a <I>Gentile</I> convert, "the 
 Gentiles" here must mean <I>the converts just made from the 
 heathen,</I> the Gentiles to whom they had <I>gone forth.</I> It would 
 have been inexpedient to have taken aught (the <I>Greek</I> 
 "<I>meden</I>" implies, not that they <I>got</I> nothing, though they 
 had desired it, but that it was of <I>their own choice</I> they <I>took 
 nothing</I>) from the infant churches among the heathen: the case was 
 different in receiving hospitality from Gaius.</P>

 <A NAME="3Jo1_8"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>8. We</B>--in contradistinction to "the Gentiles" or "heathen" 
 referred to,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:7">3Jo 7</A>.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>therefore</B>--as they take nothing from the Gentiles or heathen.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>receive</B>--The oldest manuscripts read, "take up." As they "take" 
 nothing from the Gentiles, we ought to <I>take</I> them <I>up</I> so as 
 to support them.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>fellow helpers</B>--with them.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>to the truth</B>--that is, <I>to promote</I> the truth.</P>

 <A NAME="3Jo1_9"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>9. I wrote</B>--The oldest manuscripts add "something": a 
 <I>communication,</I> probably, on the subject of <I>receiving the 
 brethren</I> with brotherly love

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:8,10">3Jo 8, 10</A>).

 That Epistle was not designed by the Spirit for the universal Church, 
 or else it would have been preserved.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>unto the church</B>--of which Gaius is a member.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>loveth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. pre-eminence</B>--through ambition. Evidently 
 occupying a high place in the Church where Gaius was

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:10">3Jo 10</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>among them</B>--<I>over</I> the members of the Church.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>receiveth us not</B>--virtually, namely, by not <I>receiving</I> 
 with love the brethren whom we recommended to be received

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:8,10">3Jo 8, 10</A>;
 
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:40">Mt 10:40</A>).</P>

 <A NAME="3Jo1_10"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>10. if I come</B>--

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:14">3Jo 14</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>I will remember</B>--literally, "I will bring to mind" before all by 
 stigmatizing and punishing.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>prating</B>--with mere silly tattle.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>neither doth he .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. receive the brethren</B>--with 
 hospitality. "The brethren" are the missionaries on their journey.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>forbiddeth them that would</B>--receive them.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>casteth them</B>--those that would receive the brethren, by 
 excommunication from the Church, which his influence, as a leading man

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:9">3Jo 9</A>)

 in it, enabled him to do. N<FONT SIZE=-1>EANDER</FONT> thinks that the 
 missionaries were J<FONT SIZE=-1>EWS</FONT> by birth, whence it is said 
 in their praise they <I>took nothing from</I> <FONT SIZE=-1>THE</FONT> 
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>ENTILES</FONT>: in contrast to other Jewish missionaries 
 who abused ministers' right of maintenance elsewhere, as Paul tells us,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:22,Php+3:2,5,19">2Co 11:22;
 Php 3:2, 5, 19</A>. 

 Now in the Gentile churches there existed an ultra-Pauline party of 
 anti-Jewish tendency, the forerunners of Marcion: Diotrephes possibly 
 stood at the head of this party, which fact, as well as this 
 domineering spirit, may account for his hostility to the missionaries, 
 and to the apostle John, who had, by the power of love, tried to 
 harmonize the various elements in the Asiatic churches.  At a later 
 period, Marcion, we know, attached himself to Paul alone, and paid no 
 deference to the authority of John.</P>

 <A NAME="3Jo1_11"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>11. follow not that which is evil</B>--as manifested in Diotrephes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:9,10">3Jo 9, 10</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. good</B>--as manifested in Demetrius 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:12">3Jo 12</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>is of God</B>--is born of God, who is good.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>hath not seen God</B>--spiritually, not literally.</P>

 <A NAME="3Jo1_12"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>12. of all men</B>--who have had opportunity of knowing his character.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>of the truth itself</B>--The Gospel standard of <I>truth</I> bears 
 witness to him that he walks conformably to it, in acts of real love, 
 hospitality to the brethren (in contrast to Diotrephes), &c. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:21">Joh 3:21</A>

 "He that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made 
 manifest that they are wrought in God."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>we also</B>--besides the testimony of "all men," and "of the truth
 itself."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>ye know</B>--The oldest manuscripts read, "thou knowest."</P>

 <A NAME="3Jo1_13"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>13. I will not</B>--rather as <I>Greek,</I> "I <I>wish</I> not
 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to write" more.</P>

 <A NAME="3Jo1_14"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>14. face to face</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "mouth to mouth."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Peace</B>--peace inward of conscience, peace fraternal of
 friendship, peace supernal of glory [L<FONT SIZE=-1>YRA</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>friends</B>--a title seldom used in the New Testament, as it is
 absorbed in the higher titles of "brother, brethren." Still Christ 
 recognizes the relation of <I>friend</I> also, based on the highest 
 grounds, obedience to Him from love, and entailing the highest 
 privileges, admission to the intimacy of the holy and glorious God, and 
 sympathizing Saviour; so Christians have "friends" in Christ. Here in a 
 friendly letter, mention of "friends" appropriately occurs.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>by name</B>--not less than if their names were written 
 [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>].</P>
