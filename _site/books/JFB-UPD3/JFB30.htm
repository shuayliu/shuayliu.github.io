 A<FONT SIZE=-1>MOS</FONT> (meaning in <I>Hebrew</I> "a burden") was 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+1:1">Am 1:1</A>)

 a shepherd of Tekoa, a small town of Judah, six miles southeast from
 Beth-lehem, and twelve from Jerusalem, on the borders of the great 
 desert

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+20:20">2Ch 20:20</A>;
 
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:6">2Ch 11:6</A>).

 The region being sandy was more fit for pastoral than for agricultural 
 purposes. Amos therefore owned and tended flocks, and collected 
 sycamore figs; not that the former was a menial office, kings 
 themselves, as Mesha of Moab

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:4">2Ki 3:4</A>),

 exercising it. Amos, however (from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:14,15">Am 7:14, 15</A>),
 
 seems to have been of humble rank.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Though belonging to Judah, he was commissioned by God to exercise
 his prophetical function in Israel; as the latter kingdom abounded in
 impostors, and the prophets of God generally fled to Judah through fear
 of the kings of Israel, a true prophet from Judah was the more needed
 in it. His name is not to be confounded with that of Isaiah's father,
 Amoz.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The time of his prophesying was in the reigns of Uzziah king of
 Judea, and Jeroboam II, son of Joash, king of Israel 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+1:1">Am 1:1</A>),

 that is, in part of the time in which the two kings were contemporary; 
 probably in Jeroboam's latter years, after that monarch had recovered 
 from Syria "the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath to the sea 
 of the plain"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:25-27">2Ki 14:25-27</A>);

 for Amos foretells that these same coasts, "from the entering in of 
 Hamath unto the river of the wilderness," should be the scene of 
 Israel's being afflicted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:14">Am 6:14</A>);

 also his references to the state of luxurious security then existing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:1,4,13">Am 6:1, 4, 13</A>),

 and to the speedy termination of it by the Assyrian foe

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+1:5,3:12,15,5:27,8:2">Am 1:5; 3:12, 15; 5:27; 8:2</A>),

 point to the latter part of Jeroboam's reign, which terminated in 784
 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, the twenty-seventh year of Uzziah's reign, 
 which continued down to 759 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He was contemporary with Hosea, only that the latter continued to 
 prophesy in reigns subsequent to Uzziah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:1">Ho 1:1</A>);

 whereas Amos ceased to prophesy in the reign of that monarch. The scene 
 of his ministry was Beth-el, where the idol calves were set up

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:10-13">Am 7:10-13</A>).

 There his prophecies roused Amaziah, the idol priest, to accuse him of 
 conspiracy and to try to drive him back to Judah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The first six chapters are without figure; the last three
 symbolical, but with the explanation subjoined. He first denounces the
 neighboring peoples, then the Jews, then Israel (from the third chapter
 to the end), closing with the promise or restoration under Messiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:11-15">Am 9:11-15</A>).

 His style is thought by J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> to betray his 
 humble origin; but though not sublime, it is regular, perspicuous, and 
 energetic; his images are taken from the scenes in nature with which he 
 was familiar; his rhythms are flowing, his parallelisms exact, and his 
 descriptions minute and graphic. Some peculiar expressions occur: 
 "cleanness of teeth," that is, <I>want of bread</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:6">Am 4:6</A>);

 "the excellency of Jacob"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:8,8:7">Am 6:8; 8:7</A>);
 
 "the high places of Isaac"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:9">Am 7:9</A>);

 "the house of Isaac" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:16">Am 7:16</A>);
 
 "he that createth the wind"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:13">Am 4:13</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGSTENBERG</FONT> draws an able argument for the genuineness of the
 Mosaic records from the evidence in Amos, that the existing
 institutions in Israel as well as Judah (excepting the calves of
 Jeroboam), were framed according to the Pentateuch rules.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two quotations from Amos occur in the New Testament (compare

 <I>ill-shapen and short-footed</I> (as others explain the name from an
 <I>Arabic</I> root), but distinguished by their wool
 [M<FONT SIZE=-1>AURER</FONT>]. God chooses
 "the weak things of the world to confound the mighty," and makes a
 humble shepherd reprove the arrogance of Israel and her king arising
 from prosperity (compare

 <B>3.</B> Here begins a series of threatenings of vengeance against six other
 states, followed by one against Judah, and ending with one against
 Israel, with whom the rest of the prophecy is occupied. The eight
 predictions are in symmetrical stanzas, each prefaced by "Thus saith the
 Lord." Beginning with the sin of others, which Israel would be ready
 enough to recognize, he proceeds to bring home to Israel her own guilt.
 Israel must not think hereafter, because she sees others visited
 similarly to herself, that such judgments are matters of chance; nay,
 they are divinely foreseen and foreordered, and are confirmations of the
 truth that God will not clear the guilty. If God spares not the nations
 that know not the truth, how much less Israel that sins wilfully

 sinned once or twice, I would have spared them, but since, after having
 been so often pardoned, they still persevere <I>so continually,</I> I will
 no longer "turn away" <I>their punishment.</I> The <I>Hebrew</I> is simply, "I
 will not reverse <I>it,</I>" namely, the sentence of punishment which
 follows; the negative expression implies more than it expresses; that
 is, "I will <I>most surely execute</I> it"; God's fulfilment of His threats
 being more awful than human language can express. "Three and four"
 imply sin <I>multiplied on sin</I> (compare

 as Jehu of Israel, mentioned as tributaries of "Shalmanubar," king of 
 Assyria. The kind of tribute from Jehu is mentioned: gold, pearls,
 precious oil, &c.  [G. V. S<FONT SIZE=-1>MITH</FONT>].  The Ben-hadad

 "pleasantness"; situated at Lebanon. As J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT> 
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>BASSUS</FONT> is a doubtful authority, perhaps the 
 reference may be rather to the valley between Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon, 
 called <I>El-Bekaa,</I> where are the ruins of the Baal-bek temple of 
 the sun; so the <I>Septuagint</I> renders it <I>On,</I> the same name

 "Judah .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. carried captive <I>all</I> of it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

 carried away all the substance of the king of Judah, and his wives and 
 his sons, "so that there was never a son left to him, save Jehoahaz"; 
 and after Amos' time (if the reference includes the <I>future,</I>

 reference here in Amos is not to that fact, but to the revenge which 
 probably the king of Moab took on the king of Edom, when the forces of 
 Israel and Judah had retired after their successful campaign against 
 Moab, leaving Edom without allies. The Hebrew tradition is that Moab in 
 revenge tore from their grave and burned the bones of the king of Edom, 
 the ally of Jehoram and Jehoshaphat, who was already buried. Probably 
 the "burning of the bones" means, "he burned the king of Edom alive,

 <B>Can two walk together, except they be agreed?</B>--Can God's prophets be
 so unanimous in prophesying against you, if God's Spirit were not joined
 with them, or if their prophecies were false? The Israelites were "at
 ease," not believing that God was with the prophets in their denunciations
 of coming ruin to the nation

 Where a corrupt nation is, there God's instruments of punishment are

 lion."

 <B>have taken nothing?</B>--The young lion just weaned lies silent, until the
 old lion brings the prey near; then the scent rouses him. So, the

 Israel's sins as requiring punishment.</P>

 <B>5.</B> When a bird trying to fly upwards is made to fall upon the earth

 judgment that thou art entangled [L<FONT SIZE=-1>UDOVICUS</FONT>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>shall <I>one</I> take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing</B>--The bird-catcher does not remove his snare off the ground till he has
 caught some prey; so God will not withdraw the Assyrians, &c., the
 instruments of punishment, until they have had the success against you
 which God gives them. The foe corresponds to the "snare," suddenly
 <I>springing</I> from the ground and enclosing the bird on the latter
 touching it; the <I>Hebrew</I> is literally, "Shall the snare <I>spring</I> from the earth?" Israel entangled in judgments answers to the bird

 Yet Israel is not alarmed, though God threatens judgments.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done it?</B>--This is
 the explanation of the preceding similes: God is the Author of all the

 is not to the world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:17">1Ki 18:17</A>).

 So if aught of Israel escapes, it shall be a miracle of God's goodness.
 It shall be but a scanty remnant. There is a kind of goat in the East 
 the ears of which are a foot long, and proportionally broad. Perhaps

 So the Israelites are represented as not merely in "the corner of a 
 bed," as in Samaria, but "in a (whole) couch," at Damascus, living in 
 luxurious ease. Of these, now so luxurious, soon but a remnant shall be 
 left by the foe. The destruction of Damascus and that of Samaria shall 
 be conjoined; as here their luxurious lives, and subsequently under 
 Pekah and Rezin their inroads on Judah, were combined

 it is "beyond <I>Babylon,</I>" which includes <I>beyond Damascus.</I> 
 In Amos' time, Damascus was the object of Israel's fear because of the
 Syrian wars. Babylon was not yet named as the place of their captivity. 
 Stephen supplies this name. Their place of exile was in fact, as he 
 states, "<I>beyond</I> Babylon," in Halah and Habor by the river Gozan, 
 and in the cities of the Medes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:6">2Ki 17:6</A>;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+1:5,4:3,6:14">Am 1:5; 4:3; 6:14</A>).

 The road to Assyria lay through "Damascus." It is therefore specified,
 that not merely shall they be carried captives to Damascus, as they had 
 been by Syrian kings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:32,33,13:7">2Ki 10:32, 33; 13:7</A>),

 but, beyond that, to a region whence a return was not so possible as
 from Damascus. They were led captive by Satan into idolatry, therefore 
 God caused them to go captive among idolaters.  Compare

 But Amaziah exaggerates the charge, to excite Jeroboam against him. The

 He argues by implication against Amos' presumption, as a private man,
 in speaking against the worship sanctioned by the king, and that in the 
 very place consecrated to it for the king's own devotions.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>king's court</B>--that is, residence: the seat of empire, where the king
 holds his court, and which thou oughtest to have reverenced. Samaria was
 the usual king's residence: but for the convenience of attending the
 calf-worship, a royal palace was at Beth-el also.</P>

 that he discharged the prophetical office to earn his "bread" (like 
 Israel's mercenary prophets). So far from being rewarded, Jehovah's 
 prophets had to expect imprisonment and even death as the result of 
 their prophesying in Samaria or Israel: whereas the prophets of Baal 
 were maintained at the king's expense (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:19">1Ki 18:19</A>).
 
 I was not, says Amos, of the order of prophets, or educated in their
 schools, and deriving a livelihood from exercising the public functions
 of a prophet. I am a <I>shepherd</I> (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:15">Am 7:15</A>,

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>prophet's son</B>--that is, disciple. Schools of prophets are mentioned
 first in First Samuel; in these youths were educated to serve the
 theocracy as public instructors. Only in the kingdom of the ten tribes
 is the continuance of the schools of the prophets mentioned. They were
 missionary stations near the chief seats of superstition in Israel, and
 associations endowed with the Spirit of God; none were admitted but
 those to whom the Spirit had been previously imparted. Their spiritual
 fathers travelled about to visit the training schools, and cared for the
 members and even their widows 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+4:1,2">2Ki 4:1, 2</A>).

 The pupils had their common board in them, and after leaving them still 
 continued members.  The offerings which in Judah were given by the 
 pious to the Levites, in Israel went to the schools of the prophets

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+4:42">2Ki 4:42</A>).

 Prophecy (for example, Elijah and Elisha) in Israel was more connected 
 with extraordinary events than in Judah, inasmuch as, in the absence of 
 the legal hierarchy of the latter, it needed to have more palpable 
 divine sanction.

 <B>11. In that day</B>--quoted by James 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:16,17">Ac 15:16, 17</A>),

 "After this," that is, in the dispensation of Messiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10,Ho+3:4,5,Joe+2:28,3:1">Ge 49:10;
 Ho 3:4, 5; 
 Joe 2:28; 3:1</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>tabernacle of David</B>--not "the <I>house</I> of David," which is
 used of his affairs when prospering

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:1">2Sa 3:1</A>),

 but the <I>tent</I> or <I>booth,</I> expressing the low condition to
 which his kingdom and family had fallen in Amos' time, and subsequently 
 at the Babylonian captivity before the restoration; and secondarily, in 
 the last days preceding Israel's restoration under Messiah, the 
 antitype to David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:13,14,Jer+30:9,Eze+34:24,37:24">Ps 102:13, 14;
 Jer 30:9; 
 Eze 34:24; 37:24</A>;

 see on

 <A HREF="JFB23.htm#Isa12_1">Isa 12:1</A>). 
 
 The type is taken from architecture

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:20">Eph 2:20</A>).

 The restoration under Zerubbabel can only be a partial, temporary 
 fulfilment; for it did not include Israel, which nation is the main 
 subject of Amos' prophecies, but only Judah; also Zerubbabel's kingdom 
 was not independent and settled; also all the prophets end their 
 prophecies with Messiah, whose advent is the cure of all previous 
 disorders. "Tabernacle" is appropriate to Him, as His human nature is 
 the tabernacle which He assumed in becoming Immanuel, "God with us"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:14">Joh 1:14</A>).

 "Dwelt," literally, <I>tabernacled</I> "among us" (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:3">Re 21:3</A>).

 Some understand "the tabernacle of David" as that which David pitched 
 for the ark in Zion, after bringing it from Obed-edom's house. It 
 remained there all his reign for thirty years, till the temple of 
 Solomon was built, whereas the "tabernacle of the congregation" 
 remained at Gibeon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:3">2Ch 1:3</A>),

 where the priests ministered in sacrifices

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:39">1Ch 16:39</A>).

 Song and praise was the service of David's attendants before the ark 
 (Asaph, &c.): a type of the gospel separation between the sacrificial 
 service (<I>Messiah's</I> priesthood now <I>in heaven</I>) and the 
 access of <I>believers on earth</I> to the presence of God, apart from 
 the former (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:12-17,1Ch+16:37-39,2Ch+1:3">2Sa 6:12-17;
 1Ch 16:37-39; 
 2Ch 1:3</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>breaches thereof</B>--literally, "of them," that is, of the <I>whole</I> nation, Israel as well as Judah.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>as in .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. days of old</B>--as it was formerly in the days of David and
 Solomon, when the kingdom was in its full extent and undivided.</P>

 <A NAME="Am9_12"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>12. That they may possess .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. remnant of Edom, and of all the
 heathen</B>--"Edom," the bitter foe, though the brother, of Israel;
 therefore to be punished 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+1:11,12">Am 1:11, 12</A>),

 Israel shall be lord of the "remnant" of Edom left after the punishment 
 of the latter. James quotes it, "That <I>the residue of men</I> might 
 <I>seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles,</I>" &c. For "all the 
 heathen" nations stand on the same footing as <I>Edom:</I> Edom is the 
 representative of them all. The <I>residue</I> or <I>remnant</I> in 
 both cases expresses those left after great antecedent calamities

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:27,Zec+14:16">Ro 9:27;
 Zec 14:16</A>).

 Here the conversion of "<I>all</I> nations" (of which the earnest was
 given in James's time) is represented as only to be realized on the 
 re-establishment of the theocracy under Messiah, the Heir of the throne 
 of David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:11">Am 9:11</A>).

 The possession of the heathen nations by Israel is to be spiritual, the 
 latter being the ministers to the former for their conversion to 
 Messiah, King of the Jews; just as the first conversions of pagans were 
 through the ministry of the apostles, who were Jews. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:3">Isa 54:3</A>,

 "thy seed shall <I>inherit the Gentiles</I>" (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:8,Ro+4:13">Isa 49:8;
 Ro 4:13</A>). 

 A remnant of Edom became Jews under John Hyrcanus, and the rest
 amalgamated with the Arabians, who became Christians subsequently.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>which are called by my name</B>--that is, who belong to Me, whom I
 claim as Mine

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:8">Ps 2:8</A>);

 in the purposes of electing grace, God terms them already <I>called by
 His name.</I> Compare the title, "the children," applied by 
 anticipation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:14">Heb 2:14</A>.

 Hence as an act of sovereign grace, fulfilling His promise, it is 
 spoken of God. Proclaim His title as sovereign, "the Lord that doeth 
 this" ("all these things,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:17">Ac 15:17</A>,
 
 namely, all these and such like acts of sovereign love).</P>

 Such shall be the abundance that the harvest and vintage can hardly be
 gathered before the time for preparing for the next crop shall come. 
 Instead of the greater part of the year being spent in war, the whole 
 shall be spent in sowing and reaping the fruits of earth. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:21-23">Isa 65:21-23</A>,
 
 as to the same period.
