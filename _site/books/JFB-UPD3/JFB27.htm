 D<FONT SIZE=-1>ANIEL,</FONT> that is, "God is my judge"; probably of the blood royal
 (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:3,1Ch+3:1">Da 1:3,
 with 1Ch 3:1</A>,

 where <I>a son of David</I> is named so). Jerusalem may have been his
 birthplace (though

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:24">Da 9:24</A>,

 "thy holy city," does not <I>necessarily</I> imply this). He was 
 carried to Babylon among the Hebrew captives brought thither by 
 Nebuchadnezzar at the first deportation in the fourth year of 
 Jehoiakim. As he and his three companions are called

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:4">Da 1:4</A>)

 "children," he cannot have been more than about twelve years old when 
 put in training, according to Eastern etiquette, to be a courtier

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:3,6">Da 1:3, 6</A>).

 He then received a new name, by which it was usual to mark a change in 
 one's condition

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:34,24:17,Ezr+5:14,Es+2:7">2Ki 23:34; 24:17;
 Ezr 5:14; 
 Es 2:7</A>), 

 Belteshazzar, that is, "a prince favored by Bel"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:7">Da 1:7</A>).

 His piety and wisdom were proverbial among his countrymen at an early 
 period; probably owing to that noble proof he gave of faithfulness, 
 combined with wisdom, in abstaining from the food sent to him from the 
 king's table, as being polluted by the idolatries usual at heathen 
 banquets

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:8-16">Da 1:8-16</A>).

 Hence Ezekiel's reference to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:14,20,28:3">Eze 14:14, 20; 28:3</A>)

 is precisely of that kind we should expect; a coincidence which must be
 undesigned. Ezekiel refers to him not as a <I>writer,</I> but as 
 exhibiting a character righteous and wise in discerning secrets, in 
 those circumstances now found in his book, which are <I>earlier</I> 
 than the time when Ezekiel wrote. As Joseph rose in Egypt by 
 interpreting Pharaoh's dreams, so Daniel, by interpreting 
 Nebuchadnezzar's, was promoted to be governor of Babylonia, and 
 president of the Magian priest-caste. Under Evil-merodach, 
 Nebuchadnezzar's successor, as a change of officers often attends the 
 accession of a new king, Daniel seems to have had a lower post, which 
 led him occasionally to be away from Babylon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:2,27">Da 8:2, 27</A>).

 Again he came into note when he read the mystic writing of Belshazzar's 
 doom on the wall on the night of that monarch's impious feast. B<FONT
 SIZE=-1>EROSUS</FONT> calls the last Babylonian king Nabonidus and says 
 he was not killed, but had an honorable abode in Carmania assigned to 
 him, after having surrendered voluntarily in Borsippa. R<FONT
 SIZE=-1>AWLINSON</FONT> has cleared up the discrepancy from the Nineveh 
 inscription. Belshazzar was joint king with his father, Evil-merodach 
 or Nabonidus (called Minus in the inscriptions), to whom he was 
 subordinate. He shut himself up in Babylon, while the other king took 
 refuge elsewhere, namely, in Borsippa. B<FONT SIZE=-1>EROSUS</FONT> 
 gives the Chaldean account, which suppresses all about Belshazzar, as 
 being to the national dishonor. Had Daniel been a <I>late</I> book, he 
 would no doubt have taken up the later account of B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>EROSUS</FONT>. If he gave a history differing from that current 
 in Babylonia, the Jews of that region would not have received it as 
 true. Darius the Mede, or Cyaxares II, succeeded and reigned two years. 
 The mention of this monarch's reign, almost unknown to profane history 
 (being eclipsed by the splendor of Cyrus) is an incidental proof that 
 Daniel wrote as a contemporary historian of events which he knew, and 
 did not borrow from others. In the third year of Cyrus he saw the 
 visions (the tenth through twelfth chapters) relating to his people 
 down to the latest days and the coming resurrection. He must have been 
 about eighty-four years old at this time. Tradition represents Daniel 
 as having died and been buried at Shushan. Though his advanced age did 
 not allow him to be among those who returned to Palestine, yet he never 
 ceased to have his people's interests nearest to his heart

 A<FONT SIZE=-1>UTHENTICITY OF THE</FONT>
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>OOK OF</FONT>
 D<FONT SIZE=-1>ANIEL.</FONT>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:1,28,8:2,9:2,10:1,2,12:4,5">Da 7:1, 28;
 8:2; 9:2; 10:1, 2; 12:4, 5</A>,

 testify that it was composed by Daniel himself. He does not mention
 himself in the first six chapters, which are <I>historical;</I> for in 
 these it is not the author, but the <I>events</I> which are the 
 prominent point. In the last six, which are <I>prophetical,</I> the 
 author makes himself known, for here it was needed, prophecy being a 
 revelation of <I>words</I> to particular men. It holds a third rank in 
 the <I>Hebrew</I> canon: not among <I>the prophets,</I> but in the 
 Hagiographa (Chetubim), between Esther and Ezra, books like it relating 
 to the captivity; because he did not strictly belong to those who held 
 exclusively the <I>profession</I> of "prophets" in the theocracy, but 
 was rather a "seer," having the <I>gift,</I> but not the <I>office</I> 
 of prophet. Were the book an interpolated one, it doubtless would have 
 been placed among the prophets. Its present position is a proof of its 
 genuineness, as it was <I>deliberately</I> put in a position different 
 from that where most would expect to find it. Placed between Esther, 
 and Ezra and Nehemiah, it separated the historical books of the time 
 after the captivity. Thus, Daniel was, as B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT> 
 calls him, the politician, chronologer, and historian among the 
 prophets. The Psalms also, though many are prophetical, are ranked with 
 the Hagiographa, not with the prophets; and the Revelation of John is 
 separated from his Epistles, as Daniel is from the Old Testament 
 prophets. Instead of writing in the midst of the covenant people, and 
 making them the foreground of his picture, he writes in a heathen 
 court, the world kingdoms occupying the foreground, and the kingdom of 
 God, though ultimately made the most significant, the background. His 
 peculiar position in the heathen court is reflected in his peculiar 
 position in the canon. As the "prophets" in the Old Testament, so the 
 epistles of the apostles in the New Testament were written by divinely 
 commissioned persons for their contemporaries. But Daniel and John
 were not in immediate contact with the congregation, but isolated and 
 alone with God, the one in a heathen court, the other on a lonely isle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:9">Re 1:9</A>).

 P<FONT SIZE=-1>ORPHYRY</FONT>, the assailant of Christianity in the
 third century, asserted that the Book of Daniel was a forgery of the 
 time of the Maccabees (170-164 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>), a time when 
 <I>confessedly</I> there were no prophets, written after the events as 
 to Antiochus Epiphanes, which it professes to <I>foretell;</I> so 
 accurate are the details. A conclusive proof of Daniel's inspiration, 
 if his prophecies can be shown to have been <I>before</I> the events. 
 Now we know, from J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT> [<I>Antiquities,</I> 
 10.11.7], that the Jews in Christ's days recognized Daniel as in the 
 canon. Zechariah, Ezra, and Nehemiah, centuries before Antiochus, refer 
 to it. Jesus refers to it in His characteristic designation, "Son of 
 man,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:30">Mt 24:30</A>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:13">Da 7:13</A>);
 
 also expressly by name, and as a "prophet," in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:15">Mt 24:15</A>
 
 (compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:21,Da+12:1">Mt 24:21,
 with Da 12:1</A>,

 &c.); and in the moment that decided His life

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:64">Mt 26:64</A>)

 or death, when the high priest adjured him by the living God. Also, in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:19-26">Lu 1:19-26</A>,

 "Gabriel" is mentioned, whose name occurs nowhere else in Scripture, 
 save in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:16,9:21">Da 8:16; 9:21</A>.

 Besides the references to it in Revelation, Paul confirms the 
 prophetical part of it, as to the blasphemous king

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:8,25,11:36">Da 7:8, 25; 11:36</A>),

 in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:2,2Th+2:3,4">1Co 6:2;
 2Th 2:3, 4</A>; 

 the narrative part, as to the miraculous deliverances from "the lions"
 and "the fire," in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:3,3,34">Heb 11:33, 34</A>.

 Thus the book is expressly attested by the New Testament on the three
 points made the stumbling-block of neologists--the predictions, the
 narratives of miracles, and the manifestations of angels. An objection
 has been stated to the unity of the book, namely, that Jesus quotes no
 part of the first half of Daniel. But

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:44">Mt 21:44</A>
 
 would be an enigma if it were not a reference to the "stone that smote
 the image"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:34,35,44,45">Da 2:34, 35, 44, 45</A>).

 Thus the New Testament sanctions the second, third, sixth, seventh, and 
 eleventh chapters. The design of the miracles in the heathen courts 
 where Daniel was, as of those of Moses in Egypt, was to lead the world 
 power, which seemed to be victorious over the theocracy, to see the 
 essential inner superiority of the seemingly fallen kingdom of God to 
 itself, and to show prostrate Israel that the power of God was the same 
 as of old in Egypt. The first book of Maccabees (compare <U>1 Maccabees
 1:24; 9:27, 40</U>, with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:1,Da+11:26">Da 12:1; 11:26</A>,

 of the <I>Septuagint</I>) refers to Daniel as an accredited book, and
 even refers to the <I>Septuagint</I> Alexandrian version of it. The 
 fact of Daniel having a place in the <I>Septuagint</I> shows it was 
 received by the Jews at large prior to the Maccabean times. The 
 <I>Septuagint</I> version so arbitrarily deviated from the 
 <I>Hebrew</I> Daniel, that Theodotius' version was substituted for it 
 in the early Christian Church. J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>
 [<I>Antiquities,</I> 11.8.5] mentions that Alexander the Great had 
 designed to punish the Jews for their fidelity to Darius, but that 
 Jaddua (332 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>), the high priest, met him at the
 head of a procession and averted his wrath by showing him Daniel's 
 prophecy that a Grecian monarch should overthrow Persia. Certain it is, 
 Alexander favored the Jews, and J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS'</FONT> 
 statement gives an explanation of the fact; at least it shows that the 
 Jews in J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS'</FONT> days <I>believed</I> that Daniel 
 was extant in Alexander's days, long before the Maccabees. With Jaddua 
 (high priest from 341-322 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>) the Old Testament 
 history ends

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+12:11">Ne 12:11</A>).

 (The register of the priests and Levites was not written by Nehemiah, 
 who died about 400 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, but was inserted with 
 divine sanction by the collectors of the canon subsequently.) An 
 objection to Daniel's authenticity has been rested on a few 
 <I>Greek</I> words found in it. But these are mostly names of Greek
 musical instruments, which were imported by Greece from the East, 
 rather than vice versa. Some of the words are derived from the common 
 Indo-Germanic stock of both <I>Greek</I> and <I>Chaldee:</I> hence 
 their appearance in both tongues. And one or two may have come through 
 the Greeks of Asia Minor to the <I>Chaldee.</I> The fact that from the 
 fourth verse of the second chapter to the end of the seventh, the 
 language is <I>Chaldee,</I> but the rest <I>Hebrew,</I> is not an 
 argument against, but for, its authenticity. So in Ezra the two 
 languages are found. The work, if that of one author, must have been 
 composed by someone in the circumstances of Daniel, that is, by one 
 familiar with both languages. No native-born Hebrew who had not lived 
 in Chaldea would know <I>Chaldee</I> so well as to use it with the same 
 idiomatic ease as his native tongue; the very impurities in Daniel's 
 use of both are just such as were <I>natural</I> to one in his 
 circumstances, but <I>unnatural</I> to one in a later age, or to one 
 not half Hebrew, half Chaldean in residence as Daniel was. Those parts 
 of Daniel which concern the whole world are mostly <I>Chaldee,</I> then 
 the language of the world empire. So <I>Greek</I> was made the language
 of the New Testament, which was designed for the whole world. Those
 affecting the Jews, mostly <I>Hebrew;</I> and this not so impure as
 that of Ezekiel. His <I>Chaldee</I> is a mixture of <I>Hebrew</I> and
 <I>Aramaic.</I> Two predictions alone are enough to prove to us that
 Daniel was a true prophet. (1) That his prophecies reach beyond
 Antiochus; namely, he foretells the rise of <I>the four great
 monarchies,</I> Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome (the last not
 being in Daniel's time known beyond the precincts of Italy, or rather
 of Latium), and that no other earthly kingdom would subvert the fourth,
 but that it would divide into parts. All this has come to pass. No
 <I>fifth</I> great earthly monarchy has arisen, though often attempted,
 as by Charlemagne, Charles V, and Napoleon. (2) The time of Messiah's
 advent, as dated from a certain decree, His being cut off, and the
 destruction of the city. "He who denies Daniel's prophecies," says
 S<FONT SIZE=-1>IR</FONT> I<FONT SIZE=-1>SAAC</FONT> N<FONT
 SIZE=-1>EWTON</FONT>, "undermines Christianity, which is founded on 
 Daniel's prophecies concerning Christ."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 C<FONT SIZE=-1>HARACTERISTICS OF</FONT>
 D<FONT SIZE=-1>ANIEL.</FONT> The <I>vision mode of revelation</I> is the
 exception in other prophets, the rule in Daniel. In Zechariah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:1-6:15">Zec 1:1-6:15</A>),

 who lived after Daniel, the same mode appears, but the other form from 
 the seventh chapter to the end. The Revelation of St. John alone is 
 perfectly parallel to Daniel, which may be called the Old Testament 
 Apocalypse. In the <I>contents</I> too there is the difference above 
 noticed, that he views the kingdom of God from the standpoint of the 
 world kingdoms, the development of which is his great subject. This 
 mode of viewing it was appropriate to his own position in a heathen 
 court, and to the relation of subjection in which the covenant-people 
 then stood to the world powers. No longer are single powers of the 
 world incidentally introduced, but the <I>universal monarchies</I> are 
 the chief theme, in which the worldly principle, opposed to the kingdom 
 of God, manifests itself fully. The near and distant are not seen in 
 the same perspective, as by the other prophets, who viewed the whole 
 future from the eschatological point; but in Daniel the historical 
 <I>details</I> are given of that development of the world powers which 
 must precede the advent of the kingdom [A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>UBERLEN</FONT>].</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 S<FONT SIZE=-1>IGNIFICANCE OF THE</FONT>
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>ABYLONIAN</FONT>
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>APTIVITY.</FONT> The exile is the historical basis of
 Daniel's prophecies, as Daniel implies in the first chapter, which 
 commences with the beginning, and ends with the termination, of the 
 captivity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:1,21">Da 1:1, 21</A>;

 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:1,2">Da 9:1, 2</A>).

 A new stage in the theocracy begins with the captivity. Nebuchadnezzar
 made three incursions into Judah. The first under Jehoiakim (606 <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>), in which Daniel was carried away, subjected the 
 theocracy to the Babylonian world power. The second (598 <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>) was that in which Jehoiachin and Ezekiel were 
 carried away. In the third (588 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>), 
 Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Jerusalem and carried away Zedekiah.
 Originally, Abraham was raised out of the "sea"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:2">Da 7:2</A>)

 of the nations, as an island holy to God, and his seed chosen as God's 
 mediator of His revelations of love to mankind. Under David and 
 Solomon, the theocracy, as opposed to the heathen power, attained its 
 climax in the Old Testament, not only being independent, but lord of 
 the surrounding nations; so that the period of these two kings was 
 henceforth made the type of the Messianic. But when God's people, 
 instead of resting on Him, seek alliance with the world power, that 
 very power is made the instrument of their chastisement. So Ephraim 
 (722 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>) fell by Assyria; and Judah also, drawn 
 into the sphere of the world's movements from the time of Ahaz, who 
 sought Assyrian help (740 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:1-25">Isa 7:1-25</A>)

 at last fell by Babylon, and thenceforth has been more or less 
 dependent on the world monarchies, and so, till Messiah, was favored 
 with no revelations from the time of Malachi (four hundred years). 
 Thus, from the beginning of the exile, the theocracy, in the strict 
 sense, ceased on earth; the rule of the world powers superseding it. 
 But God's covenant with Israel remains firm

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:29">Ro 11:29</A>);

 therefore, a period of blessing under Messiah's kingdom is <I>now</I> 
 foretold as about to follow their long chastisement. The exile thus is 
 the turning point in the history of the theocracy, which R<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OOS</FONT> thus divides: (1) From Adam to the exodus out of 
 Egypt. (2) From the exodus to the beginning of the Babylonian 
 captivity. (3) From the captivity to the millennium. (4) From the 
 millennium to the end of the world. <I>The position of Daniel</I> in 
 the Babylonian court was in unison with the altered relations of the 
 theocracy and the world power, which new relation was to be the theme 
 of his prophecy. Earlier prophets, from the standpoint of Israel, 
 treated of Israel in its relation to the world powers; Daniel, from 
 Babylon, the center of the then world power, treats of the world powers 
 in their relation to Israel. His seventy years' residence in Babylon, 
 and his high official position there, gave him an insight into the 
 world's politics, fitting him to be the recipient of political 
 revelations; while his spiritual experiences, gained through 
 Nebuchadnezzar's humiliation, Belshazzar's downfall, and the rapid 
 decay of the Babylonian empire itself, as well as the miraculous 
 deliverances of himself and his friends (the third through sixth 
 chapters), all fitted him for regarding things from the spiritual 
 standpoint, from which the world's power appears transient, but the 
 glory of God's kingdom eternal. As his political position was the 
 <I>body,</I> the school of magicians in which he had studied for three 
 years

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:4,5">Da 1:4, 5</A>)

 was the <I>soul;</I> and his mind strong in faith and nourished by the 
 earlier prophecies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:2">Da 9:2</A>),

 the <I>spirit</I> of his prophecy, which only waited for the spirit of 
 revelation from above to kindle it. So God fits His organs for their 
 work. A<FONT SIZE=-1>UBERLEN</FONT> compares Daniel to Joseph: the one
 at the beginning, the other at the end of the Jewish history of 
 revelation; both representatives of God and His people at heathen 
 courts; both interpreters of the dim presentiments of truth, expressed 
 in God-sent dreams, and therefore raised to honor by the powers of the 
 world: so representing Israel's calling to be a royal priesthood among 
 the nations; and types of Christ, the true Israel, and of Israel's 
 destination to be a light to lighten the whole Gentile world, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:12,15">Ro 11:12, 15</A>

 foretells. As Achilles at the beginning, and Alexander at the end, of 
 Grecian history are the mirrors of the whole life of the Hellenic 
 people, so Joseph and Daniel of Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 C<FONT SIZE=-1>ONTENTS OF THE</FONT>
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>OOK.</FONT> Historical and biographical
 <I>introduction</I> in <I>the first chapter.</I> Daniel, a captive
 exile, is representative of his nation in its servitude and exile:
 while his heavenly insight into dreams, far exceeding that of the magi,
 represents the divine superiority of the covenant-people over their
 heathen lords. The high dignities, even in the world, which he thereby
 attained, typify the giving of the earth-kingdom at last "to the people
 of the saints of the Most High"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:27">Da 7:27</A>).

 Thus Daniel's personal history is the typical foundation of his
 prophecy. The prophets had to experience in themselves, and in their 
 age, something of what they foretold about future times; just as David 
 felt much of Christ's sufferings in his own person (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:2-9,10,11,2:3">Ho 1:2-9, 10, 11; 2:3</A>).

 So

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:1-17">Jon 1:1-17</A>,

 &c. [R<FONT SIZE=-1>OOS</FONT>]. Hence biographical notices of
 Daniel and his friends are inserted among his prophecies. The second 
 through twelfth chapters contain the substance of the book, and consist 
 of <I>two parts.</I> The first (the second through seventh chapters) 
 represents the development of the world powers, viewed from a 
 historical point. The second (the eighth through twelfth chapters), 
 their development in relation to Israel, especially in the future 
 preceding Christ's first advent, foretold in the ninth chapter. But 
 prophecy looks beyond the immediate future to the complete fulfilment 
 in the last days, since the individual parts in the organic history of 
 salvation cannot be understood except in connection with the whole. 
 Also Israel looked forward to the Messianic time, not only for 
 spiritual salvation, but also for the visible restoration of the 
 kingdom which even now we too expect. The prophecy which they needed 
 ought therefore to comprise both, and so much of the history of the 
 world as would elapse before the final consummation. The period of 
 Daniel's prophecies, therefore, is that from the downfall of the 
 theocracy at the captivity till its final restoration, yet future--the 
 period of the dominion of the world powers, not set aside by Christ's 
 first coming

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:36">Joh 18:36</A>;

 for, to have taken the earth-kingdom <I>then,</I> would have been to 
 take it from Satan's hands,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:8-10">Mt 4:8-10</A>),
 
 but to be superseded by His universal and everlasting kingdom at His
 second coming 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:15">Re 11:15</A>).

 Thus the general survey of the development and final destiny of the 
 world powers (the second through seventh chapters) fittingly precedes 
 the disclosures as to the immediate future (the eighth through twelfth 
 chapters). Daniel marks the division by writing the first part in 
 <I>Chaldee,</I> and the second, and the introduction, in <I>Hebrew;</I> 
 the former, referring to the powers of the world, in the language of 
 the then dominant world power under which he lived; the latter, 
 relating to the people of God, in their own language. An interpolator 
 in a later age would have used <I>Hebrew,</I> the language of the 
 ancient prophets throughout, or if anywhere <I>Aramaic,</I> so as to be 
 understood by his contemporaries, he would have used it in the second 
 rather than in the first part as having a more immediate reference to 
 his own times [A<FONT SIZE=-1>UBERLEN</FONT>].</P>

 "the <I>fourth</I> year; Jehoiakim came to the throne at the <I>end</I> 
 of the year, which Jeremiah reckons as the <I>first</I> year, but which 
 Daniel leaves out of count, being an incomplete year: thus, in 
 Jeremiah, it is "the <I>fourth</I> year"; in Daniel, "the <I>third</I>" 
 [J<FONT SIZE=-1>AHN</FONT>]. However, Jeremiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:1,46:2">Jer 25:1; 46:2</A>)

 merely says, the fourth year of Jehoiakim coincided with the first of
 Nebuchadnezzar, when the latter <I>conquered the Egyptians at

 place in the end of the third year of Jehoiakim, shortly <I>before</I> 
 the battle of Carchemish [F<FONT SIZE=-1>AIRBAIRN</FONT>]. 
 Nebuchadnezzar took away the captives as hostages for the submission of 
 the Hebrews. <I>Historical</I> Scripture gives no positive account of 
 this first deportation, with which the Babylonian captivity, that is, 
 Judah's subjection to Babylon for seventy years

 Babylon," and that he "carried off the vessels of the house of the 
 Lord" thither. But Jehoiakim died at Jerusalem, before the conqueror's 
 intention as to him was carried into effect

 leader in the "purpose" (the word implies a <I>decided</I> resolution) 
 to abstain from defilement, thus manifesting a character already formed
 for prophetical functions. The other three youths, no doubt, shared in
 his purpose. It was the custom to throw a small part of the viands and
 wine upon the earth, as an initiatory offering to the gods, so as to
 consecrate to them the whole entertainment (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:38">De 32:38</A>).

 To have partaken of such a feast would have been to sanction idolatry,
 and was forbidden even after the legal distinction of clean and unclean 
 meats was done away

 Thus the faith of these youths was made instrumental in overruling the
 evil foretold against the Jews

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+4:13,Ho+9:3">Eze 4:13;

 to the glory of God. Daniel and his three friends, says A<FONT

 Moses, Daniel "chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of 
 God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season"

 <B>1. second year of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Nebuchadnezzar</B>--
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:5">Da 1:5</A>

 shows that "three years" had elapsed since Nebuchadnezzar had taken 
 Jerusalem. The solution of this difficulty is: Nebuchadnezzar first 
 ruled as subordinate to his father Nabopolassar, to which time the 
 first chapter refers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:1">Da 1:1</A>);

 whereas "the second year" in the second chapter is dated from his sole 
 sovereignty. The very difficulty is a proof of genuineness; all was 
 clear to the writer and the original readers from <I>their</I> 
 knowledge of the circumstances, and so he adds no explanation. A
 forger would not <I>introduce</I> difficulties; the author did not 
 <I>then</I> see any difficulty in the case. Nebuchadnezzar is called 
 "king"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:1">Da 1:1</A>),

 <I>by anticipation.</I> Before he left Judea, he became actual king by 
 the death of his father, and the Jews always called him "king," as 
 commander of the invading army.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>dreams</B>--It is significant that not to Daniel, but to the then world
 ruler, Nebuchadnezzar, the dream is vouchsafed. It was from the first of
 its representatives who had conquered the theocracy, that the world
 power was to learn its doom, as about to be in its turn subdued, and for
 ever by the kingdom of God. As this vision opens, so that in the seventh
 chapter developing the same truth more fully, closes the first part.
 Nebuchadnezzar, as vicegerent of God 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:37">Da 2:37</A>;
 
 compare

 Eze 28:12-15; 
 Isa 44:28; 45:1; 
 Ro 13:1</A>), 

 is honored with the revelation in the form of a dream, the appropriate
 form to one outside the kingdom of God. So in the cases of Abimelech, 
 Pharaoh, &c.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:3,41:1-7">Ge 20:3; 41:1-7</A>),

 especially as the heathen attached such importance to dreams. Still it
 is not he, but an Israelite, who interprets it. Heathendom is passive,
 Israel active, in divine things, so that the glory redounds to "the God 
 of heaven."</P>

 the unprecedented greatness to which his power had attained 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:29">Da 2:29</A>)

 The interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream was a preparatory 
 education to Daniel himself. By gradual steps, each revelation 
 preparing him for the succeeding one, God fitted him for disclosures 
 becoming more and more special. In the second and fourth chapters he is 
 but an interpreter of Nebuchadnezzar's dreams; then he has a dream 
 himself, but it is only a vision in a dream of the night

 Rome, with its Germano-Slavonic offshoots, the legs of iron and feet of
 iron and clay, the fourth still existing. Those kingdoms only are
 mentioned which stand in some relation to the kingdom of God; of these
 none is left out; the final establishment of that kingdom is the aim of
 His moral government of the world. The colossus of metal stands on weak

 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ESIOD</FONT>, two hundred years before Daniel, had
 compared the four ages to the four metals in the same order; the idea
 is sanctioned here by Holy Writ. It was perhaps one of those fragments 
 of revelation among the heathen derived from the tradition as to the 
 fall of man. The metals lessen in <I>specific gravity,</I> as they 
 downwards; silver is not so heavy as gold, brass not so heavy as

 As the fourth kingdom, or Rome, was represented in a twofold state, 
 first strong, with legs of iron, then weak, with toes part of iron, 
 part of clay; so this fifth kingdom, that of Christ, is seen 
 conversely, first insignificant as a "stone," then as a "mountain" 
 filling the whole earth. The ten toes are the ten lesser kingdoms into 
 which the Roman kingdom was finally to be divided; this tenfold 
 division here hinted at is not specified in detail till the seventh 
 chapter. The fourth empire originally was bounded in Europe pretty 
 nearly by the line of the Rhine and Danube; in Asia by the Euphrates. 
 In Africa it possessed Egypt and the north coasts; South Britain and 
 Dacia were afterwards added but were ultimately resigned. The ten
 kingdoms do not arise until a deterioration (by mixing clay with the 
 iron) has taken place; they are in existence when Christ comes in 
 glory, and then are broken in pieces. The ten have been sought for in 
 the invading hosts of the fifth and sixth century. But though many 
 provinces were then severed from Rome as independent kingdoms, the 
 dignity of emperor still continued, and the imperial power was 
 exercised over Rome itself for two centuries. So the tenfold divisions 
 cannot be looked for before <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 731. But the East 
 is not to be excluded, five toes being on each foot. Thus no point of 
 time before the overthrow of the empire at the taking of Constantinople 
 by the Turks (<FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 1453) can be assigned for the 
 division. It seems, therefore, that the definite ten will be the 
 ultimate development of the Roman empire just before the rise of 
 Antichrist, who shall overthrow three of the kings, and, after three 
 and a half years, he himself be overthrown by Christ in person. Some
 of the ten kingdoms will, doubtless, be the same as some past and 
 present divisions of the old Roman empire, which accounts for the 
 <I>continuity</I> of the connection between the toes and legs, a gap of 
 centuries not being interposed, as is objected by opponents of the 
 futurist theory. The lists of the ten made by the latter differ from 
 one another; and they are set aside by the fact that they include 
 countries which were never Roman, and exclude one whole section of the 
 empire, namely, the East [T<FONT SIZE=-1>REGELLES</FONT>].

 Between the vision of Nebuchadnezzar in the second chapter and that of 
 Daniel in the seventh, four narratives of Daniel's and his friends' 
 personal history are introduced. As the second and seventh chapters go 
 together, so the third and sixth chapters (the deliverance from the 
 lions' den), and the fourth and fifth chapters. Of these last two 
 pairs, the former shows God's nearness to save His saints when faithful 
 to Him, at the very time they seem to be crushed by the world power. 
 The second pair shows, in the case of the two kings of the first 
 monarchy, how God can suddenly humble the world power in the height of 
 its insolence. The latter advances from mere self-glorification, in the 
 fourth chapter, to open opposition to God in the fifth. Nebuchadnezzar 
 demands homage to be paid to his image

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:1-6">Da 3:1-6</A>),

 and boasts of his power

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:1-18">Da 4:1-18</A>).

 But Belshazzar goes further, blaspheming God by polluting His holy 
 vessels. There is a similar progression in the conduct of God's people. 
 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego refuse <I>positive</I> homage to the 
 image of the world power

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:12">Da 3:12</A>);

 Daniel will not yield it even a <I>negative</I> homage, by omitting for 
 a time the worship of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:10">Da 6:10</A>).

 Jehovah's power manifested for the saints against the world in 
 individual histories (the third through sixth chapters) is exhibited in 
 the second and seventh chapters, in world-wide prophetical pictures; 
 the former heightening the effect of the latter. The miracles wrought 
 in behalf of Daniel and his friends were a manifestation of God's glory 
 in Daniel's person, as the representative of the theocracy before the 
 Babylonian king, who deemed himself almighty, at a time when God could 
 not manifest it in His people as a body. They tended also to secure, by 
 their impressive character, that respect for the covenant-people on the 
 part of the heathen powers which issued in Cyrus' decree, not only 
 restoring the Jews, but ascribing honor to the God of heaven, and 
 commanding the building of the temple

 <B>1. image</B>--Nebuchadnezzar's confession of God did not prevent him 
 being a worshipper of idols, besides. Ancient idolaters thought that 
 each nation had its own gods, and that, in addition to these, foreign 
 gods might be worshipped. The Jewish religion was the only exclusive 
 one that claimed <I>all</I> homage for Jehovah as the <I>only</I> true 
 God. Men will in times of trouble confess God, if they are allowed to 
 retain their favorite heart-idols. The image was that of Bel, the 
 Babylonian tutelary god; or rather, Nebuchadnezzar <I>himself,</I> the
 personification and representative of the Babylonian empire, as
 suggested to him by the dream

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:38">Da 2:38</A>),

 "<I>Thou</I> art this head <I>of gold.</I>" The interval between the
 dream and the event here was about nineteen years. Nebuchadnezzar had
 just returned from finishing the Jewish and Syrian wars, the spoils of 
 which would furnish the means of rearing such a colossal statue [P<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>RIDEAUX</FONT>]. The colossal size makes it likely that the
 frame was wood, overlaid with gold. The "height," sixty cubits, is so 
 out of proportion with the "breadth," exceeding it ten times, that it 
 seems best to suppose the <I>thickness</I> from breast to back to be 
 intended, which is exactly the right proportion of a well-formed man 
 [A<FONT SIZE=-1>UGUSTINE</FONT>, <I>The City of God,</I> 15.26].
 P<FONT SIZE=-1>RIDEAUX</FONT> thinks the sixty cubits refer to <I>the 
 image and pedestal together,</I> the image being twenty-seven cubits 
 high, or forty feet, the pedestal thirty-three cubits, or fifty feet. 
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ERODOTUS</FONT> [1.183] confirms this by mentioning a 
 <I>similar</I> image, forty <I>feet high,</I> in the temple of Belus at 
 Babylon. It was not the <I>same</I> image, for the one here was on the 
 plain of Dura, not in the city.</P>

 to all recusants, representing such refusal of homage as an act of
 treason to Nebuchadnezzar as civil and religious "head" of the empire.
 So the edict under Darius 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:7-9">Da 6:7-9</A>)

 was aimed against the Jews by those jealous of Daniel's influence. The

 The <I>Septuagint</I> and <I>Vulgate</I> translate not so well, 
 "redeem," which is made an argument for Rome's doctrine of the 
 expiation of sins by meritorious works. Even translate it so, it can 
 only mean; Repent and show the reality of thy repentance by works of 
 justice and charity (compare

 Persian account. B<FONT SIZE=-1>EROSUS</FONT> and A<FONT

 Nebuchadnezzar added much to the old city, built a splendid palace and 
 city walls. H<FONT SIZE=-1>ERODOTUS</FONT>, the so-called "father of
 history," does not even mention Nebuchadnezzar. (Nitocris, to whom he 
 attributes the beautifying of Babylon, seems to have been 
 Nebuchadnezzar's wife). Hence infidels have doubted the Scripture 
 account. But the latter is proved by thousands of bricks on the plain,
 the inscriptions of which have been deciphered, each marked
 "Nebuchadnezzar, the son of Nabopolassar." "Built," that is, restored
 and enlarged

 the effect of annihilating the whole interval, so that, when reason 
 returns, the patient remembers only the event that immediately preceded

 <B>1. Belshazzar</B>--R<FONT SIZE=-1>AWLINSON</FONT>, from the Assyrian inscriptions, has
 explained the seeming discrepancy between Daniel and the heathen
 historians of Babylon, B<FONT SIZE=-1>EROSUS</FONT> and
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>BYDENUS</FONT>, who say the last king
 (Nabonidus) surrendered in Borsippa, after Babylon was taken, and had an
 honorable abode in Caramania assigned to him.
 <I>Belshazzar was joint king with his father</I> (called <I>Minus</I> in the
 inscriptions), <I>but subordinate to him;</I> hence the <I>Babylonian</I> account suppresses the facts which cast discredit on Babylon, namely,
 that Belshazzar shut himself up in that city and fell at its capture;
 while it records the surrender of the principal king in Borsippa
 (see my

 <A HREF="#Introduction"><I>Introduction</I></A> 

 to Daniel). The heathen X<FONT SIZE=-1>ENOPHON'S</FONT> description of 
 Belshazzar accords with Daniel's; he calls him "impious," and 
 illustrates his cruelty by mentioning that he killed one of his nobles, 
 merely because, in hunting, the noble struck down the game before him; 
 and unmanned a courtier, Gadates, at a banquet, because one of the 
 king's concubines praised him as handsome. Daniel shows none of the 
 sympathy for him which he had for Nebuchadnezzar. X<FONT
 SIZE=-1>ENOPHON</FONT> confirms Daniel as to Belshazzar's end. W<FONT
 SIZE=-1>INER</FONT> explains the "shazzar" in the name as meaning 
 "fire."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>made .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. feast</B>--heaven-sent infatuation when his city was at the
 time being besieged by Cyrus. The fortifications and abundant provisions
 in the city made the king despise the besiegers. It was a festival day
 among the Babylonians [X<FONT SIZE=-1>ENOPHON</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>drank .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. before the thousand</B>--The king, on this extraordinary
 occasion, departed from his usual way of feasting apart from his nobles
 (compare

 <B>2. whiles he tasted the wine</B>--While under the effects of wine, men

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>his father Nebuchadnezzar</B>--that is, his forefather. So "Jesus
 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the <I>son</I> of David, the <I>son</I> of Abraham"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:1">Mt 1:1</A>).

 Daniel does not say that the other kings mentioned in other writers did
 not reign between Belshazzar and Nebuchadnezzar, namely, Evil-merodach

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:31">Jer 52:31</A>),

 Neriglissar, his brother-in-law, and Laborasoarchod (nine months). 
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>EROSUS</FONT> makes Nabonidus, the last king, to have 
 been <I>one of the people,</I> raised to the throne by an insurrection. 
 As the inscriptions show that Belshazzar was distinct from, and joint 
 king with, him, this is not at variance with Daniel, whose statement 
 that Belshazzar was <I>son</I> (grandson) of <I>Nebuchadnezzar</I> is 
 corroborated by Jeremiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:7">Jer 27:7</A>).

 Their joint, yet independent, testimony, as contemporaries, and having 
 the best means of information, is more trustworthy than any of the 
 heathen historians, if there were a discrepancy. Evil-merodach, son of 
 Nebuchadnezzar (according to B<FONT SIZE=-1>EROSUS</FONT>), reigned but 
 a short time (one or two years), having, in consequence of his bad 
 government, been dethroned by a plot of Neriglissar, his sister's 
 husband; hence Daniel does not mention him. At the elevation of 
 Nabonidus as supreme king, Belshazzar, the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar, 
 was doubtless suffered to be subordinate king and successor, in order 
 to conciliate the legitimate party. Thus the seeming discrepancy 
 becomes a confirmation of genuineness when cleared up, for the real 
 harmony must have been undesigned.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>wives .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. concubines</B>--not usually present at feasts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:9-12">Es 1:9-12</A>).

 But the Babylonian court, in its reckless excesses, seems not to have
 been so strict as the Persian. X<FONT SIZE=-1>ENOPHON</FONT> 
 [<I>Cyrop&aelig;dia,</I> 5.2,28] confirms Daniel, representing a feast 
 of Belshazzar where the concubines are present. At the beginning "the 
 lords"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:1">Da 5:1</A>),

 for whom the feast was made, alone seem to have been present; but as 
 the revelry advanced, the women were introduced. Two classes of them 
 are mentioned, those to whom belonged the privileges of "wives," and 
 those strictly concubines

 Godly fidelity which might be expected to bring down vengeance, as in

 Amshaspands before the throne of Ormuzd; hence Mordecai

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:4">Es 3:4</A>)

 refused such homage to Haman, the king's prime minister, as
 inconsistent with what is due to God alone. A weak despot, like Darius, 
 much under the control of his princes, might easily be persuaded that 
 such a decree would test the obedience of the Chaldeans just conquered, 
 and tame their proud spirits. So absolute is the king in the East,
 that he is regarded not merely as the ruler, but the owner, of the 
 people.

 This immutability of the king's commands was peculiar to the Medes and

 representative of Ormuzd; it was not so among the Babylonians.

 <B>Medes and Persians</B>--The order of the names is an undesigned mark of
 genuineness. Cyrus the Persian reigned subordinate to Darius the Mede as
 to dignity, though exercising more real power. After Darius' death, the
 order is "the Persians and Medes"

 This chapter treats of the same subject as the second chapter. But there
 the four kingdoms, and Messiah's final kingdom, were regarded according
 to their <I>external</I> political aspect, but here according to the mind
 of God concerning them, and their <I>moral</I> features. The outward
 political history had been shown in its general features to the world
 ruler, whose position fitted him for receiving such a revelation. But
 God's prophet here receives disclosures as to the characters of the
 powers of the world, in a religious point of view, suited to <I>his</I> position and receptivity. Hence in the second chapter the images are
 taken from the inanimate sphere; in the seventh chapter they are taken
 from the animate. Nebuchadnezzar saw superficially the world power as a
 splendid human figure, and the kingdom of God as a mere stone at the
 first. Daniel sees the world kingdoms in their inner essence as of an
 <I>animal</I> nature lower than human, being estranged from God; and that
 only in the kingdom of God ("the Son of <I>man,</I>" the representative
 man) is the true dignity of man realized. So, as contrasted with
 Nebuchadnezzar's vision, the kingdom of God appears to Daniel,
 <I>from the very first,</I> superior to the world kingdom. For though in
 <I>physical</I> force the beasts excel man, man has essentially
 <I>spiritual</I> powers. Nebuchadnezzar's colossal image represents mankind
 in its own strength, but only the outward man. Daniel sees man
 spiritually degraded to the beast level, led by blind impulses, through
 his alienation from God. It is only from above that the perfect Son of
 man comes, and in His kingdom man attains his true destiny. Compare

 The animal with all its sagacity looks always to the ground, without
 consciousness of relation to God. What elevates man is communion with 
 God, in willing subjection to Him. The moment he tries to exalt himself 
 to independence of God, as did Nebuchadnezzar

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:30">Da 4:30</A>),

 he sinks to the beast's level. Daniel's acquaintance with the animal 
 colossal figures in Babylon and Nineveh was a psychological preparation 
 for his animal visions.

 the "horns" representing <I>power</I>), that is, <I>kingdoms,</I> into 
 which Rome was divided on its incorporation with the Germanic and 
 Slavonic tribes, and again at the Reformation, are thought by many to 
 be here intended. But the variation of the list of the ten, and their 
 ignoring the eastern half of the empire altogether, and the existence 
 of the Papacy <I>before</I> the breaking up of even the <I>Western</I> 
 empire, instead of being the "little horn" springing up <I>after</I> 
 the other ten, are against this view. The Western Roman empire 
 continued till <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 731, and the Eastern, till 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 1453. The ten kingdoms, therefore, prefigured

 The Roman empire did not represent itself as a continuation of
 Alexander's; but the Germanic empire calls itself "the holy Roman
 empire." Napoleon's attempted universal monarchy was avowedly Roman: his
 son was called king of Rome. The czar (<I>C&aelig;sar</I>) also professes to
 represent the eastern half of the Roman empire. The Roman civilization,
 church, language, and law are the chief elements in Germanic
 civilization. But the Romanic element seeks universal empire, while the
 Germanic seeks individualization. Hence the universal monarchies
 attempted by the Papacy, Charlemagne, Charles V, and Napoleon have
 failed, the iron not amalgamating with the clay. In the king symbolized
 by "the little horn," the God-opposing, haughty spirit of the world,
 represented by the fourth monarchy, finds its intensest development.

 Antichrist rising three and a half years before Christ's second advent, 
 having first overthrown three of the ten contemporaneous kingdoms, into 
 which the fourth monarchy, under which we live, shall be finally 
 divided. Popery seems to be <I>a</I> fulfilment of the prophecy in
 many particulars, the Pope claiming to be God on earth and above all

 the serpent's promise was, man's "eyes should be opened," if he would 
 but rebel against God. Antichrist shall consummate the self-apotheosis, 
 begun at the fall, high intellectual culture, independent of God. The 
 metals representing Babylon and Medo-Persia, gold and silver, are more 
 precious than brass and iron, representing Greece and Rome; but the 
 latter metals are more useful to civilization

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:22">Ge 4:22</A>).

 The clay, representing the Germanic element, is the most plastic 
 material. Thus there is a progress in <I>culture;</I> but this is not a 
 progress <I>necessarily</I> in man's truest dignity, namely, union and 
 likeness to God. Nay, it has led him farther from God, to self-reliance 
 and world-love. The beginnings of civilization were among the children 
 of Cain

 Antiochus Epiphanes, the first Antichrist, came from civilized Greece, 
 and loved art. As Hellenic civilization produced the <I>first,</I> so 
 modern civilization under the fourth monarchy will produce the 
 <I>last</I> Antichrist. The "mouth" and "eyes" are those of a man, 
 while the symbol is otherwise brutish, that is, it will assume man's 
 true dignity, namely, wear the guise of the kingdom of God (which comes 
 as the "Son of <I>man</I>" from above), while it is really bestial, 
 namely, severed from God. Antichrist promises the same things as
 Christ, but in an opposite way: a caricature of Christ, offering a 
 regenerated world without the cross. Babylon and Persia in their
 religion had more reverence for things divine than Greece and Rome in 
 the imperial stages of their history. Nebuchadnezzar's human
 <I>heart,</I> given him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:16">Da 4:16</A>)

 on his repentance, contrasts with the human <I>eyes</I> of Antichrist, 
 the pseudo son of man, namely, intellectual culture, while heart and 
 mouth blaspheme God. The deterioration politically corresponds: the 
 first kingdom, an organic unity; the second, divided into Median and 
 Persian; the third branches off into four; the fourth, into ten. The 
 two eastern kingdoms are marked by nobler metals; the two western, by 
 baser; individualization and division appear in the latter, and it is 
 they which produce the two Antichrists.</P>

 It is striking, the fourth monarchy, though Christianized for fifteen
 hundred years past, is not distinguished from the previous heathen 
 monarchies, or from its own heathen portion. Nay, it is represented as 
 the most God-opposed of all, and culminating at last in blasphemous 
 Antichrist. The reason is: Christ's kingdom <I>now</I> is not of this 
 world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:36">Joh 18:36</A>);

 and only at the second advent of Christ does it become an external 
 power of the world. Hence Daniel, whose province it was to prophesy of 
 the world powers, does not treat of Christianity until it becomes a 
 world power, namely, at the second advent. The kingdom of God is a 
 hidden one till Jesus comes again

 forsaking Christ

 time

 To Balaam's "Asshur" correspond Daniel's two eastern kingdoms, Babylon
 and Medo-Persia; to "Chittim," the two western kingdoms, Greece and 
 Rome (compare

 world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:8-13">Ge 10:8-13</A>).

 The Babylonian world power takes up the thread interrupted at the 
 building of Babel, and the kingdom of Nimrod. As at Babel, so in 
 Babylon the world is united against God; Babylon, the first world 
 power, thus becomes the type of the God-opposed world. The fourth 
 monarchy consummates the evil; it is "diverse" from the others only in 
 its more unlimited universality. The three first were not in the full 
 sense universal monarchies. The fourth is; so in it the God-opposed 
 principle finds its full development. All history moves within the 
 Romanic, Germanic, and Slavonic nations; it shall continue so to 
 Christ's second advent. The fourth monarchy represents universalism 
 externally; Christianity, internally. Rome is Babylon fully developed. 
 It is the world power corresponding in contrast to Christianity, and 
 therefore contemporary with it

 The three being gone, he is the eighth (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:11">Re 17:11</A>);

 a distinct head, and yet "of the seven." As the previous world kingdoms 
 had their representative heads (Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar; Persia, Cyrus; 
 Greece, Alexander), so the fourth kingdom and its Antichrists shall 
 have their evil concentrated in the one final Antichrist. As Antiochus 
 Epiphanes, the Antichrist of the third kingdom in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:23-25">Da 8:23-25</A>,

 was the personal enemy of God, so the final Antichrist of the fourth 
 kingdom, his antitype. The Church has endured a pagan and a papal 
 persecution; there remains for her an infidel persecution, general, 
 purifying, and cementing [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ECIL</FONT>]. He will not 
 merely, as Popery, <I>substitute</I> himself for Christ <I>in Christ's 
 name,</I> but "<I>deny</I> the Father and the Son"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:22">1Jo 2:22</A>).

 The persecution is to continue <I>up to Christ's second coming</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:21,22">Da 7:21, 22</A>);

 a general cessation of persecution.</P>

 fullest development 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:22">1Jo 2:22</A>).

 Therefore, not only is power taken from the fourth beast, as in the 
 case of the other three, but God destroys it and the world power in 
 general by a final judgment. The present external Christianity is to 
 give place to an almost universal apostasy.

 forty-two months

 That literally three and a half years are to be the term of 
 Antichrist's persecution is favored by

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:16,23">Da 4:16, 23</A>,

 where the year-day theory would be impossible. If the Church, moreover, 
 had been informed that 1260 years must elapse before the second advent, 
 the attitude of expectancy which is inculcated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:38,1Co+1:7,1Th+1:9,10,2Pe+3:12">Lu 12:38;
 1Co 1:7; 
 1Th 1:9, 10; 
 2Pe 3:12</A>) 

 on the ground of the uncertainty of the time, would be out of place.
 The original word for "time" denotes <I>a stated period</I> or <I>set 
 feast;</I> or the interval from one set feast to its recurrence, that 
 is, a year [T<FONT SIZE=-1>REGELLES</FONT>];

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:4">Le 23:4</A>,
 
 "seasons"; 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:44">Le 23:44</A>,

 "feasts." The passages in favor of the year-day theory are

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+4:6">Eze 4:6</A>,

 where each day of the forty during which Ezekiel lay on his right side 
 is defined by God as meaning a year. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:34">Nu 14:34</A>,

 where a year of wandering in the wilderness was appointed for each day 
 of the forty during which the spies searched Canaan; but the days were, 
 in these two cases, merely the type or reason for the years, which were 
 <I>announced as they were to be fulfilled.</I> In the prophetic part of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:34">Nu 14:34</A>

 "years" are literal. If the year-day system was applied to them, they 
 would be 14,400 years! In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+4:4-6">Eze 4:4-6</A>,

 if <I>day</I> meant <I>year,</I> Ezekiel would have lain on his right 
 side forty years! The context here in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:24,25">Da 7:24, 25</A>,

 is not symbolical. Antichrist is no longer called a horn, but a 
 <I>king</I> subduing three out of ten <I>kings</I> (no longer horns,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:7,8">Da 7:7, 8</A>).

 So in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:7">Da 12:7</A>,

 where "time, times, and half a time," again occurs, nothing symbolic 
 occurs in the context. So that there is no reason why the three and a 
 half years should be so. For the first four centuries the "days" were 
 interpreted literally; a mystical meaning of the 1260 days then began.
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>ALTER</FONT> B<FONT SIZE=-1>RUTE</FONT> first suggested 
 the year-day theory in the end of the fourteenth century. The 
 <I>seventy years</I> of the Babylonian captivity foretold by Jeremiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:12,29:10">Jer 25:12; 29:10</A>)
 
 were understood by Daniel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:2">Da 9:2</A>)

 as literal years, not symbolical, which would have been 25,200 years!
 [T<FONT SIZE=-1>REGELLES</FONT>]. It is possible that the year-day and 
 day-day theories are <I>both</I> true. The seven (symbolical) times of 
 the Gentile monarchies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:24">Le 26:24</A>)

 during Israel's casting off will end in the seven years of Antichrist.
 The 1260 years of papal misrule in the name of Christ may be 
 represented by three and a half years of open Antichristianity and 
 persecution before the millennium. Witnessing churches may be succeeded 
 by witnessing individuals, the former occupying the longer, the latter 
 the shorter period

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:3">Re 11:3</A>).

 The beginning of the 1260 years is by E<FONT SIZE=-1>LLIOTT</FONT> set
 at <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 529 or 533, when Justinian's edict 
 acknowledged Pope John II to be head of the Church; by L<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>UTHER</FONT>, at 606, when Phocas confirmed Justinian's grant.
 But 752 is the most likely date, when the <I>temporal</I> dominion of 
 the popes began by Pepin's grant to Stephen II (for Zachary, his 
 predecessor's recognition of his title to France), confirmed by 
 Charlemagne. For it was then first that the little horn plucked up 
 three horns, and so became the prolongation of the fourth 
 <I>secular</I> kingdom [N<FONT SIZE=-1>EWTON</FONT>]. This would bring 
 us down to about <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 2000, or the seventh 
 thousand millenary from creation. But C<FONT SIZE=-1>LINTON</FONT> 
 makes about 1862 the seventh millenary, which may favor the dating from

 faithfulness to Israel, and a pledge of their future national blessing.

 With this chapter the <I>Hebrew</I> part of the book begins and continues
 to be the language of the remainder; the visions relating wholly to the
 Jews and Jerusalem. The scene here narrows from world-wide prophecies to
 those affecting the one covenant-people in the five centuries between
 the exile and the advent. Antichrist, like Christ, has a more immediate
 future, as well as one more remote. The vision, the eighth chapter,
 begins, and that, the tenth through twelfth chapters, concludes, the
 account of the Antichrist of the third kingdom. Between the two visions
 the ninth chapter is inserted, as to Messiah and the covenant-people at

 to be "a king of fierce countenance," &c. Antiochus Epiphanes is meant.
 Greece with all its refinement produces the first, that is, the Old
 Testament Antichrist. Antiochus had an extraordinary love of art, which
 expressed itself in grand temples. He wished to substitute Zeus Olympius
 for Jehovah at Jerusalem. Thus first heathen civilization from below,
 and revealed religion from above, came into collision. Identifying
 himself with Jupiter, his aim was to make <I>his own</I> worship universal
 (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:25,11:36">Da 8:25
 with Da 11:36</A>);

 so mad was he in this that he was called Epimanes (maniac) instead of 
 Epiphanes. None of the previous world rulers, Nebuchadnezzar

 had systematically opposed the Jews' religious worship. Hence the need 
 of prophecy to prepare them for Antiochus. The struggle of the 
 Maccabees was a fruit of Daniel's prophecy (<U>1 Maccabees 2:59</U>).
 He is the forerunner of the final Antichrist, standing in the same 
 relation to the first advent of Christ that Antichrist does to His 
 second coming. The sins in Israel which gave rise to the Greek 
 Antichrist were that some Jews adopted Hellenic customs (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:30,32">Da 11:30, 32</A>),

 erecting theaters, and regarding all religions alike, sacrificing to 
 Jehovah, but at the same time sending money for sacrifices to Hercules. 
 Such shall be the state of the world when ripe for Antichrist. At

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:9,23">Da 8:9
 and Da 8:23</A>

 the description passes from the literal Antiochus to
 features which, though partially attributed to him, hold good in their
 fullest sense only of his antitype, the New Testament Antichrist. The
 Mohammedan Antichrist may also be included; answering to the Euphratean
 (Turk) horsemen

 Christians was in <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 1281; and 391 years after

 Grecian customs and amusements, the pal&aelig;stra and gymnasium;
 ending with the death of Antiochus, 165 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, or
 the month Shebath, in the year 148 of the Seleucid era. Compare

 <U>1 Maccabees 1:11-15; 2 Maccabees 4:9</U>,

 &c. The reason for the greater minuteness of historical facts and
 dates, given in Daniel's prophecies, than in those of the New 
 Testament, is that Israel, not having yet the clear views which 
 Christians have of immortality and the heavenly inheritance, could only 
 be directed to the earthly future: for it was on earth the looked-for 
 Messiah was to appear, and the sum and subject of Old Testament 
 prophecy was <I>the kingdom of God upon earth.</I> The minuteness of 
 the revelation of Israel's earthly destiny was to compensate for the 
 absence, in the Old Testament, of views of heavenly glory. Thus, in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:24-27">Da 9:24-27</A>,

 the times of Messiah are foretold to the very year; in

 the Syro-Egyptian struggles in most minute detail. T<FONT
 SIZE=-1>REGELLES</FONT> thinks the twenty-three hundred "days" answer 
 to the week of years

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:27">Da 9:27</A>),
 
 during which the destroying prince

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:26">Da 9:26</A>)

 makes a covenant, which he breaks in the midst of the week (namely, at
 the end of three and a half years). The seven years exceed the
 twenty-three hundred days by considerably more than a half year. This 
 period of the seven years' excess above the twenty-three hundred days 
 may be allotted to the preparations needed for setting up the 
 temple-worship, with Antichrist's permission to the restored Jews, 
 according to his "covenant" with them; and the twenty-three hundred 
 days may date from the actual setting up of the worship. But, says 
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>UBERLEN</FONT>, the more accurate to a day the dates as 
 to Antiochus are given, the less should we say the 1290, or 1335 days

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:11,12">Da 12:11, 12</A>)

 correspond to the half week (roughly), and the twenty-three hundred to
 the whole. The event, however, may, in the case of Antichrist, show a 
 correspondence between the days here given and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:27">Da 9:27</A>,

 such as is not yet discernible. The term of twenty-three hundred days
 cannot refer twenty-three hundred years of the treading down of 
 Christianity by Mohammedanism, as this would leave the greater portion 
 of the time yet future; whereas, Mohammedanism is fast waning. If the
 twenty-three hundred <I>days</I> mean <I>years,</I> dating from 
 Alexander's conquests, 334 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT> to 323, we should 
 arrive at about the close of the sixth thousand years of the world,

 The event being to take place at "the time of the end" makes it likely
 that the Antichrist ultimately referred to (besides the immediate
 reference to Antiochus) in this chapter, and the one in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:8">Da 7:8</A>,

 are one and the same. The objection that the one in the seventh chapter
 springs out of the ten divisions of the Roman earth, the fourth 
 kingdom, the one in the eighth chapter and the eleventh chapter from 
 one of the four divisions of the third kingdom, Greece, is answered 
 thus: The four divisions of the Grecian empire, having become parts of 
 the Roman empire, shall at the end form four of its ten final divisions 
 [T<FONT SIZE=-1>REGELLES</FONT>]. However, the origin from one of the 
 four parts of the third kingdom may be <I>limited to Antiochus,</I> the 
 immediate subject of the eighth and eleventh chapter, while the 
 ulterior typical reference of these chapters (namely, Antichrist) may 
 belong to one of the ten Roman divisions, not <I>necessarily</I> one 
 formerly of the four of the third kingdom. The event will tell. "Time

 The world powers here recede from view; Israel, and the salvation by
 Messiah promised to it, are the subject of revelation. Israel had
 naturally expected salvation at the end of the captivity. Daniel is
 therefore told, that, after the seventy years of the captivity, seventy
 times seven must elapse, and that even then Messiah would not come in
 glory as the Jews might through misunderstanding expect from the earlier
 prophets, but by dying would put away sin. This ninth chapter (Messianic
 prophecy) stands between the two visions of the Old Testament
 Antichrist, to comfort "the wise." In the interval between Antiochus and
 Christ, no further revelation was needed; therefore, as in the first
 part of the book, so in the second, Christ and Antichrist in connection
 are the theme.</P>

 that if Israel in exile for sin should repent and <I>confess,</I> God 
 would remember for them His covenant with Abraham (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:1-5,Jer+29:12-14,Jam+4:10">De 30:1-5;
 Jer 29:12-14; 
 Jas 4:10</A>). 

 God's promise was absolute, but prayer also was ordained as about to
 precede its fulfilment, this too being the work of God <I>in</I> His 
 people, as much as the <I>external</I> restoration which was to follow. 
 So it shall be at Israel's final restoration

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:13-17">Ps 102:13-17</A>).

 Daniel takes his countrymen's place of confession of sin, identifying 
 himself with them, and, as their representative and intercessory 
 priest, "accepts the punishment of their iniquity." Thus he typifies 
 Messiah, the Sin-bearer and great Intercessor. The prophet's own life 
 and experience form the fit starting point of the prophecy concerning 
 the sin atonement. He prays for Israel's restoration as associated in 
 the prophets (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:4,11,12,31">Jer 31:4, 11, 12, 31</A>,

 &c.) with the hope of Messiah. The revelation, now granted, analyzes
 into its successive parts that which the prophets, in prophetical 
 perspective, heretofore saw together in one; namely, the redemption 
 from captivity, and the full Messianic redemption. God's servants, who, 
 like Noah's father

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:29">Ge 5:29</A>),

 hoped many a time that now the Comforter of their afflictions was at 
 hand, had to wait from age to age, and to view preceding fulfilments 
 only as pledges of the coming of Him whom they so earnestly desired to 
 see

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:17">Mt 13:17</A>);

 as now also Christians, who believe that the Lord's second coming is 
 nigh, are expected to continue waiting. So Daniel is informed of a long 
 period of seventy prophetic weeks before Messiah's coming, instead of 
 seventy years, as <I>he</I> might have expected (compare

 seventy heptads or hebdomads; four hundred ninety years; expressed in a

 [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGSTENBERG</FONT>], a usual way with
 the prophets. The Babylonian captivity is a turning point in the
 history of the kingdom of God. It terminated the free Old Testament
 theocracy. Up to that time Israel, though oppressed at times, was; as a
 rule, free. From the Babylonian captivity the theocracy never recovered
 its full freedom down to its entire suspension by Rome; and this period
 of Israel's subjection to the Gentiles is to continue till the
 millennium 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:1-15">Re 20:1-15</A>),

 when Israel shall be restored as head of the New Testament theocracy, 
 which will embrace the whole earth. The free theocracy ceased in the 
 first year of Nebuchadnezzar, and the fourth of Jehoiakim; the year of 
 the world 3338, the point at which the seventy years of the captivity
 begin. Heretofore Israel had a right, if subjugated by a foreign king,
 to shake off the yoke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:1-5:31,2Ki+18:7">Jud 4:1-5:31;

 as an unlawful one, at the first opportunity. But the prophets

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:9-11">Jer 27:9-11</A>)

 declared it to be <I>God's will</I> that they should submit to Babylon. 
 Hence every effort of Jehoiakim, Jeconiah, and Zedekiah to rebel was 
 vain. The period of the world times, and of Israel's depression, from 
 the Babylonian captivity to the millennium, though abounding more in 
 afflictions (for example, the two destructions of Jerusalem, Antiochus' 
 persecution, and those which Christians suffered), contains all that 
 was good in the preceding ones, summed up in Christ, but in a way 
 visible only to the eye of faith. Since He came as a servant, He chose
 for His appearing the period darkest of all as to His people's temporal 
 state. Always fresh persecutors have been rising, whose end is 
 destruction, and so it shall be with the last enemy, Antichrist. As the 
 Davidic epoch is the point of the covenant-people's highest glory, so 
 the captivity is that of their lowest humiliation. Accordingly, the 
 people's sufferings are reflected in the picture of the suffering 
 Messiah. He is no longer represented as the theocratic King, the 
 Antitype of David, but as the Servant of God and Son of man; at the 
 same time the cross being the way to glory (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:1-27,Da+2:34,35,44,12:7">Da 9:1-27
 with Da 2:34, 35, 44; 12:7</A>).

 In the second and seventh chapters, Christ's first coming is not
 noticed, for Daniel's object was to prophesy to his nation as to the 
 whole period from the destruction to the re-establishment of 
 <I>Israel;</I> but this ninth chapter minutely predicts Christ's first 
 coming, and its effects on the covenant people. <I>The seventy weeks
 date thirteen years before the rebuilding of Jerusalem;</I> for then 
 the re-establishment of the theocracy began, namely, at <I>the return 
 of Ezra to Jerusalem,</I> 457 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT> So Jeremiah's 
 seventy years of the captivity begin 606 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, 
 eighteen years before the destruction of Jerusalem, for then Judah 
 ceased to exist as an independent theocracy, having fallen under the 
 sway of Babylon. Two periods are marked in Ezra: (1) The return from 
 the captivity under Jeshua and Zerubbabel, and rebuilding of the 
 <I>temple,</I> which was the first anxiety of the theocratic nation. 
 (2) The return of Ezra (regarded by the Jews as a second Moses) from 
 Persia to Jerusalem, the restoration of <I>the city, the 
 nationality,</I> and the law. Artaxerxes, in the <I>seventh</I> year of 
 his reign, gave him the commission which virtually includes permission 
 to rebuild the city, afterwards confirmed to, and carried out by, 
 Nehemiah in the <I>twentieth</I> year

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+9:9,7:11">Ezr 9:9; 7:11,

 &c.).

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:25">Da 9:25</A>,

 "from the going forth of the commandment <I>to build Jerusalem,</I>"
 proves that the second of the two periods is referred to. The words in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:24">Da 9:24</A>

 are not, "are determined upon the holy city," but "<I>upon thy 
 people</I> and thy holy city"; thus the restoration of the religious 
 <I>national polity</I> and the law (the inner work fulfilled by Ezra 
 the priest), and the rebuilding of the <I>houses and walls</I> (the 
 outer work of Nehemiah, the governor), are both included in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:25">Da 9:25</A>,

 "restore and build Jerusalem." "Jerusalem" represents both the city, 
 the body, and the congregation, the soul of the state. Compare

 The starting-point of the seventy weeks dated from eighty-one years
 after Daniel received the prophecy: the object being not to fix <I>for 
 him</I> definitely the time, but for the Church: the prophecy taught 
 <I>him</I> that the Messianic redemption, which he thought near, was 
 separated from him by at least a half millennium. Expectation was 
 sufficiently kept alive by the <I>general</I> conception of the time; 
 not only the Jews, but many Gentiles looked for some great Lord of the 
 earth to spring from Judea <I>at that very time</I> [T<FONT

 SIZE=-1>UETONIUS</FONT>, <I>Vespasian,</I> 4]. Ezra's placing of Daniel 
 in the canon immediately before his own book and Nehemiah's was perhaps 
 owing to his feeling that he himself brought about the beginning of the 
 fulfilment of the prophecy

 A<FONT SIZE=-1>UBERLEN</FONT> remarks, there is but one Apocalypse in 
 each Testament. Its purpose in each is to sum up all the preceding 
 prophecies, previous to the "troublous times" of the Gentiles, in which 
 there was to be no revelation. Daniel sums up all the previous 
 Messianic prophecy, separating into its individual phases what the 
 prophets had seen in one and the same perspective, the temporary 
 deliverance from captivity and the antitypical final Messianic 
 deliverance. The seventy weeks are separated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:25-27">Da 9:25-27</A>)

 into three unequal parts, seven, sixty-two, one. The seventieth is the 
 consummation of the preceding ones, as the Sabbath of God succeeds the 
 working days; an idea suggested by the division into <I>weeks.</I> In 
 the sixty-nine weeks Jerusalem is restored, and so a place is prepared 
 for Messiah wherein to accomplish His sabbatic work

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:25,26">Da 9:25, 26</A>)
 
 of "confirming the covenant"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:27">Da 9:27</A>).

 The Messianic time is the Sabbath of Israel's history, in which it had 
 the offer of all God's mercies, but in which it was cut off for a time 
 by its rejection of them. As the seventy weeks end with seven years, or 
 a week, so they begin with seven times seven, that is, seven weeks. As 
 the seventieth week is separated from the rest <I>as a period of 
 revelation,</I> so it may be with the seven weeks. The number 
 <I>seven</I> is associated with revelation; for the <I>seven</I> 
 spirits of God are the mediators of all His revelations

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:4,3:1,4:5">Re 1:4; 3:1; 4:5</A>).

 <I>Ten</I> is the number of what is human; for example, the world power 
 issues in <I>ten heads</I> and <I>ten horns</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:42,7:7">Da 2:42; 7:7</A>).

 <I>Seventy</I> is <I>ten</I> multiplied by <I>seven,</I> the human
 moulded by the divine. The <I>seventy</I> years of exile symbolize the 
 triumph of the world power over Israel. In the seven times seventy 
 years the world number ten is likewise contained, that is, God's people 
 is still under the power of the world ("troublous times"); but the 
 number of the divine is multiplied by itself; seven times seven years, 
 at the beginning a period of Old Testament revelation to God's people 
 by Ezra, Nehemiah, and Malachi, whose labors extend over about half a 
 century, or <I>seven weeks,</I> and whose writings are last in the 
 canon; and in the end, seven years, the period of New Testament 
 revelation in Messiah. The commencing seven weeks of years of Old 
 Testament revelation are hurried over, in order that the chief stress 
 might rest on the Messianic week. Yet the seven weeks of Old Testament
 revelation are marked by their separation from the sixty-two, to be 
 above those sixty-two wherein there was to be none.

 Israel was not actually destroyed till <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 79, but it was so virtually,
 <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 33, about three or four years after Christ's death, during which
 the Gospel was preached exclusively to the Jews. When the Jews
 persecuted the Church and stoned Stephen

 Israel, having rejected Christ, was rejected by Christ, and henceforth

 <B>he shall cause the sacrifice .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. oblation to cease</B>--distinct from

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:11,11:31">Da 8:11; 11:31</A>).

 Messiah was to cause all sacrifices and oblations in general to
 "<I>cease</I>" utterly. There is here an <I>allusion</I> only to 
 Antiochus' act; to comfort God's people when sacrificial worship was to 
 be trodden down, by pointing them to the Messianic time when salvation 
 would fully come and yet temple sacrifices cease. This is the same 
 consolation as Jeremiah and Ezekiel gave under like circumstances, when 
 the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar was impending

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:16,31:31,Eze+11:19">Jer 3:16; 31:31;
 Eze 11:19</A>). 

 Jesus died in the middle of the last week, <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT>
 30. His prophetic life lasted three and a half years; the very time in 
 which "the saints are given into the hand" of Antichrist

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:25">Da 7:25</A>).

 Three and a half does not, like ten, designate the power of the world 
 in its fulness, but (while opposed to the divine, expressed by 
 <I>seven</I>) broken and defeated in its seeming triumph; for 
 immediately after the three and a half times, judgment falls on the 
 victorious world powers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:25,26">Da 7:25, 26</A>).

 So Jesus' death seemed the triumph of the world, but was really its 
 defeat

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:31">Joh 12:31</A>).

 The rending of the veil marked the cessation of sacrifices through 
 Christ's death

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:6,17,16:2,15,Heb+10:14-18">Le 4:6, 17; 16:2, 15;
 Heb 10:14-18</A>). 

 There cannot be a covenant without sacrifice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:20,9:17,15:9,Heb+9:15">Ge 8:20; 9:17; 15:9,
 &c.; Heb 9:15</A>).

 Here the old covenant is to be confirmed, but in a way peculiar to the
 New Testament, namely, by the one sacrifice, which would terminate all 
 sacrifices

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:6,11">Ps 40:6, 11</A>).

 Thus as the Levitical rites approached their end, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, 
 and Daniel, with ever increasing clearness, oppose the spiritual new 
 covenant to the transient earthly elements of the old.

 <B>for the overspreading of abominations</B>--<I>On account of the

 He shall not only destroy the city and sanctuary

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:25">Da 9:25</A>),

 but shall continue its desolation until the time of the consummation 
 "determined" by God (the phrase is quoted from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:22,23">Isa 10:22, 23</A>),

 A<FONT SIZE=-1>UBERLEN</FONT> translates, "On account of the desolating

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:31,12:11">Da 11:31; 12:11</A>;

 thus the repetition of the same thing as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:26">Da 9:26</A>

 curse,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:11">Da 9:11</A>,

 foretold by Moses) will pour on the desolated." Israel reached the 
 summit of abominations, which drew down desolation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:28">Mt 24:28</A>),

 nay, which is the desolation itself, when, after murdering Messiah, 
 they offered sacrifices, Mosaic indeed in form, but heathenish in 
 spirit (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:13,Eze+5:11">Isa 1:13;
 Eze 5:11</A>).
 
 Christ refers to this passage

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:15">Mt 24:15</A>),

 "When ye see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the 
 prophet, stand <I>in the holy place</I>" (the latter words being 
 <I>tacitly implied</I> in "abominations" as being such as are committed 
 <I>against the sanctuary</I>). T<FONT SIZE=-1>REGELLES</FONT>
 translates, "upon the <I>wing</I> of abominations shall be that which 
 causeth desolation"; namely, an idol set up on a wing or pinnacle of 
 the temple (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:5">Mt 4:5</A>)

 by Antichrist, who makes a covenant with the restored Jews for the last 
 of the seventy weeks of years (fulfilling Jesus' words, "If another 
 shall come in his own name, him ye will receive"), and for the first 
 three and a half years keeps it, then in the midst of the week breaks 
 it, causing the daily sacrifices to cease. T<FONT
 SIZE=-1>REGELLES</FONT> thus identifies the last half week with the 
 time, times, and a half of the persecuting little horn

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:25">Da 7:25</A>).

 But thus there is a gap of at least 1830 years put between the
 sixty-nine weeks and the seventieth week. S<FONT SIZE=-1>IR</FONT>
 I<FONT SIZE=-1>SAAC</FONT> N<FONT SIZE=-1>EWTON</FONT> explains the 
 wing ("overspreading") of abominations to be the Roman ensigns (eagles) 
 brought to the east gate of the temple, and there sacrificed to by the 
 soldiers; the war, ending in the destruction of Jerusalem, lasted from 
 spring <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 67 to autumn <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 
 70, that is, just three and a half years, or the last half week of 
 years [J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>, <I>Wars of the Jews,</I> 6.6].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>poured upon the desolate</B>--T<FONT SIZE=-1>REGELLES</FONT> 
 translates, "the <I>causer</I> of desolation," namely, Antichrist. 
 Compare "abomination <I>that maketh</I> desolate"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:11">Da 12:11</A>).

 Perhaps <I>both</I> interpretations of the whole passage may be in part 
 true; the Roman desolator, Titus, being a type of Antichrist, the final 
 desolator of Jerusalem. B<FONT SIZE=-1>ACON</FONT> [<I>The Advancement 
 of Learning,</I> 2.3] says, "Prophecies are of the nature of the 
 Author, with whom a thousand years are as one day; and therefore are 
 not fulfilled punctually at once, but have a springing and germinant 
 accomplishment through many years, though the height and fulness of 
 them may refer to one age."</P>

 On Daniel, by his silence, intimating that he did understand, the angel 
 declares he will return to renew the fight with the evil angel, the 
 prince of Persia. This points to new difficulties to the Jews' 
 restoration which would arise in the Persian court, but which would be 
 counteracted by God, through the ministry of angels.

 <B>intelligence with them that forsake the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
 covenant</B>--namely, with the apostates in the nation (<U>1 Maccabees

 religion and country, learning from Greek philosophy that all religions 
 are good enough to keep the masses in check. These had cast off 
 circumcision and the religion of Jehovah for Greek customs. Antiochus, 
 on his way home, sent Apollonius (167 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>) with 
 twenty-two thousand to destroy Jerusalem, two years after its capture 
 by himself. Apollonius slew multitudes, dismantled and pillaged the 
 city. They then, from a fortress which they built commanding the 
 temple, fell on and slew the worshippers; so that the temple service 
 was discontinued. Also, Antiochus decreed that all, on pain of death, 
 should conform to the Greek religion, and the temple was consecrated to 
 Jupiter Olympius. Identifying himself with that god, with fanatical 
 haughtiness he wished to make his own worship universal 
 
 (<U>1 Maccabees 1:41; 2 Maccabees 6:7</U>). 

 This was the gravest peril which ever heretofore threatened revealed 
 religion, the holy people, and the theocracy on earth, for none of the 
 previous world rulers had interfered with the religious worship of the 
 covenant-people, when subject to them

 in Daniel, the Jews, the adversaries of Jesus, would never have forged 
 the prophecies which confirm His claims. The ninth chapter was to 
 comfort the faithful Jews, in the midst of the "abominations" against 
 "the covenant," with the prospect of Messiah who would "confirm the 
 covenant." He would show by bringing salvation, and yet abolishing 
 sacrifices, that the temple service which they so grieved after, was 
 not absolutely necessary; thus the correspondence of phraseology would 
 suggest comfort (compare

 arms (that is, the Romans) shall stand up"; at the very time that 
 Antiochus left Egypt, the Romans conquered Macedon, thus finishing the 
 reign of Daniel's third beast; so here the prophet naturally proceeds 
 to the fourth beast. J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME'S</FONT> view is simpler;

 A<FONT SIZE=-1>UBERLEN</FONT> takes rather P<FONT

 again, and took Palestine on his way. The "tidings"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:44">Da 11:44</A>)

 as to the revolt of tributary nations then led him to the East. P<FONT

 Doubtless, antitypically, the final Antichrist, and its predecessor 
 Mohammed, are intended, to whom the language may be more fully

 "pushed at" the Greek emperor Heraclius, and deprived him of Egypt and 
 Syria. But the Turks of "the north" not merely <I>pushed at,</I> but 
 destroyed the Greek empire; therefore more is said of them than of the 
 Saracens. Their "horsemen" are specified, being their chief strength. 
 Their standards still are <I>horse tails.</I> Their "ships," too, often 
 gained the victory over Venice, the great naval power of Europe in that 
 day. They "overflowed" Western Asia, and then "passed over" into 
 Europe, fixing their seat of empire at Constantinople under Mohammed II

 side of Judea. In <U>1 Maccabees 4:61; 5:3</U>; &c., it is stated that

 C<FONT SIZE=-1>UMMING</FONT> thinks the 1260 years begin when Justinian

 Elijah, the two witnesses, prophesy in sackcloth. This theory is very
