 confirmed by the testimonies of I<FONT SIZE=-1>REN&AElig;US</FONT>,

 alludes to the frequent and affectionate mention made by Paul of the 
 Christian state, privileges, and persons of the Ephesians in his 
 Epistle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two theories, besides the ordinary one, have been held on the
 question, <I>to whom</I> the Epistle is addressed.
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT>, after the
 heretic Marcion, maintains that it was addressed to the Church at
 Laodicea, and that it is the Epistle to which Paul refers in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:16">Col 4:16</A>.

 But the Epistle to the Colossians was probably written <I>before</I> 
 that to the Ephesians, as appears from the parallel passages in 
 Ephesians bearing marks of being expanded from those in Colossians; and 
 Marcion seems to have drawn his notion, as to our Epistle, from Paul's 
 allusion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:16">Col 4:16</A>)

 to an Epistle addressed by him to the Laodiceans. O<FONT
 SIZE=-1>RIGEN</FONT> and C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT> A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LEXANDRIA</FONT>, and even T<FONT SIZE=-1>ERTULLIAN</FONT>, who 
 refers to Marcion, give no sanction to his notion. No single manuscript 
 contains the heading, "to the saints that are at Laodicea." The very 
 resemblance of the Epistle to the Ephesians, to that to the Colossians, 
 is against the theory; for if the former were really the one addressed 
 to Laodicea

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:16">Col 4:16</A>),

 Paul would not have deemed it necessary that the churches of Colosse 
 and Laodicea should interchange Epistles. The greetings, moreover

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:15">Col 4:15</A>),

 which he sends <I>through the Colossians to the Laodiceans,</I> are 
 quite incompatible with the idea that Paul wrote an Epistle <I>to the 
 Laodiceans</I> at the same time, and by the same bearer, Tychicus (the 
 bearer of our Epistle to the Ephesians, as well as of that to Colosse,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:21,Col+4:7">Eph 6:21;
 Col 4:7</A>);

 for who, under such circumstances, would not send the greetings
 <I>directly</I> in the letter to the party saluted? The letter to 
 Laodicea was evidently written some time <I>before</I> that to Colosse, 
 Archbishop U<FONT SIZE=-1>SHER</FONT> has advanced the second theory: 
 That it was an <I>encyclical</I> letter headed, as in Manuscript B., 
 "to the saints that are .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and to the faithful," the name 
 of each Church being inserted in the copy sent to it; and that its 
 <I>being sent to Ephesus first,</I> occasioned its being entitled, as 
 now, the Epistle to the Ephesians. A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> makes
 the following objections to this theory: (1) It is at variance with the 
 spirit of the Epistle, which is clearly addressed to one set of persons 
 throughout, co-existing in one place, and as one body, and under the 
 same circumstances. (2) The improbability that the apostle, who in two 
 of his Epistles (Second Corinthians and Galatians) has so plainly 
 specified their encyclical character, should have here omitted such 
 specification. (3) The still greater improbability that he should have, 
 as on this hypothesis must be assumed, written a circular Epistle to a 
 district, of which Ephesus was the commercial capital, addressed to 
 various churches within that district, yet from its very contents (as 
 by the opponents' hypothesis) not admitting of application to the 
 Church of that metropolis, in which he had spent so long a time, and to 
 which he was so affectionately bound. (4) The inconsistency of this 
 hypothesis with the address of the Epistle, and the universal testimony 
 of the ancient Church. The absence of personal greetings is not an 
 argument for either of the two theories; for similarly there are none 
 in Galatians, Philippians, First and Second Thessalonians, First 
 Timothy. The better he knows the parties addressed, and the more 
 general and solemn the subject, the less he seems to give of these 
 individual notices. Writing, as he does in this Epistle, on the 
 constitution and prospects of Christ's universal Church, he refers the 
 Ephesians, as to personal matters, to the bearer of the Epistle, 
 Tychicus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:21,22">Eph 6:21, 22</A>).

 As to the omission of "which are at Ephesus"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:1">Eph 1:1</A>),

 in Manuscript B., so "in Rome" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:7">Ro 1:7</A>)

 is omitted in some old manuscripts: it was probably done by churches 
 <I>among whom it was read,</I> in order to generalize the reference of 
 its contents, and especially where the subject of the Epistle is 
 catholic. The words are found in the margin of Manuscript B, from a
 first hand; and are found in all the oldest manuscripts and 
 versions.</P>

 Paul's first visit to Ephesus (on the seacoast of Lydia, near the
 river Cayster) is related in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:19-21">Ac 18:19-21</A>.

 The work, begun by his disputations with the Jews in his short visit, 
 was carried on by Apollos

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:24-26">Ac 18:24-26</A>),
 
 and Aquila and Priscilla 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:26">Ac 18:26</A>).

 At his second visit, after his journey to Jerusalem, and thence to the 
 east regions of Asia Minor, he remained at Ephesus "three years"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:10">Ac 19:10</A>,

 the "two years" in which verse are only <I>part</I> of the time, and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:31">Ac 20:31</A>);

 so that the founding and rearing of this Church occupied an unusually 
 large portion of the apostle's time and care; whence his language in 
 this Epistle shows a warmth of feeling, and a free outpouring of 
 thought, and a union in spiritual privileges and hope between him and 
 them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:3">Eph 1:3</A>,

 &c.), such as are natural from one so long and so intimately associated 
 with those whom he addresses. On his last journey to Jerusalem, he
 sailed by Ephesus and summoned the elders of the Ephesian Church to 
 meet him at Miletus, where he delivered his remarkable farewell charge

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:18-35">Ac 20:18-35</A>).</P>

 This Epistle was addressed to the Ephesians during the early part of
 his imprisonment at Rome, immediately after that to the Colossians, to
 which it bears a close resemblance in many passages, the apostle having
 in his mind generally the same great truths in writing both. It is an
 undesigned proof of genuineness that the two Epistles, written about
 the same date, and under the same circumstances, bear a closer mutual
 resemblance than those written at distant dates and on different
 occasions. Compare

 Tychicus and Onesimus were being sent to Colosse, the former bearing 
 the two Epistles to the two churches respectively, the latter furnished 
 with a letter of recommendation to Philemon, his former master, 
 residing at Colosse. The date was probably about four years after his 
 parting with the Ephesian elders at Miletus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:6-38">Ac 20:6-38</A>),

 about <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 62, before his imprisonment had become 
 of the more severe kind, which appears in his Epistle to the 
 Philippians. From

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:19,20">Eph 6:19, 20</A>

 it is plain he had at the time, though a prisoner, some degree of 
 freedom in preaching, which accords with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:23,30,31">Ac 28:23, 30, 31</A>,

 where he is represented as receiving at his lodgings all inquirers. His
 imprisonment began in February <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 61 and lasted 
 "two whole years"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:30">Ac 28:30</A>)
 
 at least, and perhaps longer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Church of Ephesus was made up of converts partly from the Jews
 and partly from the Gentiles 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:8-10">Ac 19:8-10</A>).

 Accordingly, the Epistle so addresses a Church constituted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:14-22">Eph 2:14-22</A>).

 Ephesus was famed for its idol temple of Artemis or Diana, which, after 
 its having been burnt down by Herostratus on the night that Alexander 
 the Great was born (355 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>), was rebuilt at 
 enormous cost and was one of the wonders of the world. Hence, perhaps, 
 have arisen his images in this Epistle drawn from a beautiful temple: 
 the Church being in true inner beauty that which the temple of the idol 
 tried to realize in outward show

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:19-22">Eph 2:19-22</A>).
 
 The Epistle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:17,5:1-13">Eph 4:17; 5:1-13</A>)

 implies the profligacy for which the Ephesian heathen were notorious.
 Many of the same expressions occur in the Epistle as in Paul's address 
 to the Ephesian elders. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:6,7,2:7">Eph 1:6, 7; 2:7</A>,
 
 as to "grace," with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:24,32">Ac 20:24, 32</A>:

 this may well be called "the Epistle of the grace of God" 
 [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]. Also, as to his "bonds,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:1,4:1,Ac+20:22,23">Eph 3:1, and 4:1

 Also

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:11">Eph 1:11</A>,

 as to "the counsel of God," with

 The object of the Epistle is "to set forth the ground, the course,
 and the aim and end of <FONT SIZE=-1>THE</FONT>
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>HURCH OF THE</FONT>
 F<FONT SIZE=-1>AITHFUL IN</FONT>
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>HRIST</FONT>.
 He speaks to the Ephesians as a type or sample of the Church universal"
 [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>].
 Hence, "the Church" throughout the Epistle is spoken of in the
 singular, not in the plural, "churches." The Church's foundation, its
 course, and its end, are his theme alike in the larger and smaller
 divisions of the whole Epistle. "Everywhere the foundation of the
 Church is in <I>the will of the Father;</I> the course of the Church is by
 <I>the satisfaction of the Son;</I> the end of the Church is the
 <I>life in the Holy Spirit</I>"
 [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]. Compare respectively

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:11,2:5,3:16">Eph 1:11; 2:5; 3:16</A>.

 This having been laid down as a matter of doctrine (this part closing
 with a sublime doxology,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:14-21">Eph 3:14-21</A>),

 is then made the ground of practical exhortations. In these latter also 
 (from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:1">Eph 4:1</A>,

 onward), the same threefold division prevails, for the Church is 
 represented as founded on the counsel of "God the Father, who is above 
 all, through all, and in all," reared by the "one Lord," Jesus Christ, 
 through the "one Spirit"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:4-6">Eph 4:4-6</A>,

 &c.), who give their respective graces to the several members. These 
 last are therefore to exercise all these graces in the several 
 relations of life, as husbands, wives, servants, children, &c. The 
 conclusion is that we must put on "the whole armor of God"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:13">Eph 6:13</A>).</P>

 The sublimity of the <FONT SIZE=-1>STYLE</FONT> and
 <FONT SIZE=-1>LANGUAGE</FONT> corresponds to the sublimity
 of the subjects and exceeds almost that of any part of his Epistles. It
 is appropriate that those to whom he so wrote were Christians long
 grounded in the faith. The very sublimity is the cause of the
 difficulty of the style, and of the presence of peculiar expressions
 occurring, not found elsewhere.</P>

 been sharers in light and life (compare

 The plural implies the several renewals of the covenant with Abraham,
 Isaac, and Jacob, and with the whole people at Sinai 
 [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]. "The promise" is singular, to signify
 that the covenant, in reality, and substantially, is one and the same 
 at all times, but only different in its accidents and external 
 circumstances (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:1">Heb 1:1</A>,

 The <FONT SIZE=-1>CONJECTURES</FONT> of heathen philosophers as to a 
 future life were at best vague and utterly unsatisfactory. They had no 
 divine "promise," and therefore no sure ground of "hope." Epicurus and 
 Aristotle did not believe in it at all. The Platonists believed the 
 soul passed through perpetual changes, now happy, and then again 
 miserable; the Stoics, that it existed no longer than till the time of 
 the general burning up of all things.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>without God</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "atheists," that is, they had not 
 "God" in the sense we use the word, the Eternal Being who made and 
 governs all things (compare

 "Turn from these vanities unto <I>the living God</I> who made heaven,

 distinct ideas of God and immortality. Compare also

 <I>parted</I> Jew and Gentile. There was a balustrade of stone which 
 separated the court of the Gentiles from the holy place, which it was 
 death for a Gentile to pass. But this, though incidentally alluded to, 
 was but a symbol of the partition itself, namely, "the enmity"
 <I>between</I> "<I>both</I>" <I>and God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:15">Eph 2:15</A>),

 the real cause of separation from God, and so the mediate cause of 
 their separation from one another. Hence there was a twofold wall of 
 partition, one the inner wall, severing the Jewish people from entrance 
 to the holy part of the temple where the priests officiated, the other 
 the outer wall, separating the Gentile proselytes from access to the 
 court of the Jews (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:7,Ac+21:28">Eze 44:7;

 Thus this twofold wall represented the Sinaitic law, which <I>both</I>
 severed all men, even the Jews, from access to God (through sin, which 
 is the violation of the law), and also separated the Gentiles from the 
 Jews. As the term "wall" implies the <I>strength</I> of the partition,

 naturally suggested by the splendid architecture of Diana's temple; the

 Christ Himself, the only true Foundation, was the grand subject of 
 their ministry, and spring of their life. As one with Him and His 
 fellow workers, they, too, in a secondary sense, are called 
 "foundations"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:14">Re 21:14</A>).

 The "prophets" are joined with them closely; for the expression is here 
 not "<I>foundations</I> of the apostles and <I>the</I> prophets," but 
 "<I>foundations</I> of the apostles and <I>prophets.</I>" For the 
 doctrine of both was essentially one

 The apostles take the precedency

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:24">Lu 10:24</A>).

 Thus he appropriately shows regard to the claims of the Jews and 
 Gentiles: "the prophets" representing the old Jewish dispensation, "the 
 apostles" the new. The "prophets" of the new also are included. B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT> and A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> refer the meaning 
 solely to these

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:5,4:11">Eph 3:5; 4:11</A>).

 These passages imply, I think, that the New Testament prophets are not
 excluded; but the apostle's plain reference to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+118:22">Ps 118:22</A>,

 "the head stone of the corner," proves that the Old Testament prophets 
 are a prominent thought. David is called a "prophet" in

 the earlier one of Jacob

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:24">Ge 49:24</A>).

 The sense of the context, too, suits this: Ye were once aliens from the 
 commonwealth <I>of Israel</I> (in the time of her <I>Old Testament 
 prophets</I>), but now ye are members of the true Israel, built upon 
 the foundation of her New Testament apostles and Old Testament 
 prophets. Paul continually identifies his teaching with that of 
 Israel's old prophets

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:22,28:23">Ac 26:22; 28:23</A>).

 The costly foundation-stones of the temple

 typified the same truth (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:26">Jer 51:26</A>).

 The same stone is at once the corner-stone and the foundation-stone on 
 which the whole building rests. Paul supposes a stone or rock so large 
 and so fashioned as to be both at once; supporting the whole as the 
 foundation, and in part rising up at the extremities, so as to admit of 
 the side walls meeting in it, and being united in it as the 
 corner-stone [Z<FONT SIZE=-1>ANCHIUS</FONT>]. As the corner-stone, it 
 is conspicuous, as was Christ

 The Church is part of the grand family, or kingdom, which comprehends, 
 besides men, the higher spiritual world, where the archetype, to the 
 realization of which redeemed man is now tending, is already realized. 
 This universal idea of the "kingdom" of God as one divine community, is 
 presented to us in the Lord's Prayer. By sin men were estranged, not 
 only from God, but from that higher spiritual world in which the 
 kingdom of God is already realized. As Christ when He reconciled men to 
 God, united them to one another in a divine community (joined to 
 Himself, the one Head), breaking down the partition wall between Jew 
 and Gentile

 <B>4.</B> In the apostle's creed, the article as to
 <FONT SIZE=-1>THE</FONT>
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>HURCH</FONT> properly follows that as to
 <FONT SIZE=-1>THE</FONT>
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>OLY</FONT>
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>HOST</FONT>. To the Trinity naturally is annexed the
 Church, as the house to its tenant, to God His temple, the state to its
 founder [A<FONT SIZE=-1>UGUSTINE</FONT>, <I>Enchiridion,</I> c. 15].
 There is yet to be a Church, not merely potentially, but actually
 catholic or world-wide; then the Church and the world will be
 co-extensive. Rome falls into inextricable error by setting up a mere
 man as a visible head, antedating that consummation which Christ, the
 true visible Head, at His appearing shall first realize. As the "<FONT
 SIZE=-1>SPIRIT</FONT>" is mentioned here, so the "L<FONT
 SIZE=-1>ORD</FONT>" (Jesus),

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:5">Eph 4:5</A>,

 and "G<FONT SIZE=-1>OD</FONT> the Father,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:6">Eph 4:6</A>.

 Thus the Trinity is again set forth.

 <B>hope</B>--here associated with "the Spirit," which is the "earnest 
 of our inheritance"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:13,14">Eph 1:13, 14</A>).
 
 As "faith" is mentioned,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:5">Eph 4:5</A>,

 so "hope" here, and "love,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:2">Eph 4:2</A>.

 The Holy Spirit, as the common higher principle of life

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:18,22">Eph 2:18, 22</A>),

 gives to the Church its true unity. Outward uniformity is as yet 
 unattainable; but beginning by having one mind, we shall hereafter end 
 by having "one body." The true "body" of Christ (all believers of every 
 age) is already "one," as joined to the one Head. But its unity is as 
 yet not visible, even as the Head is not visible; but it shall appear 
 when He shall appear

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:21-23,Col+3:4">Joh 17:21-23;
 Col 3:4</A>). 

 Meanwhile the rule is, "In essentials, unity; in doubtful questions,
 liberty; in all things, charity." There is more real unity where both 
 go to heaven under different names than when with the same name one 
 goes to heaven, the other to hell. Truth is the first thing: those who 
 reach it, will at last reach unity, because truth is <I>one;</I> while 
 those who seek unity as the first thing, may purchase it at the 
 sacrifice of truth, and so of the soul itself.

 <B>lower parts of the earth</B>--The antithesis or contrast to "far

 others, to show that this phrase means more than simply the 
 <I>earth,</I> namely, the regions <I>beneath</I> it, even as He 
 ascended not merely to the visible heavens, but "far above" them. 
 Moreover, His design "that He might fill <I>all</I> things"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:10">Eph 4:10</A>,

 <I>Greek,</I> "the whole universe of things") may imply the same. But 
 see on

 <A HREF="#Eph4_10">Eph 4:10</A> 

 on those words. Also the leading "captive" of the "captive hand" 
 ("captivity") of satanic powers, may imply that the warfare reached to 
 <I>their habitation itself</I>

 Christ, as Lord of all, took possession first of the earth the unseen

 However, all we <I>surely</I> know is, that His soul at death descended 
 to Hades, that is, underwent the ordinary condition of departed spirits

 drawn from it for a descent to the abodes of Satan.

 As the apostles, prophets, and evangelists were special and 
 extraordinary ministers, so "pastors and teachers" are the ordinary 
 stated ministers of a particular flock, including, probably, the 
 bishops, presbyters, and deacons. Evangelists were itinerant preachers
 like our missionaries, as Philip the deacon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:8">Ac 21:8</A>);

 as contrasted with stationary "pastors and teachers"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:5">2Ti 4:5</A>).

 The <I>evangelist</I> founded the Church; the <I>teacher</I> built it 
 up in the faith already received. The "pastor" had the <I>outward 
 rule</I> and <I>guidance</I> of the Church: the bishop. As to 
 revelation, the "evangelist" testified infallibly of the past; the 
 "prophet," infallibly of the future. The prophet derived all from the 
 Spirit; the evangelist, in the special case of the Four, recorded 
 matter of fact, cognizable to the senses, under the Spirit's guidance. 
 No one form of Church polity as permanently <I>unalterable</I> is laid 
 down in the New Testament though the apostolical order of bishops, or 
 presbyters, and deacons, superintended by higher overseers (called 
 bishops after the apostolic times), has the highest sanction of 
 primitive usage. In the case of the Jews, a fixed model of hierarchy 
 and ceremonial unalterably bound the people, most minutely detailed in 
 the law. In the New Testament, the absence of minute directions for 
 Church government and ceremonies, shows that a fixed model was not 
 designed; the <I>general</I> rule is obligatory as to ceremonies, "Let 
 all things be done decently and in order" (compare Article XXXIV, 
 Church of England); and that a succession of ministers be provided, not 
 self-called, but "called to the work by men who have public authority 
 given unto them in the congregation, to call and send ministers into 
 the Lord's vineyard" [Article XXIII]. That the "pastors" here were the 
 bishops and presbyters of the Church, is evident from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:28,1Pe+5:1,2">Ac 20:28;
 1Pe 5:1, 2</A>, 

 where the <I>bishops'</I> and <I>presbyters'</I> office is said to be
 "to feed" the flock. The term, "shepherd" or "pastor," is used of 
 guiding and <I>governing</I> and not merely <I>instructing,</I> whence

 Should circumstances arise to call for anger on your part, let it be as 
 Christ's "anger"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:5">Mr 3:5</A>),

 without sin. Our natural feelings are not wrong when directed to their
 legitimate object, and when not exceeding due bounds. As in the future 
 literal, so in the present spiritual, resurrection, no essential 
 constituent is annihilated, but all that is a perversion of the 
 original design is removed. Thus indignation at dishonor done to God, 
 and wrong to man, is justifiable anger. <I>Passion</I> is sinful 
 (derived from "<I>passio,</I>" <I>suffering:</I> implying that amidst 
 seeming energy, a man is really <I>passive,</I> the slave of his anger, 
 instead of ruling it).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>let not the sun go down upon your wrath</B>--"wrath" is absolutely
 forbidden; "anger" not so, though, like poison sometimes used as
 medicine, it is to be used with extreme caution. The sense is not, Your
 <I>anger</I> shall not be imputed to you if you put it away before
 nightfall; but "let no <I>wrath</I> (that is, as the <I>Greek,</I> personal
 'irritation' or 'exasperation') mingle with your 'anger,' even though,
 the latter be righteous,
 [T<FONT SIZE=-1>RENCH</FONT>, <I>Greek Synonyms of the New Testament</I>].
 "Put it away <I>before sunset</I>" (when the Jewish day began), is proverbial
 for put it away <I>at once</I> before <I>another day begin</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:15">De 24:15</A>);

 also before you part with your brother for the night, perhaps never in 
 this world to meet again. So J<FONT SIZE=-1>ONA</FONT>, "Let not night 
 and anger against anyone sleep with you, but go and conciliate the 
 other party, though he have been the first to commit the offense." Let 
 not your "anger" at another's wickedness verge into hatred, or 
 contempt, or revenge [V<FONT SIZE=-1>ATABLUS</FONT>].</P>

 constitutes true "wisdom"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:15">Eph 5:15</A>).

 In a larger sense, <I>the whole season from the time that one is 
 spiritually awakened,</I> is to be "redeemed" from vanity for God 
 (compare

 be bought at any price. W<FONT SIZE=-1>AHL</FONT> explains, "Redeeming
 for yourselves (that is, availing yourselves of) the opportunity 
 (offered you of acting aright), and commanding the time as a master 
 does his servant." T<FONT SIZE=-1>ITTMANN</FONT>, "Watch the time, and

 Hence arose the abstinence from wine of many of the prophets, for 
 example, John the Baptist, namely, in order to keep distinct before the 
 world the ecstasy caused by the Spirit, from that caused by wine. So 
 also in ordinary Christians the Spirit dwells not in the mind that

 constrain a servant by fear, though not even he is so to be bound to

 marriage, wherein "a man leaves father and mother (the oldest

 principal thing meant here, but <I>the spiritual marriage</I> represented
 by it, and on which it rests, whereby Christ left the Father's bosom to
 woo to Himself the Church out of a lost world:

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:32">Eph 5:32</A>

 In natural marriage, husband and wife combine the elements of one 
 perfect human being: the one being incomplete without the other. So 
 Christ, as God-man, is pleased to make the Church, the body, a 
 necessary adjunct to Himself, the Head. He is the archetype of the 
 Church, from whom and according to whom, as the pattern, she is formed. 
 He is her Head, as the husband is of the wife

 The same grades of powers are specified in the case of the demons here,

 The Ephesians had practiced sorcery

 so that he appropriately treats of evil spirits in addressing them. The 
 more clearly any book of Scripture, as this, treats of the economy of 
 the kingdom of light, the more clearly does it set forth the kingdom of 
 darkness. Hence, nowhere does the satanic kingdom come more clearly 
 into view than in the Gospels which treat of Christ, the true Light.

 they are not the ruler of the universe; and their usurped rule of the 
 world is soon to cease, when He shall "come whose right it is"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+21:27">Eze 21:27</A>).

 Two cases prove Satan not to be a mere subjective fancy: (1) Christ's 
 temptation; (2) the entrance of demons into the swine (for these are 
 incapable of such fancies). Satan tries to parody, or imitate in a 
 perverted way, God's working

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:13,14">2Co 11:13, 14</A>).

 So when God became incarnate, Satan, by his demons, took forcible 
 possession of human bodies. Thus the demoniacally possessed were not 
 peculiarly wicked, but miserable, and so fit subjects for Jesus' pity.
 Paul makes no mention of demoniacal possession, so that in the time he 
 wrote, it seems to have ceased; it probably was restricted to the 
 period of the Lord's incarnation, and of the foundation of His Church.
