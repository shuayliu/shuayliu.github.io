 C<FONT SIZE=-1>ANONICITY AND AUTHORSHIP</FONT>.--C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT 
 OF</FONT> R<FONT SIZE=-1>OME</FONT>, at the end of the first century 
 (A.D), copiously uses it, adopting its words just as he does those of 
 the other books of the New Testament; not indeed giving to either the 
 term "Scripture," which he reserves for the Old Testament (the canon of 
 the New Testament not yet having been formally established), but 
 certainly not ranking it below the other New Testament acknowledged 
 Epistles. As our Epistle claims <I>authority</I> on the part of the 
 writer, C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT'S</FONT> adoption of extracts from it is 
 virtually sanctioning its authority, and this in the apostolic age.
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>USTIN</FONT> M<FONT SIZE=-1>ARTYR</FONT> quotes it as 
 divinely authoritative, to establish the titles "apostle," as well as 
 "angel," as applied to the Son of God. C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT>
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LEXANDRIA</FONT> refers it expressly to Paul, on the 
 authority of Pant&aelig;nus, chief of the Catechetical school in 
 Alexandria, in the middle of the second century, saying, that as Jesus 
 is termed in it the "apostle" sent to the Hebrews, Paul, through 
 humility, does not in it call himself apostle of the Hebrews, being 
 apostle to the Gentiles. C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT</FONT> also says that
 Paul, as the Hebrews were prejudiced against him, prudently omitted to 
 put forward his name in the beginning; also, that it was originally 
 written in <I>Hebrew</I> for the Hebrews, and that Luke translated it 
 into <I>Greek</I> for the Greeks, whence the style is similar to that
 of Acts. He, however, quotes frequently the words of the existing
 <I>Greek</I> Epistle as Paul's words. O<FONT SIZE=-1>RIGEN</FONT>
 similarly quotes it as Paul's Epistle. However, in his Homilies, he
 regards the style as distinct from that of Paul, and as "more Grecian,"
 but the thoughts as the apostle's; adding that the "ancients who have
 handed down the tradition of its Pauline authorship, must have had good
 reason for doing so, though God alone knows the certainty who was the
 actual writer" (that is, probably "transcriber" of the apostle's 
 thoughts). In the African Church, in the beginning of the third 
 century, T<FONT SIZE=-1>ERTULLIAN</FONT> ascribes it to Barnabas. 
 I<FONT SIZE=-1>REN&AElig;US</FONT>, bishop of Lyons, is mentioned in 
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>, as quoting from this Epistle, though 
 without expressly referring it to Paul. About the same period, Caius, 
 the presbyter, in the Church of Rome, mentions only <I>thirteen</I> 
 Epistles of Paul, whereas, if the Epistle to the Hebrews were included, 
 there would be <I>fourteen.</I> So the canon fragment of the end of the 
 second century, or beginning of the third, published by M<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>URATORI</FONT>, apparently omits mentioning it. And so the 
 Latin Church did not recognize it as Paul's till a considerable time 
 after the beginning of the third century. Thus, also,
 N<FONT SIZE=-1>OVATIAN OF</FONT>
 R<FONT SIZE=-1>OME</FONT>,
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>YPRIAN OF</FONT>
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>ARTHAGE</FONT>, and
 V<FONT SIZE=-1>ICTORINUS</FONT>, also of the
 Latin Church. But in the fourth century, H<FONT SIZE=-1>ILARY OF</FONT>
 P<FONT SIZE=-1>OITIERS</FONT>
 (<FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 368),
 L<FONT SIZE=-1>UCIFER OF</FONT>
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>AGLIARI</FONT>
 (<FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 371),
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>MBROSE OF</FONT>
 M<FONT SIZE=-1>ILAN</FONT> (A.D. 397) and other Latins, quote it as
 Paul's; and the fifth Council of Carthage (<FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT>
 419) formally reckons it among his fourteen Epistles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As to the <I>similarity</I> of its <I>style to that of Luke's</I>
 writings, this is due to his having been so long the companion of Paul.
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>HRYSOSTOM</FONT>, comparing Luke and Mark, says, "Each
 imitated his teacher: Luke imitated Paul flowing along with more than 
 river fulness; but Mark imitated Peter, who studied brevity of style." 
 Besides, there is a greater predominance of Jewish feeling and 
 familiarity with the peculiarities of the Jewish schools apparent in 
 this Epistle than in Luke's writings. There is no clear <I>evidence</I> 
 for attributing the authorship to him, or to Apollos, whom A<FONT
 SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> upholds as the author. The grounds alleged for
 the latter view are its supposed Alexandrian phraseology and modes of
 thought. But these are such as any Palestinian Jew might have used; and
 Paul, from his Hebr&aelig;o-Hellenistic education at Jerusalem and
 Tarsus, would be familiar with P<FONT SIZE=-1>HILO'S</FONT> modes of
 thought, which are not, as some think, necessarily all derived from his
 Alexandrian, but also from his Jewish, education. It would be unlikely
 that the Alexandrian Church should have so undoubtingly asserted the
 Pauline authorship, if Apollos, <I>their own countryman,</I> had really
 been the author. The eloquence of its style and rhetoric, a 
 characteristic of Apollos' at Corinth, whereas Paul there spoke in 
 words unadorned by man's wisdom, are doubtless designedly adapted to 
 the minds of those whom Paul in this Epistle addresses. To the Greek 
 Corinthians, who were in danger of idolizing human eloquence and 
 wisdom, he writes in an unadorned style, in order to fix their 
 attention more wholly on the Gospel itself. But the Hebrews were in no 
 such danger. And his Hebr&aelig;o-Grecian education would enable him to 
 write in a style attractive to the Hebrews at Alexandria, where Greek 
 philosophy had been blended with Judaism. The <I>Septuagint</I> 
 translation framed at Alexandria had formed a connecting link between 
 the latter and the former; and it is remarkable that all the quotations 
 from the Old Testament, excepting two

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:30,13:5">Heb 10:30; 13:5</A>),

 are taken from the <I>Septuagint.</I> The fact that the peculiarities
 of the Septuagint are interwoven into the argument proves that the 
 <I>Greek</I> Epistle is an original, not a translation; had the 
 original been <I>Hebrew,</I> the quotations would have been from the 
 <I>Hebrew</I> Old Testament. The same conclusion follows from the plays 
 on similarly sounding words in the <I>Greek,</I> and alliterations, and 
 rhythmically constructed periods. C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>
 observes, If the Epistle had been written in <I>Hebrew,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:15-17">Heb 9:15-17</A>

 would lose all its point, which consists in the play upon the double 
 meaning of the <I>Greek</I> "<I>diathece,</I>" a "covenant," or a 
 "testament," whereas the <I>Hebrew</I> "<I>berith</I>" means only 
 "covenant."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Internal evidence</I> favors the Pauline authorship. Thus the topic so
 fully handled in this Epistle, that Christianity is superior to
 Judaism, inasmuch as the reality exceeds the type which gives place to
 it, is a favorite one with Paul (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:6-18,Ga+3:23-25,4:1-9,21-31">2Co 3:6-18;
 Ga 3:23-25; 4:1-9, 21-31</A>, 

 wherein the allegorical mode of interpretation appears in its divinely
 sanctioned application--a mode pushed to an unwarrantable excess in the 
 Alexandrian school). So the Divine Son appears in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:3">Heb 1:3</A>,

 &c., as in other Epistles of Paul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:6,Col+1:15-20">Php 2:6;
 Col 1:15-20</A>),

 as <I>the Image,</I> or manifestation <I>of the Deity.</I> His lowering
 of Himself for man's sake similarly, compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:9,2Co+8:9,Php+2:7,8">Heb 2:9,
 with 2Co 8:9; 
 Php 2:7, 8</A>.

 Also His final exaltation, compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:8,10:13,12:2,1Co+15:25,27">Heb 2:8; 10:13; 12:2,
 with 1Co 15:25, 27</A>.

 The word "Mediator" is peculiar to Paul alone, compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:6,Ga+3:19,20">Heb 8:6,
 with Ga 3:19, 20</A>.

 Christ's death is represented as the sacrifice for sin prefigured by
 the Jewish sacrifices, compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:22-26,1Co+5:7,Heb+7:1-10:39">Ro 3:22-26;
 1Co 5:7,
 with Heb 7:1-10:39</A>.

 The phrase, "God of Peace," is peculiar to Paul, compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:20,Ro+15:33,1Th+5:23">Heb 13:20;
 Ro 15:33;

 Also, compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:4">Heb 2:4</A>,
 
 <I>Margin,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:4">1Co 12:4</A>.

 Justification, or "righteousness by faith." appears in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:7,10:38">Heb 11:7; 10:38</A>,

 as in

 Ga 3:11;
 Php 3:9</A>. 

 The word of God is the "sword of the Spirit," compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:12,Eph+6:17">Heb 4:12,
 with Eph 6:17</A>.

 Inexperienced Christians are <I>children</I> needing <I>milk,</I> that
 is, instruction in the <I>elements,</I> whereas riper Christians, as 
 <I>full-grown men,</I> require <I>strong meat,</I> compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:12,13,6:1,1Co+3:1,2,14,20">Heb 5:12, 13; 6:1,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:9,Col+3:14">Ga 4:9;
 Col 3:14</A>. 

 Salvation is represented as a <I>boldness of access to God by
 Christ,</I> compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:19,Ro+5:2,Eph+2:18,3:12">Heb 10:19,

 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:30,Col+2:1">Php 1:30;

 The Christian life is a <I>race,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:1">Heb 12:1</A>;
 
 compare

 The Jewish ritual is a <I>service,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:4">Ro 9:4</A>;
 
 compare 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:1,6">Heb 9:1, 6</A>.

 Compare "subject to bondage,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:15,Ga+5:1">Heb 2:15,
 with Ga 5:1</A>.

 Other characteristics of Paul's style appear in this Epistle; namely, a
 propensity "to go off at a word" and enter on a long parenthesis 
 suggested by that word, a fondness for play upon words of similar 
 sound, and a disposition to repeat some favorite word. Frequent appeals 
 to the Old Testament, and quotations linked by "and again," compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:5,2:12,13,Ro+15:9-12">Heb 1:5; 2:12, 13,
 with Ro 15:9-12</A>.

 Also quotations in a peculiar application, compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:8,1Co+15:27,Eph+1:22">Heb 2:8,
 with 1Co 15:27;
 Eph 1:22</A>.

 Also the same passage quoted in a form not agreeing with the
 <I>Septuagint,</I> and with the addition "saith the Lord," not found in 
 the <I>Hebrew,</I> in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:30,Ro+12:19">Heb 10:30;
 Ro 12:19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The supposed Alexandrian (which are rather Philon-like) characteristics 
 of the Epistle are probably due to the fact that the Hebrews were 
 generally then imbued with the Alexandrian modes of thought of 

 Philo, &c., and Paul, without coloring or altering Gospel truth "to the
 Jews, became (in style) as a Jew, that he might win the Jews"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:20">1Co 9:20</A>).

 This will account for its being recognized as Paul's Epistle in the
 Alexandrian and Jerusalem churches unanimously, to the Hebrews of whom 
 probably it was addressed. Not one Greek father ascribes the Epistle to 
 any but Paul, whereas in the Western and Latin churches, which it did 
 not reach for some time, it was for long doubted, owing to its 
 anonymous form, and generally less distinctively Pauline style. Their 
 reason for not accepting it as Paul's, or indeed as canonical, for the 
 first three centuries, was <I>negative,</I> insufficient evidence for 
 it, not positive evidence against it. The positive evidence is 
 generally for its Pauline origin. In the Latin churches, owing to their 
 distance from the churches to whom belonged the Hebrews addressed, 
 there was no generally received tradition on the subject. The Epistle 
 was in fact but little known at all, whence we find it is not mentioned 
 at all in the <I>Canon of Muratori.</I> When at last, in the fourth 
 century, the Latins found that it was received as Pauline and canonical 
 on good grounds in the Greek churches, they universally acknowledged it 
 as such.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>The personal notices</I> all favor its Pauline authorship, namely, his
 intention to visit those addressed, shortly, along with Timothy, styled
 "our brother,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:23">Heb 13:23</A>;

 his being then in prison, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:19">Heb 13:19</A>;

 his formerly having been imprisoned in Palestine, according to 
 <I>English Version</I> reading,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:34">Heb 10:34</A>;

 the salutations transmitted to them from believers of Italy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:24">Heb 13:24</A>.

 A reason for not prefixing the name may be the rhetorical character of 
 the Epistle which led the author to waive the usual form of epistolary 
 address.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 D<FONT SIZE=-1>ESIGN</FONT>.--His aim is to show the superiority of 
 Christianity over Judaism, in that it was introduced by one far higher 
 than the angels or Moses, through whom the Jews received the law, and 
 in that its priesthood and sacrifices are far less perfecting as to 
 salvation than those of Christ; that He is the substance of which the 
 former are but the shadow, and that the type necessarily gives place to 
 the antitype; and that now we no longer are kept at a comparative 
 distance as under the law, but have freedom of access through the 
 opened veil, that is, Christ's flesh; hence he warns them of the danger 
 of apostasy, to which Jewish converts were tempted, when they saw 
 Christians persecuted, while Judaism was tolerated by the Roman 
 authorities. He infers the obligations to a life of faith, of which, 
 even in the less perfect Old Testament dispensation, the Jewish history 
 contained bright examples. He concludes in the usual Pauline mode,
 with practical exhortations and pious prayers for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 H<FONT SIZE=-1>IS MODE OF ADDRESS</FONT> is in it hortatory rather than
 commanding, just as we might have expected from Paul addressing the
 Jews. He does not write to the <I>rulers</I> of the Jewish Christians,
 for in fact there was no exclusively Jewish Church; and his Epistle,
 though primarily addressed to the Palestinian Jews, was intended to
 include the Hebrews of all adjoining churches. He inculcates obedience
 and respect in relation to their rulers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:7,17,24">Heb 13:7, 17, 24</A>);

 a tacit obviating of the objection that he was by writing this Epistle
 interfering with the prerogative of Peter the apostle of the 
 circumcision, and James the bishop of Jerusalem. Hence arises his 
 gentle and delicate mode of dealing with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:22">Heb 13:22</A>).

 So far from being surprised at discrepancy of style between an Epistle 
 to Hebrews and Epistles to Gentile Christians, it is just what we 
 should expect. The Holy Spirit guided him to choose means best suited 
 to the nature of the ends aimed at. W<FONT SIZE=-1>ORDSWORTH</FONT> 
 notices a peculiar Pauline <I>Greek</I> construction,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:9">Ro 12:9</A>,

 literally, "Let your love be without dissimulation, ye abhorring 
 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. evil, cleaving to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. good," which is found 
 nowhere else save

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:5">Heb 13:5</A>,

 literally, "Let your conversation be without covetousness, ye being 
 content with," &c. (a noun singular feminine nominative absolute, 
 suddenly passing into a participle masculine nominative plural 
 absolute). So in quoting Old Testament Scripture, the writer of the 
 Epistle to the Hebrews quotes it as <I>a Jew</I> writing to Jews would, 
 "God <I>spoke</I> to our fathers," not, "it is <I>written.</I>" So

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:18">Heb 13:18</A>,

 "We trust we have a good conscience" is an altogether Pauline sentiment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:1,24:16,2Co+1:12,4:2,2Ti+1:3">Ac 23:1; 24:16;
 2Co 1:12; 4:2;
 2Ti 1:3</A>).

 Though he has not prefixed his name, he has given at the close his
 universal token to identify him, namely, his apostolic salutation, 
 "Grace be with you all"; this "salutation with his own hand" he 
 declared

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:17,18">2Th 3:17, 18</A>)
 
 to be "his token in every Epistle": so

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:21,23,Col+4:18">1Co 16:21, 23;
 Col 4:18</A>. 

 The same prayer of greeting closes <I>every one</I> of his Epistles,
 and is not found in any one of the Epistles of the other apostles
 written in Paul's lifetime; but it is found in the last book of the New
 Testament Revelation, and subsequently in the Epistle of 
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT> R<FONT SIZE=-1>OME</FONT>. This proves
 that, by whomsoever the body of the Epistle was committed to writing 
 (whether a mere amanuensis writing by dictation, or a companion of Paul 
 by the Spirit's gift of <I>interpreting tongues,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:10">1Co 12:10</A>,

 transfusing Paul's Spirit-taught sentiments into his own Spirit-guided 
 diction), Paul at the close sets his seal to the whole as really his, 
 and sanctioned by him as such. The churches of the East, and Jerusalem, 
 their center, to which quarter it was first sent, received it as Paul's 
 from the earliest times according to Cyril, Bishop of Jerusalem (<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 349). J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT>, though bringing
 with him from Rome the prejudices of the Latins against the Epistle to 
 the Hebrews, aggravated, doubtless, by its seeming sanction of the 
 Novatian heresy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:4-6">Heb 6:4-6</A>),

 was constrained by the force of facts to receive it as Paul's, on the 
 almost unanimous testimony of all Greek Christians from the earliest 
 times; and was probably the main instrument in correcting the past 
 error of Rome in rejecting it. The testimony of the Alexandrian Church 
 is peculiarly valuable, for it was founded by Mark, who was with Paul 
 at Rome in his first confinement, when this Epistle seems to have been 
 written

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:10">Col 4:10</A>),

 and who possibly was the bearer of this Epistle, at the same time 
 visiting Colosse on the way to Jerusalem (where Mark's mother lived), 
 and thence to Alexandria. Moreover,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:15,16">2Pe 3:15, 16</A>,

 written shortly before Peter's death, and like his first Epistle 
 written by him, "the apostle of the circumcision," to the 
 "<I>Hebrew</I>" Christians dispersed in the East, says, "As our beloved 
 brother Paul hath written <I>unto you</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:15">2Pe 3:15</A>),

 that is, to the <I>Hebrews;</I> also the words added, "As also in all 
 his Epistles"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:16">2Pe 3:16</A>),

 distinguish the <I>Epistle to the Hebrews</I> from the rest; then he 
 further speaks of it as on a level with "<I>other</I> Scriptures," thus 
 asserting at once its Pauline authorship and divine inspiration. An 
 interesting illustration of the power of Christian faith and love; 
 Peter, who had been openly rebuked by Paul

 fully adopted what Paul wrote; there was no difference in the Gospel of 
 the apostle of the circumcision and that of the apostle of the 
 uncircumcision. It strikingly shows God's sovereignty that He chose as 
 the instrument to confirm the <I>Hebrews,</I> Paul, <I>the apostle of 
 the Gentiles</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:13">Ro 11:13</A>);

 Rome, in the person of C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT>
 R<FONT SIZE=-1>OME</FONT>, originally received this
 Epistle. Then followed a period in which it ceased to be received by
 the Roman churches. Then, in the fourth century, Rome retracted her
 error. A plain proof she is not unchangeable or infallible. As far as
 Rome is concerned, the Epistle to the Hebrews was not only lost for
 three centuries, but never would have been recovered at all but for the
 Eastern churches; it is therefore a happy thing for Christendom that
 Rome is not the Catholic Church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It plainly was written before the destruction of Jerusalem, which
 would have been mentioned in the Epistle had that event gone before,
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:10">Heb 13:10</A>;

 and probably to churches in which the Jewish members were the more 
 numerous, as those in Judea, and perhaps Alexandria. In the latter city 
 were the greatest number of resident Jews next to Jerusalem. In 
 Leontopolis, in Egypt, was another temple, with the arrangements of 
 which, W<FONT SIZE=-1>IESELER</FONT> thinks the notices in this Epistle 
 more nearly corresponded than with those in Jerusalem. It was from 
 Alexandria that the Epistle appears first to have come to the knowledge 
 of Christendom. Moreover, "the Epistle to the Alexandrians," mentioned 
 in the <I>Canon of Muratori,</I> may possibly be this Epistle to the 
 Hebrews. He addresses the Jews as peculiarly "the people of God"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:17,4:9,13:12">Heb 2:17; 4:9; 13:12</A>),

 "the seed of Abraham," that is, as the primary stock on which Gentile
 believers are grafted, to which

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:16-24">Ro 11:16-24</A>

 corresponds; but he urges them to come out of the carnal earthly 
 Jerusalem and to realize their spiritual union to "the heavenly 
 Jerusalem"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:18-23,13:13">Heb 12:18-23; 13:13</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The use of <I>Greek</I> rather than <I>Hebrew</I> is doubtless due to
 the Epistle being intended, not merely for the Hebrew, but for the
 Hellenistic Jew converts, not only in Palestine, but elsewhere; a view
 confirmed by the use of the <I>Septuagint.</I> B<FONT
 SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT> thinks, probably (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:15,16">2Pe 3:15, 16</A>,

 explained above), the Jews primarily, though not exclusively,
 addressed, were those who had left Jerusalem on account of the war and
 were settled in Asia Minor.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The notion of its having been originally in <I>Hebrew</I> arose
 probably from its <I>Hebrew</I> tone, method, and topics. It is 
 reckoned among the Epistles, <I>not at first generally 
 acknowledged,</I> along with James, Second Peter, Second and Third 
 John, Jude, and Revelation. A beautiful link exists between these
 Epistles and <I>the universally acknowledged</I> Epistles. Hebrews
 unites the ordinances of Leviticus with their antitypical Gospel
 fulfilment. James is the link between the highest doctrines of
 Christianity and the universal law of moral duty--a commentary on the
 Sermon on the Mount--harmonizing the decalogue law of Moses, and the
 revelation to Job and Elias, with the Christian law of liberty. Second
 Peter links the teaching of Peter with that of Paul. Jude links the
 earliest unwritten to the latest written Revelation. The two shorter
 Epistles to John, like Philemon, apply Christianity to the minute 
 details of the Christian life, showing that Christianity can sanctify 
 all earthly relations.</P>

 For proofs of Paul being the author, see my <I>Introduction.</I> In the 
 Pauline method, the statement of subject and the division are put 
 before the discussion; and at the close, the practical follows the 
 doctrinal portion. The ardor of Spirit in this Epistle, as in First 
 John, bursting forth at once into the subject (without prefatory 
 inscription of name and greeting), the more effectively strikes the 
 hearers. The date must have been while the temple was yet standing, 
 before its destruction, <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 70; some time before 
 the martyrdom of Peter, who mentions this Epistle of Paul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:15,16">2Pe 3:15, 16</A>);

 <B>1. at sundry times</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "in many portions." All was 
 not revealed to each one prophet; but one received one portion of 
 revelation, and another another. To Noah the quarter of the world to 
 which Messiah should belong was revealed; to Abraham, the nation; to 
 Jacob, the tribe; to David and Isaiah, the family; to Micah, the town 
 of nativity; to Daniel, the exact time; to Malachi, the coming of His 
 forerunner, and His second advent; through Jonah, His burial and 
 resurrection; through Isaiah and Hosea, His resurrection. Each only 
 knew in part; but when that which was perfect came in Messiah, that 
 which was in part was done away

 The Old Testament revelations were fragmentary in substance, and 
 manifold in form; the very <I>multitude</I> of prophets shows that they 
 prophesied only <I>in part.</I> In Christ, the revelation of God is 
 full, not in shifting hues of separated color, but Himself the pure 
 light, uniting in His one person the whole spectrum

 not by the formula, "It is written," but "said," &c.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>in time past</B>--From Malachi, the last of the Old Testament 
 prophets, for four hundred years, there had arisen no prophet, in order 
 that the Son might be the more an object of expectation [B<FONT

 <I>spoken</I> here; so God the Son,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:3">Heb 2:3</A>;

 ambassador, not (as the King of kings) <I>in</I> his ambassador. The 
 Son is the last and highest manifestation of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:34,37">Mt 21:34, 37</A>);

 here quoted applied primarily in a less full sense to Solomon, of whom 
 God promised by Nathan to David. "I will be his father and he shall be 
 my son." But as the whole theocracy was of Messianic import, the 
 triumph of David over Hadadezer and neighboring kings

 He sets (<I>Hebrew,</I> "anointed,"

 on His "holy hill of Zion," as King of the Jews and of the whole earth. 
 the antitype to Solomon, son of David. The "I" in <I>Greek</I> is 
 emphatic; <I>I</I> the Everlasting Father have begotten Thee this day, 
 that is, on this day, the day of Thy being manifested as My Son, "the 
 first-<I>begotten</I> of the dead"

 when Thou hast ransomed and opened heaven to Thy people. He had been
 always Son, but now first was manifested as such in His once humbled, 
 now exalted manhood united to His Godhead. A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>
 refers "this day" to the <I>eternal</I> generation of the Son: the day 
 in which the Son was begotten by the Father is an everlasting 
 <I>to-day:</I> there never was a yesterday or past time to Him, nor a 
 to-morrow or future time: "Nothing there is to come, and nothing past, 
 but an eternal NOW doth ever last"

 The communication of the divine essence in its fulness, involves
 eternal generation; for the divine essence has no beginning. But the 
 context refers to a definite point of time, namely, that of His having 
 entered on the <I>inheritance</I>

 "Worship Him all ye gods" ("gods," that is, <I>exalted beings,</I> as
 <I>angels</I>), refers to <I>God;</I> but it was universally admitted 
 among the Hebrews that God would dwell, in a peculiar sense, in Messiah 
 (so as to be in the Talmud phrase, "capable of being pointed to with 
 the finger"); and so what was said of God was true of, and to be 
 fulfilled in, Messiah. K<FONT SIZE=-1>IMCHI</FONT> says that the
 ninety-third through the hundred first Psalms contain in them the 
 mystery of Messiah. God ruled the theocracy in and through Him.

 (quoted in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:5">Heb 1:5</A>),

 is called "God's <I>first-born,</I> higher than the <I>kings</I> of the 
 earth"; so the antitypical first-begotten, the son of David, is to be 
 worshipped by all inferior <I>lords,</I> such as <I>angels</I> ("gods,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:7">Ps 97:7</A>);

 for He is "King of kings and Lord of lords"

 In the <I>Greek,</I> "again" is transposed; but this does not oblige 
 us, as A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> thinks, to translate, "when He 
 <I>again shall have introduced,</I>" &c., namely, at Christ's second
 coming; for there is no previous mention of a <I>first</I> bringing in; 
 and "again" is often used in quotations, not to be joined with the 
 verb, but parenthetically ("that I may again quote Scripture").

 directing powers of winds and flames, when these latter are required to
 perform His will. "Commissions them to assume the agency or form of
 flames for His purposes" [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>].
 <I>English Version,</I> "maketh His angels <I>spirits,</I>" means, He
 maketh them of a subtle, incorporeal nature, swift as the wind. So

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:10">Ps 18:10</A>,

 "a <I>cherub</I> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the wings of the <I>wind.</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:14">Heb 1:14</A>,

 "ministering <I>spirits,</I>" favors <I>English Version</I> here. As 
 "spirits" implies the wind-like velocity and subtle nature of the 
 <I>cherubim,</I> so "flame of fire" expresses the burning devotion and 
 intense all-consuming zeal of the adoring <I>seraphim</I> (meaning 
 "burning),

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:1">Isa 6:1</A>.

 The translation, "maketh winds His messengers, and a flame of fire His 
 <I>ministers</I> (!)," is plainly wrong. In the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:3,4">Ps 104:3, 4</A>,

 the subject in each clause comes first, and the attribute predicated of 
 it second; so the <I>Greek</I> article here marks "angels" and 
 "ministers" as the <I>subjects,</I> and "winds" and "flame of fire," 
 <I>predicates, Schemoth Rabba</I> says, "God is called God of Zebaoth 
 (the heavenly hosts), because He does what He pleases with His angels. 
 When He pleases, He makes them to sit

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:7">Ps 45:7</A>,

 "O God, Thy God, hath anointed thee," whereby Christ is addressed as 
 God. This is probably the true translation of the <I>Hebrew</I> there, 
 and also of the <I>Greek</I> of Hebrews here; for it is likely the Son 
 is addressed, "O God," as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:8">Heb 1:8</A>.

 The <I>anointing</I> here meant is not that at His baptism, when He 
 solemnly entered on His ministry for us; but that with the "oil of 
 gladness," or "exulting joy" (which denotes a <I>triumph,</I> and 
 follows as the consequence of His manifested <I>love of 
 righteousness</I> and <I>hatred of iniquity</I>), wherewith, after His 
 triumphant completion of His work, He has been anointed by the Father 
 above His fellows (not only above us, His fellow men, the adopted 
 members of God's family, whom "He is not ashamed to call His brethren,"
 but above the angels, fellow partakers in part with Him, though 
 infinitely His inferiors, in the glories, holiness, and joys of heaven; 
 "sons of God," and angel "messengers," though subordinate to the divine 
 Angel--"Messenger of the covenant"). Thus He is antitype to Solomon, 
 "chosen of all David's many sons to sit upon the throne of the kingdom 
 of the Lord over Israel," even as His father David was chosen before 
 all the house of his father's sons. The image is drawn from the custom 
 of anointing guests at feasts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:5">Ps 23:5</A>);

 or rather of anointing kings: not until His ascension did He assume the 
 <I>kingdom</I> as Son of man. A fuller accomplishment is yet to be, 
 when He shall be <FONT SIZE=-1>VISIBLY</FONT> the anointed King over 
 the whole earth (set by the Father) on His holy hill of Zion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:6,8">Ps 2:6, 8</A>.

 So David, His type, was first anointed at Bethlehem

 and yet again at Hebron, first over Judah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+2:4">2Sa 2:4</A>),
 
 then over all Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:3">2Sa 5:3</A>);

 not till the death of Saul did he enter on his actual kingdom; as it 
 was not till after Christ's death that the Father set Him at His right 
 hand far above all principalities

 The
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:1-17">forty-fifth Psalm</A>

 Gethsemane,

 and the first proclamation of the Gospel kingdom by the Lord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:17">Mt 4:17</A>),

 "spake .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. spoken." Appropriately also in his Epistles to 
 Gentiles, he dwells on his independent call to the apostleship of the 
 Gentiles; in his Epistle to the Hebrews, he appeals to the apostles who 
 had been long with the Lord (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:21,10:41">Ac 1:21; 10:41</A>):

 "The world to come" is the new dispensation brought in by Christ,
 beginning in grace here, to be completed in glory hereafter. It is 
 called "to come," or "about to be," as at the time of its being 
 subjected to Christ by the divine decree, it was as yet a thing of the 
 future, and is still so to us, in respect to its full consummation. In 
 respect to the <I>subjecting</I> of all things to Christ in fulfilment 
 of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:1-9">Ps 8:1-9</A>,

 the realization is still "to come." Regarded from the Old Testament 
 standpoint, which looks prophetically forward to the New Testament (and 
 the Jewish priesthood and Old Testament ritual were in force then when 
 Paul wrote, and continued till their forcible abrogation by the 
 destruction of Jerusalem), it is "the world to come"; Paul, as 
 addressing Jews, appropriately calls it so, according to their 
 conventional way of viewing it. We, like them, still pray, "Thy kingdom 
 come"; for its <I>manifestation</I> in glory is yet future. "This 
 world" is used in contrast to express the present fallen condition of 
 the world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:2">Eph 2:2</A>).

 Believers belong not to this present world course, but by faith rise in 
 spirit to "the world to come," making it a present, though internal. 
 reality. Still, in the present world, natural and social, angels are 
 mediately rulers under God in some sense: not so in the coming world: 
 man in it, and the Son of man, man's Head, are to be supreme. Hence 
 greater reverence was paid to angels by men in the Old Testament than 
 is permitted in the New Testament. For man's nature is exalted in 
 Christ now, so that angels are our "fellow servants"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:9">Re 22:9</A>).

 In their ministrations they stand on a different footing from that on 
 which they stood towards us in the Old Testament. We are "brethren" of 
 Christ in a nearness not enjoyed even by angels

 Christ; and our <I>brotherhood</I> with Him flows from <I>God</I> being

 Israel, and Rezin of Syria, but on Jehovah; and then foretells the 
 deliverance of Judah by God, in language which finds its antitypical

 Messiah. Christ, the antitypical Prophet, similarly, instead of the

 the <I>Greek</I>) He overcame death. "Jesus suffering death overcame; 
 Satan wielding death succumbed" [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]. As David 
 cut off the head of Goliath with the giant's own sword wherewith the 
 latter was wont to win his victories. Coming to redeem mankind, Christ 
 made Himself a sort of hook to destroy the devil; for in Him there was 
 His humanity to attract the devourer to Him, His divinity to pierce 
 him, apparent weakness to provoke, hidden power to transfix the hungry 
 ravisher. The <I>Latin</I> epigram says, <I>Mors mortis morti mortem 
 nisi morte tu lisset, &AElig;tern&aelig;</I> <I>vit&aelig; janua clausa

 "Bondage" is defined by Aristotle, "The living not as one chooses";

 <B>it behooved him</B>--by moral necessity, considering what the 
 justice and love of God required of Him as Mediator (compare

 the office which He had voluntarily undertaken in order to "help" man

 "the seed of Abraham"

 <B>be,</B> &c.--rather as <I>Greek,</I> "that He might <I>become</I> 
 High Priest"; He was <I>called</I> so, when He was "made perfect by the 
 things which He suffered"

 He was actually <I>made</I> so, when He entered within the veil, from
 which last flows His ever continuing intercession as Priest for us. The 
 death, as man, must first be, in order that the bringing in of the 
 blood into the heavenly Holy Place might follow, in which consisted the 
 expiation as High Priest.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>merciful</B>--to "the <I>people</I>" deserving wrath by "sins." 
 <I>Mercy</I> is a prime requisite in a priest, since his office is to 
 help the wretched and raise the fallen: such <I>mercy</I> is most 
 likely to be found in one who has a fellow-feeling with the afflicted, 
 having been so once Himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:15">Heb 4:15</A>);

 not that the Son of God needed to be taught by suffering to be 
 merciful, but that in order to save us He needed to take our manhood 
 with all its sorrows, thereby qualifying Himself, by experimental 
 suffering with us, to be our sympathizing High Priest, and assuring us 
 of His entire fellow-feeling with us in every sorrow. So in the main

 Zec 6:13</A>, 

 and in this Epistle, is Christ expressly called a <I>priest.</I> In
 this Epistle alone His priesthood is professedly discussed; whence it 
 is evident how necessary is this book of the New Testament. In

 there is added mention of the <I>kingdom</I> of Christ, which elsewhere
 is spoken of without the <I>priesthood,</I> and that frequently. On the 
 cross, whereon as Priest He offered the sacrifice, He had the title 
 "King" inscribed over Him [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>to make reconciliation for the sins</B>--rather as <I>Greek,</I> "to 
 propitiate (in respect to) the sins"; "to expiate the sins." Strictly 
 divine <I>justice</I> is "propitiated"; but God's <I>love</I> is as 
 much from everlasting as His justice; therefore, lest Christ's 
 sacrifice, or its typical forerunners, the legal sacrifices, should be 
 thought to be antecedent to God's grace and love, neither are said in 
 the Old or New Testament to have <I>propitiated God;</I> otherwise 
 Christ's sacrifices might have been thought to have first induced God 
 to love and pity man, instead of (as the fact really is) His love 
 having <I>originated</I> Christ's sacrifice, whereby divine justice and 
 divine love are harmonized. The sinner is brought by that sacrifice 
 into God's favor, which by sin he had forfeited; hence his right prayer 
 is, "God <I>be propitiated</I> (so the <I>Greek</I>) to me who am a 
 sinner"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:13">Lu 18:13</A>).

 As Moses especially was the prophet by whom "God in times past spake to 
 the fathers," being the mediator of the law, Paul deems it necessary 
 now to show that, great as was Moses, the Son of God is greater.
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>BRARD</FONT> in A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> remarks, The 
 angel of the covenant came in the name of God before Israel; Moses in
 the name of Israel before God; whereas the high priest came <I>both</I> 
 in the name of God (bearing the name J<FONT SIZE=-1>EHOVAH</FONT> on 
 his forehead) before Israel, and in the name of Israel (bearing the 
 names of the twelve tribes on his breast) before God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:9-29,36,38">Ex 28:9-29, 36, 38</A>).

 Now Christ is above the angels, according to the first and second
 chapters because (1) as Son of God He is higher; and (2) because 
 manhood, though originally lower than angels, is in Him exalted above 
 them to the lordship of "the world to come," inasmuch as He is at once 
 Messenger of God to men, and also atoning Priest-Representative of men 
 before God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:17,18">Heb 2:17, 18</A>).

 Parallel with this line of argument as to His superiority to angels

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:4">Heb 1:4</A>)

 runs that which here follows as to His superiority to Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:3">Heb 3:3</A>):

 (1) because as <I>Son</I> over the house; He is above the 
 <I>servant</I> in the house

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:5,6">Heb 3:5, 6</A>),

 just as the <I>angels</I> were shown to be but <I>ministering</I> 
 (serving) spirits

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:14">Heb 1:14</A>),
 
 whereas He is the <I>Son</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:7,8">Heb 3:7, 8</A>);

 (2) because the bringing of Israel into the promised rest, which was 
 not finished by Moses, is accomplished by Him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:1-11">Heb 4:1-11</A>),

 through His being not merely a leader and lawgiver as Moses, but also a 
 propitiatory High Priest

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:14,5:10">Heb 4:14; 5:10</A>).</P>

 <B>1. Wherefore</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "Whence," that is, seeing we have 
 such a sympathizing Helper you ought to "consider attentively," 
 "contemplate"; fix your eyes and mind on Him with a view to profiting 
 by the contemplation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:2">Heb 12:2</A>).

 The <I>Greek</I> word is often used by Luke, Paul's companion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:24,27">Lu 12:24, 27</A>).

 heaven whence it comes.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:14">Php 3:14</A>,

 "the high calling"; <I>Greek</I> "the calling <I>above,</I>" that is, 
 <I>heavenly.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the Apostle and High Priest of our profession</B>--There is but one 
 <I>Greek</I> article to both nouns, "Him who is at once Apostle and 
 High Priest"--<I>Apostle,</I> as Ambassador (a higher designation than 
 "angel"-<I>messenger</I>) sent by the Father

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:21">Joh 20:21</A>),

 pleading the cause of <I>God with us; High Priest,</I> as pleading 
 <I>our</I> cause <I>with God.</I> Both His Apostleship and High 
 Priesthood are comprehended in the one title, <I>Mediator</I> 
 [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]. Though the title "Apostle" is nowhere
 else applied to Christ, it is appropriate here in addressing Hebrews, 
 who used the term of the delegates sent by the high priest to collect 
 the temple tribute from Jews resident in foreign countries, even as 
 Christ was Delegate of the Father to this world far off from Him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:37">Mt 21:37</A>).

 Hence as what applies to Him, applies also to His people, the Twelve
 are designated His apostles, even as He is the Father's

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:21">Joh 20:21</A>).

 It was desirable to avoid designating Him here "angel," in order to 
 distinguish His nature from that of angels mentioned before, though he 
 is "the Angel of the Covenant." The "legate of the Church" (<I>Sheliach 
 Tsibbur</I>) offered up the prayers in the synagogue in the name of 
 all, and for all. So Jesus, "the Apostle of our profession," is 
 <I>delegated</I> to intercede for the Church before the Father. The 
 words "of our profession," mark that it is not of the legal ritual, but 
 of our Christian faith, that He is the High Priest. Paul compares Him 
 as an <I>Apostle</I> to Moses; as High Priest to Aaron. He alone holds 
 both offices combined, and in a more eminent degree than either, which 
 those two brothers held apart.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>profession</B>--"confession," corresponds to God having
 <I>spoken</I> to us by His Son, sent as Apostle and High Priest. What 
 God proclaims we confess.</P>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]. The <I>Greek</I> verb is used purposely 
 instead of "builded," in order to mark that the building meant is not a 
 literal, but a spiritual house: the Church both of the Old Testament 
 and New Testament; and that the building of such a house includes all 
 the <I>preparations</I> of providence and grace needed to furnish it 
 with "living stones" and fitting "servants." Thus, as Christ the 
 Founder and Establisher (in Old Testament as well as the New Testament) 
 is greater than the house so established, including the servants, He is 
 greater also than Moses, who was but a "servant." Moses, as a servant, 
 is a portion of the house, and less than the house; Christ, as the 
 Instrumental Creator of all things, must be God, and so greater than 
 the house of which Moses was but a part. <I>Glory</I> is the result of

 not unite with the hearers in faith." The word heard being the food 
 which, as the bread of life, must pass into flesh and blood through 
 man's appropriating it to himself in faith. Hearing alone is of as
 little value as undigested food in a bad stomach [T<FONT

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>as he said</B>--God's saying that <I>unbelief</I> excludes from 
 entrance implies that <I>belief</I> gains an entrance into the rest. 
 What, however, Paul mainly here dwells on in the quotation is that the 
 promised "<I>rest</I>" has not <I>yet</I> been entered into. At

 he again, as in

 already, takes up <I>faith</I> as the indispensable qualification for 
 entering it.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>although,</B> &c.--Although God had finished His works of creation 
 and entered on <I>His</I> rest from creation long before Moses' time, 
 yet under that leader of Israel another rest was promised, which most 
 fell short of through unbelief; and although the rest in Canaan was 
 subsequently attained under Joshua, yet long after, in David's days, 
 God, in the ninety-fifth Psalm, still speaks of <I>the rest of God</I> 
 as not yet attained. T<FONT SIZE=-1>HEREFORE</FONT>, there must be 
 meant a rest <I>still future,</I> namely, that which "remaineth for the 
 people of God" in heaven,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:3-9">Heb 4:3-9</A>,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:10">Heb 4:10</A>.

 <B>God did rest the seventh day</B>--a rest not ending with the seventh 
 day, but beginning then and still continuing, into which believers 
 shall hereafter enter. God's rest is not a rest necessitated by 
 fatigue, nor consisting in idleness, but is that upholding and 
 governing of which creation was the beginning [A<FONT

 first six days, but not of the seventh.

 <B>a rest</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "Sabbatism." In time there are many 
 Sabbaths, but then there shall be the enjoyment and keeping of a 
 Sabbath-rest: one perfect and eternal. The "rest" in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:8">Heb 4:8</A>

 is <I>Greek,</I> "<I>catapausis;</I>" <I>Hebrew,</I> "<I>Noah</I>"; 
 rest from weariness, as the ark rested on Ararat after its tossings to 
 and fro; and as Israel, under Joshua, enjoyed at last rest from war in 
 Canaan. But the "rest" in this

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:9">Heb 4:9</A>

 is the nobler and more exalted (<I>Hebrew</I>) "<I>Sabbath</I>" 
 <I>rest;</I> literally, "cessation": rest from <I>work when 
 finished</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:4">Heb 4:4</A>),
 
 as God rested 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:17">Re 16:17</A>).

 The two ideas of "rest" combined, give the perfect view of the heavenly 
 Sabbath. Rest from weariness, sorrow, and sin; and rest in the 
 completion of God's new creation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:5">Re 21:5</A>).

 The whole renovated creation shall share in it; nothing will there be

 Moses, the representative of the law, could not lead Israel into 
 Canaan: the law leads us to Christ, and there its office ceases, as 
 that of Moses on the borders of Canaan: it is Jesus, the antitype of 
 Joshua, who leads us into the heavenly rest. This verse indirectly 
 establishes the obligation of the Sabbath still; for the type continues 
 until the antitype supersedes it: so legal sacrifices continued till 
 the great antitypical Sacrifice superseded it, As then the antitypical 
 heavenly Sabbath-rest will not be till Christ, our Gospel Joshua, 
 comes, to usher us into it, the typical earthly Sabbath must continue 
 till then. The Jews call the future rest "the day which is all 
 Sabbath."</P>

 The work and subsequent rest of God are the archetype to which we 
 should be conformed. The argument is: He who once enters rest, rests 
 from labors; but God's people have not yet rested from them, therefore 
 they have not yet entered the rest, and so it must be still future. 
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> translates, "He that entered into his (or

 Joshua, who, having entered His rest at the Ascension, has ceased or 
 rested from His work of the new creation, as God on the seventh day 
 rested from the work of physical creation. Not that He has ceased to 
 carry on the work of redemption, nay, He upholds it by His mediation; 
 but He has ceased from those portions of the work which constitute the 
 foundation; the sacrifice has been once for all accomplished. Compare 
 as to God's creation rest, once for all completed, and rested from, but

 into such <I>disobedience</I> (so the <I>Greek</I> for 'unbelief'

 power, whereby it doomed the disobedient Israelites to exclusion from 
 Canaan, and shall exclude unbelieving so-called Christians from the 
 heavenly rest. The written Word of God is not the prominent thought 
 here, though the passage is often quoted as if it were. Still the word 
 of God (the same as that preached,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:2">Heb 4:2</A>),

 used here in the broadest sense, but with special reference to its 
 <I>judicial</I> power, <FONT SIZE=-1>INCLUDES</FONT> the Word of God, 
 the sword of the Spirit with double edge, one edge for convicting and 
 converting some

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:2">Heb 4:2</A>),

 and the other for condemning and destroying the unbelieving

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:14">Heb 4:14</A>).

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:15">Re 19:15</A>

 similarly represents the Word's judicial power as a sharp sword going 
 out of Christ's mouth to <I>smite</I> the nations. The same word which 
 is saving to the faithful

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:2">Heb 4:2</A>)
 
 is destroying to the disobedient

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:15,16">2Co 2:15, 16</A>).

 The personal Word, to whom some refer the passage, is not here meant: 
 for He <I>is</I> not the sword, but <I>has</I> the sword. Thus
 reference to Joshua appropriately follows in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:8">Heb 4:8</A>.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:17">Eph 6:17</A>).

 Its <I>double</I> power seems to be implied by its being "two-edged." 
 "It judges all that is in the heart, for there it passes through, at 
 once <I>punishing</I> [unbelievers] and searching [both believers and 
 unbelievers]" [C<FONT SIZE=-1>HRYSOSTOM</FONT>]. P<FONT
 SIZE=-1>HILO</FONT> similarly speaks of "God passing between the parts 
 of Abraham's sacrifices

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:17">Ge 15:17</A>,

 where, however, it is a 'burning lamp' that passed between the pieces) 
 with His word, which is the cutter of all things: which sword, being 
 sharpened to the utmost keenness, never ceases to divide all sensible 
 things, and even things not perceptible to sense or physically 
 divisible, but perceptible and divisible by the word." Paul's early 
 training, both in the <I>Greek</I> schools of Tarsus and the Hebrew 
 schools at Jerusalem, accounts fully for his acquaintance with Philo's 
 modes of thought, which were sure to be current among learned Jews 
 everywhere, though Philo himself belonged to Alexandria, not Jerusalem. 
 Addressing Jews, he by the Spirit sanctions what was true in their 
 current literature, as he similarly did in addressing Gentiles

 <B>even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit</B>--that is, 
 reaching through even to the separation of the animal <I>soul,</I> the 
 lower part of man's incorporeal nature, the seat of animal desires, 
 which he has in common with the brutes; compare the same <I>Greek,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:14">1Co 2:14</A>,

 "the natural [animal-souled] man"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:19">Jude 19</A>),

 from the spirit (the higher part of man, receptive of the Spirit of
 God, and allying him to heavenly beings).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and of the joints and marrow</B>--rather, "(<I>reaching even</I> 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>TO</FONT>) <I>both</I> the joints (so as to divide them) 
 and marrow." Christ "knows what is in man"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:25">Joh 2:25</A>):

 so His word reaches as far as to the most intimate and accurate 
 knowledge of man's most hidden parts, feelings, and thoughts, dividing, 
 that is, <I>distinguishing</I> what is <I>spiritual</I> from what is 
 <I>carnal</I> and <I>animal</I> in him, the <I>spirit</I> from the 
 <I>soul:</I> so

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+20:27">Pr 20:27</A>.

 As the knife of the Levitical priest reached to dividing parts, closely 
 united as the <I>joints</I> of the limbs, and penetrated to the 
 innermost parts, as the <I>marrows</I> (the <I>Greek</I> is 
 <I>plural</I>); so the word of God divides the closely joined parts of 
 man's immaterial being, soul and spirit, and penetrates to the 
 innermost parts of the spirit. The clause (reaching even to) 
 "<I>both</I> the joints and marrow" is subordinate to the clause, "even 
 to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit." (In the oldest manuscripts 
 as in <I>English Version,</I> there is no "both," as there is in the 
 clause "<I>both</I> the joints <I>and</I> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which marks 
 the latter to be subordinate). An image (appropriate in addressing
 Jews) from the literal dividing of joints, and penetrating to, so as to 
 open out, the marrow, by the priest's knife, illustrating the 
 previously mentioned spiritual "dividing of soul from spirit," whereby 
 each (soul as well as spirit) is laid bare and "naked" before God; this 
 view accords with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:13">Heb 4:13</A>.

 Evidently "the dividing of the soul from the spirit" answers to the 
 "joints" which <I>the sword, when it reaches</I> unto, <I>divides 
 asunder,</I> as the "spirit" answers to the innermost "marrow." "Moses 
 forms the soul, Christ the spirit. The soul draws with it the body; the 
 spirit draws with it both soul and body." A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD'S</FONT> 
 interpretation is clumsy, by which he makes the soul <I>itself,</I> and 
 the spirit <I>itself,</I> to be divided, instead of the soul 
 <I>from</I> the spirit: so also he makes not only the <I>joints</I> to 
 be divided asunder, but the <I>marrow</I> also to be divided (?). The 
 Word's dividing and far penetrating power has both a punitive and a 
 healing effect.

 the forms of temptation than we who are weak can; His will repelled 
 them as instantaneously as the fire does the drop of water cast into 
 it. He, therefore, experimentally knew what power was needed to 
 overcome temptations. He is capable of sympathizing, for He was at the

 ordination in the Christian ministry; but the reference here is to the 
 <I>priesthood,</I> not the Christian <I>ministry.</I> The analogy in 
 our Christian dispensation would warn ministers, seeing that God has 
 separated them from the congregation of His people to bring them near 
 Himself, and to do the service of His house, and to minister (as He 
 separated the Levites, Korah with his company), that content with this, 
 they should beware of assuming the sacrificial priesthood also, which 
 belongs to Christ alone. The sin of Korah was, not content with the 
 ministry as a Levite, he took the sacerdotal priesthood also. No 
 Christian minister, as such, is ever called <I>Hiereus,</I> that is, 
 sacrificing priest. All Christians, without distinction, whether 
 ministers or people, have a metaphorical, not a literal, priesthood. 
 The sacrifices which they offer are spiritual, not literal, their 
 bodies and the fruit of their lips, praises continually

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:15">Heb 13:15</A>).

 Christ alone had a proper and true sacrifice to offer. The law 
 sacrifices were typical, not metaphorical, as the Christian's, nor 
 proper and true, as Christ's. In Roman times the Mosaic restriction of 
 the priesthood to Aaron's family was violated.</P>

 His cry showed His entire participation of man's infirmity: His
 reference of His wish to the will of God, His sinless faith and 
 obedience.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>heard in that he feared</B>--There is no intimation in the 
 twenty-second Psalm, or the Gospels that Christ prayed to be saved from 
 the mere act of dying. What He feared was the hiding of the Father's 
 countenance. His holy filial love must rightly have shrunk from this 
 strange and bitterest of trials without the imputation of impatience. 
 To have been passively content at the approach of such a cloud would 
 have been, not faith, but sin. The cup of death He prayed to be freed 
 from was, not corporal, but spiritual death, that is, the (temporary) 
 separation of His human soul from the light of God's countenance. His 
 prayer was "heard" in His Father's strengthening Him so as to hold fast 
 His unwavering faith under the trial (<I>My</I> God, <I>my</I> God, was 
 still His filial cry under it, still claiming God as His, though God
 hid His face), and soon removing it in answer to His cry during the 
 darkness on the cross, "My God, my God," &c. But see below a further 
 explanation of how He was heard. The <I>Greek</I> literally, is, "Was 
 heard <I>from His fear,</I>" that is, so as to be saved from His fear. 
 Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:21">Ps 22:21</A>,

 which well accords with this, "Save me <I>from</I> the lion's mouth 
 (His prayer): thou hast heard me <I>from</I> the horns of the 
 unicorns." Or what better accords with the strict meaning of the 
 <I>Greek</I> noun, "<I>in consequence of His</I> <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>REVERENTIAL FEAR</FONT>," that is, in that He <I>shrank 
 from</I> the horrors of separation from the bright presence of the 
 Father, yet was <I>reverentially cautious</I> by no thought or word of 
 impatience to give way to a shadow of distrust or want of perfect 
 filial love. In the same sense

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:28">Heb 12:28</A>
 
 uses the noun, and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:7">Heb 11:7</A>

 the verb. A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> somewhat similarly translates, 
 "By reason of His reverent submission." I prefer "reverent 
 <I>fear.</I>" The word in derivation means the <I>cautious handling</I> 
 of some precious, yet delicate vessel, which with ruder handling might
 easily be broken [T<FONT SIZE=-1>RENCH</FONT>]. This fully agrees with
 Jesus' spirit, "If it be possible .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <I>nevertheless not
 My will, but Thy will be done</I>"; and with the context,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:5">Heb 5:5</A>,

 "Glorified not Himself to be made an High Priest," implying <I>reverent 
 fear:</I> wherein it appears He had the requisite for the office 
 specified

 "No man taketh this honor unto himself." A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> 
 well says, What is true in the Christian's life, that what we ask from 
 God, though He may not grant in the form we wish, yet He grants in His 
 own, and that a better form, does not hold good in Christ's case; for 
 Christ's real prayer, "not My will, but Thine be done," in consistency 
 with His reverent fear towards the Father, was granted in the very form 
 in which it was expressed, not in another.</P>

 The <I>solid meat,</I> or <I>food,</I> is not absolutely necessary for 
 preserving life, but is so for acquiring greater strength. Especially 
 in the case of the Hebrews, who were much given to allegorical 
 interpretations of their law, which they so much venerated, the 
 application of the Old Testament types, to Christ and His High 
 Priesthood, was calculated much to strengthen them in the Christian

 <I>vital</I> principle of faith and love toward God, and so counted, 
 like their doer, <I>dead</I> before God. This <I>repentance from dead 
 works</I> is therefore paired with "faith toward God." The three pairs 
 of truths enumerated are designedly such as J<FONT SIZE=-1>EWISH</FONT> 
 believers might in some degree have known from the Old Testament, but 
 had been taught more clearly when they became Christians. This accounts 
 for the omission of <I>distinct</I> specification of some essential 
 first principle of Christian truth. Hence, too, he mentions "faith 
 toward <I>God,</I>" and not <I>explicitly</I> faith toward 
 <I>Christ</I> (though of course included). Repentance and faith were 
 the first principles taught under the Gospel.</P>

 <B>2. the doctrine of baptisms</B>--paired with "laying on of hands," 
 as the latter followed on Christian baptism, and answers to the rite of 
 <I>confirmation</I> in Episcopal churches. Jewish believers passed, by 
 an easy transition, from Jewish <I>baptismal purifications</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:10">Heb 9:10</A>,

 "washings"), baptism of proselytes, and John's baptism, and legal 
 imposition of hands, to their Christian analogues, <I>baptism,</I> and 
 the subsequent <I>laying on of hands,</I> accompanied by the gift of
 the Holy Ghost (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:4">Heb 6:4</A>).

 <I>Greek,</I> "<I>baptismoi,</I>" plural, including <I>Jewish</I> and 
 <I>Christian baptisms,</I> are to be distinguished from 
 <I>baptisma,</I> singular, <I>restricted</I> to Christian baptism. The 
 six particulars here specified had been, as it were, <I>the Christian 
 Catechism</I> of the Old Testament; and such Jews who had begun to 
 recognize Jesus as the Christ immediately on the new light being shed 
 on these fundamental particulars, were accounted as having the 
 elementary <I>principles</I> of the doctrine of Christ [B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]. The first and most obvious elementary 
 instruction of Jews would be the <I>teaching</I> them the typical 
 significance of their own ceremonial law in its Christian fulfilment 
 [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:13">Php 2:13</A>).
 
 The "for" in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:4">Heb 6:4</A>

 refers to this: I say, if God permit, <I>for</I> there are cases where 
 God does not permit, for example, "it is impossible," &c. Without God's 
 blessing, the cultivation of the ground does not succeed

 <B>for those</B>--"in the case of those."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>once enlightened</B>--once for all illuminated by the word of God 
 taught in connection with "baptism" (to which, in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:2">Heb 6:2</A>,

 as once for all done," once enlightened" here answers); compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:26">Eph 5:26</A>.

 This passage probably originated the application of the term
 "illumination" to baptism in subsequent times. <I>Illumination,</I>
 however, was not supposed to be the inseparable accompaniment of
 <I>baptism:</I> thus C<FONT SIZE=-1>HRYSOSTOM</FONT> says, "Heretics
 have <I>baptism,</I> not <I>illumination:</I> they are baptized in
 body, but not enlightened in soul: as Simon Magus was baptized, but not
 illuminated." That "enlightened" here means <I>knowledge of the word of
 truth,</I> appears from comparing the same <I>Greek</I> word
 "illuminated,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:32,Heb+10:26">Heb 10:32,
 with Heb 10:26</A>,

 where "knowledge of the truth" answers to it.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>tasted of the heavenly gift</B>--tasted <I>for themselves.</I> As 
 "enlightened" refers to the sense of <I>sight:</I> so here <I>taste</I> 
 follows. "The heavenly gift"; <I>Christ</I> given by the Father and 
 revealed by the enlightening word preached and written: as conferring 
 peace in the remission of sins; and as the Bestower of the gift of the 
 Holy Spirit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:19,20">Ac 8:19, 20</A>),

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>made partakers of the Holy Ghost</B>--specified as distinct from, 
 though so inseparably connected with, "enlightened," and "tasted of the 
 heavenly gift," Christ, as answering to "laying on of hands" after 
 baptism, which was then generally accompanied with the impartation of 
 <I>the Holy Ghost</I> in miraculous <I>gifts.</I></P>

 <A NAME="Heb6_5"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>5. tasted the good word of God</B>--distinct from "tasted
 <FONT SIZE=-1>OF</FONT> (genitive) the heavenly gift"; we do not yet
 enjoy <I>all</I> the fulness of Christ, but only have a taste 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>OF</FONT> Him, the heavenly gift now; but believers may
 taste the <I>whole</I> word (accusative case) of God already, namely, 
 God's "good word <I>of promise.</I>" The Old Testament promise of 
 Canaan to Israel typified "the good word of God's" promise of the 
 heavenly rest

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:1-16">Heb 4:1-16</A>).

 Therefore, there immediately follows the clause, "the powers of the 
 world to come." As "enlightening" and "tasting of the heavenly gift," 
 Christ, the Bread of Life, answers to <FONT SIZE=-1>FAITH</FONT>: so 
 "made partakers of the Holy Ghost," to <FONT SIZE=-1>CHARITY</FONT>, 
 which is the first-fruit of the Spirit: and "tasted the good word of 
 <I>God,</I> and the powers of the world to come," to <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>HOPE</FONT>. Thus the triad of privileges answers to the 
 Trinity, the Father, Son, and Spirit, in their respective works toward 
 us. "The world to come," is the Christian dispensation, viewed 
 especially in its <I>future glories,</I> though already begun in grace 
 here. The <I>world to come</I> thus stands in contrast to <I>course of 
 this world,</I> altogether disorganized because God is not its spring 
 of action and end. By faith, Christians make the world to come a 
 present reality, though but a foretaste of the perfect future. The 
 powers of this new spiritual world, partly exhibited in outward 
 miracles at that time, and then, as now, especially consisting in the 
 Spirit's inward quickening influences are the earnest of the coming 
 inheritance above, and lead the believer who gives himself up to the 
 Spirit to seek to live as the angels, to sit with Christ in heavenly 
 places, to set the affections on things above, and not on things on 
 earth, and to look for Christ's coming and the full manifestation of 
 the world to come. This "world to come," in its future aspect, thus 
 corresponds to "resurrection of the dead and eternal life"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:2">Heb 6:2</A>),

 the <I>first</I> Christian principles which the Hebrew believers had 
 been taught, by the Christian light being thrown back on their Old 
 Testament for their instruction (see on

 <A HREF="#Heb6_1">Heb 6:1,2</A>).

 "The world to come," which, as to its "powers," exists already in the 
 redeemed, will pass into a fully realized fact at Christ's coming

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:4">Col 3:4</A>).</P>

 compare a less extreme falling or declension,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:4">Ga 5:4</A>,

 "Ye are fallen from grace." Here an entire and wilful apostasy is 
 meant; the Hebrews had not yet so fallen away; but he warns them that 
 such would be the final result of retrogression, if, instead of "going 
 on to perfection," they should need to learn again the first principles 
 of Christianity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:1">Heb 6:1</A>).

 <B>to renew them again</B>--They have been "once" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:4">Heb 6:4</A>)

 already <I>renewed,</I> or made anew, and now they need to be 
 "<I>renewed</I>" over "again."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>crucify to themselves the Son of God</B>--"<I>are crucifiying</I> to
 themselves" Christ, instead of, like Paul,
 <I>crucifying the world unto them by the cross of Christ</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:14">Ga 6:14</A>).
 
 So in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:29">Heb 10:29</A>,

 "trodden under foot the Son of God, and counted the blood of the 
 covenant, wherewith .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sanctified, an unholy thing." "The 
 Son of God," marking His dignity, shows the greatness of their offense.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>put him to an open shame</B>--literally, "make a public example of" 
 Him, as if He were a malefactor suspended on a tree. What the carnal 
 Israel did outwardly, those who fall away from light do inwardly, they 
 virtually crucify again the Son of God; "they tear him out of the 
 recesses of their hearts where He had fixed His abode and exhibit Him 
 to the open scoffs of the world as something powerless and common" 
 [B<FONT SIZE=-1>LEEK</FONT> in A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]. The 
 Montanists and Novatians used this passage to justify the lasting 
 exclusion from the Church of those who had once lapsed. The Catholic 
 Church always opposed this view, and readmitted the lapsed on their 
 repentance, but did not rebaptize them. This passage implies that 
 persons may be in some sense "renewed," and yet fall away finally; for 
 the words, "renew <I>again,</I>" imply that they have been, in 
 <I>some</I> sense, <I>not the full sense,</I> <FONT SIZE=-1>ONCE 
 RENEWED</FONT> by the Holy Ghost; but certainly not that they are "the 
 elect," for these can never fall away, being chosen unto everlasting 
 life

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:28">Joh 10:28</A>).

 The elect abide in Christ, hear and continuously obey His voice, and do
 not fall away. He who abides not in Christ, is cast forth as a withered 
 branch; but he who abides in Him becomes more and more free from sin; 
 the wicked one cannot touch him; and he by faith overcomes the world. A 
 <I>temporary</I> faith is possible, without one thereby being 
 constituted one of the elect

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:16,17">Mr 4:16, 17</A>).

 At the same time it does not limit God's grace, as if it were
 "impossible" <I>for God</I> to reclaim even such a hardened rebel so as 
 yet to look on Him whom he has pierced. The impossibility rests in 
 their having known in themselves once the power of Christ's sacrifice, 
 and yet now rejecting it; there <I>cannot possibly</I> be any new means 
 devised for their renewal afresh, and the means provided by God's love 
 they now, after experience of them, deliberately and continuously
 reject; their conscience being served, and they "twice dead"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:12">Jude 12</A>),

 are now past hope, except by a miracle of God's grace. "It is the curse
 of evil eternally to propagate evil" [T<FONT SIZE=-1>HOLUCK</FONT>].
 "He who is led into the whole (?) compass of Christian experiences, may 
 yet cease to abide in them; he who abides not in them, was, at the very 
 time when he had those objective experiences, not <I>subjectively</I> 
 true to them; otherwise there would have been fulfilled in him, 
 "Whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more 
 abundance"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:12">Mt 13:12</A>),

 so that he would have abided in them and not have fallen away"

 merely earthly and visible goods, but penetrates even to those which 
 are within the veil, namely, to the Holy of Holies, where it lays hold 
 on God Himself, and heavenly goods, and fastens on them. "Hope, 
 entering within heaven, hath made us already to be in the things 
 promised to us, even while we are still below, and have not yet 
 received them; such strength hope has, as to make those that are 
 earthly to become heavenly." "The soul clings, as one in fear of 
 shipwreck to an anchor, and sees not whither the cable of the anchor 
 runs--where it is fastened: but she knows that it is fastened behind 
 the veil which hides the future glory."

 being <FONT SIZE=-1>IN</FONT> a place: 'whither' is understood to 
 'entered,' taken out of 'where'; whither <I>Jesus entered,</I> and 
 <I>where</I> He is now]. The "for us" implies that it was not for 
 Himself, as God, He needed to enter there, but as our High Priest,
 representing and introducing us, His followers, opening the way to us,
 by His intercession with the Father, as the Aaronic high priest entered
 the Holiest Place once a year to make propitiation for the people. The 
 first-fruits of our nature are ascended, and so the rest is sanctified.
 Christ's ascension is our promotion: and whither the glory of the Head 
 has preceded, thither the hope of the body, too, is called. We ought to

 This title of God, "the Most High," handed down by tradition from the 
 primitive revelation, appears in the Ph&oelig;nician god "Elion," that 
 is, <I>Most High.</I> It is used to imply that the God whom Melchisedec 
 served is THE TRUE G<FONT SIZE=-1>OD</FONT>, and not one of the gods of 
 the nations around. So it is used in the only other cases in which it 
 is found in the New Testament, namely in the address of the demoniac, 
 and the divining damsel constrained to confess that her own gods were 
 false, and God the only true God.

 earth," is made over to Abraham; and Abraham's glory, from his victory 
 over the foe, is made over to God. A blessed exchange for Abraham

 <B>tenth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of all</B>--namely, the booty taken. The 
 tithes given are closely associated with the priesthood: the mediating 
 priest received them as a pledge of the giver's whole property being

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:1">Heb 7:1</A>,

 "blessed him"), so also man's gifts to God. Melchisedec is a sample of 
 how God preserves, amidst general apostasy, an elect remnant. The 
 meeting of Melchisedec and Abraham is the connecting link between to 
 two dispensations, the patriarchal, represented by Melchisedec, who 
 seems to have been <I>specially consecrated by God as a</I> <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>KING-PRIEST</FONT>, the highest form of that primitive system 
 in which each father of a household was priest in it, and the 
 Levitical, represented by Abraham, in which the priesthood was to be 
 limited to one family of one tribe and one nation. The Levitical was 
 parenthetical, and severed the kingdom and priesthood; the patriarchal 
 was the true forerunner of Christ's, which, like Melchisedec's, 
 <I>unites the kingship and priesthood,</I> and is not derived from 
 other man, or transmitted to other man; but derived from God, and is 
 transmitted in God to a never-ending perpetuity. Melchisedec's
 priesthood continueth in Christ for ever. For other points of 
 superiority, see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:16-21">Heb 7:16-21</A>.

 Melchisedec must have had some special consecration above the other 
 patriarchs, as Abraham, who also exercised the priesthood; else Abraham 
 would not have paid tithe to him as to a superior. His peculiar 
 function seems to have been, by God's special call, <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>KING</FONT>-<I>priest</I> whereas no other "patriarch-priest" 
 was also a God-consecrated king.

 <I>Greek</I> is for "without descent); compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:6">Heb 7:6</A>,

 that is, his genealogy is <I>not known,</I> whereas a Levitical priest 
 could not dispense with the proof of his descent.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>having neither beginning of days nor end of life</B>--namely, 
 history not having recorded his beginning nor end, as it has the 
 beginning and end of Aaron. The <I>Greek</I> idiom expressed by 
 "without father," &c., one whose parentage was humble or <I>unknown.</I>
 "Days" mean his time of discharging his <I>function.</I> So the 
 eternity spoken of in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:4">Ps 110:4</A>
 
 is that of the <I>priestly office</I> chiefly.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>made like</B>--It is not said that he was asbsolutely "like." 
 <I>Made like,</I> namely, in the particulars here specified. Nothing is 
 said in Genesis of the end of his priesthood, or of his having had in 
 his priesthood either predecessor or successor, which, in a typical 
 point of view, represents Christ's eternal priesthood, without 
 beginning or end. Aaron's <I>end</I> is recorded; Melchisedec's not: 
 typically significant. "The Son of God" is not said to be made like 
 unto Melchisedec, but Melchisedec to be "made like the Son of God." 
 When A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> denies that Melchisedec was made like 
 the Son of God <I>in respect of his priesthood,</I> on the ground that 
 Melchisedec was <I>prior in time</I> to our Lord, he forgets that 
 Christ's eternal priesthood was an archetypal reality <I>in God's 
 purpose from everlasting,</I> to which Melchisedec's priesthood was 
 "made like" in due time. The Son of God is the more ancient, and is the 
 archetype: compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:5">Heb 8:5</A>,

 where the heavenly things are represented as the <I>primary archetype 
 of the Levitical ordinances.</I> The epithets, "without father," &c. 
 "beginning of days, "nor end," "abideth continually," belong to 
 Melchisedec only <I>in respect to his priesthood,</I> and in <I>so far 
 as he is the type of the Son of God,</I> and are strictly true of Him 
 alone. Melchisedec was, in his priesthood, "made like" Christ, as far 
 as the imperfect type could represent the lineaments of the perfect 
 archetype. "The portrait of a living man can be seen on the canvas, yet 
 the man is very different from his picture." There is nothing in the 
 account,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:18-20">Ge 14:18-20</A>,

 to mark Melchisedec as a superhuman being: he is classed with the other 
 kings in the chapter as a living historic personage: not as 
 O<FONT SIZE=-1>RIGEN</FONT> thought, an angel; nor as the Jews thought,
 Shem, son of Noah; nor as C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALMET</FONT>, Enoch; nor as 
 the Melchisedekites, that he was the Holy Ghost; nor as others, the 
 Divine Word. He was probably of Shemitic, not Canaanite origin: the 
 last independent representative of the original Shemitic population, 
 which had been vanquished by the Canaanites, Ham's descendants. The 
 greatness of Abraham then lay in hopes; of Melchisedec, in present 
 possession. Melchisedec was the highest and last representative of the
 Noahic covenant, as Christ was the highest and ever enduring 
 representative of the Abrahamic. Melchisedec, like Christ, unites in 
 himself the <I>kingly and priestly</I> offices, which Abraham does not.
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> thinks the epithets are, in some sense, 
 strictly true of Melchisedec <I>himself;</I> not merely in the typical 
 sense given above; but that he had not, as mortal men have, a beginning 
 or end of life (?). A very improbable theory, and only to be resorted 
 to in the last extremity, which has no place here. With Melchisedec, 
 whose priesthood probably lasted a long period, the priesthood and 
 worship of the true God in Canaan ceased. He was first and last 
 <I>king-priest</I> there, till Christ, the antitype; and therefore his 
 priesthood is said to last for ever, because it both lasts a long time, 
 and lasts as long as the nature of the thing itself (namely, his life, 
 and the continuance of God's worship in Canaan) admits. If Melchisedec 
 were high priest for ever in a literal sense, then Christ and he would 
 now still be high priests, and we should have two instead of one (!).
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HOLUCK</FONT> remarks, "Melchisedec <I>remains</I> in so 
 far as the type remains in the antitype, in so far as his priesthood 
 remains in Christ." The <I>father</I> and <I>mother</I> of Melchisedec, 
 as also his children, are not descended from Levi, as the Levitical 
 priests

 were required to be, and are not even mentioned by Moses. The wife of 
 Aaron, Elisheba, the <I>mother</I> from whom the Levitical priests 
 spring, is mentioned: as also Sarah, the original mother of the Jewish 
 nation itself. As man, Christ had no <I>father;</I> as God, <I>no 
 mother.</I></P>

 then, must this Melchisedec be in respect to his priesthood, as 
 compared with the Levitical, though the latter received tithes! and now 
 unspeakably great must "the Son of God" be, to whom, as the sacerdotal

 <B>him that had</B>--"the possessor of the promises," Abraham's

 still more to exalt Melchisedec. When Christ is the subject, the 
 singular "promise" is used. "The promises" in the plural, refer to 
 God's promise of greatness to himself and his seed, and of the 
 possession of Canaan, twice repeated before the blessing of 
 Melchisedec. As the priests, though above the people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:7">Heb 7:7</A>)

 whom it was their duty to "bless," were yet subordinate to Abraham; and

 <B>8.</B> Second point of superiority: Melchisedec's is an 
 <I>enduring,</I> the Levitical a <I>transitory,</I> priesthood. As the 
 law was a <I>parenthesis</I> between Abraham's dispensation of promise 
 of grace, and its enduring fulfilment at Christ's coming

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:20">Ro 5:20</A>,

 <I>Greek,</I> "The law entered as something adscititious and by the 
 way"): so the Levitical priesthood was parenthetical and temporary, 
 between Melchisedec's typically enduring priesthood, and its 
 antitypical realization in our ever continuing High Priest, Christ.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>here</B>--in the <I>Levitical</I> priesthood.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>there</B>--in the priesthood <I>after the order of Melchisedec.</I> 
 In order to bring out the typical parallel more strongly, Paul 
 substitutes, "He of whom it is witnessed that he liveth," for the more 
 untypical, "He <I>who is made like to Him</I> that liveth." Melchisedec 
 "liveth" merely in his <I>official</I> capacity, his priesthood being 
 continued in Christ. Christ, on the other hand, is, in <I>His own
 person,</I> "ever living after the power of an endless life"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:16,25">Heb 7:16, 25</A>).

 Melchisedec's death not being recorded, is expressed by the positive 
 term "liveth," for the sake of bringing into prominence the antitype, 
 Christ, of whom alone it is strictly and perfectly true, "that He 
 liveth."</P>

 fruit of (David's, and so of) Abraham's loins," yet, being 
 supernaturally, without human father, conceived, as He is above the 
 natural law of birth, so is he above the law of tithes. Only those
 born in the natural way, and so in sin, being under the curse, needed 
 to pay tithe to the priest, that he might make propitiation for their 
 sin. Not so Christ, who derived only His flesh, not also the taint of 
 the flesh, from Abraham. B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT> remarks, The

 passes into the heavenly "Holy of Holies," the immediate immaterial 
 presence of God, where He intercedes for us. This tabernacle in which 
 God dwells, is where God in Christ meets us who are "members of His

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:2">1Pe 1:2</A>).

 The term "consecrate" as a priest, is literally, to <I>fill the 
 hand,</I> implying that an offering is given into the hands of the 
 priest, which it is his duty to present to God. If a man be a priest,
 he must have some gift in his hands to offer. Therefore, Christ, as a

 therefore, certainly, He could not exercise the high priestly function 
 in the earthly Holy of Holies.

 <B>seeing that,</B> &c.--"since there are" already, and exist now (the 
 temple service not yet being set aside, as it was on the destruction of 
 Jerusalem), "those (the oldest manuscripts omit 'priests') who offer 
 <I>the</I> (appointed) gifts according to (the) law." <I>Therefore, His

 "If His priesthood terminated on the earth, He would not even be a 
 priest at all" [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]. I conceive that the 
 denial here of Christ's priesthood <I>on earth</I> does not extend to 
 the sacrifice on the cross which <I>He offered as a priest on 
 earth;</I> but applies only to the crowning work of His priesthood, the 
 <I>bringing of the blood into the Holy of Holies,</I> which He could 
 not have done in the <I>earthly</I> Holy of Holies, as not being an 
 Aaronic priest. The <I>place</I> (the heavenly Holy of Holies) was as 
 essential to the atonement being made as the <I>oblation</I> (the 
 blood). The body was burnt without the gate; but the sanctification was 
 effected by the presentation of the blood within the sanctuary by the 
 high priest. If on earth, He would not be a priest <I>in the sense of 
 the law of Moses</I> ("according to the law" is emphatic).</P>

 promises was a pledge of the fulfilment of the heavenly. "Like a

 At Rama, the headquarters of Nebuzar-adan, whither the captives of 
 Jerusalem had been led, Jeremiah uttered this prophecy of Israel's 
 restoration under another David, whereby Rachel, wailing for her lost 
 children, shall be comforted; literally in part fulfilled at the 
 restoration under Zerubbabel, and more fully to be hereafter at 
 Israel's return to their own land; spiritually fulfilled in the Gospel 
 covenant, whereby God forgives absolutely His people's sins, and writes 
 His law by His Spirit on the hearts of believers, the true Israel.
 "This prophecy forms the third part of the third trilogy of the three 
 great trilogies into which Jeremiah's prophecies may be divided:

 atonement effected by the goat sin offering (of which the ceremony of 
 the scapegoat is a part, and not distinct from the sin offering)

 The ashes were laid by for constant use; so the continually cleansing
 effects of Christ's blood, once for all shed. In our wilderness journey 
 we are continually contracting defilement by contact with the 
 spiritually dead, and with dead works, and need therefore continual 
 application to the antitypical life-giving cleansing blood of Christ, 
 whereby we are afresh restored to peace and living communion with God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:17">Heb 9:17</A>).

 This is a common meaning of the <I>Greek</I> noun <I>diathece.</I> So 
 in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:29">Lu 22:29</A>,

 "I appoint (by testamentary disposition; the cognate <I>Greek</I> verb 
 <I>diatithemai</I>) unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed 
 unto me." The need of death before the testamentary appointment takes 
 effect, holds good in Christ's relation as MAN to us; Of course not in 
 <I>God's</I> relation to Christ.

 <B>be</B>--literally, be borne": "be involved in the case"; <I>be 
 inferred;</I> or else, "be brought forward in court," so as to give 
 effect to the will. This sense (<I>testament</I>) of the <I>Greek</I> 
 "<I>diathece</I>" here does not exclude its other secondary senses in 
 the other passages of the New Testament: (1) a <I>covenant</I> between 
 <I>two</I> parties; (2) an arrangement, or disposition, made by <I>God 
 alone</I> in relation to us. Thus,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:28">Mt 26:28</A>

 may be translated, "Blood of the <I>covenant</I>"; for a 
 <I>testament</I> does not require <I>blood</I> shedding. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:8">Ex 24:8</A>

 (<I>covenant</I>), which Christ quotes, though it is probable He 
 <I>included</I> in a sense "testament" also under the <I>Greek</I> word 
 <I>diathece</I> (comprehending <I>both</I> meanings, "covenant" and 
 "testament"), as this designation strictly and properly applies to the 
 new dispensation, and is rightly applicable to the old also, not in 
 itself, but when viewed as typifying the new, which is properly a 
 <I>testament.</I> Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:8">Ex 24:8</A>)

 speaks of the same thing as [Christ and] Paul. Moses, by the term 
 "covenant," does not mean aught save one concerning giving the heavenly 
 <I>inheritance</I> typified by Canaan after the death of the 
 <I>Testator,</I> which he represented by the sprinkling of blood. And 
 Paul, by the term "testament," does not mean aught save one having 
 <I>conditions</I> attached to it, one which is at the same time a 
 <I>covenant</I> [P<FONT SIZE=-1>OLI</FONT>, <I>Synopsis</I>]; the 
 conditions are fulfilled by Christ, not by us, except that we must 
 <I>believe,</I> but even this God works in His people.  T<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>HOLUCK</FONT> explains, as elsewhere, "<I>covenant</I> 
 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. covenant .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. mediating victim"; the 
 <I>masculine</I> is used of the victim personified, and regarded as 
 mediator of the covenant; especially as in the new covenant a <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>MAN</FONT> (Christ) took the place of the victim. The 
 covenanting parties used to pass between the divided parts of the 
 sacrificed animals; but, without reference to this rite, the need of a 
 <I>sacrifice</I> for establishing a covenant sufficiently explains this 
 verse. Others, also, explaining the <I>Greek</I> as "covenant," 
 consider that the death of the sacrificial victim represented in all 
 covenants the death of both parties as <I>unalterably bound to the 
 covenant.</I> So in the redemption-covenant, the death of Jesus 
 symbolized the death of God (?) in the person of the mediating victim, 
 and the death of man in the same. But the expression is not "there must 
 be the death of <I>both parties</I> making the covenant," but 
 <I>singular,</I> "of <I>Him</I> who <I>made</I> (aorist, past time; not 
 'of Him <I>making</I>') the testament." Also, it is "death," not 
 "sacrifice" or "slaying." Plainly, the death is supposed to be 
 <I>past</I> (aorist, "made"); and the fact of the death is 
 <I>brought</I> (<I>Greek</I>) before court to give effect to the will. 
 These requisites of a will, or testament, concur here: (1) a testator; 
 (2) heirs; (3) goods; (4) the death of the testator; (5) the fact of 
 the death <I>brought forward</I> in court. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:28">Mt 26:28</A>

 two other requisites appear: <I>witnesses,</I> the disciples; and <I>a 
 seal,</I> the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, the sign of His 
 <I>blood</I> wherewith the testament is primarily sealed. It is true 
 the <I>heir</I> is ordinarily the <I>successor</I> of him who dies and 
 so ceases to have the possession. But in this case Christ comes to life 
 again, and is Himself (including all that He hath), in the power of His 
 now endless life, His people's inheritance; in <I>His</I> being Heir

 So Jesus wore a scarlet robe, the emblem of the deep-dyed sins He bore

 imbibing and retaining water; the hyssop, as a bushy, tufty plant

 wool was also a symbol of purity

 he both sprinkled all the people, and

 specified here, not in

 The sprinkling of the <I>roll</I> (so the <I>Greek</I> for "book") of 
 the covenant, or testament, as well as of the people, implies that

 The <I>Greek</I> "<I>diathece</I>" means both "testament" and

 though the idea <I>testament</I> is included, for the old was one in 
 its typical relation to the new dispensation, to which the term 
 "testament" is better suited. Christ has sealed the testament with His 
 <I>blood,</I> of which the Lord's Supper is the sacramental sign. The 
 testator was represented by the animals slain in the old dispensation.  
 In both dispensations the inheritance was bequeathed: in the new by One 
 who has come in person and died; in the old by the same one, only 
 typically and ceremonially present. See A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD'S</FONT>

 by virtue of the eternal Spirit, that is, the imperishable life of His
 person, now and for ever freed from death, our eternally present
 offering before God" [D<FONT SIZE=-1>ELITZSCH</FONT> in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:24">Heb 9:24</A>,

 Paul said, it was not into the typical, but the true sanctuary, that 
 Christ is entered; so now he says, that His sacrifice needs not, as the 
 Levitical sacrifices did, to be repeated.  Construe, "<I>Nor yet</I> 
 did He enter for this purpose <I>that He may offer Himself often,</I>" 
 that is, "<I>present Himself in the presence of God,</I> as the high 
 priest does (Paul uses the <I>present tense,</I> as the legal service 
 was then existing), year by year, on the day of atonement, entering the 
 Holy of Holies.

 would have been necessary for Him often to suffer." In order to "offer"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:25">Heb 9:25</A>),

 or present Himself often before God in the heavenly holiest place, like 
 the legal high priests making fresh renewals of this high priestly 
 function. He would have had, and would have often to suffer. His 
 <I>oblation</I> of Himself before God was once for all (that is, the 
 bringing in of His blood into the heavenly Holy of Holies), and 
 therefore the preliminary <I>suffering</I> was once for all.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>since the foundation of the world</B>--The continued sins of men, 
 from their first creation, would entail a continual suffering on earth, 
 and consequent oblation of His blood in the heavenly holiest place, 
 <I>since the foundation of the world,</I> if the one oblation "in the 
 fulness of time" were not sufficient. P<FONT SIZE=-1>HILO</FONT> 
 [<I>The Creation of the World,</I> p. 637], shows that the high priest 
 of the Hebrews offered sacrifices for the whole human race. "If there 
 had been greater efficacy in the repetition of the oblation, Christ 
 necessarily would not have been so long promised, but would have been 
 sent immediately after the foundation of the world to suffer, and offer 
 Himself at successive periods" [G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>now</B>--as the case is,

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>once</B>--for all; without need of renewal. Rome's fiction of an
 <FONT SIZE=-1>UNBLOODY</FONT> sacrifice in the mass, contradicts her 
 assertion that the <I>blood</I> of Christ is present in the wine; and 
 also confutes her assertion that the mass is propitiatory; for, if 
 <I>unbloody,</I> it cannot be <I>propitiatory;</I> for <I>without 
 shedding of blood there is no remission</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:22">Heb 9:22</A>).

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:28,Heb+10:10,12">Heb 9:28,
 and Heb 10:10, 12</A>,

 proves the falsity of her view that there is a continually repeated 
 offering of Christ in the Eucharist or mass. The offering of Christ was 
 a thing once done that it might be thought of for ever (compare

 Instead of the daily ministry of the Levitical priests, Christ's service
 is perfected by the one sacrifice, whence He now sits on the right hand
 of God as a Priest-King, until all His foes shall be subdued unto Him.
 Thus the new covenant 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:8-12">Heb 8:8-12</A>)

 is inaugurated, whereby the law is written on the heart, so that an 
 offering for sin is needed no more.  Wherefore we ought to draw near 
 the Holiest in firm faith and love; fearful of the awful results of 
 apostasy; looking for the recompense to be given at Christ's 
 coming.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>1.</B> Previously the <I>oneness</I> of Christ's offering was shown; 
 now is shown its perfection as contrasted with the law sacrifices.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>having</B>--inasmuch as it has but "the shadow, not the very image,"
 that is, not the exact likeness, reality, and full revelation, such as
 the Gospel has. The "image" here means the <I>archetype</I> (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:24">Heb 9:24</A>),

 the original, solid image [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>] realizing to us 
 those heavenly verities, of which the law furnished but a <I>shadowy 
 outline</I> before.  Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:13,14,18">2Co 3:13, 14, 18</A>;

 the Gospel is the very setting forth by the Word and Spirit of the 
 heavenly realities themselves, out of which it (the Gospel) is 
 constructed. So A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>. As Christ is "<I>the 
 express image</I> (<I>Greek,</I> 'impress') of the Father's person"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:3">Heb 1:3</A>),

 so the Gospel is the heavenly verities themselves manifested by 
 revelation--<I>the</I> heavenly very <I>archetype,</I> of which the law 
 was drawn as a sketch, or outline copy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:5">Heb 8:5</A>).

 The law was a continual process of acted prophecy, proving the divine 
 design that its counterparts should come; and proving the truth of 
 those counterparts when they came. Thus the imperfect and continued 
 expiatory sacrifices before Christ foretend, and now prove, the reality 
 of, Christ's one perfect antitypical expiation.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 belonging to "the world (age) to come." <I>Good things</I> in part made 
 present by faith to the believer, and to be fully realized hereafter in 
 actual and perfect enjoyment.  Lessing says, "As Christ's Church on 
 earth is a prediction of the economy of the future life, so the Old 
 Testament economy is a prediction of the Christian Church." In relation 
 to the temporal good things of the law, the spiritual and eternal good 
 things of the Gospel are "good things <I>to come</I>."

 about to come, into <I>public.</I> The <I>Greek</I> verbs are in the 
 past: "sacrifice .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Thou <I>didst</I> not wish, but a body 
 Thou <I>didst</I> prepare for Me"; and, "Lo, <I>I am come.</I>" 
 Therefore, in order to harmonize these times, the present 
 <I>coming,</I> or about to come, with the past, "A body Thou 
 <I>didst</I> prepare for Me," we must either explain as A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>, or else, if we take the period to be 
 <I>before</I> His actual arrival in the world (the earth) or 
 <I>incarnation,</I> we must explain the <I>past</I> tenses to refer to 
 God's <I>purpose,</I> which speaks of what He designed from eternity as 
 though it were already fulfilled. "A body Thou didst prepare in Thy 
 eternal counsel." This seems to me more likely than explaining "coming 
 into the world," "<I>coming into public,</I>" or entering on His public 
 ministry. David, in the fortieth Psalm (here quoted), reviews his past 
 troubles and God's having delivered him from them, and his consequent 
 desire to render willing obedience to God as more acceptable than 
 sacrifices; but the Spirit puts into his mouth language finding its 
 partial application to David, and its full realization only in the 
 divine Son of David. "The more any son of man approaches the incarnate 
 Son of God in position, or office, or individual spiritual experience, 
 the more directly may his holy breathings in the power of Christ's 
 Spirit be taken as utterances of Christ Himself. Of all men, the 
 prophet-king of Israel resembled and foreshadowed Him the most" [A<FONT

 <B>a body hast thou prepared me</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "Thou didst 
 <I>fit</I> for Me a body." "In Thy counsels <I>Thou didst determine to 
 make for Me a body,</I> to be given up to death as a sacrificial 
 victim" [W<FONT SIZE=-1>AHL</FONT>]. In the <I>Hebrew,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:6">Ps 40:6</A>,

 it is "mine ears hast thou opened," or "dug." Perhaps this alludes to 
 the custom of <I>boring the ear of a slave who volunteers to remain 
 under his master when he might be free.</I> Christ's assuming a human 
 <I>body,</I> in obedience to the Father's will, in order to die the 
 death of a slave

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:14">Heb 2:14</A>),

 was virtually the same act of voluntary submission to service as that 
 of a slave suffering his ear to be bored by his master. His <I>willing 
 obedience to the Father's will</I> is what is dwelt on as giving 
 especial virtue to His sacrifice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:7,9,10">Heb 10:7, 9, 10</A>).

 The <I>preparing,</I> or <I>fitting of a body</I> for Him, is not with 
 a view to His mere incarnation, but to His expiatory <I>sacrifice</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:10">Heb 10:10</A>),

 as the <I>contrast</I> to "sacrifice and offering" requires; compare

 More probably "opened mine ears" means <I>opened mine inward ear,</I>
 so as to be attentively obedient to what God wills me to do, namely, to 
 assume the body He has prepared for me for my sacrifice, so

 <I>Margin;</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:10">Job 36:10</A>

 (doubtless the boring of a slave's "ear" was the symbol of <I>such 
 willing obedience</I>);

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:5">Isa 50:5</A>,

 "The Lord God hath opened mine ear," that is, made me <I>obediently</I> 
 attentive as a slave to his master. Others somewhat similarly explain, 
 "Mine ears hast thou digged," or "<I>fashioned,</I>" not with allusion 
 to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:6">Ex 21:6</A>,

 the voice of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:4,5">Isa 50:4, 5</A>).

 The forming of the ear implies the preparation of the body, that is, 
 the incarnation; this secondary idea, really in the <I>Hebrew,</I> 
 though less prominent, is the one which Paul uses for his argument. In 
 either explanation the idea of Christ taking on Him the form, and 
 becoming <I>obedient as a servant,</I> is implied. As He assumed a body 
 in which to make His self-sacrifice, so ought we <I>present</I> our

 [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]. When the two goats on the day of 
 atonement were presented before the Lord, that goat on which the lot of 
 the Lord should fall was to be offered as a sin offering; and that lot 
 was lifted up on high in the hand of the high priest, and then laid 
 upon the head of the goat which was to die; so the <I>hand</I> of God 
 <I>determined</I> all that was done to Christ. Besides the covenant of 
 God with man through Christ's blood, there was another covenant made by 
 the Father with the Son from eternity. The condition was, "If He shall 
 make His soul an offering for sin, He shall see His seed," &c.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:10">Isa 53:10</A>).

 "The offering of Christ, once for all made, will continue the one and

 [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>].  The mass, which professes to be the
 frequent repetition of one and the same sacrifice of Christ's body, is

 The mass would be much the same as the Jewish sacrifices which Paul 
 sets aside as abrogated, for they were anticipations of the one 
 sacrifice, just as Rome makes masses continuations of it, in opposition 
 to Paul's argument. A repetition would imply that the former 
 once-for-all offering of the one sacrifice was imperfect, and so would 
 be dishonoring to it

 all are accepted when they come by the new and living way opened by 
 Christ. Thus all Christians are, in respect to access directly to God,

 in the brazen laver. Believers, as priests to God, are once for all 
 washed in BODY (as distinguished from "hearts") at baptism. As we have 
 an immaterial, and a material nature, the cleansing of both is 
 expressed by "hearts" and "body," the inner and the outer man; so the 
 whole man, material and immaterial. The baptism of the body, however, 
 is not the mere putting away of material filth, nor an act operating by 
 intrinsic efficacy, but the sacramental seal, applied to the outer man, 
 of a spiritual washing

 includes the <I>whole</I> material man, which needs cleansing, as being 
 redeemed, as well as the soul. The body, once polluted with sin, is 
 washed, so as to be fitted like Christ's holy body, and by His body, to 
 be spiritually a pure and living offering. On the "pure water," the 
 symbol of consecration and sanctification, compare

 imply a continuing state produced by a once-for-all accomplished act,

 <B>things not seen</B>--the whole invisible and spiritual world: not 
 things future and things pleasant, as the "things hoped for," but also 
 the past and present, and those the reverse of pleasant. "Eternal life 
 is promised to us, but it is when we are dead: we are told of a blessed 
 resurrection, but meanwhile we moulder in the dust; we are declared to 
 be justified, and sin dwells in us; we hear that we are blessed, 
 meantime we are overwhelmed in endless miseries: we are promised 
 abundance of all goods, but we still endure hunger and thirst; God 
 declares He will immediately come to our help, but He seems deaf to our 
 cries. What should we do if we had not faith and hope to lean on, and 
 if our mind did not emerge amidst the darkness above the world by the 
 shining of the Word and Spirit of God?" [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>]. 
 Faith is an assent unto truths credible upon the testimony of God (not 
 on the <I>reasonableness</I> of the thing revealed, though by this we 
 may judge as to whether it be what it professes, a genuine revelation), 
 delivered unto us in the writings of the apostles and prophets. Thus 
 Christ's ascension is the cause, and His absence the crown, of our 
 faith: because He ascended, we the more believe, and because we believe 
 in Him who hath ascended, our faith is the more accepted [B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ISHOP</FONT> P<FONT SIZE=-1>EARSON</FONT>]. Faith believes what 
 it sees not; for if thou seest there is no faith; the Lord has gone 
 away so as not to be seen: He is hidden that He may be believed; the 
 yearning desire by faith after Him who is unseen is the preparation of 
 a heavenly mansion for us; when He shall be seen it shall be given to 
 us as the reward of faith [A<FONT SIZE=-1>UGUSTINE</FONT>]. As 
 Revelation deals with spiritual and invisible things exclusively, faith 
 is the faculty needed by us, since it is the evidence of things not 
 seen. By faith we venture our eternal interests on the bare word of 
 God, and this is altogether reasonable.</P>

 <B>4. more excellent sacrifice</B>--because offered in <I>faith.</I> 
 Now <I>faith</I> must have some <I>revelation of God</I> on which it 
 fastens. The revelation in this case was doubtless God's command to 
 sacrifice <I>animals</I> ("the firstlings of the flock") in token of 
 the forfeiture of men's life by sin, and as a type of the promised 
 bruiser of the serpent's head

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15">Ge 3:15</A>),

 the one coming sacrifice: this command is implied in God's having made 
 coats of skin for Adam and Eve

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:21">Ge 3:21</A>):

 for these skins must have been taken from animals slain <I>in 
 sacrifice:</I> inasmuch as it was not for <I>food</I> they were slain, 
 animal food not being permitted till after the flood; nor for mere 
 <I>clothing,</I> as, were it so, clothes might have been made of the 
 fleeces without the needless cruelty of killing the animal; but a coat 
 of skin put on Adam from a sacrificed animal typified the covering or 
 atonement (the <I>Hebrew</I> for <I>atone</I> means to <I>cover</I>) 
 resulting from Christ's sacrifice. The <I>Greek</I> is more literally 
 rendered [K<FONT SIZE=-1>ENNICOTT</FONT>] by W<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>YCLIFFE,</FONT> "a <I>much more</I> sacrifice"; and by Queen 
 Elizabeth's version "a greater sacrifice." A fuller, more ample 
 sacrifice, that which partook more largely and essentially of the true 
 nature and virtue of sacrifice [A<FONT SIZE=-1>RCHBISHOP</FONT> M<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>AGEE</FONT>]. It was not any intrinsic merit in "the firstling 
 of the flock" above "the fruit of the ground." It was God's appointment 
 that gave it all its excellency as a sacrifice; if it had not been so, 
 it would have been a presumptuous act of <I>will-worship</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:23">Col 2:23</A>),

 and taking of a life which man had no right over before the flood

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:1-6">Ge 9:1-6</A>).

 The sacrifice seems to have been a holocaust, and the sign of the 
 divine acceptance of it was probably the consumption of it by fire from 
 heaven

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:17">Ge 15:17</A>).

 Hence, "to accept" a burnt sacrifice is in <I>Hebrew</I> "to turn it to 
 ashes"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:3">Ps 20:3</A>,

 <I>Margin</I>). A flame seems to have issued from the Shekinah, or 
 flaming cherubim, east of Eden ("the presence of the Lord,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:16">Ge 4:16</A>),

 where the first sacrifices were offered. Cain, in unbelieving 
 self-righteousness, presented merely a <I>thank offering,</I> not like 
 Abel feeling his need of the propitiatory sacrifice appointed on 
 account of sin. God "had respect (first) unto Abel, and (then) to his 
 offering"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:4">Ge 4:4</A>).

 Faith causes the believer's person to be accepted, and then his 
 offering. Even an animal sacrifice, though of God's appointment, would 
 not have been accepted, had it not been offered in faith.

 a mystical sacrifice of the Ph&oelig;nicians, wherein a prince in royal 
 robes was the offerer, and his only son was to be the victim: this 
 evidently was a tradition derived from Abraham's offering, and handed 
 down through Esau or Edom, Isaac's son. Isaac was Abraham's

 He <I>did not fear the king</I> so as to neglect his duty and not
 return when God called him. It was <I>in spite of the king's 
 prohibition he left Egypt,</I> not fearing the consequences which were 
 likely to overtake him if he should be caught, after having, in 
 defiance of the king, left Egypt. If he had stayed and resumed his 
 position as adopted son of Pharaoh's daughter, his slaughter of the 
 Egyptian would doubtless have been connived at; but his resolution to 
 take his portion with oppressed Israel, which he could not have done 
 had he stayed, was the motive of his flight, and constituted the 
 "faith" of this act, according to the express statement here. The 
 exodus of Moses with Israel cannot be meant here, for it was made, not 
 in defiance, but by the desire, of the king. Besides, the chronological 
 order would be broken thus, the next particular specified here, namely, 
 the institution of the <I>Passover,</I> having taken place <I>before

 feeling in finding God's people insensible to their high destiny, and 
 from disappointment at not having been able to inspire them with those

 <I>Judaism.</I> "Though the Old Testament worthies attained such

 <I>positively,</I> unequivocally, and <I>directly</I> sustained by 
 Scripture. It gives vividness to the image; as the crowd of spectators

 "the <I>perfected spirits,</I>" but "the spirits of <I>the perfected

 and ascension

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:10,5:9">Heb 2:10; 5:9</A>),

 is naturally suggested by the mention of "the just <I>made perfect</I>"
 at their resurrection (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:22">Heb 7:22</A>).

 Paul uses "Jesus," dwelling here on Him as the Person realized as our 
 loving friend, not merely in His <I>official</I> character as the 
 <I>Christ.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and to the blood of sprinkling</B>--here enumerated as distinct from 
 "Jesus." B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT> reasonably argues as follows: His 
 blood was entirely "poured out" of His body by the various ways in 
 which it was shed, His bloody sweat, the crown of thorns, the 
 scourging, the nails, and after death the spear, just as the blood was 
 entirely poured out and extravasated from the animal sacrifices of the 
 law. It was <I>incorruptible</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:18,19">1Pe 1:18, 19</A>).

 No Scripture states it was again put into the Lord's body. At His 
 ascension, as our great High Priest, He entered the heavenly holiest 
 place "<FONT SIZE=-1>BY</FONT> His own blood" (not <I>after</I> 
 shedding His blood, nor <I>with</I> the blood in His body, but), 
 carrying it separately from his body (compare the type,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:7,12,25,13:11">Heb 9:7, 12, 25; 13:11</A>).

 Paul does not say, by the efficacy of His blood, but, "by <I>His own
 proper</I> blood"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:12">Heb 9:12</A>);

 not <FONT SIZE=-1>MATERIAL</FONT> blood, but "the blood of Him who, 
 through the eternal Spirit, offered Himself without spot unto God"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:14">Heb 9:14</A>).
 
 So in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:29">Heb 10:29</A>,

 <I>the Son of God</I> and <I>the blood of the covenant wherewith he</I> 
 (the professor) <I>was sanctified,</I> are mentioned separately. Also 
 in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:12,20">Heb 13:12, 20</A>;
 
 also compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:19,21">Heb 10:19,
 with Heb 10:21</A>.

 So in the Lord's Supper

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:16,11:24-26">1Co 10:16; 11:24-26</A>),

 <I>the body</I> and <I>blood</I> are separately represented. The blood
 itself, therefore, continues still in heaven before God, the perpetual 
 ransom price of "the eternal covenant"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:20">Heb 13:20</A>).

 Once for all Christ sprinkled the blood peculiarly for us at His 
 ascension

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:12">Heb 9:12</A>).

 But it is called "the blood of sprinkling," on account also of its 
 continued use in heaven, and in the consciences of the saints on earth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:14,10:22,Isa+52:15">Heb 9:14; 10:22;
 Isa 52:15</A>).

 This sprinkling is analogous to the sprinkled blood of the Passover.
 Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:6">Re 5:6</A>,

 "In the midst of the throne, a Lamb <I>as it had been slain.</I>" His 
 glorified body does not require meat, nor the circulation of the blood. 
 His blood introduced into heaven took away the dragon's right to 
 accuse. Thus Rome's theory of <I>concomitancy</I> of the blood with the 
 body, the excuse for giving only the bread to the laity, falls to the 
 ground. The mention of "the blood of sprinkling" naturally follows the 
 mention of the "covenant," which could not be consecrated without 
 <I>blood</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:18,22">Heb 9:18, 22</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>speaketh better things than that of Abel</B>--namely, than the 
 sprinkling (the best manuscripts read the article <I>masculine,</I> 
 which refers to "sprinkling," not to "blood," which last is neuter) of 
 blood by Abel in his sacrifice spake. This comparison between two 
 <I>things of the same kind</I> (namely, Christ's sacrifice, and Abel's 
 sacrifice) is more natural, than between two things different in kind 
 and in results (namely, Christ's sacrifice, and Abel's <I>own</I> blood 
 [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>], which was not a sacrifice at all); 
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:4,Ge+4:4">Heb 11:4;
 Ge 4:4</A>.

 This accords with the whole tenor of the Epistle, and of this passage
 in particular

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:18-22">Heb 12:18-22</A>),

 which is to show the superiority of Christ's sacrifice and the new 
 covenant, to the Old Testament sacrifices (of which Abel's is the first 
 recorded; it, moreover, was testified to by God as acceptable to Him 
 above Cain's), compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:1-10:39">Heb 9:1-10:39</A>.

 The word "better" implies superiority to something that is good: but 
 Abel's own blood was not at all good for the purpose for which Christ's 
 blood was efficacious; nay, it cried for vengeance.  So A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>RCHBISHOP</FONT> M<FONT SIZE=-1>AGEE</FONT>, H<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>AMMOND</FONT>, and K<FONT SIZE=-1>NATCHBULL</FONT>.  B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT> takes "the blood of Abel" as put for <I>all</I> 
 the blood shed on earth crying for vengeance, and greatly increasing 
 the other cries raised by sin in the world; counteracted by the blood 
 of Christ calmly speaking in heaven for us, and from heaven to us. I 
 prefer M<FONT SIZE=-1>AGEE'S</FONT> view. Be this as it may, to deny 
 that Christ's atonement is truly a propitiation, overthrows Christ's 
 priesthood, makes the sacrifices of Moses' law an unmeaning mummery, 
 and represents Cain's sacrifice as good as that of Abel.</P>

 at the first coming of Messiah; it will be completed at His second 
 coming, prodigies in the world of nature accompanying the overthrow of 
 all kingdoms that oppose Messiah. The <I>Hebrew</I> is literally, "it 
 is yet one little," that is, a single brief space till the series of 
 movements begins ending in the advent of Messiah. Not merely the earth, 
 as at the establishment of the Sinaitic covenant, but heaven also is to 
 be shaken. The two advents of Messiah are regarded as one, the complete 
 shaking belonging to the second advent, of which the presage was given 
 in the shakings at the first advent: the convulsions connected with the 
 overthrow of Jerusalem shadowing forth those about to be at the 
 overthrow of all the God-opposed kingdoms by the coming Messiah.</P>

 be removed. The new abiding heaven and earth are also <I>made</I> by 
 God, but they are of a higher nature than the material creation, being 
 made to partake of the divine nature of Him who is not <I>made:</I> so

 to be as much a <I>messenger</I> of God for good, as the angels (whose

 Judaism and Gnosticism combined were soon about to throw discredit on 
 marriage. The venerable Paphnutius, in the Council of Nice, quoted this 
 verse for the justification of the married state. If one does not 
 himself marry, he should not prevent others from doing so. Others, 
 especially Romanists, translate, "in all <I>things,</I>" as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:18">Heb 13:18</A>.

 But the warning being against lasciviousness, the contrast to 
 "<I>whoremongers</I> and <I>adulterers</I>" in the parallel clause, 
 requires the "in all" in this clause to refer to <I>persons.</I>

 earthly sanctuary, the Christians to whom the altar in heaven stands 
 open, while it is closed against the Jews. As Jesus suffered without 
 the gate, so spiritually must those who desire to belong to Him, 
 withdraw from the earthly Jerusalem and its sanctuary, as from this

 do, namely, come out of the carnal worship of the earthly Jerusalem to 
 worship God in Christ in spirit, and of what we all ought to do,

 This threefold mention of the <I>rulers</I> is peculiar to this 
 Epistle. In other Epistles Paul includes the <I>rulers</I> in his 
 exhortations. But here the address is limited to the <I>general body of 
 the Church,</I> in contrast to the <I>rulers</I> to whom they are 
 charged to yield reverent submission. Now this is just what might be 
 expected when the apostle of the Gentiles was writing to the Palestine 
 Christians, among whom James and the eleven apostles had exercised a 
 more immediate authority. It was important he should not seem to set 
 himself in opposition to their guides, but rather strengthen their 
 hands; he claims no authority directly or indirectly over these rulers 
 themselves [B<FONT SIZE=-1>IRKS</FONT>]. "Remember" your deceased 
 rulers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:7">Heb 13:7</A>).

 "Obey" your living rulers; nay, more, not only <I>obey</I> in cases 
 where no sacrifice of self is required, and where you are 
 <I>persuaded</I> they are right (so the <I>Greek,</I> for "obey"), but 
 "<I>submit</I> yourselves" as a matter of dutiful <I>yielding,</I> when 
 your judgment and natural will incline you in an opposite direction.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>they</B>--on their part; so the <I>Greek.</I> As they do their part, 
 so do you yours. So Paul exhorts,

 C<FONT SIZE=-1>HRYSOSTOM</FONT> was deeply struck with these words, as 
 he tells us [<I>On the Priesthood,</I> 6], "The fear of this threat 
 continually agitates my soul."

 deeds, who is not sufficient for his own [E<FONT SIZE=-1>STIUS</FONT>,

 that any of the rulers should be saved [C<FONT

 the day of account you may be among the lost, instead of being their 
 crown of rejoicing. In giving account, the stewards are liable to blame 
 if aught be lost to the Master. "Mitigate their toil by every office of 
 attention and respect, that with alacrity, rather than with grief, they 
 may fulfil their duty, arduous enough in itself, even though no 
 unpleasantness be added on your part" [G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT>].

 heard; how much more of pastors!" [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]. So God 
 will be provoked to avenge on you their "groaning" (<I>Greek</I>). If
