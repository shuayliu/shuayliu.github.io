 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT> internal and external evidence for <I>Paul's authorship</I> is
 conclusive. The style is characteristically Pauline. The
 superscription, and allusions to the apostle of the Gentiles in the
 first person, throughout the Epistle, establish the same truth

 His authorship is also upheld by the unanimous testimony of the ancient
 Church: compare I<FONT SIZE=-1>REN&AElig;US</FONT> [<I>Against 
 Heresies,</I> 3,7,2]

 The Epistle was written "<FONT SIZE=-1>TO THE CHURCHES OF</FONT>
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>ALATIA</FONT>" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:2">Ga 1:2</A>),

 a district of Asia Minor, bordering on Phrygia, Pontus, Bithynia,
 Cappadocia, and Paphlagonia. The inhabitants (Gallo-gr&aelig;ci,
 contracted into Galati, another form of the name Celts) were Gauls in
 origin, the latter having overrun Asia Minor after they had pillaged
 Delphi, about 280 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT> and at last permanently
 settled in the central parts, thence called Gallo-gr&aelig;cia or
 Galatia. Their character, as shown in this Epistle, is in entire
 consonance with that ascribed to the Gallic race by all writers.
 C&aelig;sar [<I>Commentaries on the Gallic War,</I> 4,5], "The
 infirmity of the Gauls is that they are fickle in their resolves and
 fond of change, and not to be trusted." So Thierry (quoted by 
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>), "Frank, impetuous, impressible, eminently
 intelligent, but at the same time extremely changeable, inconstant, 
 fond of show, perpetually quarrelling, the fruit of excessive vanity." 
 They received Paul at first with all joy and kindness; but soon wavered 
 in their allegiance to the Gospel and to him, and hearkened as eagerly 
 now to Judaizing teachers as they had before to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:14-16">Ga 4:14-16</A>).

 The apostle himself had been the first preacher among them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:6,Ga+1:8,4:13">Ac 16:6;
 Ga 1:8; 4:13</A>;

 see on

 <A HREF="#Ga4_13">Ga 4:13</A>;

 "<I>on account of</I> infirmity of flesh I preached unto you at the
 first": implying that sickness detained him among them); and had then 
 probably founded churches, which at his subsequent visit he 
 "strengthened" in the faith

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:23">Ac 18:23</A>).

 His first visit was about <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 51, during his 
 second missionary journey.  J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT> 
 [<I>Antiquities,</I> 16.62] testifies that many Jews resided in Ancyra 
 in Galatia. Among these and their brethren, doubtless, as elsewhere, he 
 began his preaching. And though subsequently the majority in the 
 Galatian churches were Gentiles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:8,9">Ga 4:8, 9</A>),

 yet these were soon infected by Judaizing teachers, and almost suffered 
 themselves to be persuaded to undergo circumcision

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:6,3:1,3,5:2,3,6:12,13">Ga 1:6; 3:1, 3; 5:2, 3; 6:12, 13</A>).

 Accustomed as the Galatians had been, when heathen, to the mystic 
 worship of Cybele (prevalent in the neighboring region of Phrygia), and 
 the theosophistic doctrines connected with that worship, they were the 
 more readily led to believe that the full privileges of Christianity 
 could only be attained through an elaborate system of ceremonial 
 symbolism

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:9-11,5:7-12">Ga 4:9-11; 5:7-12</A>).

 They even gave ear to the insinuation that Paul himself observed the
 law among the Jews, though he persuaded the Gentiles to renounce it, 
 and that his motive was to keep his converts in a subordinate state, 
 excluded from the full privileges of Christianity, which were enjoyed 
 by the circumcised alone

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:11,Ga+4:16">Ga 5:11,
 Ga 4:16</A>,

 compare with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:17">Ga 2:17</A>);

 and that in "becoming all things to all men," he was an interested
 flatterer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:10">Ga 1:10</A>),
 
 aiming at forming a party for himself: moreover, that he falsely
 represented himself as an apostle divinely commissioned by Christ,
 whereas he was but a messenger sent by the Twelve and the Church at
 Jerusalem, and that his teaching was now at variance with that of Peter
 and James, "pillars" of the Church, and therefore ought not to be
 accepted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 His <FONT SIZE=-1>PURPOSE</FONT>, then, in writing this Epistle was: 
 (1) to defend his apostolic authority

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:11-19,2:1-14">Ga 1:11-19; 2:1-14</A>);

 (2) to counteract the evil influence of the Judaizers in Galatia

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:1-4:31">Ga 3:1-4:31</A>),

 and to show that their doctrine destroyed the very <I>essence of</I> 
 Christianity, by lowering its spirituality to an outward ceremonial 
 system; (3) to give exhortation for the strengthening of Galatian 
 believers in faith towards Christ, and in the fruits of the Spirit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:1-6:18">Ga 5:1-6:18</A>).

 He had already, face to face, testified against the Judaizing teachers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:9,4:16,Ac+18:23">Ga 1:9; 4:16;
 Ac 18:23</A>); 

 and now that he has heard of the continued and increasing prevalence of
 the evil, he writes <I>with his own hand</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:11">Ga 6:11</A>:

 a labor which he usually delegated to an amanuensis) this Epistle to 
 oppose it. The sketch he gives in it of his apostolic career confirms 
 and expands the account in Acts and shows his independence of human 
 authority, however exalted. His protest against Peter in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:14-21">Ga 2:14-21</A>,

 disproves the figment, not merely of papal, but even of that apostle's 
 supremacy; and shows that Peter, save when specially inspired, was 
 fallible like other men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 There is much in common between this Epistle and that to the Romans
 on the subject of justification by faith only, and not by the law. But
 the Epistle to the Romans handles the subject in a didactic and logical
 mode, without any special reference; this Epistle, in a controversial
 manner, and with special reference to the Judaizers in Galatia.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <FONT SIZE=-1>STYLE</FONT> combines the two extremes, sternness.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:1-24,3:1-5">Ga 1:1-24; 3:1-5</A>)

 and tenderness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:19,20">Ga 4:19, 20</A>),

 the characteristics of a man of strong emotions, and both alike well
 suited for acting on an impressible people such as the Galatians were. 
 The beginning is abrupt, as was suited to the urgency of the question 
 and the greatness of the danger.  A tone of sadness, too, is apparent, 
 such as might be expected in the letter of a warm-hearted teacher who 
 had just learned that those whom he loved were forsaking his teachings 
 for those of perverters of the truth, as well as giving ear to 
 calumnies against himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <FONT SIZE=-1>TIME OF WRITING</FONT> was <I>after</I> the visit to
 Jerusalem recorded in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:1">Ac 15:1</A>,

 &c.; that is, <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 50, if that visit be, as seems 
 probable, identical with that in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:1">Ga 2:1</A>.

 Further, as 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:9">Ga 1:9</A>
 
 ("as we said <I>before</I>"), and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:16">Ga 4:16</A>

 ("Have [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>] I become your enemy?" namely, at 
 my second visit, whereas I was welcomed by you at my first visit), 
 refer to his second visit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:23">Ac 18:23</A>),

 this Epistle must have been written after the date of that visit (the 
 autumn of <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 54).

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:13">Ga 4:13</A>,

 "Ye know how .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I preached .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at the first" 
 (<I>Greek,</I> "at the former time"), implies that Paul, at the time of 
 writing, had been <I>twice</I> in Galatia; and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:6">Ga 1:6</A>,

 "I marvel that ye are <I>so soon</I> removed," implies that he wrote 
 not long after having left Galatia for the second time; probably in the 
 early part of <I>his residence at Ephesus</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:23,19:1">Ac 18:23; 19:1</A>,
 
 &c., from
 <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 54,
 the autumn, to <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 57, Pentecost)
 [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>].
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>ONYBEARE</FONT> and
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>OWSON</FONT>, from
 the similarity between this Epistle and that to the Romans, the same
 line of argument in both occupying the writer's mind, think it was
 <I>not written till his stay at Corinth</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:2,3">Ac 20:2, 3</A>),

 during the winter of 57-58, whence he wrote his Epistle to the Romans; 
 and certainly, in the theory of the earlier writing of it from Ephesus, 
 it does seem unlikely that the two Epistles to the Corinthians, so 
 dissimilar, should intervene between those so similar as the Epistles 
 to the Galatians and Romans; or that the Epistle to the Galatians 
 should intervene between the second to the Thessalonians and the first 
 to the Corinthians. The decision between the two theories rests on the 
 words, "so soon." If these be not considered inconsistent with little 
 more than three years having elapsed since his second visit to Galatia, 
 the argument, from the similarity to the Epistle to the Romans, seems 
 to me conclusive. This to the Galatians seems written on the urgency of 
 the occasion, tidings having reached him at Corinth from Ephesus of the 
 Judaizing of many of his Galatian converts, in an admonitory and 
 controversial tone, to maintain the great principles of Christian 
 liberty and justification by faith only; that to the Romans is a more 
 deliberate and systematic exposition of the same central truths of 
 theology, subsequently drawn up in writing to a Church with which he 
 was personally unacquainted.  See on

 <A HREF="#Ga1_6">Ga 1:6</A>, 

 for B<FONT SIZE=-1>IRKS'S</FONT> view. 
 P<FONT SIZE=-1>ALEY</FONT> [<I>Hor&aelig; Paulin&aelig;</I>] well
 remarks how perfectly adapted the conduct of the argument is to the 
 historical circumstances under which the Epistle was written! Thus, 
 that to the Galatians, a Church which Paul had founded, he puts mainly 
 upon <I>authority;</I> that to the Romans, to whom he was not 
 personally known, entirely upon <I>argument.</I></P>

 Judaizing teachers had persuaded the Galatians that Paul had taught them
 the new religion imperfectly, and at second hand; that the founder of
 their church himself possessed only a deputed commission, the seal of
 truth and authority being in the apostles at Jerusalem: moreover, that
 whatever he might profess among them, he had himself at other times, and
 in other places, given way to the doctrine of circumcision. To refute
 this, he appeals to the history of his conversion, and to the manner of
 his conferring with the apostles when he met them at Jerusalem; that so
 far was his doctrine from being derived from them, or they from
 exercising any superiority over him, that they had simply assented to
 what he had already preached among the Gentiles, which preaching was
 communicated, not by them to him, but by himself to them
 [P<FONT SIZE=-1>ALEY</FONT>]. Such
 an apologetic Epistle could not be a later forgery, the objections which
 it meets only coming out incidentally, not being obtruded as they would
 be by a forger; and also being such as could only arise in the earliest
 age of the Church, when Jerusalem and Judaism still held a prominent
 place.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>1. apostle</B>--in the earliest Epistles, the two to the 
 Thessalonians, through humility, he uses no title of authority; but
 associates with him "Silvanus and Timotheus"; yet here, though 
 "brethren"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:2">Ga 1:2</A>)

 are with him, he does not <I>name</I> them but puts his own name and
 apostleship prominent: evidently because his apostolic commission needs 
 now to be vindicated against deniers of it.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>of</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "from." Expressing the <I>origin</I> from which his mission
 came, "not from <I>men,</I>" but from Christ and the Father (understood) as
 the source. "By" expresses the immediate operating agent in the call.
 Not only was the call <I>from</I> God as its ultimate source, but <I>by</I> Christ and the Father as the immediate agent in calling him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:15,26:16-18">Ac 22:15; 26:16-18</A>).
 
 The laying on of Ananias' hands 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:17">Ac 9:17</A>)

 is no objection to this; for that was but a sign of the fact, not an
 assisting cause. So the Holy Ghost calls him specially

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:2,3">Ac 13:2, 3</A>);
 
 he was an apostle <I>before</I> this special mission.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>man</B>--singular; to mark the contrast to "Jesus Christ." The opposition
 between "Christ" and "man," and His name being put in closest connection
 with God the Father, imply His Godhead.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>raised him from the dead</B>--implying that, though he had not seen Him in
 His humiliation as the other apostles (which was made an objection
 against him), he had seen and been
 <I>constituted an apostle by Him in His resurrection power</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:18,Ro+1:4,5">Mt 28:18;
 Ro 1:4, 5</A>). 

 Compare as to the ascension, the consequence of the resurrection, and 
 the cause of His giving "apostles,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:11">Eph 4:11</A>.
 
 He rose again, too, for our <I>justification</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:25">Ro 4:25</A>);

 thus Paul prepares the way for the prominent subject of the Epistle, 
 justification in Christ, not by the law.</P>

 these), join with me. Not that these were <I>joint authors</I> with 
 Paul of the Epistle: but joined him in the <I>sentiments</I> and 
 <I>salutations.</I> The phrase, "all the brethren," accords with a date 
 when he had many travelling companions, he and they having to bear 
 jointly the collection to Jerusalem [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ONYBEARE</FONT> and

 He does not attach any honorable title to the churches here, as
 elsewhere, being displeased at their Judaizing. See First Corinthians; 
 First Thessalonians, &c. The first Epistle of Peter is addressed to 
 Jewish Christians sojourning in Galatia

 uncircumcision, once at issue

 B<FONT SIZE=-1>IRKS</FONT> holds the Epistle to have been written from
 Corinth after his <FONT SIZE=-1>FIRST</FONT> visit to Galatia; for this 
 agrees best with the "so soon" here: with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:18">Ga 4:18</A>,

 "It is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not
 only when I am present with you." If they had persevered in the faith 
 during three years of his first absence, and only turned aside after 
 his second visit, they could not be charged justly with adhering to the 
 truth only when he was present: for his first absence was longer than 
 both his visits, and they would have obeyed longer in his 
 "<I>absence</I>" than in his "<I>presence.</I>" But if their decline 
 had begun immediately after he left them, and before his return to 
 them, the reproof will be just. But see on

 censure by implying that the Galatians were tempted by seducers from
 without, with whom the chief guilt lay: and the present, "ye are
 <I>being</I> removed," implies that their seduction was only in process of
 being effected, not that it was actually effected. W<FONT SIZE=-1>AHL</FONT>,

 Christianity from the law. This severance was partially recognized

 whole period of his stay at Damascus, called by Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:23">Ac 9:23</A>),

 "many [<I>Greek,</I> a considerable number of] days." It is curiously
 confirmatory of the legitimacy of taking "many days" to stand for 
 "three years," that the same phrase exactly occurs in the same sense in

 at Damascus: thus he shows the independence of his apostolic 
 commission. He also here had that comparative retirement needed, after 
 the first fervor of his conversion, to prepare him for the great work 
 before him. Compare Moses

 This is the same visit to Jerusalem as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:26">Ac 9:26</A>,
 
 and at this visit occurred the vision

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:17,18">Ac 22:17, 18</A>).
 
 The incident which led to his leaving Damascus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:25,2Co+11:33">Ac 9:25;
 2Co 11:33</A>) 

 was not the main <I>cause</I> of his going <I>to Jerusalem.</I> So that
 there is no discrepancy in the statement here that he went "to see 
 Peter"; or rather, as <I>Greek,</I> "to make the acquaintance of"; "to 
 become personally acquainted with." The two oldest manuscripts read, 
 "Cephas," the name given Peter elsewhere in the Epistle, the 
 <I>Hebrew</I> name; as <I>Peter</I> is the <I>Greek</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:42">Joh 1:42</A>).

 Appropriate to the view of him here as the apostle especially of the 
 Hebrews. It is remarkable that Peter himself, in his Epistles, uses the 
 <I>Greek</I> name <I>Peter,</I> perhaps to mark his antagonism to the 
 Judaizers who would cling to the Hebraic form. He was prominent among 
 the apostles, though James, as bishop of Jerusalem, had the chief 
 authority there

 <B>fifteen days</B>--only fifteen days; contrasting with the long period of
 <I>three years,</I> during which, previously, he had exercised an independent
 commission in preaching: a fact proving on the face of it, how little he
 owed to Peter in regard to his apostolical authority or instruction.
 The <I>Greek</I> for "to see," at the same time implies
 <I>visiting a person important to know,</I> such as Peter was. The plots of
 the Jews prevented him staying longer 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:29">Ac 9:29</A>).

 Also, the vision directing him to depart to the Gentiles, for that the 
 people of Jerusalem would not receive his testimony

 wherein Luke, as an historian, describes more generally what Paul, the 
 subject of the history, himself details more particularly. The history 
 speaks of "apostles"; and Paul's mention of a <I>second</I> apostle, 
 besides Peter, reconciles the Epistle and the history. At Stephen's 
 martyrdom, and the consequent persecution, the other ten apostles, 
 agreeably to Christ's directions, seem to have <I>soon</I> (though not 
 <I>immediately,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:14">Ac 8:14</A>)

 left Jerusalem to preach elsewhere. James remained in charge of the 
 mother church, as its bishop. Peter, the apostle of the circumcision, 
 was present during Paul's fifteen days' stay; but he, too, presently 
 after

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:32">Ac 9:32</A>),
 
 went on a circuit through Judea.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>James, the Lord's brother</B>--This designation, to distinguish him from
 James the son of Zebedee, was appropriate while that apostle was alive.
 But before Paul's second visit to Jerusalem 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:1,Ac+15:1-4">Ga 2:1;
 Ac 15:1-4</A>), 

 he had been beheaded by Herod

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:2">Ac 12:2</A>).

 Accordingly, in the subsequent mention of James here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:9,12">Ga 2:9, 12</A>),

 he is not designated by this distinctive epithet: a minute, undesigned 
 coincidence, and proof of genuineness. James was the Lord's brother, 
 not in our strict sense, but in the sense, "cousin," or "kinsman"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:10,Joh+20:17">Mt 28:10;
 Joh 20:17</A>). 

 His brethren are never called "sons of Joseph," which they would have
 been had they been the Lord's brothers strictly. However, compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:8">Ps 69:8</A>,
 
 "I am an alien to <I>my mother's children.</I>" In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:3,5">Joh 7:3, 5</A>,

 the "brethren" who believed not in Him may mean His <I>near 
 relations,</I> not including the two of His brethren, that is, 
 relatives (James and Jude) who were among the Twelve apostles.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:14">Ac 1:14</A>,

 "His brethren," refer to Simon and Joses, and others

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:55">Mt 13:55</A>)

 of His kinsmen, who were not apostles. It is not likely there would be 
 two pairs of brothers named alike, of such eminence as James and Jude; 
 the likelihood is that the apostles James and Jude are also the writers 
 of the Epistles, and the brethren of Jesus. James and Joses were sons 
 of Alpheus and Mary, sister of the Virgin Mary.</P>

 subsequently confirmed in the faith

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:23,41">Ac 15:23, 41</A>).

 He probably went first to C&aelig;sarea, the main seaport, and thence 
 by sea to Tarsus of Cilicia, his native place

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:30">Ac 9:30</A>),

 and thence to Syria; Cilicia having its geographical affinities with 
 Syria, rather than with Asia Minor, as the Tarsus mountains separate it 
 from the latter. His placing "Syria" in the order of words before 
 "Cilicia," is due to Antioch being a more important city than Tarsus, 
 as also to his longer stay in the former city. Also "Syria and 
 Cilicia," from their close geographical connection, became a generic 
 geographical phrase, the more important district being placed first 
 [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ONYBEARE</FONT> and H<FONT SIZE=-1>OWSON</FONT>]. This 
 sea journey accounts for his being "unknown by face to the churches of 
 Judea"

 occupy but a few days

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:25">Ac 12:25</A>),

 Church decided that Gentile Christians need not be circumcised. His 
 omitting allusion to that decree is; (1) Because his <I>design</I> here 
 is to show the Galatians his own independent apostolic authority, 
 whence he was not likely to support himself by their decision. Thus we 
 see that general councils are not above apostles. (2) Because he argues 
 the point upon principle, not authoritative decisions. (3) The decree 
 did not go the length of the position maintained here: the council did 
 not impose Mosaic ordinances; the apostle maintains that the Mosaic 
 institution itself is at an end.  (4) The Galatians were Judaizing, not 
 because the Jewish law was imposed by authority of the Church as 
 <I>necessary to Christianity,</I> but because they thought it necessary

 It was necessary that the Jerusalem apostles should know beforehand

 the nature of the doctrine they preached (as Paul did privately to the

 run, in vain; but lest he should, if he gave them no explanation, 
 <I>seem</I> so <I>to them.</I> His race was the swift-running 
 proclamation of the Gospel to the Gentiles (compare "run,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:4">Ga 2:4</A>

 ("certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:5">Ac 15:5</A>),

 demanded his circumcision. The apostles, however, constrained by the 
 firmness of Paul and Barnabas

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:5">Ga 2:5</A>),

 did not compel or insist on his being circumcised. Thus they virtually 
 sanctioned Paul's course among the Gentiles and admitted his 
 independence as an apostle: the point he desires to set forth to the 
 Galatians. Timothy, on the other hand, as being a proselyte of the 
 gate, and son of a Jewess

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:1">Ac 16:1</A>),

 he circumcised

 Christianity did not interfere with Jewish usages, regarded merely as 
 social ordinances, though no longer having their religious 
 significance, in the case of Jews and proselytes, while the Jewish 
 polity and temple still stood; after the overthrow of the latter, those 
 usages naturally ceased. To have insisted on Jewish usages for 
 <I>Gentile</I> converts, would have been to make them essential parts 
 of Christianity. To have rudely violated them at first in the case of 
 <I>Jews,</I> would have been inconsistent with that charity which (in 
 matters indifferent) is made all things to all men, that by all means 
 it may win some

 He was called "the Just," from his strict adherence to the law, and so 
 was especially popular among the Jewish party though he did not fall 
 into their extremes; whereas Peter was somewhat estranged from them 
 through his intercourse with the Gentile Christians.  To each apostle 
 was assigned the sphere best suited to his temperament: to James, who 
 was tenacious of the law, the Jerusalem Jews; to Peter, who had opened 
 the door to the Gentiles but who was Judaically disposed, the Jews of 
 the dispersion; to Paul, who, by the miraculous and overwhelming 
 suddenness of his conversion, had the whole current of his early Jewish 
 prejudices turned into an utterly opposite direction, the Gentiles. Not 
 separately and individually, but collectively the apostles together 
 represented Christ, the One Head, in the apostleship. The twelve 
 foundation-stones of various colors are joined together to the one

 <B>11. Peter</B>--"Cephas" in the oldest manuscripts Paul's withstanding
 Peter is the strongest proof that the former gives of the independence
 of his apostleship in relation to the other apostles, and upsets the
 Romish doctrine of Peter's supremacy. The apostles were not always
 inspired; but were so always in <I>writing</I> the Scriptures. If then the
 inspired men who <I>wrote</I> them were not invariably at other times
 infallible, much less were the uninspired men who kept them. The
 Christian fathers may be trusted generally as witnesses to facts, but
 not implicitly followed in matters of opinion.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:20,26">Ac 11:20, 26</A>),

 and where Peter is said to have been subsequently bishop. The question
 at Antioch was not whether the Gentiles were admissible to the
 Christian covenant without becoming circumcised--that was the question
 settled at the Jerusalem council just before--but whether the Gentile
 Christians were to be admitted to <I>social intercourse with the Jewish
 Christians</I> without conforming to the Jewish institution. The
 Judaizers, soon after the council had passed the resolutions 
 recognizing the equal rights of the Gentile Christians, repaired to 
 Antioch, the scene of the gathering in of the Gentiles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:20-26">Ac 11:20-26</A>),

 to witness, what to Jews would look so extraordinary, the receiving of 
 men to communion of the Church without circumcision. Regarding the 
 proceeding with prejudice, they explained away the force of the 
 Jerusalem decision; and probably also desired to watch whether the 
 <I>Jewish</I> Christians among the Gentiles violated the law, which 
 that decision did not verbally sanction <I>them</I> in doing, though 
 giving the Gentiles latitude

 the Church at Jerusalem under James' bishopric.  Still James' leanings 
 were to legalism, and this gave him his influence with the Jewish party

 We recognize the same old nature in him as led him, after faithfully 
 witnessing for Christ, yet for a brief space, to deny Him. "Ever the

 Gospels and the Epistle in the consistency of character as portrayed in

 It was not a question of liberty, and of bearing with others'

 But it is not <I>restricted</I> solely to the Jews, as A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> thinks; for these are the representative people of 
 the world at large, and their "law" is the embodiment of what God 
 requires of the whole world. The curse of its non-fulfilment affects 
 the Gentiles through the Jews; for the law represents that 
 righteousness which God requires of all, and which, since the Jews 
 failed to fulfil, the Gentiles are equally unable to fulfil.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:10">Ga 3:10</A>,

 "As many as are of the works of the law, are under the curse," refers 
 plainly, not to <I>the Jews only,</I> but to all, even Gentiles (as the 
 Galatians), who seek justification by the law. The Jews' law represents 
 the universal law which condemned the Gentiles, though with less clear 
 consciousness on their part

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:1-29">Ro 2:1-29</A>).

 The revelation of God's "wrath" by the law of conscience, in some 
 degree prepared the Gentiles for appreciating redemption through Christ 
 when revealed. The curse had to be removed from off the heathen, too, 
 as well as the Jews, in order that the blessing, through Abraham, might 
 flow to them. Accordingly, the "we," in "that <I>we</I> might receive 
 the promise of the Spirit," plainly refers to both Jews and Gentiles.

 and "from the curse" under which all lie who trust to the law and the 
 works of the law for justification. The Gentile Galatians, by putting 
 themselves under the law, were involving themselves in the curse from 
 which Christ has redeemed the Jews primarily, and through them the 
 Gentiles. The ransom price He paid was His own precious blood

 having put them to death otherwise, in order to brand them with 
 peculiar ignominy, they <I>hung</I> the bodies on a tree, and such

 So legal Judaism could make no alteration in the fundamental relation 
 between God and man, already established by the promises to Abraham; it 
 could not add as a new condition the observance of the law, in which 
 case the fulfilment of the promise would be attached to a condition 
 impossible for man to perform. The "covenant" here is one of free 
 grace, a <I>promise</I> afterwards carried into effect in the 
 Gospel.</P>

 <A NAME="Ga3_16"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>16.</B> This verse is parenthetical. The covenant of promise was not
 "spoken" (so <I>Greek</I> for "made") to Abraham alone, but "to Abraham and
 his seed"; to the latter especially; and this means Christ (and that
 which is inseparable from Him, the <I>literal Israel,</I> and
 <I>the spiritual,</I> His body, the Church). Christ not having come when
 the law was given, the covenant could not have been then fulfilled, but
 awaited the coming of Him, the Seed, to whom it was spoken.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>promises</B>--plural, because the same promise was often repeated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:3,7,15:5,18,17:7,22:18">Ge 12:3, 7; 15:5, 18; 17:7; 22:18</A>),

 and because it involved many things; earthly blessings to the literal
 children of Abraham in Canaan, and spiritual and heavenly blessings to 
 his spiritual children; but both promised to Christ, "the Seed" and 
 representative Head of the literal and spiritual Israel alike. In the 
 spiritual seed there is no distinction of Jew or <I>Greek;</I> but to 
 the literal seed, the promises still in part remain to be fulfilled

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:26">Ro 11:26</A>).

 The covenant was not made with "many" seeds (which if there had been, a 
 pretext might exist for supposing there was one seed before the law, 
 another under the law; and that those sprung from one seed, say the 
 Jewish, are admitted on different terms, and with a higher degree of 
 acceptability, than those sprung from the Gentile seed), but with the 
 one seed; therefore, the promise that in Him "all the families of the 
 earth shall be blessed"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:3">Ge 12:3</A>),

 joins in this one Seed, Christ, Jew and Gentile, as fellow heirs on the 
 same terms of acceptability, namely, by grace through faith

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:13">Ro 4:13</A>);

 not to some by promise, to others by the law, but to all alike, 
 circumcised and uncircumcised, constituting but one seed in Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:16">Ro 4:16</A>).

 The law, on the other hand, contemplates the Jews and Gentiles as 
 distinct seeds. God makes a covenant, but it is one of promise; whereas 
 the law is a covenant of works. Whereas the law brings in a mediator, a 
 third party

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:19,20">Ga 3:19, 20</A>),

 God makes His covenant of promise with the one seed, Christ

 The dispensation of "the promise" began with the call of Abraham from 
 Ur into Canaan, and ended on the last night of his grandson Jacob's 
 sojourn in Canaan, the <I>land of promise.</I> The dispensation of the 
 law, which engenders bondage, was beginning to draw on from the time of 
 his entrance into Egypt, the land of bondage. It was to Christ in him, 
 as in his grandfather Abraham, and his father Isaac, not to him or them 
 as persons, the promise was spoken. On the day following the last 
 repetition of the promise orally

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+46:1-6">Ge 46:1-6</A>),

 at Beer-sheba, Israel passed into Egypt. It is from the end, not from 
 the beginning of the dispensation of promise, that the interval of four 
 hundred thirty years between it and the law is to be counted. At 
 Beer-sheba, after the covenant with Abimelech, Abraham called on the 
 everlasting God, and the well was confirmed to him and his seed as an 
 everlasting possession.  Here God appeared to Isaac. Here Jacob 
 received the promise of the blessing, for which God had called Abraham 
 out of Ur, repeated for the last time, on the last night of his sojourn 
 in the land of promise.

 representative, giving the blessing <I>directly</I> by <I>promise</I> to

 consequently, the law, with its inseparable appendage of a mediator,
 cannot be the normal way of dealing of God, the one, and unchangeable
 God, who dealt with Abraham by <I>direct</I> promise, as a sovereign, not
 as one forming a compact with another party, with conditions and a
 mediator attached thereto. God would bring man into immediate communion

 <B>life</B>--The law, as an externally prescribed rule, can never internally

 righteousness would have been by the law (for where life is, there
 righteousness, its <I>condition,</I> must also be)." But the law does not
 <I>pretend</I> to give life, and therefore not righteousness; so there is
 no opposition between the law and the promise. Righteousness can only

 <B>might be</B>--rather, "that we <I>may</I> be justified by faith"; which we
 could not be till Christ, the object of faith, had come. Meanwhile the
 law, by outwardly checking the sinful propensity which was constantly
 giving fresh proof of its refractoriness--as thus the consciousness of
 the power of the sinful principle became more vivid, and hence the sense
 of need both of forgiveness of sin and freedom from its bondage was
 awakened--the law became a "schoolmaster to guide us unto Christ"
 [N<FONT SIZE=-1>EANDER</FONT>]. The <I>moral</I> law shows us what we ought to do, and so we
 learn our inability to do it. In the <I>ceremonial</I> law we seek, by
 animal sacrifices, to answer for our not having done it, but find dead
 victims no satisfaction for the sins of living men, and that outward
 purifying will not cleanse the soul; and that therefore we need an
 infinitely better Sacrifice, the antitype of all the legal sacrifices.
 Thus delivered up to the <I>judicial</I> law, we see how awful is the doom
 we deserve: thus the law at last leads us to Christ, with whom we find
 righteousness and peace. "<I>Sin, sin!</I> is the word heard again and

 G<FONT SIZE=-1>ATAKER</FONT> defines a Christian, "One who has put on

 therefore, He being the Son of God, ye become sons by adoption, by 
 virtue of His Sonship by generation. This proves that baptism, <I>where 
 it answers to its ideal,</I> is not a mere empty sign, but a means of 
 spiritual transference from the state of legal condemnation to that of 
 living union with Christ, and of sonship through Him in relation to God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:14">Ro 13:14</A>).

 Christ alone can, by baptizing with His Spirit, make the inward grace
 correspond to the outward sign. But as He promises the blessing in the

 privileges. But under the law the male sex had great privileges. Males 
 alone had in their body circumcision, the sign of the covenant
 (contrast <I>baptism</I> applied to male and female alike); they alone

 "The Church has its own ages" [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>].  God does
 nothing prematurely, but, foreseeing the end from the beginning, waits 
 till all is ripe for the execution of His purpose. Had Christ come 
 directly after the fall, the enormity and deadly fruits of sin would 
 not have been realized fully by man, so as to feel his desperate state 
 and need of a Saviour. Sin was fully developed. Man's inability to save 
 himself by obedience to the law, whether that of Moses, or that of 
 conscience, was completely manifested; all the prophecies of various 
 ages found their common center in <I>this</I> particular time: and 
 Providence, by various arrangements in the social and political, as 
 well as the moral world, had fully prepared the way for the coming 
 Redeemer. God often permits physical evil long before he teaches the 
 remedy. The smallpox had for long committed its ravages before 
 inoculation, and then vaccination, was discovered. It was essential to 
 the honor of God's law to permit evil long before He revealed the full 
 remedy. Compare "the set time"

 <B>6. because ye are sons</B>--The gift of the Spirit of prayer is the
 consequence of our adoption. The Gentile Galatians might think, as the
 Jews were under the law before their adoption, that so they, too, must
 first be under the law. Paul, by anticipation, meets this objection by
 saying, Y<FONT SIZE=-1>E ARE</FONT> sons, therefore ye need not be as children 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:1">Ga 4:1</A>)

 under the tutorship of the law, as being already in the free state of 
 "sons" of God by faith in Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:26">Ga 3:26</A>),

 no longer in your nonage (as "children,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:1">Ga 4:1</A>).

 The Spirit of God's only Begotten Son in your hearts, sent from, and 
 leading you to cry to, the Father, attests your sonship by adoption: 
 for the Spirit is the "earnest of your inheritance"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:15,16,Eph+1:13">Ro 8:15, 16;
 Eph 1:13</A>). 

 "It is because ye are sons that God sent forth" (the <I>Greek</I>
 requires this translation, not "<I>hath</I> sent forth") into 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>OUR</FONT> (so the oldest manuscripts read for "your," in
 <I>English Version</I>) hearts the Spirit of His son, crying, "Abba, 
 Father"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:12">Joh 1:12</A>).
 
 As in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:5">Ga 4:5</A>

 he changed from "them," the third person, to "we," the first person, so 
 here he changes from "ye," the second person, to "our," the first 
 person: this he does to identify their case as Gentiles, with his own 
 and that of his believing fellow countrymen, as Jews. In another point 
 of view, though not the immediate one intended by the context, this 
 verse expresses, "Because ye <I>are</I> sons (already in God's electing 
 purpose of love), God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your 
 hearts," &c.: God thus, by sending His Spirit in due time, actually 
 conferring that sonship which He already regarded as a present reality 
 ("are") because of His purpose, even before it was actually fulfilled. 
 So

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:13">Heb 2:13</A>,

 where "the children" are spoken of as existing in His purpose, before

 <B>the Spirit of his Son</B>--By faith ye are one with the Son, so that
 what is His is yours; His Sonship ensures your sonship; His Spirit

 Christ, he is none of His" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:9">Ro 8:9</A>).

 Moreover, as the Spirit of God proceeds from God the Father, so the 
 Spirit of the Son proceeds from the Son: so that the Holy Ghost, as the 
 Creed says, "proceedeth from the Father and the Son." The Father was 
 not <I>begotten:</I> the Son is <I>begotten</I> of the Father; the Holy 
 Ghost <I>proceeding</I> from the Father and the Son.

 "The Spirit of adoption" is said to be that whereby <FONT

 "The S<FONT SIZE=-1>PIRIT ITSELF</FONT> maketh intercession for us with groanings which

 its acceptability with God.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Abba, Father</B>--The <I>Hebrew</I> says, "<I>Abba</I>" (a <I>Hebrew</I> term), the
 <I>Greek,</I> "Father" ("<I>Pater,</I>" a <I>Greek</I> term in the original), both
 united together in one Sonship and one cry of faith, "Abba, Father." So

 synagogues. Compare the <I>Jerusalem</I> Talmud [<I>Tractatu Succa,

 we have the three, "faith," "hope," and "love." The <I>Greek</I>

 <I>Love</I> is not joined with <I>faith</I> in justifying, but is the

 not legalists, upholding circumcision, think that the essence of the

 Let them, therefore, seek this "faith," which will enable them truly to

 uncircumcision think that, because the law does not justify, they are 
 free to walk after "the flesh"

 God. Paul's living as a Gentile among Gentiles, plainly showed that, if 
 he lived as a Jew among Jews, it was not that he thought it meritorious 
 before God, but as a matter indifferent, wherein he might lawfully 
 conform as a <I>Jew by birth</I> to those with whom he was, in order to
