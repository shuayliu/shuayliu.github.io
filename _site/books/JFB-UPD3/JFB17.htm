 <B>3. made a feast unto all his princes and his servants</B>--Banquets on so
 grand a scale, and extending over so great a period, have been
 frequently provided by the luxurious monarchs of Eastern countries,
 both in ancient and modern times. The early portion of this festive
 season, however, seems to have been dedicated to amusement,
 particularly an exhibition of the magnificence and treasures of the
 court, and it was closed by a special feast of seven days' continuance,
 given within the gardens of the royal palace. The ancient palace of
 Susa has been recently disinterred from an incumbent mass of earth and
 ruins; and in that palace, which is, beyond all doubt, the actual
 edifice referred to in this passage, there is a great hall of marble
 pillars. "The position of the great colonnade corresponds with the
 account here given. It stands on an elevation in the center of the
 mound, the remainder of which we may well imagine to have been
 occupied, after the Persian fashion, with a garden and fountains. Thus
 the colonnade would represent the 'court of the garden of the king's
 palace' with its 'pillars of marble.' I am even inclined to believe the
 expression, 'Shushan the palace,' applies especially to this portion of
 the existing ruins, in contradistinction to the citadel and the city of
 Shushan" [L<FONT SIZE=-1>OFTUS,</FONT> <I>Chaldaea and Susiana</I>].</P>

 <B>6. Where were white, green, and blue hangings,</B> &c.--The fashion, in
 the houses of the great, on festive occasions, was to decorate the
 chambers from the middle of the wall downward with damask or velvet
 hangings of variegated colors suspended on hooks, or taken down at
 pleasure.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the beds were of gold and silver</B>--that is, the couches on which,
 according to Oriental fashion, the guests reclined, and which were
 either formed entirely of gold and silver or inlaid with ornaments of
 those costly metals, stood on an elevated floor of parti-colored
 marble.</P>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+5:6,7:2,7,8">Es 5:6; 7:2, 7, 8</A>,

 the description, that this was a banquet rather than a feast.</P>

 <B>9. Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women</B>--The celebration
 was double; for, as according to the Oriental fashion, the sexes do not
 intermingle in society, the court ladies were entertained in a separate
 apartment by the queen.</P>

 <A NAME="Es1_10"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>10-12. On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with
 wine</B>--As the feast days advanced, the drinking was more freely indulged
 in, so that the close was usually marked by great excesses of revelry.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he commanded .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the seven chamberlains</B>--These were the eunuchs who
 had charge of the royal harem. The refusal of Vashti to obey an order
 which required her to make an indecent exposure of herself before a
 company of drunken revellers, was becoming both the modesty of her sex
 and her rank as queen; for, according to Persian customs, the queen,
 even more than the wives of other men, was secluded from the public
 gaze. Had not the king's blood been heated with wine, or his reason
 overpowered by force of offended pride, he would have perceived that his
 own honor, as well as hers, was consulted by her dignified conduct.</P>

 <B>13-19. Then the king said to the wise men</B>--These were probably the
 magi, without whose advice as to the proper time of doing a thing the
 Persian kings never did take any step whatever; and the persons named in
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:14">Es 1:14</A>

 were the "seven counsellors" (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:14">Ezr 7:14</A>)

 who formed the state ministry. The combined wisdom of all, it seems, 
 was enlisted to consult with the king what course should be taken after 
 so unprecedented an occurrence as Vashti's disobedience of the royal 
 summons. It is scarcely possible for us to imagine the astonishment 
 produced by such a refusal in a country and a court where the will of 
 the sovereign was absolute. The assembled grandees were petrified with 
 horror at the daring affront. Alarm for the consequences that might 
 ensue to each of them in his own household next seized on their minds; 
 and the sounds of bacchanalian revelry were hushed into deep and 
 anxious consultation what punishment to inflict on the refractory 
 queen. But a purpose was to be served by the flattery of the king and 
 the enslavement of all women. The counsellors were too intoxicated or 
 obsequious to oppose the courtly advice of Memucan was unanimously 
 resolved, with a wise regard to the public interests of the nation, 
 that the punishment of Vashti could be nothing short of degradation 
 from her royal dignity. The doom was accordingly pronounced and made
 known in all parts of the empire.</P>

 <B>1-3. After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was
 appeased</B>--On recovering from the violent excitement of his revelry
 and rage, the king was pierced with poignant regret for the unmerited
 treatment he had given to his beautiful and dignified queen. But,
 according to the law, which made the word of a Persian king
 irrevocable, she could not be restored. His counsellors, for their own
 sake, were solicitous to remove his disquietude, and hastened to
 recommend the adoption of all suitable means for gratifying their royal
 master with another consort of equal or superior attractions to those
 of his divorced queen. In the despotic countries of the East the custom
 obtains that when an order is sent to a family for a young damsel to
 repair to the royal palace, the parents, however unwilling, dare not
 refuse the honor for their daughter; and although they know that when
 she is once in the royal harem, they will never see her again, they are
 obliged to yield a silent and passive compliance. On the occasion
 referred to, a general search was commanded to be made for the greatest
 beauties throughout the empire, in the hope that, from their ranks, the
 disconsolate monarch might select one for the honor of succeeding to
 the royal honors of Vashti. The damsels, on arrival at the palace, were
 placed under the custody of "Hege, the king's chamberlain, keeper of
 the women," that is, the chief eunuch, usually a repulsive old man, on
 whom the court ladies are very dependent, and whose favor they are
 always desirous to secure.</P>

 <B>5. Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew</B>--Mordecai held
 some office about the court. But his "sitting at the king's gate"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:21">Es 2:21</A>)

 does not necessarily imply that he was in the humble condition of a 
 porter; for, according to an institute of Cyrus, all state officers 
 were required to wait in the outer courts till they were summoned into 
 the presence chamber. He might, therefore, have been a person of some 
 official dignity. This man had an orphan cousin, born during the exile, 
 under his care, who being distinguished by great personal beauty, was 
 one of the young damsels taken into the royal harem on this occasion. 
 She had the good fortune at once to gain the good will of the chief 
 eunuch

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:9">Es 2:9</A>].

 Her sweet and amiable appearance made her a favorite with all who 
 looked upon her

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:15">Es 2:15</A>,

 last clause). Her Hebrew name

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:7">Es 2:7</A>)

 was Hadassah, that is, "myrtle," which, on her introduction into the
 royal harem, was changed to Esther, that is, the star Venus, indicating 
 beauty and good fortune [G<FONT SIZE=-1>ESENIUS</FONT>].</P>

 <B>11. Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's
 house</B>--The harem is an inviolable sanctuary, and what is transacted
 within its walls is as much a secret to those without as if they were
 thousands of miles away. But hints were given him through the eunuchs.</P>

 <B>12. Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus</B>--A
 whole year was spent in preparation for the intended honor. Considering
 that this took place in a palace, the long period prescribed, together
 with the profusion of costly and fragrant cosmetics employed, was
 probably required by state etiquette.</P>

 <B>17. the king loved Esther above all the women</B>--The choice fell on
 Esther, who found favor in the eyes of Ahasuerus. He elevated her to
 the dignity of chief wife, or queen. The other competitors had
 apartments assigned them in the royal harem, and were retained in the
 rank of secondary wives, of whom Oriental princes have a great number.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he set the royal crown upon her head</B>--This consisted only of a purple
 ribbon, streaked with white, bound round the forehead. The nuptials
 were celebrated by a magnificent entertainment, and, in honor of the
 auspicious occasion, "he made a release to the provinces, and gave
 gifts, according to the state of the king." The dotation of Persian
 queens consisted in consigning to them the revenue of certain cities,
 in various parts of the kingdom, for defraying their personal and
 domestic expenditure. Some of these imposts the king remitted or
 lessened at this time.</P>

 <B>21. In those days .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. two of the king's chamberlains .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. were
 wroth and sought to lay hand on the king,</B> &c.--This secret conspiracy
 against the king's life probably arose out of revenge for the divorce
 of Vashti, in whose interest, and at whose instigation, these eunuchs
 may have acted. Through the vigilance of Mordecai, whose fidelity,
 however, passed unnoticed, the design was frustrated, while the
 conspirators were condemned to be executed and as the matter was
 recorded in the court annals, it became the occasion afterwards of
 Mordecai's preferment to the place of power and influence for which, in
 furtherance of the national interests of the Jews, divine providence
 intended him.</P>

 <B>1. After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. set his
 seat above all the princes</B>--that is, raised him to the rank of vizier,
 or prime confidential minister, whose pre-eminence in office and power
 appeared in the elevated state chair appropriated to that supreme
 functionary. Such a distinction in seats was counted of vast importance
 in the formal court of Persia.</P>

 <A NAME="Es3_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and
 reverenced Haman</B>--Large mansions in the East are entered by a spacious
 vestibule, or gateway, along the sides of which visitors sit, and are
 received by the master of the house; for none, except the nearest
 relatives or special friends, are admitted farther. There the officers
 of the ancient king of Persia waited till they were called, and did
 obeisance to the all-powerful minister of the day.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence</B>--The obsequious homage of
 prostration not entirely foreign to the manners of the East, had not
 been claimed by former viziers; but this minion required that all
 subordinate officers of the court should bow before him with their
 faces to the earth. But to Mordecai, it seemed that such an attitude of
 profound reverence was due only to God. Haman being an Amalekite, one
 of a doomed and accursed race, was, doubtless, another element in the
 refusal; and on learning that the recusant was a Jew, whose
 nonconformity was grounded on religious scruples, the magnitude of the
 affront appeared so much the greater, as the example of Mordecai would
 be imitated by all his compatriots. Had the homage been a simple token
 of civil respect, Mordecai would not have refused it; but the Persian
 kings demanded a sort of adoration, which, it is well known, even the
 Greeks reckoned it degradation to express. As Xerxes, in the height of
 his favoritism, had commanded the same honors to be given to the
 minister as to himself, this was the ground of Mordecai's refusal.</P>

 <B>7. In the first month .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they cast Pur, that is, the lot</B>--In
 resorting to this method of ascertaining the most auspicious day for
 putting his atrocious scheme into execution, Haman acted as the kings
 and nobles of Persia have always done, never engaging in any enterprise
 without consulting the astrologers, and being satisfied as to the lucky
 hour. Vowing revenge but scorning to lay hands on a single victim, he
 meditated the extirpation of the whole Jewish race, who, he knew, were
 sworn enemies of his countrymen; and by artfully representing them as a
 people who were aliens in manners and habits, and enemies to the rest
 of his subjects, he procured the king's sanction of the intended
 massacre. One motive which he used in urging his point was addressed to
 the king's cupidity. Fearing lest his master might object that the
 extermination of a numerous body of his subjects would seriously
 depress the public revenue, Haman promised to make up the loss.</P>

 talent, will be about &pound;2,119,000; but estimated according to the 
 Jewish talent, it will considerably exceed &pound;3,000,000, an immense 
 contribution to be made out of a private fortune. But classic history 
 makes mention of several persons whose resources seem almost 
 incredible.</P>

 <B>10. the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto
 Haman</B>--There was a seal or signet in the ring. The bestowment of
 the ring, with the king's name and that of his kingdom engraven on it,
 was given with much ceremony, and it was equivalent to putting the sign
 manual to a royal edict.</P>

 <B>12-15. Then were the king's scribes called .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and there 
 was written</B>--The government secretaries were employed in making out 
 the proclamation authorizing a universal massacre of the Jews on one 
 day.  It was translated into the dialects of all the people throughout 
 the vast empire, and swift messengers were sent to carry it into all 
 the provinces. On the day appointed, all Jews were to be put to death 
 and their property confiscated; doubtless, the means by which Haman
 hoped to pay his stipulated tribute into the royal treasury. To us it 
 appears unaccountable how any sane monarch could have given his consent 
 to the extirpation of a numerous class of his subjects. But such acts 
 of frenzied barbarity have, alas! been not rarely authorized by 
 careless and voluptuous despots, who have allowed their ears to be 
 engrossed and their policy directed by haughty and selfish minions, who 
 had their own passions to gratify, their own ends to serve.</P>

 picture of an Oriental despot, wallowing with his favorite in sensual
 enjoyments, while his tyrannical cruelties were rending the hearts and
 homes of thousands of his subjects.</P>

 <B>1, 2. When Mordecai perceived all that was done</B>--Relying on the
 irrevocable nature of a Persian monarch's decree 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:15">Da 6:15</A>),

 Hamman made it known as soon as the royal sanction had been obtained; 
 and Mordecai was, doubtless, among the first to hear of it. On his own 
 account, as well as on that of his countrymen, this astounding decree 
 must have been indescribably distressing. The acts described in this 
 passage are, according to the Oriental fashion, expressive of the most 
 poignant sorrow; and his approach to the gate of the palace, under the 
 impulse of irrepressible emotions, was to make an earnest though vain 
 appeal to the royal mercy. Access, however, to the king's presence was, 
 to a person in his disfigured state, impossible: "for none might enter 
 into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth." But he found means of 
 conveying intelligence of the horrid plot to Queen Esther.</P>

 Mordecai</B>--Her object in doing so was either to qualify him for resuming
 his former office, or else, perhaps, of fitting him to come near enough
 to the palace to inform her of the cause of such sudden and extreme
 distress.</P>

 <B>5. Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom
 he had appointed to attend upon her</B>--Communication with the women in
 the harem is very difficult to be obtained, and only through the medium
 of the keepers. The chief eunuch receives the message from the lips of
 the queen, conveys it to some inferior office of the seraglio. When
 the commission is executed, the subaltern communicates it to the
 superintendent, by whom it is delivered to the queen. This chief
 eunuch, usually an old man who has recommended himself by a long course
 of faithful service, is always appointed by the king; but it is his
 interest, as well as his duty, to ingratiate himself with the queen
 also. Accordingly, we find Hatach rendering himself very serviceable in
 carrying on those private communications with Mordecai who was thereby
 enabled to enlist Esther's powerful influence.</P>

 exceedingly strong. As it can scarcely be supposed that Mordecai was
 still using authority over Esther as his adopted daughter, he must be
 considered as imploring rather than commanding her, in the name of her
 brethren and in the name of her God, to make a direct appeal to the
 feelings of her royal husband.</P>

 <B>11. whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the
 inner court, who is not called</B>--The Persian kings surrounded themselves
 with an almost impassable circle of forms. The law alluded to was first
 enacted by Deioces, king of Media, and afterwards, when the empires
 were united, adopted by the Persians, that all business should be
 transacted and petitions transmitted to the king through his ministers.
 Although the restriction was not intended, of course, to apply to the
 queen, yet from the strict and inflexible character of the Persian laws
 and the extreme desire to exalt the majesty of the sovereign, even his
 favorite wife had not the privilege of <I>entree,</I> except by special
 favor and indulgence. Esther was suffering from the severity of this
 law; and as, from not being admitted for a whole month to the king's
 presence, she had reason to fear that the royal affections had become
 alienated from her, she had little hope of serving her country's cause
 in this awful emergency.</P>

 <B>13, 14. Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther</B>--His answer was to
 this effect, that Esther need not indulge the vain hope she would, from
 her royal connection, escape the general doom of her race--that he
 (Mordecai) confidently believed God would interpose, and, if not
 through her, by some other deliverer, save His people; but that the
 duty evidently devolved on her, as there was great reason to believe
 that this was the design of Providence in her elevation to the dignity
 of queen, and therefore that she should go with a courageous heart, not
 doubting of success.</P>

 appeal to the king, though she should perish in the attempt.

 <B>1. Esther put on her royal apparel</B>--It was not only natural, but, on
 such occasions, highly proper and expedient, that the queen should
 decorate herself in a style becoming her exalted station. On ordinary
 occasions she might reasonably set off her charms to as much advantage
 as possible; but, on the present occasion, as she was desirous to
 secure the favor of one who sustained the twofold character of her
 husband and her sovereign, public as well as private considerations--a
 regard to her personal safety, no less than the preservation of her
 doomed countrymen--urged upon her the propriety of using every
 legitimate means of recommending herself to the favorable notice of
 Ahasuerus.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against
 the gate of the house</B>--The palace of this Persian king seems to have
 been built, like many more of the same quality and description, with an
 advanced cloister, over against the gate, made in the fashion of a
 large penthouse, supported only by one or two contiguous pillars in the
 front, or else in the center. In such open structures as these, in the
 midst of their guards and counsellors, are the <I>bashaws,</I> kadis, and
 other great officers, accustomed to distribute justice, and transact
 the public affairs of the provinces
 [S<FONT SIZE=-1>HAW</FONT>, <I>Travels</I>]. In such a
 situation the Persian king was seated. The seat he occupied was not a
 <I>throne,</I> according to our ideas of one, but simply a chair, and so
 high that it required a footstool. It was made of gold, or, at least,
 inlaid with that metal, and covered with splendid tapestry, and no one
 save the king might sit down on it under pain of death. It is often
 found pictured on the Persepolitan monuments, and always of the same
 fashion.</P>

 <A NAME="Es5_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his
 hand</B>--This golden scepter receives an interesting illustration from
 the sculptured monuments of Persia and Assyria. In the bas-reliefs of
 Persepolis, copied by Sir Robert Ker Porter, we see King Darius
 enthroned in the midst of his court, and walking abroad in equal state;
 in either case he carries in his right hand a slender rod or wand,
 about equal in length to his own height, ornamented with a small knob
 at the summit. In the Assyrian alabasters, those found at Nimroud as
 well as those from Khorsabad, "the great king" is furnished with the
 same appendage of royalty, a slender rod, but destitute of any knob or
 ornament. On the Khorsabad reliefs the rod is painted red, <I>doubtless</I> to <I>represent gold;</I> proving that "the golden sceptre" was a simple
 wand of that precious metal, commonly held in the right hand, with one
 end resting on the ground, and that whether the king was sitting or
 walking. "The gold sceptre" has received little alteration or
 modification since ancient times
 [G<FONT SIZE=-1>OSS</FONT>]. It was extended to Esther as a
 token not only that her intrusion was pardoned, but that her visit was
 welcome, and a favorable reception given to the suit she had come to
 prefer.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>touched the top of the sceptre</B>--This was the usual way of acknowledging
 the royal condescension, and at the same time expressing reverence and
 submission to the august majesty of the king.</P>

 <A NAME="Es5_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom</B>--This mode of
 speaking originated in the Persian custom of appropriating for the
 maintenance of great men, or royal favorites, one city for his bread,
 another for his wine, a third for his clothes, &c., so that the phrase
 denoted great liberality.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4. let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have
 prepared for him</B>--There was great address in this procedure of
 Esther's; for, by showing such high respect to the king's favorite, she
 would the better insinuate herself into the royal affections; and gain
 a more suitable opportunity of making known her request.</P>

 with the king and queen, it was natural that he should have been elated
 with the honor.</P>

 <B>1. the king .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. commanded to bring the book of records of the
 chronicles</B>--In Eastern courts, there are scribes or officers whose
 duty it is to keep a journal of every occurrence worthy of notice. A
 book of this kind, abounding with anecdotes, is full of interest. It
 has been a custom with Eastern kings, in all ages, frequently to cause
 the annals of the kingdom to be read to them. It is resorted to, not
 merely as a pastime to while away the tedium of an hour, but as a
 source of instruction to the monarch, by reviewing the important
 incidents of his own life, as well as those of his ancestors. There
 was, therefore, nothing uncommon in this Persian monarch calling for
 the court journal. But, in his being unable to sleep at that
 particular juncture, in his ordering the book then to be read to him,
 and in his attention having been specially directed to the important
 and as yet unrewarded services of Mordecai, the immediate interposition
 of Providence is distinctly visible.</P>

 not at once, and as it were by their own will, determine the kind of
 honor that shall be awarded; but they turn to the courtier standing
 next in rank to themselves, and ask him what shall be done to the
 individual who has rendered the service specified; and according to the

 gift, and is given with great ceremony.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the horse that the king rideth upon</B>--Persia was a country of horses,
 and the highbred charger that the king rode upon acquired, in the eyes

 <B>4. we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed</B>--that is, by the
 cruel and perfidious scheme of that man, who offered an immense sum of
 money to purchase our extermination. Esther dwelt on his contemplated
 atrocity, in a variety of expressions, which both evinced the depth of
 her own emotions, and were intended to awaken similar feelings in the
 king's breast.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my

 people might have enriched the national treasury; and, at all events,
 the policy, if found from experience to be bad, could be altered. But
 the destruction of such a body of people would be an irreparable evil,

 <B>7. he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king</B>--When
 the king of Persia orders an offender to be executed, and then rises

 be hoped for. Even the sudden rising of the king in anger was the same
 as if he had pronounced sentence.</P>

 <B>8. Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was</B>--We do not know
 the precise form of the couches on which the Persians reclined at
 table. But it is probable that they were not very different from those
 used by the Greeks and Romans. Haman, perhaps, at first stood up to beg
 pardon of Esther; but driven in his extremity to resort to an attitude
 of the most earnest supplication, he fell prostrate on the couch where
 the queen was recumbent. The king returning that instant was fired at
 what seemed an outrage on female modesty.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>they covered Haman's face</B>--The import of this striking action is, that
 a criminal is unworthy any longer to look on the face of the king, and
 hence, when malefactors are consigned to their doom in Persia, the
 first thing is to cover the face with a veil or napkin.</P>

 gallows. The information he now volunteered, as well it may be from
 abhorrence of Haman's cold-blooded conspiracy as from sympathy with his
 amiable mistress, involved with her people in imminent peril.</P>

 exposed.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Mordecai came before the king</B>--that is, was introduced at court and

 symbolized, and promoting him to the high dignity which Haman had
 formerly filled.

 cushions, and one foot under him.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman</B>--that is, to

 <B>5, 6. reverse the letters devised by Haman .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to destroy the

 by great tact, and the variety of expressions by which she describes
 her willing submission to her royal husband, the address with which she
 rolls the whole infamy of the meditated massacre on Haman, and the
 argument she draws from the king's sanction being surreptitiously
 obtained, that the decree should be immediately reversed--all indicate

 <I>wind-camel.</I> Young dromedaries also are used to carry expresses, being
 remarkable for the nimbleness and ease of their movements. Animals of

 <B>11-13. the king granted the Jews .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to stand for their life .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

 unalterable character claimed for Persian edicts often placed the king
 in a very awkward dilemma; for, however bitterly he might regret things
 done in a moment of haste and thoughtlessness, it was beyond even his
 power to prevent the consequences. This was the reason on account of
 which the king was laid under a necessity not to reverse, but to issue
 a contradictory edict; according to which it was enacted that if,
 pursuant to the first decree, the Jews were assaulted, they might, by
 virtue of the second, defend themselves and even slay their enemies.
 However strange and even ridiculous this mode of procedure may appear,
 it was the only one which, from the peculiarities of court etiquette in
 Persia, could be adopted. Instances occur in sacred

 no less than profane, history. Many passages of the Bible attest the 
 truth of this, particularly the well-known incident of Daniel's being 
 cast into the den of lions, in conformity with the rash decree of 
 Darius, though, as it afterwards appeared, contrary to the personal 
 desire of that monarch. That the law of Persia has undergone no change 
 in this respect, and the power of the monarch not less immutable, 
 appear from many anecdotes related in the books of modern travellers 
 through that country.</P>

 antagonistic decrees was, in the meantime, to raise a fierce and bloody
 war between the Jews and their enemies throughout the Persian empire;
 but through the dread of Esther and Mordecai, the provincial governors
 universally favored their cause, so that their enemies fell in great
 numbers.</P>

 <B>13. let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do 
 to-morrow also according unto this day's decree</B>--Their enemies 
 adroitly concealing themselves for the first day might have returned on 
 the next, when they imagined that the privilege of the Jews was 
 expired; so that that people would have been surprised and slain. The 
 extension of the decree to another day at the queen's special desire 
 has exposed her to the charge of being actuated by a cruel and 
 vindictive disposition.  But her conduct in making this request is 
 capable of full vindication, on the ground (1) that Haman's sons having 
 taken a prominent part in avenging their father's fall, and having been 
 previously slain in the <I>melee,</I> the order for the exposure of 
 their dead bodies on the gallows was only intended to brand them with 
 public infamy for their malice and hatred to the Jews; and (2) the 
 anti-Jewish party having, in all probability, been instigated through 
 the arts or influence of Haman to acts of spiteful and wanton 
 oppression, the existing state of feeling among the natives required 
 some vigorous and decisive measure to prevent the outbreak of future
 aggressions. The very circumstances of their slaying 800 eight hundred
 Jews in the immediate vicinity of the court

 is a proof of the daring energy and deep-rooted malice by which 
 multidues were actuated against the Jews. To order an extension,
 therefore, of the permissive edict to the Jews to defend themselves,
 was perhaps no more than affording an opportunity for their enemies to
 be publicly known. Though it led to so awful a slaughter of
 seventy-five thousand of their enemies, there is reason to believe that 
 these were chiefly Amalekites, in the fall of whom on this occasion,

 <B>26. they called these days Purim after the name of Pur</B>--"Pur," in the
 Persian language, signifies "lot"; and the feast of Purim, or lots, has
 a reference to the time having been pitched upon by Haman through the
 decision of the lot. In consequence of the signal national deliverance
 which divine providence gave them from the infamous machinations of
 Haman, Mordecai ordered the Jews to commemorate that event by an
 anniversary festival, which was to last for two days, in accordance
 with the two days' war of defense they had to maintain. There was a
 slight difference in the time of this festival; for the Jews in the
 provinces, having defended themselves against their enemies on the
 thirteenth, devoted the fourteenth to festivity; whereas their brethren
 in Shushan, having extended that work over two days, did not observe
 their thanksgiving feast till the fifteenth. But this was remedied by
 authority, which fixed the fourteenth and fifteenth of Adar. It became
 a season of sunny memories to the universal body of the Jews; and, by
 the letters of Mordecai, dispersed through all parts of the Persian
 empire, it was established as an annual feast, the celebration of which
 is kept up still. On both days of the feast, the modern Jews read over
 the <I>Megillah</I> or Book of Esther in their synagogues. The copy read
 must not be printed, but written on vellum in the form of a roll; and
 the names of the ten sons of Haman are written on it a peculiar manner,
 being ranged, they say, like so many bodies on a gibbet. The reader
 must pronounce all these names in one breath. Whenever Haman's name is
 pronounced, they make a terrible noise in the synagogue. Some drum with
 their feet on the floor, and the boys have mallets with which they
 knock and make a noise. They prepare themselves for their carnival by a
 previous fast, which should continue three days, in imitation of
 Esther's; but they have mostly reduced it to one day

 history, and improperly separated from the preceding chapter, it might
 be that the occasion of levying this new impost arose out of the
 commotions raised by Haman's conspiracy. Neither the nature nor the
 amount of the tax has been recorded; only it was not a local tribute,
 but one exacted from all parts of his vast empire.</P>

 From sitting contentedly at the king's gate, he was raised to the
 dignity of highest subject, the powerful ruler of the kingdom. Acting 
 uniformly on the great principles of truth and righteousness, his 
 greatness rested on a firm foundation. His faith was openly avowed, and 
 his influence as a professor of the true religion was of the greatest 
 usefulness for promoting the welfare of the Jewish people, as well as 
 for advancing the glory of God.</P>

 <B>3. For Mordecai .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was next unto King Ahasuerus .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. great among
 the Jews,</B> &c.--The elevation of this pious and patriotic Jew to the
 possession of the highest official power was of very great importance
 to the suffering church at that period; for it enabled him, who all
 along possessed the disposition, now to direct the royal influence and
 authority in promoting the interests and extending the privileges of
 his exiled countrymen. Viewed in this light, the providence of God is
 plainly traceable in all the steps that led to his unexpected
 advancement. This providential interposition is all the more
 remarkable, that, as in the analogous case of Joseph, it was displayed
 in making the ordinary and natural course of things lead to the most
 marvellous results. To use the pious words of an eminent prelate,
 "though in the whole of this episode there was no extraordinary
 manifestation of God's power, no particular cause or agent that was in
 its working advanced above the ordinary pitch of nature, yet the
 contrivance, and suiting these ordinary agents appointed by God, is in
 itself more admirable than if the same end had been effected by means
 that were truly miraculous." The sudden advancement of individuals from
 obscurity and neglect to the highest stations of power and influence
 is, in Eastern courts, no extraordinary nor infrequent occurrence. The
 caprice, the weak partiality of the reigning sovereign, or, it may be,
 his penetrating discernment in discovering latent energy and talent,
 has often "raised the beggar from the dunghill, and set him among
 princes" 

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:8">1Sa 2:8</A>].

 Some of the all-powerful viziers in modern Persia, and not a few of the 
 beys in Egypt, have been elevated to their respective dignities in this 
 manner. And, therefore, the advancement of "Mordecai, who was next unto 
 Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews," was in perfect accordance with 
 the rapid revolution of "the wheel of fortune" in that part of the 
 world. But, considering all the circumstances of Mordecai's 
 advancement, not only his gaining the favor of the king, but his being 
 "accepted of the multitude of his brethren, it was beyond all 
 controversy the doing of the Lord, and was truly marvellous in his 
 people's eyes."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>accepted of the multitude of his brethren</B>--Far from being envious
 of his grandeur, they blessed God for the elevation to official power
 of so good a man.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>speaking peace to all his seed</B>--While his administration was 
 conducted with a mild and impartial hand, he showed a peculiarly warm 
 and friendly feeling to all his countrymen when asked his counsel or 
 his aid.</P>
