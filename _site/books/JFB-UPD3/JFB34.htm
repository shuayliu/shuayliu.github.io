 N<FONT SIZE=-1>AHUM</FONT> means "consolation" and "vengeance"; 
 symbolizing the "consolation" in the book for God's people, and the 
 "vengeance" coming on their enemies. In the first chapter the two 
 themes alternate; but as the prophet advances, vengeance on the capital
 of the Assyrian foe is the predominant topic. He is called "the 
 Elkoshite"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+1:1">Na 1:1</A>),

 from <I>Elkosh,</I> or Elkesi, a village of Galilee, pointed out to
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> [<I>Preface in Nahum</I>] as a place of 
 note among the Jews, having traces of ancient buildings. The name 
 <I>Capernaum,</I> that is, "village of Nahum," seems to take its name 
 from Nahum having resided in it, though born in Elkosh in the 
 neighborhood. There is another Elkosh east of the Tigris, and north of 
 Mosul, believed by Jewish pilgrims to be the birthplace and burial 
 place of the prophet. But the book of Nahum in its allusions shows a 
 particularity of acquaintance with Palestine

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+1:4">Na 1:4</A>),
 
 and only a more general knowledge as to Nineveh

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+2:4-6,3:2,3">Na 2:4-6; 3:2, 3</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 His graphic description of Sennacherib and his army 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+1:9-12">Na 1:9-12</A>)

 makes it not unlikely that he was in or near Jerusalem at the time: 
 hence the number of phrases corresponding to those of Isaiah (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+1:8,9,Isa+8:8,10:23">Na 1:8, 9,
 with Isa 8:8; 10:23</A>;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+2:10,Isa+24:1,21:3">Na 2:10,
 with Isa 24:1; 21:3</A>;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+1:15,Isa+52:7">Na 1:15,
 with Isa 52:7</A>).

 The prophecy in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+1:14">Na 1:14</A>

 probably refers to the murder of Sennacherib twenty years after his
 return from Palestine

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:38">Isa 37:38</A>).

 The date of his prophecies, thus, seems to be about the former years of 
 Hezekiah. So J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> thinks. He plainly writes 
 while the Assyrian power was yet unbroken

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+1:12,2:11-13">Na 1:12; 2:11-13</A>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:15-17">Na 3:15-17</A>).

 The correspondence between the sentiments of Nahum and those of Isaiah
 and Hezekiah, as recorded in Second Kings and Isaiah, proves the 
 likelihood of Nahum's prophecies belonging to the time when Sennacherib 
 was demanding the surrender of Jerusalem, and had not yet raised the 
 siege (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+1:2,2Ki+19:14,15">Na 1:2,
 &c., with
 2Ki 19:14, 15</A>;

 2Ch 32:7, 8</A>;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+1:9,11,2Ki+19:22,27,28">Na 1:9, 11,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+1:15,2:1,2,2Ki+19:32,33">Na 1:15; 2:1, 2,

 with 2Ki 19:22, 23</A>).

 The historical data in the book itself are the humiliation of Israel
 and Judah by Assyria

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+2:2">Na 2:2</A>);
 
 the invasion of Judah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+1:9,11">Na 1:9, 11</A>);

 and the conquest of No-ammon, or Thebes, in Upper Egypt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:8-10">Na 3:8-10</A>).

 Tiglath-pileser and Shalmaneser had carried away Israel. The Jews were 
 harassed by the Syrians, and impoverished by Ahaz' payments to 
 Tiglath-pileser

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:1-27,Isa+7:9">2Ch 28:1-27;
 Isa 7:9</A>). 

 Sargon, Shalmaneser's successor, after the reduction of Ph&oelig;nicia
 by the latter, fearing lest Egypt should join Palestine against him, 
 undertook an expedition to Africa

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+20:1-6">Isa 20:1-6</A>),

 and took Thebes; the latter fact we know only from Nahum, but the 
 <I>success</I> of the expedition in general is corroborated in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+20:1-6">Isa 20:1-6</A>.
 
 Sennacherib, Sargon's successor, made the last Assyrian attempt against
 Judea, ending in the destruction of his army in the fourteenth year of
 Hezekiah (713-710 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>). As Nahum refers to this in part prophetically,
 in part as matter of history 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+1:9-13,2:13">Na 1:9-13; 2:13</A>),

 he must have lived about 720-714 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, that is,
 almost a hundred years before the event foretold, namely, the overthrow 
 of Nineveh by the joint forces of Cyaxares and Nabopolassar in the 
 reign of Chyniladanus, 625 or 603 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophecy is remarkable for its unity of aim. Nahum's object was
 to inspire his countrymen, the Jews, with the assurance that, however
 alarming their position might seem, exposed to the attacks of the mighty
 Assyrian, who had already carried away the ten tribes, yet that not only
 should the Assyrian (Sennacherib) fail in his attack on Jerusalem, but
 Nineveh, his own capital, be taken and his empire overthrown; and this,
 not by an arbitrary exercise of Jehovah's power, but for the iniquities
 of the city and its people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 His position in the canon is seventh of the minor prophets in both the 
 Hebrew and Greek arrangement. He is seventh in point of date.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 His style is clear, elegant, and forcible. Its most striking
 characteristic is the power of representing several phases of an idea in
 the briefest sentences, as in the majestic description of God in the
 commencement, the conquest of Nineveh, and the destruction of No-ammon
 [E<FONT SIZE=-1>ICHORN</FONT>].
 D<FONT SIZE=-1>E</FONT>
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>ETTE</FONT> calls attention to his variety of manner in
 presenting ideas, as marking great poetic talent. "Here there is
 something sonorous in his language there something murmuring; with both
 these alternates something that is soft, delicate, and melting, as the
 subject demands." Excepting two alleged Assyrian words 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+3:17">Na 3:17</A>),

 <I>English Version,</I> "crowned," or <I>princes,</I> and <I>English 
 Version,</I> "captains," or <I>satraps</I> (used by

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:27">Jer 51:27</A>),

 the language is pure. These two, doubtless, came to be known in Judea 
 from the intercourse with Assyria in the eighth and seventh centuries

 <B>2. jealous</B>--In this there is sternness, yet tender affection. We
 are jealous only of those we love: a husband, of a wife; a king, of his
 subjects' loyalty. God is jealous of men because He loves them. God
 will not bear a rival in His claims on them. His burning jealousy for
 His own wounded honor and their love, as much as His justice, accounts
 for all His fearful judgments: the flood, the destruction of Jerusalem,
 that of Nineveh. His jealousy will not admit of His friends being
 oppressed, and their enemies flourishing (compare

 <I>Burning zeal</I> enters into the idea in "jealous" here (compare

 readily give effect to His fury" [G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT>]. Nahum

 after having carried away the ten tribes, now proceeding to invade

 After long waiting for their repentance in vain, at length punishing
 them. A wrong estimate of Jehovah is formed from His suspending 
 punishment: it is not that He is insensible or dilatory, but He 
 reserves wrath for His own fit time. In the case of the penitent, He 
 does not <I>reserve</I> or retain His anger

 very different from that in which God will afflict Judah no more. In 
 the Assyrian's case, because the blow will be fatally final; the 
 latter, because God will make lasting blessedness in Judah's case 
 succeed temporary chastisement. But it seems simpler to refer 
 "affliction" here, as in

 Nineveh, by large canals, had easy access to Babylon; and it was one of 
 the great routes for the people of the west and northwest to that city; 
 lying on the Tigris it had access to the sea. The Ph&oelig;nicians
 carried its wares everywhere. Hence its merchandise is so much spoken 
 of.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away</B>--that is, spoiled
 <I>thy merchants.</I> The "cankerworm," or licking locust, answers to the
 Medo-Babylonian invaders of Nineveh [G. V. S<FONT SIZE=-1>MITH</FONT>].
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT> explains less
 probably, "Thy merchants spoiled many regions; but the same shall befall
 them as befalls locusts, they in a moment shall be scattered and flee
 away." M<FONT SIZE=-1>AURER</FONT>, somewhat similarly, "The licking locust
 puts off (the envelope in which his wings had been folded),
 and teeth away" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+2:9">Na 2:9</A>;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:4">Joe 1:4</A>).

 The king's nobles and officers wore the tiara, as well as the king;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:27">Jer 51:27</A>,

 meaning <I>satraps</I> [M<FONT SIZE=-1>ICHAELIS</FONT>]; or rather, 
 "military leaders" [M<FONT SIZE=-1>AURER</FONT>]. The last syllable, 
 <I>sar</I> means a "prince," and is found in <I>Belshaz-zar, 
 Nabopolas-sar, Nebuchadnez-zar.</I>

 <B>as the great grasshoppers</B>--literally, "as the locust of locusts," that
 is, the largest locust. M<FONT SIZE=-1>AURER</FONT> translates, "as many as
 <I>locusts upon locusts,</I>" that is, swarms of locusts. <I>Hebrew</I> idiom
 favors <I>English Version.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>in the hedges in the cold</B>--Cold deprives the locust of the power of
 flight; so they alight in cold weather and at night, but when warmed by
 the sun soon "flee away." So shall the Assyrian multitudes suddenly
 disappear, not leaving a trace behind (compare P<FONT SIZE=-1>LINY</FONT>,
 <I>Natural History,</I> 11.29).</P>

 <B>upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?</B>--implying God's
 long forbearance, and the consequent enormity of Assyria's guilt,
 rendering her case one that admitted no hope of restoration.</P>
