 The name Ezekiel means "(whom) God will strengthen"
 [G<FONT SIZE=-1>ESENIUS</FONT>]; or,
 "God will prevail" [R<FONT SIZE=-1>OSENMULLER</FONT>]. His father was Buzi 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:3">Eze 1:3</A>),

 a priest, and he probably exercised the priestly office himself at 
 Jerusalem, previous to his captivity, as appears from the matured 
 priestly character to be seen in his prophecies, a circumstance which 
 much increased his influence with his captive fellow countrymen at 
 Babylon. Tradition represents Sarera as the land of his nativity. His 
 call to prophesy was in the fifth year from the date of his being 
 carried away with Jehoiachin (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:11-15">2Ki 24:11-15</A>)

 by Nebuchadnezzar, 599 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT> The best portions of 
 the people seem to have been among the first carried away

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:16,Jer+24:2-7,8,10">Eze 11:16;
 Jer 24:2-7, 8, 10</A>). 

 The ungodly were willing to do anything to remain in their native land;
 whereas the godly believed the prophets and obeyed the first summons to 
 surrender, as the only path of safety. These latter, as adhering to the 
 theocratic principle, were among the earliest to be removed by the 
 Chaldeans, who believed that, if they were out of the way, the nation 
 would fall to pieces of itself. They were despised by their brethren in 
 the Holy Land not yet captives, as having no share in the temple 
 sacrifices. Thus Ezekiel's sphere of labor was one happier and less 
 impeded by his countrymen than that of Jeremiah at home. The vicinity 
 of the river Chebar, which flows into the Euphrates near Circeslum, was 
 the first scene of his prophecies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:1">Eze 1:1</A>).

 Tel-Abib there (now Thallaba) was his place of residence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:15">Eze 3:15</A>),

 whither the elders used to come to inquire as to God's messages through 
 him. They were eager to return to Jerusalem, but he taught them that 
 they must first return to their God. He continued to prophesy for at 
 least twenty-two years, that is, to the twenty-seventh year of the 
 captivity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:17">Eze 29:17</A>),

 and probably remained with the captives by the Chebar the rest of his 
 life. A treatise, falsely attributed to E<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>PIPHANIUS</FONT>, states a tradition that he was killed at 
 Babylon by a prince of his people whom he had reproved for 
 idolatry.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He was contemporary with Jeremiah and Daniel. The former had
 prophesied for thirty-four years before Ezekiel, and continued to do so
 for six or seven years after him. The call of Ezekiel followed the very
 next year after the communication of Jeremiah's predictions to Babylon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:59">Jer 51:59</A>),

 and was divinely intended as a sequel to them. Daniel's predictions are 
 mostly later than Ezekiel's but his piety and wisdom had become 
 proverbial in the early part of Ezekiel's ministry

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:14,16,28:3">Eze 14:14, 16; 28:3</A>).

 They much resemble one another, especially in the visions and grotesque
 images. It is a remarkable proof of genuineness that in Ezekiel no 
 prophecies against Babylon occur among those directed against the 
 enemies of the covenant-people. Probably he desired not to give 
 needless offence to the government under which he lived. The effect of 
 his labors is to be seen in the improved character of the people 
 towards the close of the captivity, and their general cessation from 
 idolatry and a return to the law. It was little more than thirty years 
 after the close of his labors when the decree of the Jews' restoration 
 was issued. His leading characteristic is realizing, determined energy; 
 this admirably adapted him for opposing the "rebellious house" "of 
 stubborn front and hard heart," and for maintaining the cause of God's 
 Church among his countrymen in a foreign land, when the external 
 framework had fallen to pieces. His style is plain and simple. His 
 conceptions are definite, and the details even of the symbolical and 
 enigmatical parts are given with lifelike minuteness. The obscurity 
 lies in the substance, not in the form, of his communications. The 
 priestly element predominates in his prophecies, arising from his 
 previous training as a priest. He delights to linger about the temple 
 and to find in its symbolical forms the imagery for conveying his 
 instructions. This was divinely ordered to satisfy the spiritual want 
 felt by the people in the absence of the outward temple and its 
 sacrifices. In his images he is magnificent, though austere and 
 somewhat harsh. He abounds in repetitions, not for ornament, but for 
 force and weight. Poetical parallelism is not found except in a few 
 portions, as in the seventh, twenty-first, twenty-seventh, 
 twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth through thirty-first chapters. His great 
 aim was to stimulate the dormant minds of the Jews.  For this end 
 nothing was better suited than the use of mysterious symbols expressed 
 in the plainest words. The superficial, volatile, and wilfully 
 unbelieving would thereby be left to judicial blindness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:10,Mt+13:11-13">Isa 6:10;
 Mt 13:11-13</A>, 

 &c.); whereas the better-disposed would be awakened to a deeper search
 into the things of God by the very obscurity of the symbols. 
 Inattention to this divine purpose has led the modern Jews so to 
 magnify this obscurity as to ordain that no one shall read this book 
 till he has passed his thirtieth year.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 R<FONT SIZE=-1>ABBI</FONT> H<FONT SIZE=-1>ANANIAS</FONT> is said to 
 have satisfactorily solved the difficulties (<I>Mischna</I>) which were 
 alleged against its canonicity.  
 
 <U>Ecclesiasticus 49:8</U> 

 refers to it, and J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT> [<I>Antiquities,</I> 
 10.5.1].  It is mentioned as part of the canon in 
 M<FONT SIZE=-1>ELITO'S</FONT> catalogue [E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>,
 <I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 4.26]; also in
 O<FONT SIZE=-1>RIGEN</FONT>, J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT>, and the
 <I>Talmud.</I> The oneness of tone throughout and the repetition of
 favorite expressions exclude the suspicion that separate portions are 
 not genuine. The earlier portion, the first through the thirty-second 
 chapters, which mainly treats of sin and judgment, is a key to 
 interpret the latter portion, which is more hopeful and joyous, but 
 remote in date. Thus a unity and an orderly progressive character are 
 imparted to the whole. The destruction of Jerusalem is the central 
 point. Previous to this he calls to repentance and warns against blind 
 confidence in Egypt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:15-17">Eze 17:15-17</A>;
 
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+37:7">Jer 37:7</A>)

 or other human stay.  After it he consoles the captives by promising 
 them future deliverance and restoration. His prophecies against foreign 
 nations stand between these two great divisions, and were uttered in 
 the interval between the intimation that Nebuchadnezzar was besieging 
 Jerusalem and the arrival of the news that he had taken it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:21">Eze 33:21</A>).

 H<FONT SIZE=-1>AVERNICK</FONT> marks out nine sections:--(1) Ezekiel's 
 call to prophesy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:1-3:15">Eze 1:1-3:15</A>).

 (2) Symbolical predictions of the destruction of Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:16-7:27">Eze 3:16-7:27</A>).

 (3) A year and two months later a vision of the temple polluted by 
 Tammuz or Adonis worship; God's consequent scattering of fire over the 
 city and forsaking of the temple to reveal Himself to an inquiring 
 people in exile; happier and purer times to follow

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:1-11:25">Eze 8:1-11:25</A>).

 (4) Exposure of the particular sins prevalent in the several 
 classes--priests, prophets, and princes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:1-19:14">Eze 12:1-19:14</A>).
 
 (5) A year later the warning of judgment for national guilt repeated
 with greater distinctness as the time drew nearer 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:1-23:49">Eze 20:1-23:49</A>).
 
 (6) Two years and five months later--the very day on which Ezekiel
 speaks--is announced as the day of the beginning of the siege; Jerusalem
 shall be overthrown 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:1-27">Eze 24:1-27</A>).

 (7) Predictions against foreign nations during the interval of his 
 silence towards his own people; if judgment begins at the house of God, 
 much more will it visit the ungodly world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+25:1-32:32">Eze 25:1-32:32</A>).

 Some of these were uttered much later than others, but they all 
 <I>began</I> to be given after the fall of Jerusalem.  (8) In the 
 twelfth year of the captivity, when the fugitives from Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:21">Eze 33:21</A>)

 had appeared in Chaldea, he foretells better times and the 
 re-establishment of Israel and the triumph of God's kingdom on earth 
 over its enemies, Seir, the heathen, and Gog

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:1-39:29">Eze 33:1-39:29</A>).

 (9) After an interval of thirteen years the closing vision of the order 
 and beauty of the restored kingdom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:1-48:35">Eze 40:1-48:35</A>).

 The particularity of details as to the temple and its offerings rather 
 discountenances the view of this vision being only symbolical, and not 
 at all literal. The event alone can clear it up. At all events it has 
 not yet been fulfilled; it must be future. Ezekiel was the only 
 <I>prophet</I> (in the strict sense) among the Jews at Babylon. Daniel 
 was rather a <I>seer</I> than a prophet, for the spirit of prophecy was 
 given him to qualify him, not for a spiritual office, but for 
 disclosing future events. His position in a heathen king's palace 
 fitted him for revelations of the <I>outward</I> relations of God's 
 kingdom to the kingdoms of the world, so that his book is ranked by the 
 Jews among the Hagiographa or "Sacred Writings," not among the 
 prophetical Scriptures. On the other hand, Ezekiel was distinctively a 
 <I>prophet,</I> and one who had to do with the <I>inward</I> concerns 
 of the divine kingdom. As a priest, when sent into exile, his service 
 was but transferred from the visible temple at Jerusalem to the 
 spiritual temple in Chaldea.</P>

 <B>1. Now it came to pass</B>--rather, "<I>And</I> it came," &c. As
 this formula in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:1">Jos 1:1</A>

 has reference to the <I>written</I> history of previous times, so here
 (and in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:1,Es+1:1">Ru 1:1,
 and Es 1:1</A>),

 it refers to the
 <I>unwritten</I> history which was before the mind of the writer. The
 prophet by it, as it were, continues the history of the preceding times.
 In the fourth year of Zedekiah's reign 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:59">Jer 51:59</A>),

 Jeremiah sent by Seraiah a message to the captives

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:1-32">Jer 29:1-32</A>)

 to submit themselves to God and lay aside their flattering hopes of a 
 speedy restoration. This communication was in the next year, the fifth, 
 and the fourth month of the same king (for Jehoiachin's captivity and 
 Zedekiah's accession coincide in time), <I>followed up</I> by a prophet 
 raised up among the captives themselves, the energetic Ezekiel.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>thirtieth year</B>--that is, counting from the beginning of the 
 reign of Nabopolassar, father of Nebuchadnezzar, the era of the 
 Babylonian empire, 625 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, which epoch coincides 
 with the eighteenth year of Josiah, that in which the book of the law 
 was found, and the consequent reformation began [S<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>CALIGER</FONT>]; or the thirtieth year of Ezekiel's life.  As 
 the Lord was about to be a "little sanctuary"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:16">Eze 11:16</A>)

 to the exiles on the Chebar, so Ezekiel was to be the ministering 
 priest; therefore he marks his priestly relation to God and the people 
 at the outset; the close, which describes the future temple, thus 
 answering to the beginning. By designating himself expressly as "the 
 priest"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:3">Eze 1:3</A>),

 and as having reached his thirtieth year (the regular year of priests 
 commencing their office), he marks his office as the priest among the 
 prophets. Thus the opening vision follows naturally as the formal 
 institution of that spiritual temple in which he was to minister 
 [F<FONT SIZE=-1>AIRBAIRN</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Chebar</B>--the same as Chabor or Habor, whither the ten tribes had been
 transported by Tiglath-pileser and Shalmaneser 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:6,1Ch+5:26">2Ki 17:6;
 1Ch 5:26</A>). 

 It flows into the Euphrates near Carchemish or Circesium, two hundred
 miles north of Babylon.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>visions of God</B>--Four expressions are used as to the revelation granted
 to Ezekiel, the three first having respect to what was presented from
 without, to assure him of its <I>reality,</I> the fourth to his being
 internally made fit to receive the revelation; "the heavens were opened"
 (so

 Babylon took place, and among them was Daniel. The <I>second</I> was under

 Rome

 The Fathers identified them with the four Gospels: Matthew the lion, 
 Mark the ox, Luke the man, John the eagle.  Two cherubim only stood 
 over the ark in the temple; two more are now added, to imply that, 
 while the law is retained as the basis, a new form is needed to be 
 added to impart new life to it. The number four may have respect to the 
 four quarters of the world, to imply that God's angels execute His 
 commands everywhere. Each head in front had the face of a man as the 
 primary and prominent one: on the right the face of a lion, on the left 
 the face of an ox, above from behind the face of an eagle.  The Mosaic 
 cherubim were similar, only that the human faces were put looking

 two wings are added to cover their countenances; because there they 
 stand by the throne, here under the throne; there God deigns to consult 
 them, and His condescension calls forth their humility, so that they 
 veil their faces before Him; here they execute His commands.  The face 
 expresses their intelligence; the wings, their rapidity in fulfilling 
 God's will. The Shekinah or flame, that signified God's presence, and 
 the written name, J<FONT SIZE=-1>EHOVAH</FONT>, occupied the 
 intervening space between the cherubim

 ("placed"; properly, "to place in <I>a tabernacle</I>"), imply that the
 cherubim were appointed at the fall as symbols of God's presence in a 
 consecrated place, and that man was to worship there. In the 
 patriarchal dispensation when the flood had caused the removal of the 
 cherubim from Eden, <I>seraphim</I> or <I>teraphim</I> (<I>Chaldean</I> 
 dialect) were made as models of them for domestic use

 The silence of the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth chapters of Exodus to 
 their configuration, whereas everything else is minutely described, is 
 because their form was so well-known already to Bezaleel and all Israel 
 by tradition as to need no detailed description. Hence Ezekiel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:20">Eze 10:20</A>)

 at once knows them, for he had seen them repeatedly in the carved work 
 of the outer sanctuary of Solomon's temple

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:23-29">1Ki 6:23-29</A>).

 He therefore consoles the exiles with the hope of having the same 
 cherubim in the renovated temple which should be reared; and he assures 
 them that the same God who dwelt between the cherubim of the temple 
 would be still with His people by the Chebar.  But they were not in 
 Zerubbabel's temple; therefore Ezekiel's foretold temple, if literal, 
 is yet future. The ox is selected as chief of the tame animals, the 
 lion among the wild, the eagle among birds, and man the head of all, in 
 his ideal, realized by the Lord Jesus, combining all the excellencies 
 of the animal kingdom. The cherubim probably represent the ruling 
 powers by which God acts in the natural and moral world. Hence they 
 sometimes answer to the ministering angels; elsewhere, to the redeemed 
 saints (the elect Church) through whom, as by the angels, God shall 
 hereafter rule the world and proclaim the manifold wisdom of God

 The "lions" and "oxen," amidst "palms" and "open flowers" carved in the
 temple, were the four-faced cherubim which, being traced on a flat 
 surface, presented only one aspect of the four. The human-headed winged 
 bulls and eagle-headed gods found in Nineveh, sculptured amidst palms 
 and tulip-shaped flowers, were borrowed by corrupted tradition from the 
 cherubim placed in Eden near its fruits and flowers. So the Aaronic 
 calf

 and Jeroboam's calves at Dan and Beth-el, a schismatic imitation of the 
 sacred symbols in the temple at Jerusalem.  So the ox figures of Apis

 looking to each of the four quarters of heaven. They made no mistakes;

 similar, then existing in Chaldea, and found in the remains of Assyria.
 The latter, though derived from the original revelation by tradition,
 came by corruption to symbolize the astronomical zodiac, or the sun and

 therefore we read here merely of its sore pressure, not of its result. 
 The sum of three hundred ninety and forty years is four hundred thirty, 
 a period famous in the history of the covenant-people, being that of 
 their sojourn in Egypt

 God threatened to bring them back to Egypt, which must mean, not Egypt
 literally, but a bondage as bad as that one in Egypt. So now God will 
 reduce them to a kind of new Egyptian bondage to the world: Israel, the

 wilderness; that is, by ceasing from idolatry and seeking in their 
 sifting and sore troubles, through God's covenant, a restoration to 
 righteousness and peace [F<FONT SIZE=-1>AIRBAIRN</FONT>]. The three

 No center in the ancient heathen world could have been selected more 
 fitted than Canaan to be a vantage ground, whence the people of God 
 might have acted with success upon the heathenism of the world. It lay 
 midway between the oldest and most civilized states, Egypt and Ethiopia 
 on one side, and Babylon, Nineveh, and India on the other, and 
 afterwards Persia, Greece, and Rome. The Ph&oelig;nician mariners were
 close by, through whom they might have transmitted the true religion to 
 the remotest lands; and all around the Ishmaelites, the great 
 <I>inland</I> traders in South Asia and North Africa. Israel was thus 
 placed, not for its own selfish good, but to be the spiritual 
 benefactor of the whole world. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:1-7">Ps 67:1-7</A>

 throughout. Failing in this, and falling into idolatry, its guilt was 
 far worse than that of the heathen; not that Israel <I>literally</I> 
 went beyond the heathen in abominable idolatries. But "<I>corruptio 
 optimi pessima</I>"; the perversion of that which in itself is the best 
 is worse than the perversion of that which is less perfect: is in fact 
 the worst of all kinds of perversion. Therefore their punishment was 
 the severest. So the position of the Christian professing Church now, 
 if it be not a light to the heathen world, its condemnation will be 
 sorer than theirs

 by the Chaldean conquest. There was to be a germinating evil in their

 foretold; namely, that a third part of the nation should die by 
 pestilence, a third part by the sword, and a third be scattered unto

 all quarters and not carried to Babylonia alone, as the objectors 
 assert (compare

 same name as the river flowing from Lebanon; killed by a wild boar, 
 and, according to the fable, permitted to spend half the year on earth, 
 and obliged to spend the other half in the lower world. An annual feast 
 was celebrated to him in June (hence called Tammuz in the Jewish 
 calendar) at Byblos, when the Syrian women, in wild grief, tore off 
 their hair and yielded their persons to prostitution, consecrating the 
 hire of their infamy to Venus; next followed days of rejoicing for his 
 return to the earth; the former feast being called "the disappearance 
 of Adonis," the latter, "the finding of Adonis." This Ph&oelig;nician 
 feast answered to the similar Egyptian one in honor of Osiris. The idea 
 thus fabled was that of the waters of the river and the beauties of 
 spring destroyed by the summer heat. Or else, the earth being clothed 
 with beauty, during the half year when the sun is in the upper 
 hemisphere, and losing it when he departs to the lower. The name 
 <I>Adonis</I> is not here used, as <I>Adon</I> is the appropriated

 officers of vengeance; "linen" characterized the high priest

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:4">Le 16:4</A>);

 Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:6">Heb 1:6</A>).

 He appears as a "man," implying His incarnation; as "one" (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:5">1Ti 2:5</A>).
 
 Salvation is peculiarly assigned to Him, and so He bears the "inkhorn"
 in order to "mark" His elect 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+9:4">Eze 9:4</A>;

 As Oriental scribes suspend their inkhorn at their side in the present 
 day, and as a "scribe of the host is found in Assyrian inscriptions 
 accompanying the host" to number the heads of the slain, so He stands 
 ready for the work before Him. "The higher gate" was probably where now 
 the gate of Damascus is. The six with Him make up the sacred and 
 perfect number, <I>seven</I>

 The executors of judgment on the wicked, in Scripture teaching, are

 so
 beautifully does the Old Testament harmonize with the New Testament. The
 seven come "from the way of the north"; for it was there the idolatries
 were seen, and from the same quarter must proceed the judgment (Babylon
 lying northeast of Judea). So

 referring to the badge and only means of salvation, the cross of 
 Christ. But nowhere in Scripture are the words which are now employed 
 as names of letters used to denote the letters themselves or their 
 figures [V<FONT SIZE=-1>ITRINGA</FONT>].  The noun here is cognate to 
 the verb, "<I>mark a mark.</I>" So in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:3">Re 7:3</A>

 no particular mark is specified. We <I>seal</I> what we wish to guard 
 securely. When all things else on earth are confounded, God will secure 
 His people from the common ruin. God gives the <I>first</I> charge as 
 to their safety before He orders the punishment of the rest

 So in the case of Lot and Sodom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:22">Ge 19:22</A>);

 also the Egyptian first-born were not slain till Israel had time to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:3,Am+9:9">Re 7:3;

 So the early Christians had Pella provided as a refuge for them,
 before the destruction of Jerusalem.

 <B>upon the foreheads</B>--the most conspicuous part of the person, to imply
 how their safety would be manifested to all (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:11,39:11-18">Jer 15:11; 39:11-18</A>).
 
 It was customary thus to mark worshippers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:16,14:1,9">Re 13:16; 14:1, 9</A>)

 and servants. So the Church of England marks the forehead with the sign
 of the cross in baptizing. At the exodus the mark was on the 
 <I>houses,</I> for then it was families; here, it is on the 
 <I>foreheads,</I> for it is individuals whose safety is guaranteed.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>sigh and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. cry</B>--similarly sounding verbs in <I>Hebrew,</I> as in
 <I>English Version,</I> expressing the prolonged sound of their grief.
 "Sigh" implies their <I>inward grief</I> ("groanings which cannot be
 uttered,"

 "cry," the outward expression of it. So Lot

 It may be objected that Daniel, Jeremiah, and others were carried away, 
 whereas many of the vilest were left in the land. But God does not 
 promise believers exemption from all suffering, but only from what will 
 prove really and lastingly hurtful to them. His sparing the ungodly 
 turns to their destruction and leaves them without excuse [C<FONT

 fulfilment, for

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:3-8">Re 7:3-8</A>,

 in ages long after Babylon, foretells, as still future, the same 
 sealing of a remnant (one hundred forty-four thousand) of Israel 
 previous to the final outpouring of wrath on the rest of the nation; 
 the correspondence is exact; the same pouring of fire from the altar 
 follows the marking of the remnant in both (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+8:5,Eze+10:2">Re 8:5,

 <B>1.</B> The throne of Jehovah appearing in the midst of the judgments
 implies that whatever intermediate agencies be employed, He controls
 them, and that the whole flows as a necessary consequence from His
 essential holiness 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:22,26">Eze 1:22, 26</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>cherubim</B>--in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:5">Eze 1:5</A>,

 called "living creatures." The repetition of the vision implies that 
 the judgments are approaching nearer and nearer. These two visions of 
 Deity were granted in the beginning of Ezekiel's career, to qualify him 
 for witnessing to God's glory amidst his God-forgetting people and to 
 stamp truth on his announcements; also to signify the removal of God's 
 manifestation from the visible temple

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:18">Eze 10:18</A>)
 
 for a long period 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:2">Eze 43:2</A>).
 
 The feature

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:12">Eze 10:12</A>)

 mentioned as to the cherubim that they were "full of eyes," though 
 omitted in the former vision, is not a difference, but a more specific 
 detail observed by Ezekiel now on closer inspection.  Also, here, there 
 is no rainbow (the symbol of <I>mercy</I> after the flood of wrath) as 
 in the former; for here <I>judgment</I> is the prominent thought, 
 though the <I>marking</I> of the remnant in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+9:4,6">Eze 9:4, 6</A>

 shows that there was mercy in the background. The cherubim, perhaps, 
 represent redeemed humanity combining in and with itself the highest 
 forms of subordinate creaturely life (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:20">Ro 8:20</A>).

 Therefore they are associated with the twenty-four elders and are 
 distinguished from the angels

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:1-14">Re 5:1-14</A>).

 They stand on the mercy seat of the ark, and <I>on that ground</I> 
 become the habitation of God from which His glory is to shine upon the 
 world. The different forms symbolize the different phases of the 
 Church. So the quadriform Gospel, in which the incarnate Saviour has 
 lodged the revelation of Himself in a fourfold aspect, and from which 
 His glory shines on the Christian world, answers to the emblematic 
 throne from which He shone on the Jewish Church.</P>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:15,16">Eze 1:15, 16</A>
 
 implies mere revolution.

 <B>coals of fire</B>--the wrath of God about to <I>burn the city,</I> as His
 sword had previously <I>slain</I> its guilty inhabitants. This "fire," how
 different from <I>the fire on the altar never going out</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:12,13">Le 6:12, 13</A>),

 It is therefore not taken from the altar of reconciliation, but from 
 between the wheels of the cherubim, representing the providence of God, 
 whereby, and not by chance, judgment is to fall.</P>

 also the glory of the Lord had left its place in the holy of holies,

 Ezekiel, seeing the priesthood doomed to destruction, as a priest, felt
 anxious to vindicate their cause, as if they were his nearest kinsmen
 and he their Goel. But he is told to look for his true kinsmen in those,
 his fellow exiles, whom his natural kinsmen at Jerusalem despised, and
 he is to be their vindicator. Spiritual ties, as in the case of Levi

 days was to rise from the despised exiles. The gospel principle is 
 shadowed forth here, that the despised of men are often the chosen of 
 God and the highly esteemed among men are often an abomination before 
 Him

 The trying discipline of the exile was to chasten the outcasts so as to
 be meet recipients of God's grace, for which the carnal confidence of 
 the priests disqualified them. The dispersion served the end of 
 spiritualizing and enlarging the views even of the better Jews, so as 
 to be able to worship God <I>everywhere</I> without a material temple; 
 and, at the same time, it diffused some knowledge of God among the 
 greatest Gentile nations, thus providing materials for the gathering in 
 of the Christian Church among the Gentiles; so marvellously did God 
 overrule a present evil for an ultimate good. Still more does all this 
 hold good in the present much longer dispersion which is preparing for 
 a more perfect and universal restoration

 Ezekiel needed often to be reminded of the people's perversity, lest he
 should be discouraged by the little effect produced by his prophecies. 
 Their "not seeing" is the result of perversity, not incapacity. They 
 are wilfully blind. The persons most interested in this prophecy were 
 those dwelling at Jerusalem; and it is among them that Ezekiel was 
 transported in spirit, and performed in vision, not outwardly, the 
 typical acts. At the same time, the symbolical prophecy was designed to 
 warn the exiles at Chebar against cherishing hopes, as many did in 
 opposition to God's revealed word, of returning to Jerusalem, as if 
 that city was to stand; externally living afar off, their hearts dwelt 
 in that corrupt and doomed capital.</P>

 <B>1.</B> As the twelfth chapter denounced the false expectations of the
 people, so this denounces the false leaders who fed those expectations.
 As an independent witness, Ezekiel confirms at the Chebar the testimony
 of Jeremiah 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:21,31">Jer 29:21, 31</A>)

 in his letter from Jerusalem to the captive exiles, against the false 
 prophets; of these some were conscious knaves, others fanatical dupes 
 of their own frauds; for example, Ahab, Zedekiah, and Shemaiah. 
 Hananiah must have believed his own lie, else he would not have 
 specified so <I>circumstantial</I> details

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+28:2-4">Jer 28:2-4</A>).

 The language of Ezekiel has plain references to the similar language of
 Jeremiah (for example,

 the bane of false prophecy, which had its stronghold in Jerusalem, 
 having in some degree extended to the Chebar; this chapter, therefore, 
 is primarily intended as a message to those still in the Jewish

 Chebar.</P>

 that is, what they prophesied was what they and the people 
 <I>wished;</I> the wish was father to the thought. The people 
 <I>wished</I> to be deceived, and so were deceived. They were 
 inexcusable, for they had among them true prophets (who spoke not 
 <I>their own</I> thoughts, but as they were moved by the Holy Ghost,

 <B>their own spirit</B>--instead of the Spirit of God. A threefold
 distinction lay between the false and the true prophets: (1) The source
 of their messages respectively; of the false, "their own hearts"; of the
 true, an object presented to the spiritual sense (named from the noblest
 of the senses, a <I>seeing</I>) by the Spirit of God as from without, not
 produced by their own natural powers of reflection. The word, the body
 of the thought, presented itself not audibly to the natural sense, but
 directly to the spirit of the prophet; and so the perception of it is
 properly called a <I>seeing,</I> he perceiving that which thereafter forms
 itself in his soul as the cover of the external word
 [D<FONT SIZE=-1>ELITZSCH</FONT>]; hence
 the peculiar expression, "seeing the word of God"

 Mic 1:1</A>). 

 (2) The point aimed at; the false "walking after their own spirit"; the
 true, after the Spirit of God. (3) The result; the false saw nothing, 
 but spake as if they had seen; the true had a vision, not subjective, 
 but objectively real [F<FONT SIZE=-1>AIRBAIRN</FONT>]. A refutation of 
 those who set the <I>inward</I> word above the <I>objective,</I> and 
 represent the Bible as flowing subjectively from the inner light of its 
 writers, not from the revelation of the Holy Ghost from without. "They

 expressed by "repent," and is then divided into: (1) "Turn 
 <I>yourselves</I> (inwardly) from your idols"; (2) "Turn away your

 their sin with a corresponding sin; as they rejected the safe 
 directions of the true light, He would send the pernicious delusions of 
 a false one; prophets would be given them who should re-echo the 
 deceitfulness that already wrought in their own bosom, to their ruin

 events recorded in

 had transpired. The Jews would naturally, in their fallen condition, 
 pride themselves on one who reflected such glory on his nation at the 
 heathen capital, and would build vain hopes (here set aside) on his 
 influence in averting ruin from them. Thus the objection to the 
 authenticity of Daniel from this passage vanishes. "Job" forms the 
 climax (and is therefore put out of chronological order), having not 
 even been left a son or a daughter, and having had himself to pass 
 through an ordeal of suffering before his final deliverance, and 
 therefore forming the most simple instance of the righteousness of God, 
 which would save the righteous themselves alone in the nation, and that 
 after an ordeal of suffering, but not spare even a son or daughter for 
 their sake

 God's covenant with Israel, in the person of Abraham, was the reason 
 why, notwithstanding all her guilt, mercy was, and is, in store for 
 her.  Therefore the heathen or Gentile nations must come to her for

 more than common acumen and serious thought. The <I>Hebrew</I> is derived
 from a root, "sharp," that is, calculated to stimulate attention and
 whet the intellect. Distinct from "fable," in that it teaches not
 fiction, but fact. Not like the ordinary riddle, designed to puzzle, but
 to instruct. The "riddle" is here identical with the "parable," only
 that the former refers to the obscurity, the latter to the likeness of

 His "wings" are his great forces. Such symbols were familiar to the
 Jews, who saw them portrayed on the great buildings of Babylon; such as 
 are now seen in the Assyrian remains.

 mountains, not cities. The temple at Jerusalem was called "Lebanon" by
 the Jews [E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>],

 Lebanon. "The mountain of the Lord's house"

 kingdom of Judah was to be prosperous, but not elevated.

 <B>branches turned toward him</B>--expressing the fealty of Zedekiah as a

 very existence as a separate state. The "branches" mean his sons and the
 other princes and nobles.

 The repetition "branches" and "springs" is in order to mark the

 Vindication of God's moral government as to His retributive
 righteousness from the Jewish imputation of injustice, as if they were
 suffering, not for their own sin, but for that of their fathers. As in
 the seventeenth chapter he foretold Messiah's happy reign in Jerusalem,
 so now he warns them that its blessings can be theirs only upon their
 individually turning to righteousness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. fathers .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. eaten sour grapes, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. children's teeth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. set
 on edge</B>--Their unbelieving calumnies on God's justice had become so
 common as to have assumed a proverbial form. The sin of Adam in eating
 the forbidden fruit, visited on his posterity, seems to have suggested
 the peculiar form; noticed also by Jeremiah 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:29">Jer 31:29</A>);

 and explained in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:7">La 5:7</A>,

 "Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their 
 iniquities." They mean by "the children" <I>themselves,</I> as though
 they were innocent, whereas they were far from being so. The partial 
 reformation effected since Manasseh's wicked reign, especially among 
 the exiles at Chebar, was their ground for thinking so; but the 
 improvement was only superficial and only fostered their self-righteous 
 spirit, which sought anywhere but in themselves the cause of their 
 calamities; just as the modern Jews attribute their present dispersion, 
 not to their own sins, but to those of their forefathers. It is a 
 universal mark of corrupt nature to lay the blame, which belongs to 
 ourselves, on others and to arraign the justice of God. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:12">Ge 3:12</A>,

 where Adam transfers the blame of his sin to Eve, and even to God, "The 
 <I>woman</I> whom <I>thou</I> gavest to be with me, she gave me of the 
 tree, and I did eat."</P>

 <A NAME="Eze18_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb</B>--because I
 will let it be seen by the whole world in the very fact that you are not
 righteous, as ye fancy yourselves, but wicked, and that you suffer only
 the just penalty of your guilt; while the elect righteous remnant alone
 escapes.</P>

 <A NAME="Eze18_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4. all souls are mine</B>--Therefore I can deal with all, being My own
 creation, as I please 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:6">Jer 18:6</A>).

 As the Creator of all alike I can have no reason, but the principle of 
 equity, according to men's works, to make any difference, so as to 
 punish some, and to save others

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:25">Ge 18:25</A>).

 "The soul that sinneth it shall die." The curse descending from father 
 to son assumes guilt shared in by the son; there is a natural tendency 
 in the child to follow the sin of his father, and so he shares in the 
 father's punishment: hence the principles of God's government, involved 
 in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:5,Jer+15:4">Ex 20:5
 and Jer 15:4</A>,

 are justified. The sons, therefore (as the Jews here), cannot complain
 of being unjustly afflicted by God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:7">La 5:7</A>);

 for they filled up the guilt of their fathers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:32,34-36">Mt 23:32, 34-36</A>).

 The same God who "recompenses the iniquity of the fathers into the 
 bosom of their children," is immediately after set forth as "giving to 
 every man according to his ways"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:18,19">Jer 32:18, 19</A>).

 In the same law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:5">Ex 20:5</A>)

 which "visited the iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the
 third and fourth generation" (where the explanation is added, "of them 
 that <I>hate me,</I>" that is, the <I>children hating God,</I> as well 
 as their fathers: the former being too likely to follow their parents, 
 sin going down with cumulative force from parent to child), we find

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:16">De 24:16</A>),

 "the fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither the 
 children for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own 
 sin." The inherited guilt of sin in infants

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:14">Ro 5:14</A>)

 is an awful <I>fact,</I> but one met by the atonement of Christ; but it 
 is of adults that he speaks here. Whatever penalties fall on 
 <I>communities</I> for connection with sins of their fathers, 
 <I>individual</I> adults who repent shall escape

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:25,26">2Ki 23:25, 26</A>).

 This was no new thing, as some misinterpret the passage here; it had 
 been <I>always</I> God's principle to punish only the guilty, and not 
 also the innocent, for the sins of their fathers. God does not here 
 change the principle of His administration, but is merely about to 
 <I>manifest it</I> so personally to each that the Jews should no longer
 throw on God and on their fathers the blame which was their own.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>soul that sinneth, it shall die</B>--and it <I>alone</I>

 the just man. The excellencies are selected in reference to the
 prevailing sins of the age, from which such a one stood aloof; hence 
 arises the omission of some features of righteousness, which, under 
 different circumstances, would have been desirable to be enumerated. 
 Each age has <I>its own</I> besetting temptations, and the just man 
 will be distinguished by his guarding against the peculiar defilements, 
 inward and outward, of his age.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>just .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. lawful .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. right</B>--the duties of the second table of the
 law, which flow from the fear of God. Piety is the root of all charity;
 to render to each his own, as well to our neighbor, as to God.</P>

 <A NAME="Eze18_6"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>6. not eaten upon .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. mountains</B>--the high places, 
 where altars were reared. A double sin: sacrificing elsewhere than at
 the temple, where only God sanctioned sacrifice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:13,14">De 12:13, 14</A>);

 and this to idols instead of to Jehovah. "Eaten" refers to the feasts
 which were connected with the sacrifices (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:6,De+32:38,Jdg+9:27,1Co+8:4,10,10:7">Ex 32:6;

 After duties of justice come those of benevolence. It is not enough to
 refrain from doing a wrong to our neighbor, we must also do him good. 
 The bread owned by a man, though "his," is given to him, not to keep to 
 himself, but to impart to the needy.</P>

 The letter of the law was restricted to the Jewish polity, and is not
 binding now; and indeed the principle of taking interest was even then 
 sanctioned, by its being allowed in the case of a foreigner. The 
 <I>spirit</I> of the law still binds us, that we are not to take 
 advantage of our neighbor's necessities to enrich ourselves, but be 
 satisfied with moderate, or even no, interest, in the case of the 
 needy.

 <B>19.</B> Here the Jews object to the prophet's word and in their objection
 seem to seek a continuance of that very thing which they had originally
 made a matter of complaint. Therefore translate, "Wherefore doth not the
 son bear the iniquity of his father?" It now would seem a consolation to
 them to think the son might suffer for his father's misdeeds; for it
 would soothe their self-love to regard themselves as innocent sufferers
 for the guilt of others and would justify them in their present course
 of life, which they did not choose to abandon for a better. In reply,
 Ezekiel reiterates the truth of each being dealt with according to his
 own merits [F<FONT SIZE=-1>AIRBAIRN</FONT>].
 But G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT> supports <I>English Version,</I> wherein
 the Jews contradict the prophet, "Why (sayest thou so) doth not the son
 (often, as in our case, though innocent) bear (that is, suffer for) the
 iniquity of their father?" Ezekiel replies, It is not as you say, but as
 I in the name of God say: "When the son hath done," &c.

 Hitherto the cases had been of a change from bad to good, or vice versa,
 in one generation compared with another. Here it is such a change in one
 and the same individual. This, as practically affecting the persons here
 addressed, is properly put last. So far from God laying on men the
 penalty of others' sins, He will not even punish them for their own, if
 they turn from sin to righteousness; but if they turn from righteousness
 to sin, they must expect in justice that their former goodness will not
 atone for subsequent sin

 them by a cognate term, <I>Bomoi</I>), whereas I call mine <I>Mizbeaach,</I> "altar." The very name implies the place is not that sanctioned by Me,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:26">Eze 20:26</A>,

 F<FONT SIZE=-1>AIRBAIRN</FONT> represents the generation here referred 
 to (namely, that of Ezekiel's day) as attaining the climax of guilt 
 (see on

 <A HREF="#Eze20_26">Eze 20:26</A>), 

 in making their children pass through the fire, which that former 
 generation did not. The reason, however, for the omission of "the fire" 
 in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:26">Eze 20:26</A>

 is, perhaps, that there it is implied the children only "<I>passed 
 through</I> the fire" for purification, whereas here they are actually 
 <I>burnt to death</I> before the idol; and therefore "the fire" is 
 specified in the latter, not in the former case (compare

 live on better terms with them by having a similar worship. Besides, we
 get from God nothing but threats and calamities, whereas the heathen,
 Chaldeans, &c., get riches and power from their idols." How literally
 God's words here ("that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall not be at all") are fulfilled in the
 modern Jews! Though the Jews seemed so likely (had Ezekiel spoken as an
 uninspired man) to have blended with the rest of mankind and laid aside
 their distinctive peculiarities, as was their wish at that time, yet
 they have remained for eighteen centuries dispersed among all nations
 and without a home, but still distinct: a standing witness for the truth
 of the prophecy given so long ago.</P>

 <A NAME="Eze20_33"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>33.</B> Here begins the second division of the prophecy. Lest the 
 covenant people should abandon their distinctive hopes and amalgamate 
 with the surrounding heathen, He tells them that, as the wilderness 
 journey from Egypt was made subservient to discipline and also to the 
 taking from among them the rebellious, so a severe discipline (such as 
 the Jews are now for long actually undergoing) should be administered 
 to them during the next exodus for the same purpose

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:38">Eze 20:38</A>),

 and so to prepare them for the restored possession of their land

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:14,15">Ho 2:14, 15</A>).

 This was only partially fulfilled before, and at the return from 
 Babylon: its full and final accomplishment is future.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>with a mighty hand, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. will I rule over you</B>--I will assert My right
 over you in spite of your resistance

 as a master would in the case of his slave, and I will not let you be

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:33">Eze 20:33</A>);

 therefore, He intimates, He will reassert His right over them by

 "I will bring you out." In contrast to the literal "wilderness of 
 Egypt"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:36">Eze 20:36</A>),

 "the wilderness of the peoples" is their <I>spiritual</I> wilderness 
 period of trial, discipline, and purification while exiled among the 
 nations. As the state when they are "brought into the wilderness of the 
 peoples" and that when they were among the peoples "from" which God was 
 to "bring them out"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:34">Eze 20:34</A>)

 are distinguished, the wilderness state probably answers partially to 
 the transition period of discipline from the first decree for their 
 restoration by Cyrus to the time of their complete settlement in their 
 land, and the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the temple. But the full and 
 final fulfilment is future; the wilderness state will comprise not only 
 the transition period of their restoration, but the beginning of their 
 occupancy of Palestine, a time in which they shall endure the sorest of 
 all their chastisements, to "purge out the rebels"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:38,Da+12:1">Eze 20:38;

 Rabbath of Ammon, east of Jordan; the other by the north, by Riblah in

 in which the Jews so much gloried. The energy and subordination of
 Ezekiel's whole life to his prophetic office is strikingly displayed in 
 this narrative of his wife's death. It is the only memorable event of 
 his personal history which he records, and this only in reference to 
 his soul-absorbing work. His natural tenderness is shown by that 
 graphic touch, "the desire of thine eyes." What amazing subjection, 
 then, of his individual feeling to his prophetic duty is manifested in 
 the simple statement

 given them for ornament, and as a badge of office. The high priest, as
 having on his head the holy anointing oil, was forbidden in <I>any</I> case
 to lay aside his headdress. But the priests might do so in the case of
 the death of the nearest relatives

 This purpose of revenge yielded to the extraordinary kindness of Jacob,
 through the blessing of Him with whom Jacob wrestled in prayer; but it 
 was revived as an hereditary grudge in the posterity of Esau when they 
 saw the younger branch rising to the pre-eminence which they thought of 
 right belonged to themselves. More recently, for David's subjugation of 
 Edom to Israel

 In the twenty-sixth chapter, Ezekiel sets forth:--(1) Tyre's sin; (2)
 its doom; (3) the instruments executing it; (4) the effects produced on
 other nations by her downfall. In the twenty-seventh chapter, a
 lamentation over the fall of such earthly splendor. In the twenty-eighth
 chapter, an elegy addressed to the king, on the humiliation of his
 sacrilegious pride. Ezekiel, in his prophecies as to the heathen,
 exhibits <I>the dark side only;</I> because he views them simply in their
 hostility to the people of God, who shall outlive them all. Isaiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:1-18">Isa 23:1-18</A>),

 literally, meaning "the rock-city," <I>Zor;</I> a name applying to the
 island Tyre, called New Tyre, rather than <I>Old Tyre</I> on the 
 <I>mainland.</I> They were half a mile apart. "New Tyre," a century and 
 a half before the fall of Jerusalem, had successfully resisted 
 Shalmaneser of Assyria, for five years besieging it (M<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ENANDER</FONT>, from the Tyrian archives, quoted by J<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>, <I>Antiquities,</I> 9.14. 2). It was the 
 stronger and more important of the two cities, and is the one chiefly, 
 though not exclusively, here meant. Tyre was originally a colony of
 Zidon. Nebuchadnezzar's siege of it lasted thirteen years

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:18,Isa+23:1-18">Eze 29:18;

 J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> states he read the fact in Assyrian 
 histories.

 <B>she .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that was the gates</B>--that is, the single gate composed of two
 folding doors. Hence the verb is <I>singular.</I> "Gates" were the place of
 resort for traffic and public business: so here it expresses
 <I>a mart of commerce</I> frequented by merchants. Tyre regards Jerusalem
 not as an open enemy, for her territory being the narrow, long strip of
 land north of Philistia, between Mount Lebanon and the sea, her interest
 was to cultivate friendly relations with the Jews, on whom she was
 dependent for corn

 Ac 12:20</A>). 

 But Jerusalem had intercepted some of the inland traffic which she
 wished to monopolize to herself; so, in her intensely selfish 
 worldly-mindedness, she exulted heartlessly over the fall of Jerusalem 
 as her own gain. Hence she incurred the wrath of God as pre-eminently 
 the world's representative in its ambition, selfishness, and pride, in 
 defiance of the will of God

 the rock on which they built their city, I will scrape so clean away as
 to leave no dust, but only the bare rock as it was. An awful contrast to

 When its lofty buildings and towers fall, surrounded as it was with the
 sea which entered its double harbor and washed its ramparts, the
 "stones .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. timbers .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and dust" appropriately
 are described as thrown down "in the midst of the water." Though
 Ezekiel attributes the capture of Tyre to Nebuchadnezzar (see on

 <A HREF="#Eze29_18">Eze 29:18</A>), 

 yet it does not follow that the <I>final</I> destruction of it
 described is attributed by him to the same monarch. The overthrow of 
 Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar was the first link in the long chain of 
 evil--the first deadly blow which prepared for, and was the earnest of, 
 the final doom. The change in this verse from the individual conqueror 
 "he," to the general "they," marks that what he did was not the whole, 
 but only paved the way for others to complete the work begun by him. It 
 was to be a progressive work until she was utterly destroyed. Thus the 
 words here answer exactly to what Alexander did. With the "stones, 
 timber," and rubbish of Old Tyre, he built a causeway in seven months

 The apodosis begins at

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:7">Eze 28:7</A>.

 "The prince of Tyrus" at the time was Ithobal, or Ithbaal II; the name 
 implying his close connection with Baal, the Ph&oelig;nician supreme
 god, whose representative he was.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>I am a god, I sit in .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. seat of God .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the 
 seas</B>--As God sits enthroned in His heavenly citadel exempt from all 
 injury, so I sit secure in my impregnable stronghold amidst the 
 stormiest elements, able to control them at will, and make them 
 subserve my interests. The language, though primarily here applied to
 the king of Tyre, as similar language is to the king of Babylon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:13,14">Isa 14:13, 14</A>),

 yet has an ulterior and fuller accomplishment in Satan and his
 embodiment in Antichrist

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:25,11:36,37,2Th+2:4,Re+13:6">Da 7:25; 11:36, 37;
 2Th 2:4; 
 Re 13:6</A>). 

 This feeling of superhuman elevation in the king of Tyre was fostered
 by the fact that the island on which Tyre stood was called "the holy 
 island" [S<FONT SIZE=-1>ANCONIATHON</FONT>], being sacred to Hercules, 
 so much so that the colonies looked up to Tyre as the mother city of 
 their religion, as well as of their political existence. The 
 <I>Hebrew</I> for "God" is <I>El,</I> that is, "the Mighty One."

 the wisdom of himself and the Tyrians, as though superior to that of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:8,9,36:35">Eze 31:8, 9; 36:35</A>).

 In the person of the king of Tyre a new trial was made of humanity with
 the greatest earthly advantages. But as in the case of Adam, the good 
 gifts of God were only turned into ministers to pride and self.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:12">Ge 2:12</A>),

 "gold, bdellium, and the onyx stone." So the king of Tyre was arrayed 
 in jewel-bespangled robes after the fashion of Oriental monarchs. The 
 nine precious stones here mentioned answer to nine of the twelve 
 (representing the twelve tribes) in the high priest's breastplate

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+39:10-13,Re+21:14,19-21">Ex 39:10-13;

 Of the four rows of three in each, the third is omitted in the
 <I>Hebrew,</I> but is supplied in the <I>Septuagint.</I> In this, too, 
 there is an ulterior reference to Antichrist, who is blasphemously to 
 arrogate the office of our divine High Priest

 for thee ("in thee," that is, "with and for thee"). Thou hadst not, 
 like others, to work thy way to the throne through arduous struggles.
 No sooner created than, like Adam, thou wast surrounded with the
 gratifications of Eden. F<FONT SIZE=-1>AIRBAIRN</FONT>, for "pipes,"
 translates, "females" (having reference to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:27">Ge 1:27</A>),

 that is, musician-women. M<FONT SIZE=-1>AURER</FONT> explains the

 [F<FONT SIZE=-1>AIRBAIRN</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>covereth</B>--The imagery employed by Ezekiel as a priest is from 
 the Jewish temple, wherein the cherubim overshadowed the mercy seat, as 
 the king of Tyre, a demi-god in his own esteem, extended his protection 
 over the interests of Tyre. The cherub--an ideal compound of the 
 highest kinds of animal existence and the type of redeemed man in his 
 ultimate state of perfection--is made the image of the king of Tyre, as
 if the beau ideal of humanity. The pretensions of Antichrist are the
 ulterior reference, of whom the king of Tyre is a type. Compare "As God
 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the <I>temple</I> of God"

 This is the last of the world kingdoms against which Ezekiel's
 prophecies are directed, and occupies the largest space in them, namely,
 the next four chapters. Though farther off than Tyre, it exercised a
 more powerful influence on Israel.</P>

 <A NAME="Eze29_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. Pharaoh</B>--a common name of all the kings of Egypt, meaning "the
 sun"; or, as others say, a "crocodile," which was worshipped in parts of
 Egypt (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:3">Eze 29:3</A>).

 Hophra or Apries was on the throne at this time. His reign began 
 prosperously. He took Gaza

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+47:1">Jer 47:1</A>)

 and Zidon and made himself master of Ph&oelig;nicia and Palestine,
 recovering much that was lost to Egypt by the victory of Nebuchadnezzar 
 at Carchemish

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:7,Jer+46:2">2Ki 24:7;
 Jer 46:2</A>), 

 in the fourth year of Jehoiakim [W<FONT SIZE=-1>ILKINSON</FONT>,
 <I>Ancient Egypt,</I> 1.169]. So proudly secure because of his 
 successes for twenty-five years did he feel, that he said not even a 
 god could deprive him of his kingdom [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ERODOTUS</FONT>, 
 2.169]. Hence the appropriateness of the description of him in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:3">Eze 29:3</A>.

 No mere human sagacity could have enabled Ezekiel to foresee Egypt's 
 downfall in the height of its prosperity. There are four divisions of 
 these prophecies; the first in the tenth year of Ezekiel's captivity; 
 the last in the twelfth. Between the first and second comes one of much 
 later date, not having been given till the twenty-seventh year

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:17,30:19">Eze 29:17; 30:19</A>),

 but placed there as appropriate to the subject matter. Pharaoh-hophra,
 or Apries, was dethroned and strangled, and Amasis substituted as king, 
 by Nebuchadnezzar (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+44:30">Jer 44:30</A>).

 The Egyptian priests, from national vanity, made no mention to H<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ERODOTUS</FONT> of the Egyptian loss of territory in Syria 
 through Nebuchadnezzar, of which J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT> tells 
 us, but attributed the change in the succession from Apries to Amasis 
 solely to the Egyptian soldiery. The civil war between the two rivals 
 no doubt lasted several years, affording an opportunity to 
 Nebuchadnezzar of interfering and of elevating the usurper Amasis, on 
 condition of his becoming tributary to Babylon [W<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ILKINSON</FONT>]. Compare

 Amasis was the "hook." In the Assyrian sculptures prisoners are 
 represented with a hook in the underlip, and a cord from it held by the 
 king.

 "I have made it"), wished to stand in the stead of God as defender of 
 the covenant-people, his motive being, not love to them, but rivalry 
 with Babylon. He raised the siege of Jerusalem, but it was only for a 
 time (compare

 ruin overtook not only them, but himself. As the fish that clung to
 the horny scales of the crocodile, the lord of the Nile, when he was 
 caught, shared his fate, so the adherents of Pharaoh, lord of Egypt, 
 when he was overthrown by Amasis, should share his fate.</P>

 Pharaoh led an army against Cyrene in Africa, in support of Aricranes,
 who had been stripped of his kingdom by the Cyrenians. The army
 perished and Egypt rebelled against him

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+30:6">Eze 30:6</A>,

 <I>Margin.</I> However, <I>English Version</I> rightly refers Syene to 
 Seveneh, that is, Sebennytus, in the eastern delta of the Nile, the 
 capital of the Lower Egyptian kings. The Sebennyte Pharaohs, with the 
 help of the Canaanites, who, as shepherds or merchants, ranged the 
 desert of Suez, extended their borders beyond the narrow province east 
 of the delta, to which they had been confined by the Pharaohs of Upper 
 Egypt. The defeated party, in derision, named the Sebennyte or Lower 
 Egyptians <I>foreigners</I> and <I>shepherd-kings</I> (a shepherd being 
 an abomination in Egypt,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+46:34">Ge 46:34</A>).

 They were really a <I>native</I> dynasty. Thus, in <I>English

 Sebennytus or Syene in the north.</P>

 J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> remarks the number <I>forty</I> is one
 often connected with affliction and judgment. The rains of the flood in 
 forty days brought destruction on the world. Moses, Elias, and the 
 Saviour fasted forty days. The interval between Egypt's overthrow by 
 Nebuchadnezzar and the deliverance by Cyrus, was about forty years. The 
 <I>ideal</I> forty years' wilderness state of social and political 
 degradation, rather than a <I>literal</I> non-passing of man or beast 
 for that term, is mainly intended (so

 was to be with Egypt [F<FONT SIZE=-1>AIRBAIRN</FONT>]. Some Egyptians

 similarly make the removal of the false shepherds the preliminary to
 the interposition of Messiah the Good Shepherd in behalf of His people 
 Israel. The "shepherds" are not prophets or priests, but <I>rulers</I> 
 who sought in their government their own selfish ends, not the good of 
 the people ruled. The term was appropriate, as David, the first king 
 and the type of the true David

 and the office, like that of a shepherd for his flock, is to guard and
 provide for his people. The choice of a <I>shepherd</I> for the first

 The distinction between Israel and the heathen (as Edom) is: Israel has
 a covenant relation to God ensuring restoration after chastisement, so
 that the heathen's hope of getting possession of the elect people's
 inheritance must fail, and they themselves be made desolate

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:1-15">Eze 36:1-15</A>).

 The reason for the chastisement of Israel was Israel's sin and 
 profanation of God's name

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:16-21">Eze 36:16-21</A>).

 God has good in store for Israel, for His own name's sake, to revive 
 His people; first, by a spiritual renewal of their hearts, and, next, 
 by an external restoration to prosperity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:22-33">Eze 36:22-33</A>).

 The result is that the heathen shall be impressed with the power and 
 goodness of God manifested so palpably towards the restored people

 the tribal rod. The union of the two rods was a prophecy in action of 
 the brotherly union which is to reunite the ten tribes and Judah. As 
 their severance under Jeroboam was fraught with the greatest evil to 
 the covenant-people, so the first result of both being joined by the 
 spirit of life to God is that they become joined to one another under

 but of the ten tribes of Israel. For four hundred years, during the 
 period of the judges, with Manasseh and Benjamin, its dependent tribes, 
 it had formerly taken the lead: Shiloh was its religious capital; 
 Shechem, its civil capital. God had transferred the birthright from 
 Reuben (for dishonoring his father's bed) to Joseph, whose 
 representative, Ephraim, though the younger, was made

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:19,1Ch+5:1">Ge 48:19;

 From its pre-eminence "Israel" is attached to it as "companions." The
 "all" in this case, not in that of Judah, which has only attached as 
 "companions" "the children of Israel" (that is, some of them, namely,
 those who followed the fortunes of Judah), implies that the <I>bulk</I>

 The objections to a <I>literal</I> interpretation of the prophecy are--(1)
 The ideal nature of the name Gog, which is the root of Magog, the only
 kindred name found in Scripture or history. (2) The nations congregated
 are selected from places most distant from Israel, and from one another,
 and therefore most unlikely to act in concert (Persians and Libyans, &c.).
 (3) The whole spoil of Israel could not have given a handful to
 a tithe of their number, or maintained the myriads of invaders a single
 day 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:12,13">Eze 38:12, 13</A>).

 (4) The wood of their invaders' weapons was to serve for fuel to Israel 
 for seven years! And <I>all</I> Israel were to take seven months in 
 burying the dead! Supposing a million of Israelites to bury each two 
 corpses a day, the aggregate buried in the hundred eighty working days 
 of the seven months would be three hundred sixty millions of corpses! 
 Then the pestilential vapors from such masses of victims before they 
 were all buried! What Israelite could live in such an atmosphere? (5) 
 The scene of the Lord's controversy here is different from that in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:6">Isa 34:6</A>,

 Edom, which creates a discrepancy.  (But probably a different judgment 
 is alluded to). (6) The gross carnality of the representation of God's 
 dealings with His adversaries is inconsistent with Messianic times. It 
 therefore requires a non-literal interpretation. The prophetical 
 delineations of the divine principles of government are thrown into the 
 familiar forms of Old Testament relations. The final triumph of 
 Messiah's truth over the most distant and barbarous nations is 
 represented as a literal conflict on a gigantic scale, Israel being the 
 battlefield, ending in the complete triumph of Israel's anointed King, 
 the Saviour of the world. It is a <I>prophetical</I> parable [F<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>AIRBAIRN</FONT>]. However, though the <I>details</I> are not 
 literal, the distinctiveness in this picture, characterizing also 
 parallel descriptions in writers less ideally picturesque than Ezekiel, 
 gives probability to a more definite and generally literal 
 interpretation. The awful desolations caused in Judea by Antiochus 
 Epiphanes, of Syria (1 Maccabees; and P<FONT SIZE=-1>ORPHYRY</FONT>,
 quoted by J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> on Ezekiel), his defilement of 
 Jehovah's temple by sacrificing swine and sprinkling the altar with the 
 broth, and setting up the altar of Jupiter Olympius, seem to be an 
 earnest of the final desolations to be caused by Antichrist in Israel, 
 previous to His overthrow by the Lord Himself, coming to reign (compare

 common one of the kings of the country, as "Pharaoh" in Egypt. Chakan
 was the name given by the Northern Asiatics to their king, and is still
 a title of the Turkish sultan: "Gog" may be a contraction of this. In
 Ezekiel's time a horde of northern Asiatics, termed by the Greeks
 "Scythians," and probably including the Moschi and Tibareni, near the
 Caucasus, here ("Meshech .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Tubal") undertook an expedition against
 Egypt [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ERODOTUS</FONT>, 1.103-106]. These names might be adopted by Ezekiel
 from the historical fact familiar to men at the time, as ideal titles
 for the great last anti-Christian confederacy.

 many triumphs to His people; from this time to the death of Antiochus, 
 early in 149, a period of seven months, the Jews had rest from 
 Antiochus, and purified their land, and on the twenty-fifth day of the 
 ninth month celebrated the Enc&aelig;nia, or feast of dedication

 and purification of the temple. The whole period, in round numbers, was 
 seven years. Mattathias was the patriotic Jewish leader, and his third 
 son, Judas, the military commander under whom the Syrian generals were 
 defeated. He retook Jerusalem and purified the temple. Simon and 
 Jonathan, his brothers, succeeded him: the independence of the Jews was 
 secured, and the crown vested in the Asmonean family, in which it 
 continued till Herod the Great.</P>

 The arrangements as to the land and the temple are, in many particulars,
 different from those subsisting before the captivity. There are things
 in it so improbable physically as to preclude a <I>purely</I> literal
 interpretation. The general truth seems to hold good that, as Israel
 served the nations for his rejection of Messiah, so shall they serve him
 in the person of Messiah, when he shall acknowledge Messiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:12,Zec+14:17-19">Isa 60:12;
 Zec 14:17-19</A>; 
 
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:11">Ps 72:11</A>).

 The ideal temple exhibits, under Old Testament forms (used as being
 those then familiar to the men whom Ezekiel, a priest himself, and one
 who delighted in sacrificial images, addresses), not the precise 
 literal outline, but <I>the essential character</I> of the worship of 
 Messiah as it shall be when He shall exercise sway in Jerusalem among 
 His own people, the Jews, and thence to the ends of the earth. The very 
 fact that the whole is a vision

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:2">Eze 40:2</A>),

 not an oral face-to-face communication such as that granted to Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:6-8">Nu 12:6-8</A>),

 implies that the directions are not to be understood so precisely 
 literally as those given to the Jewish lawgiver. The description 
 involves things which, taken literally, almost involve natural 
 impossibilities. The square of the temple, in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+42:20">Eze 42:20</A>,

 is six times as large as the circuit of the wall enclosing the old 
 temple, and larger than all the earthly Jerusalem.  Ezekiel gives three 
 and a half miles and one hundred forty yards to his temple square. The 
 boundaries of the ancient city were about two and a half miles. Again, 
 the city in Ezekiel has an area between three or four thousand square 
 miles, including the holy ground set apart for the prince, priests, and 
 Levites. This is nearly as large as the whole of Judea west of the 
 Jordan. As Zion lay in the center of the ideal city, the one-half of 
 the sacred portion extended to nearly thirty miles south of Jerusalem, 
 that is, covered nearly the whole southern territory, which reached 
 only to the Dead Sea

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+47:19">Eze 47:19</A>),

 and yet five tribes were to have their inheritance on that side of 
 Jerusalem, <I>beyond</I> the sacred portion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:23-28">Eze 48:23-28</A>).

 Where was land to be found for them there? A breadth of but four or 
 five miles apiece would be left. As the boundaries of the land are 
 given the same as under Moses, these incongruities cannot be explained 
 away by supposing physical changes about to be effected in the land 
 such as will meet the difficulties of the purely literal 
 interpretation. The distribution of the land is in equal portions among 
 the twelve tribes, without respect to their relative numbers, and the 
 parallel sections running from east to west.  There is a difficulty 
 also in the supposed separate existence of the twelve tribes, such 
 separate tribeships no longer existing, and it being hard to imagine 
 how they could be restored as distinct tribes, mingled as they now are. 
 So the stream that issued from the east threshold of the temple and 
 flowed into the Dead Sea, in the rapidity of its increase and the 
 quality of its waters, is unlike anything ever known in Judea or 
 elsewhere in the world. Lastly, the catholicity of the Christian 
 dispensation, and the spirituality of its worship, seem incompatible 
 with a return to the local narrowness and "beggarly elements" of the 
 Jewish ritual and carnal ordinances, disannulled "because of the 
 unprofitableness thereof" [F<FONT SIZE=-1>AIRBAIRN</FONT>],

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:3,9,5:1,Heb+9:10,10:18">Ga 4:3, 9; 5:1;
 Heb 9:10; 10:18</A>).

 "A temple with sacrifices now would be a denial of the all-sufficiency
 of the sacrifice of Christ. He who sacrificed before confessed the 
 Messiah. He who should sacrifice now would solemnly deny Him" [D<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OUGLAS</FONT>].  These difficulties, however, may be all 
 <I>seeming,</I> not real. Faith accepts God's Word as it is, waits for 
 the event, sure that it will clear up all such difficulties. Perhaps, 
 as some think, the beau ideal of a sacred commonwealth is given 
 according to the then existing pattern of temple services, which would 
 be the imagery most familiar to the prophet and his hearers at the 
 time. The minute particularizing of details is in accordance with 
 Ezekiel's style, even in describing purely ideal scenes. The old temple 
 embodied in visible forms and rites spiritual truths affecting the 
 people even when absent from it. So this ideal temple is made in the 
 absence of the outward temple to serve by description the same purpose 
 of symbolical instruction as the old literal temple did by forms and 
 acts. As in the beginning God promised to be a "sanctuary"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:16">Eze 11:16</A>)

 to the captives at the Chebar, so now at the close is promised a 
 complete restoration and realization of the theocratic worship and 
 polity under Messiah in its noblest ideal (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:38-40">Jer 31:38-40</A>).
 
 In 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:22">Re 21:22</A>

 "no temple" is seen, as in the perfection of the new dispensation the 
 accidents of place and form are no longer needed to realize to 
 Christians what Ezekiel imparts to Jewish minds by the imagery familiar 
 to them. In Ezekiel's temple holiness stretches over the entire temple, 
 so that in this there is no longer a distinction between the different 
 parts, as in the old temple: parts left undeterminate in the latter 
 obtain now a divine sanction, so that all arbitrariness is excluded. So 
 that it is be a perfect manifestation of the love of God to His 
 covenant-people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:1-43:12">Eze 40:1-43:12</A>);

 and from it, as from a new center of religious life, there gushes forth 
 the fulness of blessings to them, and so to all people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+47:1-23">Eze 47:1-23</A>)

 [F<FONT SIZE=-1>AIRBAIRN</FONT> and H<FONT SIZE=-1>AVERNICK</FONT>].
 The temple built at the return from Babylon can only very partially
 have realized the model here given. The law is seemingly opposed to the
 gospel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:21,22,27,28,33,34">Mt 5:21, 22, 27, 28, 33, 34</A>).

 It is not really so (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:17,18,Ro+3:31,Ga+3:21,22">Mt 5:17, 18;
 Ro 3:31; 
 Ga 3:21, 22</A>).

 It is true Christ's sacrifice superseded the law sacrifices

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:12-18">Heb 10:12-18</A>).

 Israel's province may hereafter be to show the essential identity, even 
 in the minute details of the temple sacrifices, between the law and 
 gospel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:8">Ro 10:8</A>).

 In this closing vision, as in the opening one of the book, the divine 
 hand is laid on the prophet, and he is borne away in the visions of 
 God. But the scene there was by the Chebar, Jehovah having forsaken 
 Jerusalem; now it is the mountain of God, Jehovah having returned 
 thither; there, the vision was calculated to inspire terror; here, hope 
 and assurance.</P>

 middle finger, a little more than two feet: exceeding the ordinary
 <I>cubit</I> (from the elbow to the wrist) by an hand-breadth, that is,
 twenty-one inches in all. Compare

 <B>breadth of the building</B>--that is, the boundary wall. The imperfections
 in the old temple's boundary wall were to have no place here. The
 buildings attached to it had been sometimes turned to common uses; for
 example, Jeremiah was imprisoned in one 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:2,29:26">Jer 20:2; 29:26</A>).

 But now all these were to be holy to the Lord. The gates and doorways
 to the city of God were to be imprinted in their architecture with the 
 idea of the exclusion of everything defiled

 Solomon's temple had an outer court open to alterations and even
 idolatrous innovations

 in this there was to be no room for human corruptions. Its compass was
 exactly defined, one hundred cubits; and the fine pavement implied it 
 was to be trodden only by clean feet (compare

 These chambers were appendages attached to the outside of the temple,

 that no place was to be left which was to be held, as of old, not

 God from the first claimed to be their King politically as well as

 the passover; so the passover itself is to have different sacrifices
 from those of the Mosaic law. Instead of one ram and seven lambs for the
 daily burnt offering, there are to be seven bullocks and seven rams. So
 also whereas the feast of tabernacles had its own offerings, which
 diminished as the days of the feast advanced, here the same are
 appointed as on the passover. Thus it is implied that the letter of the
 law is to give place to its spirit, those outward rites of Judaism
 having no intrinsic efficacy, but symbolizing the spiritual truths of
 Messiah's kingdom, as for instance the perfect holiness which is to
 characterize it. Compare

 on Christ by faith, accompanied with "the unleavened bread of sincerity 
 and truth." Literal ordinances, though not slavishly bound to the 
 letter of the law, will set forth the catholic and eternal verities of 
 Messiah's kingdom.</P>

 The happy fruit to the earth at large of God's dwelling with Israel in
 holy fellowship is that the blessing is no longer restricted to the one
 people and locality, but is to be diffused with comprehensive
 catholicity through the whole world. So the plant from the cedar of
 Lebanon is represented as gathering under its shelter "all fowl of every
 wing"

 Messiah is the temple and the door; from His pierced side flow the
 living waters, ever increasing, both in the individual believer and in 
 the heart. The fountains in the vicinity of Moriah suggested the image 
 here. The waters flow eastward, that is, towards the Kedron, and thence 
 towards the Jordan, and so along the Ghor into the Dead Sea. The main 
 point in the picture is the rapid augmentation from a petty stream into 
 a mighty river, not by the influx of side streams, but by its own 
 self-supply from the sacred miraculous source in the temple [H<FONT
