 Colosse (or, as it is spelt in the best manuscripts, "Colass&aelig;") was
 a city of Phrygia, on the river Lycus, a branch of the Meander. The
 Church there was mainly composed of Gentiles (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:13">Col 2:13</A>).
 
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> infers from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:1">Col 2:1</A>
 
 (see on

 <A HREF="#Col2_1">Col 2:1</A>), 

 that Paul had not seen its members, and therefore could not have been 
 its founder, as T<FONT SIZE=-1>HEODORET</FONT> thought.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:7,8">Col 1:7, 8</A>

 suggests the probability that Epaphras was the first founder of the 
 Church there. The date of its foundation must have been subsequent to 
 Paul's visitation, "strengthening in order" all the churches of Galatia 
 and Phrygia

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:24">Ac 18:24</A>);

 for otherwise we must have visited the Colossians, which

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:1">Col 2:1</A>

 implies he had not. Had Paul been their father in the faith, he would 
 doubtless have alluded to the fact, as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:6,10,4:15,1Th+1:5,2:1">1Co 3:6, 10; 4:15;
 1Th 1:5; 2:1</A>. 

 It is only in the Epistles, Romans and Ephesians, and this Epistle,
 such allusions are wanting; in that to the Romans, because, as in this 
 Church of Colosse, he had not been the instrument of their conversion; 
 in that to the Ephesians, owing to the general nature of the Epistle. 
 Probably during the "two years" of Paul's stay at Ephesus, when "<I>all 
 which dwelt in Asia</I> heard the word of the Lord Jesus"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:10,26">Ac 19:10, 26</A>),

 Epaphras, Philemon, Archippus, Apphia and the other natives of Colosse, 
 becoming converted at Ephesus, were subsequently the first sowers of 
 the Gospel seed in their own city. This will account for their personal 
 acquaintance with, and attachment to, Paul and his fellow ministers, 
 and for his loving language as to them, and their counter salutations 
 to him. So also with respect to "them at Laodicea,"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:1">Col 2:1</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <FONT SIZE=-1>OBJECT</FONT> of the Epistle is to counteract Jewish false teaching, by
 setting before the Colossians their true standing in Christ alone
 (exclusive of all other heavenly beings), the majesty of His person,
 and the completeness of the redemption wrought by Him; hence they ought
 to be conformed to their risen Lord, and to exhibit that conformity in
 all the relations of ordinary life

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:16">Col 2:16</A>,

 "new moon, sabbath days," shows that the false teaching opposed in this 
 Epistle is that of <I>Judaizing</I> Christians. These mixed up with 
 pure Christianity Oriental theosophy and angel-worship, and the 
 asceticism of certain sections of the Jews, especially the Essenes. 
 Compare J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT> [<I>Wars of the Jews,</I> 
 2.8,13]. These theosophists promised to their followers a deeper 
 insight into the world of spirits, and a nearer approach to heavenly 
 purity and intelligence, than the simple Gospel affords. C<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ONYBEARE</FONT> and H<FONT SIZE=-1>OWSON</FONT> think that some 
 Alexandrian Jew had appeared at Colosse, imbued with the Greek 
 philosophy of P<FONT SIZE=-1>HILO'S</FONT> school, combining with it 
 the Rabbinical theosophy and angelology which afterwards was embodied 
 in the Cabbala. Compare J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT> 
 [<I>Antiquities,</I> 12.3,4], from which we know that Alexander the 
 Great had garrisoned the towns of Lydia and <I>Phrygia</I> with two 
 thousand Mesopotamian and Babylonian <I>Jews</I> in the time of a 
 threatened revolt. The Phrygians themselves had a mystic tendency in 
 their worship of Cybele, which inclined them to receive the more 
 readily the incipient Gnosticism of Judaizers, which afterward 
 developed itself into the strangest heresies. In the Pastoral Epistles, 
 the evil is spoken of as having reached a more deadly phase

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:1-3,6:5">1Ti 4:1-3; 6:5</A>),

 whereas he brings no charge of immorality in this Epistle: a proof of
 its being much earlier in date.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <FONT SIZE=-1>PLACE</FONT> from which it was written seems to have been Rome, during
 his first imprisonment there 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:17-31">Ac 28:17-31</A>).
 
 In my

 <A HREF="JFB49.htm#Introduction"><I>Introduction</I></A>

 to the Epistle to the Ephesians, it was shown that the three Epistles, 
 Ephesians, Colossians, and Philemon, were sent at the same time, 
 namely, during the freer portion of his imprisonment, before the death 
 of Burrus.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:3,4,Eph+6:19,20">Col 4:3, 4;
 Eph 6:19, 20</A>, 

 imply greater freedom than he had while writing to the Philippians,
 after the promotion of Tigellinus to be Pr&aelig;torian Prefect.  See

 <A HREF="JFB50.htm#Introduction"><I>Introduction</I></A> 
 
 to Philippians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This Epistle, though <I>carried</I> by the same bearer, Tychicus, who 
 bore that to the <I>Ephesians,</I> was <I>written</I> previously to 
 that Epistle; for many phrases similar in both appear in the more 
 expanded form in the Epistle to the Ephesians (compare also 
 <I>Note,</I> see on

 <A HREF="JFB49.htm#Eph6_21">Eph 6:21</A>).
 
 The <I>Epistle to the Laodiceans</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:16">Col 4:16</A>)

 was <I>written</I> before that to the Colossians, but probably was 
 <I>sent</I> by him to Laodicea at the same time with that to the Church 
 at Colosse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <FONT SIZE=-1>STYLE</FONT>
 is peculiar: many <I>Greek</I> phrases occur here, found nowhere
 else. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:8">Col 2:8</A>,
 
 "<I>spoil</I> you"; "making a show of them openly"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:15">Col 2:15</A>);
 
 "beguile of your reward," and "intruding"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:18">Col 2:18</A>);
 
 "will-worship"; "satisfying" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:23">Col 2:23</A>);

 "filthy communication"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:8">Col 3:8</A>);
 
 "rule" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:15">Col 3:15</A>);
 
 "comfort"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:11">Col 4:11</A>).

 The loftiness and artificial elaboration of style correspond to the 
 majestic nature of his theme, the majesty of Christ's person and 
 office, in contrast to the beggarly system of the Judaizers, the 
 discussion of which was forced on him by the controversy. Hence arises 
 his use of unusual phraseology. On the other hand, in the Epistle of 
 the Ephesians, subsequently written, in which he was not so hampered by 
 the exigencies of controversy, he dilates on the same glorious truths, 
 so congenial to him, more at large, freely and uncontroversially, in 
 the fuller outpouring of his spirit, with less of the elaborate and 
 antithetical language of system, such as was needed in cautioning the 
 Colossians against the particular errors threatening them. Hence arises 
 the striking similarity of many of the phrases in the two Epistles 
 written about the same time, and generally in the same vein of 
 spiritual thought; while the peculiar phrases of the Epistle to the 
 Colossians are such as are natural, considering the controversial 
 purpose of that Epistle.</P>

 He was with Paul at the time of writing in Rome.  He had been companion 
 of Paul in his first tour through Phrygia, in which Colosse was. Hence 
 the Colossians seem to have associated him with Paul in their 
 affections, and the apostle joins him with himself in the address. 
 Neither, probably, had <I>seen</I> the Colossian <I>Church</I> (compare

 be in us an inactive principle but will always produce "love." This
 passage is abused by Romanists, as if the hope of salvation depended
 upon works. A false argument. It does not follow that our hope is
 founded on our works because we are strongly stimulated to live well;
 since nothing is more effectual for this purpose than the sense of God's
 free grace [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>in the word,</B> &c.--That "hope" formed part of "the word of the truth
 of the Gospel" (compare

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>as <I>it is</I> in all the world</B>--<I>virtually,</I> as it was by this time

 However, the true reading, and that of the oldest manuscripts, is that
 which omits the following "and," thus (the "<I>it is</I>" of <I>English 
 Version</I> is not in the original <I>Greek</I>): "As in all the world 
 it is bringing forth fruit <I>and growing</I> (so the oldest 
 manuscripts read; <I>English Version</I> omits 'and growing,' without 
 good authority), even as it doth in you also." Then what is asserted is 
 not that the Gospel has been preached in all the world, but that it is 
 <I>bearing fruits</I> of righteousness, and (like a tree <I>growing</I> 
 at the same time that it is <I>bearing fruit</I>) <I>growing in 
 numbers</I> of its converts in, or throughout, all the world.

 The insertion implied that those inserting it thought that <I>Paul</I> had
 preached the Gospel to the Colossians as well as Epaphras, Whereas the
 omission in the oldest manuscripts implies that <I>Epaphras alone</I> was
 the founder of the Church at Colosse.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phile+1:23">Phm 23</A>

 he calls him "my fellow prisoner." It is possible that Epaphras may
 have been apprehended for his zealous labors in Asia Minor; but more 
 probable that Paul gave him the title; as his faithful companion in his 
 imprisonment (compare <I>Note,</I> see on

 Still, <I>secondarily,</I> this once-for-all meetness contains in it 
 the germ of sanctification, afterwards developed progressively in the 
 life by the Father's Spirit in the believer. The Christian life of 
 heavenliness is the first stage of heaven itself.  There must, and will

 and the Sustainer

 whose glories the first Adam only in part represented. "Image" 
 (<I>eicon</I>) involves "likeness" (<I>homoiosis</I>); but "likeness" 
 does not involve "image." "Image" always supposes a prototype, which it 
 not merely resembles, but from which it is drawn: the exact 
 counterpart, as the reflection of the sun in the water: the child the 
 living image of the parent. "Likeness" implies mere <I>resemblance,</I> 
 not the exact <I>counterpart</I> and <I>derivation</I> as "image" 
 expresses; hence it is nowhere applied to the Son, while "image" is 
 here, compare

 by whom God created the worlds, and by whom God appeared to the

 <I>English Version</I> might seem to favor Arianism, as if Christ were

 existence; the "<I>by</I> Him," below, that He is the <I>instrument</I> 
 of actually realizing the divine idea [N<FONT SIZE=-1>EANDER</FONT>].  
 His essential nature as the Word of the Father is not a mere appendage

 the Eternal Word to men "made in His image"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:27">Ge 1:27</A>),

 is the source of the new relation to them by redemption, formed in His 
 incarnation, whereby He restores them to His lost image. "<I>In</I>

 three prepositions mark in succession the beginning, the progress, and 
 the end [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>].

 The Gnostics used the term "fulness," for the assemblage of emanations,
 or angelic powers, coming from God. The Spirit presciently by Paul 
 warns the Church, that the true "fulness" dwells in Christ alone. This 
 assigns the reason why Christ takes precedence of every creature

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:15">Col 1:15</A>).

 For two reasons Christ is Lord of the Church: (1) Because the fulness 
 of the divine attributes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:19">Col 1:19</A>)

 dwells in Him, and so He has the <I>power</I> to govern the universe; 
 (2) Because

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:20">Col 1:20</A>)

 what He has done for the Church gives Him the <I>right</I> to preside

 <I>This indwelling of the Godhead in Christ</I> is the foundation of 
 <I>the reconciliation</I> by Him [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]. Hence 
 the "and"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:20">Col 1:20</A>)

 connects as cause and effect the two things, <I>the Godhead in Christ,

 having made peace (God the Father having made peace) through the blood
 of His (Christ's) cross," that is, shed by Christ <I>on</I> the cross: 
 the price and pledge of our reconciliation with God.  The Scripture 
 phrase, "God reconciles man to Himself," implies that He takes away by 
 the blood of Jesus the barrier which God's justice interposes against 
 man's being in union with God (compare <I>Note,</I> see on

 "Wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master," that is, 
 <I>reconcile his master</I> unto him by appeasing his wrath. So

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>by him</B>--"through Him" (the instrumental agent in the new creation, as
 in the original creation): emphatically repeated, to bring the person of
 Christ, as the Head of both creations alike, into prominence.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>things in earth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in heaven</B>--Good angels, in one 
 sense, do not need reconciliation to God; fallen angels are excluded 
 from it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:6">Jude 6</A>).

 But probably redemption has effects on the world of spirits unknown to
 us. Of course, His reconciling <I>us,</I> and His reconciling 
 <I>them,</I> must be by a different process, as He took not on Him the 
 nature of angels, so as to offer a <I>propitiation</I> for them.  But 
 the effect of redemption on them, as He is <I>their</I> Head as well as 
 <I>ours,</I> is that they are thereby <I>brought nearer God,</I> and so 
 gain an increase of blessedness [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>], and 
 <I>larger views of the love and wisdom of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:10">Eph 3:10</A>).

 All creation subsists in Christ, all creation is therefore affected by 
 His propitiation: sinful creation is strictly "reconciled" from its 
 enmity; sinless creation, comparatively distant from His unapproachable 
 purity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:18,15:15,25:5">Job 4:18; 15:15; 25:5</A>),

 is lifted into nearer participation of Him, and in this wider sense is
 reconciled. Doubtless, too, man's fall, following on Satan's fall, is a
 segment of a larger circle of evil, so that the remedy of the former
 affects the standing of angels, from among whom Satan and his host
 fell. Angels thereby having seen the magnitude of sin, and the infinite
 cost of redemption, and the exclusion of the fallen angels from it, and
 the inability of any creature to stand morally in his own strength, are
 <I>now</I> put beyond the reach of falling. Thus 
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>ACON'S</FONT> definition of Christ's Headship holds
 good: "The Head of <I>redemption</I> to man; the Head of 
 <I>preservation</I> to angels." Some conjecture that Satan, when 
 unfallen, ruled this earth and the pre-Adamic animal kingdom: hence his 
 malice against man who succeeded to the lordship of this earth and its 
 animals, and hence, too, his assumption of the form of a serpent, the 
 subtlest of the animal tribes.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:38">Lu 19:38</A>

 states expressly "peace in heaven" as the result of finished 
 redemption, as "peace on earth" was the result of its beginning at 
 Jesus' birth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:14">Lu 2:14</A>).

 B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT> explains the reconciliation to be that of 
 not only God, but also <I>angels, estranged from men</I> because of 
 man's enmity against God.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:10">Eph 1:10</A>

 accords with this: This is true, but only part of the truth: so A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LFORD'S</FONT> view also is but part of the truth. An actual 
 <I>reconciliation</I> or <I>restoration of peace in heaven,</I> as well 
 as on earth, is expressed by Paul. As long as that blood of 
 reconciliation was not actually shed, which is opposed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:8,9">Zec 3:8, 9</A>)

 to the accusations of Satan, but was only in promise, Satan could plead 
 his right against men before God day and night

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:6,Re+12:10">Job 1:6;
 Re 12:10</A>);
 
 hence he was in heaven till the ban on man was broken (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:18">Lu 10:18</A>).

 So here; the world of earth and heaven owe to Christ alone <I>the 
 restoration of harmony after the conflict and the subjugation of all 
 things under one Head</I> (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:23">Heb 11:23</A>).

 Sin introduced discord not only on earth, but also in heaven, by the 
 fall of demons; it brought into the abodes of holy angels, though not 
 positive, yet privative loss, a retardation of their highest and most 
 perfect development, harmonious gradation, and perfect consummation. 
 Angels were no more able than men by themselves to overcome the peace 
 disturbers, and cast out the devils; it is only "by," or "through 
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>IM</FONT>," and "the blood of H<FONT SIZE=-1>IS</FONT> 
 cross," that <I>peace was restored even in heaven;</I> it is only after 
 Christ has obtained the victory fully and legally, that Michael

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:7-10">Re 12:7-10</A>)

 and his angels can cast out of heaven Satan and his demons (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:15">Col 2:15</A>).

 Thus the point of Paul's argument against angel-worship is, that angels 
 themselves, like men, wholly depend on Christ, the sole and true object 
 of worship [A<FONT SIZE=-1>UBERLEN</FONT>].</P>

 creature .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  whereof I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. am .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
 a minister</B>--Three arguments against their being "moved away from 
 the Gospel": (1) Their having heard it; (2) The universality of the 
 preaching of it; (3) Paul's ministry in it. For "to (<I>Greek,</I> 
 'in') every creature," the oldest manuscripts read, "in <I>all
 creation.</I>" Compare "in all the world,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:6">Col 1:6</A>;

 "all things .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in earth,"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:15">Mr 16:15</A>):

 thus he implies that the Gospel from which he urges them <I>not to be
 moved,</I> has this mark of truth, namely, the universality of its 
 announcement, which accords with the command and prophecy of Christ 
 Himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:14">Mt 24:14</A>).

 By "<I>was</I> preached," he means not merely "<I>is being 
 preached,</I>" but <I>has been actually, as an accomplished fact, 
 preached.</I> P<FONT SIZE=-1>LINY</FONT>, not many years subsequently, 
 in his famous letter to the Emperor Trajan [<I>Epistles,</I> Book X., 
 Epistle 97], writes, "Many of every age, rank, and sex, are being 
 brought to trial. For the contagion of that superstition [Christianity] 
 has spread over not only cities, but villages and the country."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>whereof I Paul am</B>--rather as <I>Greek,</I> "<I>was made</I> a
 minister." Respect for me, the minister of this world-wide Gospel, 
 should lead you not to be moved from it. Moreover (he implies), the 
 Gospel which ye heard from Epaphras, your "minister"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:7">Col 1:7</A>),

 is the same of which "I was made a minister"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:25,Eph+3:7">Col 1:25;

 ministers of the Gospel for unauthorized false teachers.</P>

 <B>24. Who</B>--The oldest manuscripts omit "who"; then translate, "Now I
 rejoice." Some very old manuscripts, and the best of the
 <I>Latin versions,</I> and <I>Vulgate,</I> read as <I>English Version.</I> To
 enhance the glory of Christ as paramount to all, he mentions his own
 sufferings for the Church of Christ. "Now" stands in contrast to "I
 <I>was made,</I>" in the past time 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:23">Col 1:23</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for you</B>--"on your behalf," that ye may be confirmed in resting solely
 on Christ (to the exclusion of angel-worship) by the glorification of
 Christ in my sufferings

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>fill up that which is behind</B>--literally, "the deficiencies"--all 
 that are lacking of the afflictions of Christ (compare <I>Note,</I> 
 see on

 <A HREF="JFB47.htm#2Co1_5">2Co 1:5</A>). 

 Christ is "afflicted in all His people's afflictions"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:9">Isa 63:9</A>).

 "The Church is His body in which He is, dwells, lives, and therefore 
 also suffers" [V<FONT SIZE=-1>ITRINGA</FONT>]. Christ was destined to 
 endure certain afflictions in this figurative body, as well as in His 
 literal; these were "that which is behind of the afflictions of 
 <I>Christ,</I>" which Paul "filled up." His own meritorious sufferings 
 in expiation for sin were once for all completely filled up on the 
 Cross. But His Church (His second Self) has her whole measure of 
 afflictions fixed. The more Paul, a member, endured, the less remain 
 for the rest of the Church to endure; the communion of saints thus 
 giving them an interest in his sufferings. It is in reference to the 
 Church's afflictions, which are "Christ's afflictions, that Paul here 
 saith, "I fill up the deficiencies," or "what remain behind of the 
 afflictions of Christ." She is afflicted to promote her growth in 
 holiness, and her completeness in Christ. Not one suffering is lost

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:8">Ps 56:8</A>).

 All her members have thus a mutual interest in one another's sufferings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:26">1Co 12:26</A>).

 But Rome's inference hence, is utterly false that the Church has a 
 stock treasury of the merits and satisfactions of Christ and His 
 apostles, out of which she may dispense indulgences; the context has no 
 reference to sufferings in <I>expiation of sin</I> and productive of 
 <I>merit.</I> Believers should regard their sufferings less in relation 
 to themselves as individuals, and more as parts of a grand whole, 
 carrying out God's perfect plan.</P>

 This sense is proved by the following: "Christ in you the hope of

 Thus Paul's argument against those grafting on Christianity Jewish 
 observances, along with angel-worship, is, whatever part angels may be 
 supposed to have had under the law, now at an end, God having put the 
 legal dispensation itself away. But the objection is, that the context

 Literally, "Delighting ([W<FONT SIZE=-1>AHL</FONT>]) in humility"; 
 <I>loving</I> (so the <I>Greek</I> is translated,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:38">Mr 12:38</A>,

 "<I>love</I> to go in long clothing") to indulge himself <I>in a
 humility</I> of his own imposing: <I>a volunteer in humility</I> 
 [D<FONT SIZE=-1>ALL&AElig;US</FONT>]. Not as A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>, "Let no one <I>of purpose</I> defraud you," &c. 
 Not as G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT>, "If he ever so much wish" (to 
 defraud you). For the participle "wishing" or "delighting," is one of 
 the series, and stands in the same category as "intruding," "puffed 
 up," "not holding"; and the <I>self-pleasing</I> implied in it stands 
 in happy contrast to the (mock) <I>humility</I> with which it seems to 
 me, therefore, to be connected. His "humility," so called, is a 
 <I>pleasing of self:</I> thus it stands in parallelism to "his fleshly 
 mind" (its real name, though <I>he</I> styles it "humility"), as 
 "wishing" or "delighting" does to "puffed up." The <I>Greek</I> for 
 "humility" is literally, "lowliness of <I>mind,</I>" which forms a 
 clearer parallel to "puffed up by his fleshly <I>mind.</I>" Under 
 pretext of humility, as if they durst not come directly to God and 
 Christ (like the modern Church of Rome), they invoked angels: as 
 Judaizers, they justified this on the ground that the law was given by 
 angels. This error continued long in Phrygia (where Colosse and 
 Laodicea were), so that the Council of Laodicea (<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 360) expressly framed its thirty-fifth canon 
 against the "<I>Angelici</I>" (as A<FONT SIZE=-1>UGUSTINE</FONT> 
 [<I>Heresies,</I> 39], calls them) or "invokers of angels." Even as 
 late as T<FONT SIZE=-1>HEODORET'S</FONT> time, there were oratories to 
 Michael the archangel. The modern Greeks have a legend that Michael
 opened a chasm to draw off an inundation threatening the Colossian 
 Christians. Once men admit the inferior powers to share invocation with 
 the Supreme, the former gradually engrosses all our serious worship, 
 almost to the exclusion of the latter; thus the heathen, beginning with 
 adding the worship of other deities to that of the Supreme, ended with 
 ceasing to worship Him at all. Nor does it signify much, whether we 
 regard such as directly controlling us (the pagan view), or as only 
 <I>influencing</I> the Supreme in our behalf (the Church of Rome's 
 view); because he from whom I expect happiness or misery, becomes the 
 uppermost object in my mind, whether he <I>give,</I> or only 
 <I>procure</I> it [<I>Cautions for Times</I>]. Scripture opposes the 
 idea of "patrons" or "intercessors"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:5,6">1Ti 2:5, 6</A>).

 True Christian humility joins consciousness of utter personal demerit, 
 with a sense of participation in the divine life through Christ, and in 
 the dignity of our adoption by God. Without the latter being realized, 
 a false self-humiliation results, which displays itself in ceremonies 
 and ascetic self-abasement

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:23">Col 2:23</A>),

 which after all is but spiritual pride under the mock guise of 
 humility. Contrast "glorying in the Lord"

 and L<FONT SIZE=-1>UCIFER</FONT> omit "not"; then translate, "haughtily treading on
 ('Standing on'
 [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]) the things which he hath seen."
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>REGELLES</FONT>
 refers this to <I>fancied</I> visions of angels. But if Paul had meant a
 <I>fancied seeing,</I> he would have used some qualifying word, as, "which
 he <I>seemed</I> to see," not "which he <I>hath</I> seen." Plainly the things
 were <I>actually</I> seen by him, whether of demoniacal origination

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:11-20">1Sa 28:11-20</A>),

 or phenomena resulting from natural causation, mistaken by him as if 
 supernatural. Paul, not stopping to discuss the nature of the things so 
 seen, fixes on the radical error, the tendency of such a one in all 
 this to walk by <FONT SIZE=-1>SENSE</FONT> (namely, what he 
 <I>haughtily prides himself on having</I> <FONT SIZE=-1>SEEN</FONT>), 
 rather than by <FONT SIZE=-1>FAITH</FONT> in the <FONT

 Heb 11:1</A>). 

 Thus is the parallelism, "vainly puffed up" answers to "haughtily
 treading on," or "setting his foot on"; "his fleshly mind" answers to 
 the things which he hath seen," since his fleshliness betrays itself in 
 priding himself on <I>what he hath seen,</I> rather than on the 
 <I>unseen</I> objects of <I>faith.</I> That the things seen may have

 for which he was doomed to lose his throne. This "voluntary worship" is 
 the counterpart to their "voluntary humility"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:18">Col 2:18</A>):

 both specious in appearance, the former seeming in religion to do even 
 <I>more</I> than God requires (as in the dogmas of the Roman and Greek 
 churches); but really setting aside God's will for man's own; the 
 latter seemingly self-abasing, but really proud of man's self-willed

 asceticism <I>positively;</I> so this clause, <I>negatively.</I> Not paying
 any of that "honor" which is due to the body as redeemed by such a price
 as the blood of Christ. We should not degrade, but have a just
 estimation of ourselves, not in ourselves, but in Christ

 self-mortification in "meats which profit not those occupied therein"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:9">Heb 13:9</A>),

 and is consistent with Christian self-respect, the "honor" which 
 belongs to the believer as dedicated to the Lord. Compare "vainly,"

 <B>to the satisfying of the flesh</B>--This expresses the <I>real</I> tendency
 of their human ordinances of bodily asceticism, voluntary humility, and
 will-worship of angels. While seeming to <I>deny</I> self and the body,
 they really are <I>pampering</I> the flesh. Thus "satisfying of the
 <I>flesh</I>" answers to "puffed up by his <I>fleshly</I> mind" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:18">Col 2:18</A>),

 so that "flesh" is used in its ethical sense, "the carnal nature" as 
 opposed to the "spiritual"; not in the sense, "body." The <I>Greek</I> 
 for "satisfying" implies <I>satiating to repletion,</I> or <I>to 
 excess.</I> "A surfeit of the carnal sense is human tradition" [H<FONT

 gratify the flesh (namely, self-righteousness), though seeming to 
 mortify it.</P>

 privileges, so does it expressly foretell that in the coming new order 
 of things, Israel shall be first of the Christian nations, not for her 
 own selfish aggrandizement, but for their good, as the medium of 
 blessing to them.  Finally, after the millennium, the life that is in 
 Christ becomes the power which transfigures <I>nature,</I> in the time

 not having gone further than Perga, in Pamphylia, but having gone

 "I have written," for "I write." The substance of them was, "If he come
 unto you, receive him." Paul's rejection of him on his second 
 missionary journey, because he had turned back at Perga on the first 
 journey

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:13,15:37-39">Ac 13:13; 15:37-39</A>),

 had caused an alienation between himself and Barnabas. Christian love
 soon healed the breach; for here he implies his restored confidence in 
 Mark, makes honorable allusion to Barnabas, and desires that those at 
 Colosse who had regarded Mark in consequence of that past error with 
 suspicion, should now "receive" him with kindness.  Colosse is only 
 about one hundred ten miles from Perga, and less than twenty from the 
 confines of Pisidia, through which province Paul and Barnabas preached 
 on their return during the same journey. Hence, though Paul had not 
 personally visited the Colossian Church, they knew of the past 
 unfaithfulness of Mark; and needed this recommendation of him, after 
 the temporary cloud on him, so as to receive him, now that he was about 
 to visit them as an evangelist. Again, in Paul's last imprisonment, he, 
 for the last time, speaks of Mark

 the Evangelist), may have first become connected with Paul in
 professionally attending on him in the sickness under which he labored
 in Phrygia and Galatia (in which latter place he was detained by
 sickness), in the early part of that journey wherein Luke first is found
 in his company

 compare <I>Note,</I> see on

 <A HREF="JFB48.htm#Ga4_13">Ga 4:13</A>). 

 Thus the allusion to his medical profession is appropriate in writing 
 to men of Phrygia. Luke ministered to Paul in his last imprisonment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:11">2Ti 4:11</A>).

 He alone has here no honorable or descriptive epithet attached to his

 Thus, they and the Gospels were put on a level with the Old Testament, 
 which was similarly read

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:11">De 31:11</A>).

 The Holy Spirit inspired Paul to write, besides those extant, other 
 Epistles which He saw necessary for <I>that</I> day, and for particular 
 churches; and which were not so for the Church of all ages and places. 
 It is possible that as the Epistle to the Colossians was to be read for 
 the edification of other churches besides that of Colosse; so the 
 Epistle to the Ephesians was to be read in various churches besides 
 Ephesus, and that Laodicea was the last of such churches before 
 Colosse, whence he might designate the Epistle to the Ephesians here as 
 "the Epistle <I>from</I> Laodicea." But it is equally possible that the 
 Epistle meant was one to the Laodiceans themselves.</P>

 <B>17. say to Archippus</B>--<I>The Colossians</I> (not merely the 
 clergy, but the laymen) are directed, "Speak <I>ye</I> to Archippus." 
 This proves that Scripture belongs to the laity as well as the clergy; 
 and that laymen may profitably admonish the clergy in particular cases 
 when they do so in meekness. B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT> suggests that 
 Archippus was perhaps prevented from going to the Church assembly by 
 weak health or age. The word, "fulfil," accords with his ministry being
 near its close

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:25">Col 1:25</A>;

 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phile+1:2">Phm 2</A>).

 However, "fulfil" may mean, as in 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:5">2Ti 4:5</A>,
 
 "<I>make full proof of</I> thy ministry." "Give all diligence to follow
 it out fully"; a monition perhaps needed by Archippus.
