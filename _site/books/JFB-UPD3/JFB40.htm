 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT> <I>author</I> of this Gospel was a publican or 
 tax gatherer, residing at Capernaum, on the western shore of the Sea of 
 Galilee. As to his identity with the "Levi" of the second and third 
 Gospels, and other particulars, see on

 <A HREF="#Mt9_9">Mt 9:9</A>. 

 Hardly anything is known of his apostolic labors. That, after preaching 
 to his countrymen in Palestine, he went to the East, is the general 
 testimony of antiquity; but the precise scene or scenes of his ministry 
 cannot be determined. That he died a natural death may be concluded 
 from the belief of the best-informed of the Fathers--that of the 
 apostles only three, James the Greater, Peter, and Paul, suffered 
 martyrdom. That the first Gospel was written by this apostle is the 
 testimony of all antiquity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 For the <I>date</I> of this Gospel we have only internal evidence, and 
 that far from decisive. Accordingly, opinion is much divided. That it 
 was the first issued of all the Gospels was universally believed.  
 Hence, although in the order of the Gospels, those by the two apostles 
 were placed first in the oldest manuscripts of the <I>Old Latin</I> 
 version, while in all the <I>Greek</I> manuscripts, with scarcely an 
 exception, the order is the same as in our Bibles, the Gospel according 
 to Matthew is <I>in every case</I> placed first. And as this Gospel is 
 of all the four the one which bears the most evident marks of having 
 been prepared and constructed with a special view to the Jews--who 
 certainly first required a written Gospel, and would be the first to 
 make use of it--there can be no doubt that it was issued before any of 
 the others.  That it was written before the destruction of Jerusalem is 
 equally certain; for as H<FONT SIZE=-1>UG</FONT> observes 
 [<I>Introduction to the New Testament,</I> p. 316, F<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OSDICK'S</FONT> translation], when he reports our Lord's 
 prophecy of that awful event, on coming to the warning about "the 
 abomination of desolation" which they should "see standing in the holy 
 place," he interposes (contrary to his invariable practice, which is to 
 <I>relate</I> without <I>remark</I>) a call to his readers to read 
 intelligently--"Whoso readeth, let him understand"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:15">Mt 24:15</A>)

 --a call to attend to the divine signal for flight which could be 
 intended only for those who lived before the event. But how long before 
 that event this Gospel was written is not so clear. Some internal 
 evidences seem to imply a very early date. Since the Jewish Christians 
 were, for five or six years, exposed to persecution from their own 
 countrymen--until the Jews, being persecuted by the Romans, had to look 
 to themselves--it is not likely (it is argued) that they should be left 
 so long without some written Gospel to reassure and sustain them, and 
 Matthew's Gospel was eminently fitted for that purpose. But the digests 
 to which Luke refers in his Introduction (see on

 <A HREF="JFB42.htm#Lu1_1">Lu 1:1</A>) 

 would be sufficient for a time, especially as the living voice of the 
 "eye-witnesses and ministers of the Word" was yet sounding abroad. 
 Other considerations in favor of a very early date--such as the tender 
 way in which the author seems studiously to speak of Herod Antipas, as 
 if still reigning, and his writing of Pilate apparently as if still in 
 power--seem to have no foundation in fact, and cannot therefore be made 
 the ground of reasoning as to the date of this Gospel. Its Hebraic 
 structure and hue, though they prove, as we think, that this Gospel 
 must have been published at a period considerably anterior to the 
 destruction of Jerusalem, are no evidence in favor of so early a date 
 as <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 37 or 38--according to some of the 
 Fathers, and, of the moderns, T<FONT SIZE=-1>ILLEMONT</FONT>, T<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OWNSON</FONT>, O<FONT SIZE=-1>WEN</FONT>, B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>IRKS</FONT>, T<FONT SIZE=-1>REGELLES</FONT>. On the other hand, 
 the date suggested by the statement of I<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>REN&AElig;US</FONT> [<I>Against Heresies,</I> 3.1], that 
 Matthew put forth his Gospel while Peter and Paul were at Rome 
 preaching and founding the Church--or after <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 
 60--though probably the majority of critics are in favor of it, would 
 seem rather too late, especially as the second and third Gospels, which 
 were doubtless published, as well as this one, before the destruction 
 of Jerusalem, had still to be issued. Certainly, such statements as the 
 following, "Wherefore that field is called the field of blood <I>unto 
 this day</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:8">Mt 27:8</A>);

 "And this saying is commonly reported among the Jews <I>until this 
 day</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:15">Mt 28:15</A>),

 bespeak a date considerably later than the events recorded. We incline, 
 therefore, to a date intermediate between the earlier and the later 
 dates assigned to this Gospel, without pretending to greater 
 precision.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have adverted to the strikingly Jewish character and coloring of
 this Gospel. The facts which it selects, the points to which it gives
 prominence, the cast of thought and phraseology, all bespeak the Jewish
 point of view <I>from</I> which it was written and <I>to</I> which it was
 directed. This has been noticed from the beginning, and is universally
 acknowledged. It is of the greatest consequence to the right
 interpretation of it; but the tendency among some even of the best of
 the Germans to infer, from this special design of the first Gospel, a
 certain laxity on the part of the Evangelist in the treatment of his
 facts, must be guarded against.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But by far the most interesting and important point connected with
 this Gospel is the <I>language</I> in which it was written. It is believed
 by a formidable number of critics that this Gospel was originally
 written in what is loosely called <I>Hebrew,</I> but more correctly
 <I>Aramaic,</I> or <I>Syro-Chaldaic,</I> the native tongue of the country at
 the time of our Lord; and that the <I>Greek</I> Matthew which we now
 possess is a translation of that work, either by the Evangelist himself
 or some unknown hand. The evidence on which this opinion is grounded
 is wholly external, but it has been deemed conclusive by
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT>,
 M<FONT SIZE=-1>ICHAELIS</FONT> (and his translator),
 M<FONT SIZE=-1>ARSH</FONT>,
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>OWNSON</FONT>,
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>AMPBELL</FONT>,
 O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT>,
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>RESWELL</FONT>,
 M<FONT SIZE=-1>EYER</FONT>,
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>BRARD</FONT>,
 L<FONT SIZE=-1>ANGE</FONT>,
 D<FONT SIZE=-1>AVIDSON</FONT>,
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>URETON</FONT>,
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>REGELLES</FONT>,
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>EBSTER</FONT>
 and W<FONT SIZE=-1>ILKINSON</FONT>, &c. The evidence referred to cannot
 be given here, but will be found, with remarks on its unsatisfactory 
 character, in the <I>Introduction to the Gospels</I> prefixed to our 
 larger <I>Commentary,</I> pp. 28-31.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But how stand the facts as to our <I>Greek</I> Gospel? We have not a tittle
 of historical evidence that it is a <I>translation,</I> either by Matthew
 himself or anyone else. All antiquity refers to it as the work of
 Matthew the publican and apostle, just as the other Gospels are
 ascribed to their respective authors. This <I>Greek</I> Gospel was from the
 first received by the Church as an integral part of the one quadriform
 <I>Gospel.</I> And while the Fathers often advert to the two Gospels which
 we have from apostles, and the two which we have from men not
 apostles--in order to show that as that of Mark leans so entirely on
 Peter, and that of Luke on Paul, these are really no less apostolical
 than the other two--though we attach less weight to this circumstance
 than they did, we cannot but think it striking that, in thus speaking,
 they never drop a hint that the full apostolic authority of the <I>Greek</I>
 Matthew had ever been questioned on the ground of its not being the
 <I>original.</I> Further, not a trace can be discovered in this Gospel itself
 of its being a translation. M<FONT SIZE=-1>ICHAELIS</FONT>
 tried to detect, and fancied that
 he had succeeded in detecting, one or two such. Other Germans since,
 and D<FONT SIZE=-1>AVIDSON</FONT> and
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>URETON</FONT> among ourselves, have made the same attempt.
 But the entire failure of all such attempts is now generally admitted,
 and candid advocates of a <I>Hebrew</I> original are quite ready to own that
 none such are to be found, and that but for external testimony no one
 would have imagined that the <I>Greek</I> was not the original. This they
 regard as showing how perfectly the translation has been executed; but
 those who know best what translating from one language into another is
 will be the readiest to own that this is tantamount to giving up the
 question. This Gospel proclaims its own originality in a number of
 striking points; such as its manner of quoting from the Old Testament,
 and its phraseology in some peculiar cases. But the close
 <I>verbal coincidences</I> of our <I>Greek</I> Matthew with the next two Gospels
 must not be quite passed over. There are but two possible ways of
 explaining this. Either the translator, sacrificing verbal fidelity in
 his version, intentionally conformed certain parts of his author's work
 to the second and third Gospels--in which case it can hardly be called
 Matthew's Gospel at all--or our <I>Greek</I> Matthew is itself the
 original.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moved by these considerations, some advocates of a <I>Hebrew</I> original
 have adopted the theory of <I>a double original;</I> the external testimony,
 they think, requiring us to believe in a <I>Hebrew</I> original, while
 internal evidence is decisive in favor of the originality of the <I>Greek.</I>
 This theory is espoused by G<FONT SIZE=-1>UERICKS</FONT>,
 O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT>,
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HIERSCH</FONT>,
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>OWNSON</FONT>,
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>REGELLES</FONT>, &c. But, besides that this looks too like an artificial
 theory, invented to solve a difficulty, it is utterly void of
 historical support. There is not a vestige of testimony to support it
 in Christian antiquity. This ought to be decisive against it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It remains, then, that our <I>Greek</I> Matthew is the original of that
 Gospel, and that no other original ever existed. It is greatly to the
 credit of Dean A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>, that after maintaining, in the first edition of
 his <I>Greek Testament</I> the theory of a <I>Hebrew</I> original, he thus
 expresses himself in the second and subsequent editions: "On the whole,
 then, I find myself constrained to abandon the view maintained in my
 first edition, and to adopt that of a Greek original."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 One argument has been adduced on the other side, on which not a little 
 reliance has been placed; but the determination of the main question 
 does not, in our opinion, depend upon the point which it raises. It has 
 been very confidently affirmed that the <I>Greek</I> language was not 
 sufficiently understood by the Jews of Palestine when Matthew published 
 his Gospel to make it at all probable that he would write a Gospel, for 
 their benefit in the first instance, in that language. Now, as this 
 merely alleges the improbability of a <I>Greek</I> original, it is 
 enough to place against it the evidence already adduced, which is 
 positive, in favor of the sole originality of our <I>Greek</I> Matthew. 
 It is indeed a question how far the <I>Greek</I> language was 
 understood in Palestine at the time referred to. But we advise the 
 reader not to be drawn into that question as essential to the 
 settlement of the other one. It is an element in it, no doubt, but not 
 an essential element.  There are extremes on both sides of it. The old 
 idea, that our Lord hardly ever spoke anything but 
 <I>Syro-Chaldaic,</I> is now pretty nearly exploded. Many, however, 
 will not go the length, on the other side, of H<FONT SIZE=-1>UG</FONT> 
 (in his <I>Introduction to the New Testament,</I> pp. 326, &c.) and 
 R<FONT SIZE=-1>OBERTS</FONT> ("Discussions of the Gospels," &c., pp. 
 25, &c.). For ourselves, though we believe that our Lord, in all the 
 more public scenes of His ministry, spoke in <I>Greek,</I> all we think 
 it necessary here to say is that there is no ground to believe that 
 <I>Greek</I> was so little understood in Palestine as to make it 
 improbable that Matthew would write his Gospel exclusively in that 
 language--so improbable as to outweigh the evidence that he did so. And 
 when we think of the number of digests or short narratives of the 
 principal facts of our Lord's history which we know from Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:1-4">Lu 1:1-4</A>)

 were floating about for some time before he wrote his Gospel, of which 
 he speaks by no means disrespectfully, and nearly all of which would be 
 in the mother tongue, we can have no doubt that the Jewish Christians 
 and the Jews of Palestine generally would have from the first reliable 
 written matter sufficient to supply every necessary requirement until 
 the publican-apostle should leisurely draw up the first of the four 
 Gospels in a language to them not a strange tongue, while to the rest 
 of the world it was <I>the</I> language in which the entire quadriform 
 Gospel was to be for all time enshrined. The following among others 
 hold to this view of the sole originality of the <I>Greek</I> Matthew: 
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>RASMUS</FONT>, C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>, B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>EZA</FONT>, L<FONT SIZE=-1>IGHTFOOT</FONT>, W<FONT

 SIZE=-1>AIRBAIRN</FONT>, R<FONT SIZE=-1>OBERTS</FONT>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 On two other questions regarding this Gospel it would have been
 desirable to say something, had not our available space been already
 exhausted: The <I>characteristics,</I> both in language and matter, by which
 it is distinguished from the other three, and its
 <I>relation to the second and third Gospels.</I> On the latter of these
 topics--whether one or more of the Evangelists made use of the
 materials of the other Gospels, and, if so, which of the Evangelists
 drew from which--the opinions are just as numerous as the possibilities
 of the case, every conceivable way of it having one or more who plead
 for it. The most popular opinion until recently--and perhaps the most
 popular still--is that the second Evangelist availed himself more or
 less of the materials of the first Gospel, and the third of the
 materials of both the first and second Gospels. Here we can but state
 our own belief, that each of the first three Evangelists wrote
 independently of both the others; while the fourth, familiar with the
 first three, wrote to supplement them, and, even where he travels along
 the same line, wrote quite independently of them. This judgment we
 express, with all deference for those who think otherwise, as the
 result of a close study of each of the Gospels in immediate
 juxtaposition and comparison with the others. On the former of the two
 topics noticed, the linguistic peculiarities of each of the Gospels
 have been handled most closely and ably by C<FONT SIZE=-1>REDNER</FONT>
 [<I>Einleitung</I> (<I>Introduction to the New Testament</I>)], of whose
 results a good summary
 will be found in D<FONT SIZE=-1>AVIDSON'S</FONT>
 <I>Introduction to the New Testament.</I> The
 other peculiarities of the Gospels have been most felicitously and
 beautifully brought out by
 D<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT>
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>OSTA</FONT> in his <I>Four Witnesses,</I> to which
 we must simply refer the reader, though it contains a few things in
 which we cannot concur.</P>

 was never used by others till after His ascension and the formation of

 so David was the <I>last.</I> To a Jewish reader, accordingly, these 
 behooved to be the two great starting-points of any true genealogy of 
 the promised Messiah; and thus this opening verse, as it stamps the 
 first Gospel as one peculiarly Jewish, would at once tend to conciliate 
 the writer's people. From the nearest of those two fathers came that 
 familiar name of the promised Messiah, "the son of David"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:41">Lu 20:41</A>),

 the present genealogy--herein differing from that given by Luke--comes
 well from him who styles himself in his list of the Twelve, what none of
 the other lists do, "Matthew <I>the publican</I>"; as if thereby to hold
 forth, at the very outset, the unsearchable riches of that grace which
 could not only fetch in "them that are afar off," but teach down even to
 "publicans and harlots," and raise them to "sit with the princes of his
 people." David is here twice emphatically styled "David the king," as
 not only the first of that royal line from which Messiah was to descend,
 but the one king of all that line from which the throne that Messiah was
 to occupy took its name--"the throne of David." The angel Gabriel, in
 announcing Him to His virgin-mother, calls it "the throne of David His
 father," sinking all the intermediate kings of that line, as having no
 importance save as links to connect the first and the last king of
 Israel as father and son. It will be observed that Rachab is here

 last chain, as it is impossible to conceive that the Evangelist could 
 have made any mistake in the matter. But there is a simpler way of 
 accounting for it. As the Evangelist himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:17">Mt 1:17</A>)

 reckons David twice--as the last of the first fourteen and the first of

 who was coeval with the "carrying away into captivity"

 "Mary, thy wife." Betrothal was, in Jewish law, valid marriage. In 
 giving Mary up, therefore, Joseph had to take legal steps to effect the 
 separation.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example</B>--to

 in presence of only two or three witnesses, and without cause assigned, 
 instead of having her before a magistrate. That some communication had 
 passed between him and his betrothed, directly or indirectly, on the
 subject, after she returned from her three months' visit to Elizabeth,
 can hardly be doubted. Nor does the purpose to divorce her necessarily
 imply disbelief, on Joseph's part, of the explanation given him. Even
 supposing him to have yielded to it some reverential assent--and the
 Evangelist seems to convey as much, by ascribing the proposal to screen 
 her to the <I>justice</I> of his character--he might think it 
 altogether unsuitable and incongruous in such circumstances to follow

 how to do it in the way least offensive--at the last extremity the Lord
 Himself interposes.

 <B>behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying,

 which was to follow.

 It lay about six miles southwest of Jerusalem. But how came Joseph and 
 Mary to remove thither from Nazareth, the place of their residence? Not 
 of their own accord, and certainly not with the view of fulfilling the 
 prophecy regarding Messiah's birthplace; nay, they stayed at Nazareth 
 till it was almost too late for Mary to travel with safety; nor would 
 they have stirred from it at all, had not an order which left them no 
 choice forced them to the appointed place. A high hand was in all these

 a sign that Messiah was now at hand. As Herod is known to have died in 
 the year of Rome 750, in the fourth year before the commencement of our

 Doubtless these simple strangers expected all Jerusalem to be full of 
 its new-born King, and the time, place, and circumstances of His birth 
 to be familiar to every one. Little would they think that the first 
 announcement of His birth would come from themselves, and still less 
 could they anticipate the startling, instead of transporting, effect 
 which it would produce--else they would probably have sought their 
 information regarding His birthplace in some other quarter. But God 
 overruled it to draw forth a noble testimony to the predicted 
 birthplace of Messiah from the highest ecclesiastical authority in the 
 nation.</P>

 <B>4. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the
 people together</B>--The class of the "chief priests" included the high
 priest for the time being, together with all who had previously filled
 this office; for though the then head of the Aaronic family was the only
 rightful high priest, the Romans removed them at pleasure, to make way
 for creatures of their own. In this class probably were included also
 the heads of the four and twenty courses of the priests. The "scribes"
 were at first merely transcribers of the law and synagogue readers;
 afterwards interpreters of the law, both civil and religious, and so
 both lawyers and divines. The first of these classes, a proportion of
 the second, and "the elders"--that is, as
 L<FONT SIZE=-1>IGHTFOOT</FONT> thinks, "those
 elders of the laity that were not of the Levitical tribe"--constituted
 the supreme council of the nation, called the <I>Sanhedrim,</I> the members
 of which, at their full complement, numbered seventy-two. That this was
 the council which Herod now convened is most probable, from the
 solemnity of the occasion; for though the elders are not mentioned, we
 find a similar omission where all three were certainly meant (compare

 agrees substantially with the <I>Hebrew</I> and the <I>Septuagint.</I> 
 For says the prophet, "Though thou be little, yet out of thee shall 
 come the Ruler"--this honor more than compensating for its natural 
 insignificance; while our Evangelist, by a lively turn, makes him say,
 "Thou art <I>not the least:</I> for out of thee shall come a 
 Governor"--this distinction lifting it from the lowest to the highest 
 rank. The "thousands of Juda," in the prophet, mean the subordinate 
 divisions of the tribe: our Evangelist, instead of these, merely names 
 the "princes" or heads of these families, including the districts which 
 they occupied.

 <B>7. Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men</B>--Herod has so
 far succeeded in his murderous design: he has tracked the spot where
 lies his victim, an unconscious babe. But he has another point to
 fix--the date of His birth--without which he might still miss his mark.
 The one he had got from the Sanhedrim; the other he will have from the
 sages; but secretly, lest his object should be suspected and defeated.
 So he

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>inquired of them diligently</B>--rather, "precisely."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>what time the star appeared</B>--presuming that this would be the best
 clue to the age of the child. The unsuspecting strangers tell him all.
 And now he thinks he is succeeding to a wish, and shall speedily clutch
 his victim; for at so early an age as they indicate, He would not likely
 have been removed from the place of His birth. Yet he is wary. He sends
 them as messengers from himself, and bids them come to <I>him,</I> that he
 may follow their pious example.</P>

 could tell Herod where Christ should be born, and could hear of these
 strangers from the far East that the Desire of all nations had actually
 come; but I do not see you trooping to Bethlehem--I find these devout
 strangers journeying thither all alone. Yet God ordered this too, lest
 the news should be blabbed, and reach the tyrant's ears, before the Babe
 could be placed beyond his reach. Thus are the very errors and crimes
 and cold indifferences of men all overruled.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east</B>--implying apparently that
 it had disappeared in the interval.

 mentioned first, then the mother; but Joseph, though doubtless present,
 is not noticed, as being but the head of the house.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and fell down and worshipped him</B>--Clearly this was no civil homage to
 a petty Jewish king, whom these star-guided strangers came so far, and
 inquired so eagerly, and rejoiced with such exceeding joy, to pay, but a
 lofty spiritual homage. The next clause confirms this.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and when they had opened their treasures they presented</B>--rather,
 "offered."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>unto him gifts</B>--This expression, used frequently in the Old Testament
 of the oblations presented to God, is in the New Testament employed
 seven times, and always in <I>a religious</I> sense of <I>offerings to God.</I>
 Beyond doubt, therefore, we are to understand the presentation of these
 gifts by the Magi as <I>a religious offering.</I>

 "Frankincense" was an aromatic used in sacrificial offerings; "myrrh"
 was used in perfuming ointments. These, with the "gold" which they 
 presented, seem to show that the offerers were persons in affluent 
 circumstances. That the gold was presented to the infant King in token 
 of His royalty; the frankincense in token of His divinity, and the 
 myrrh, of His sufferings; or that they were designed to express His 
 divine and human natures; or that the prophetical, priestly, and kingly 
 offices of Christ are to be seen in these gifts; or that they were the 
 offerings of three individuals respectively, each of them kings, the 
 very names of whom tradition has handed down--all these are, at the 
 best, precarious suppositions. But that the feelings of these devout 
 givers are to be seen in the richness of their gifts, and that the 
 gold, at least, would be highly serviceable to the parents of the 
 blessed Babe in their unexpected journey to Egypt and stay there--that 
 much at least admits of no dispute.</P>

 and convenient refuge. Ah! blessed Saviour, on what a checkered career

 How early does she taste the reception which this mysterious Child of 
 hers is to meet with in the world! And whither is He sent? To "the

 <B>Out of Egypt have I called my son</B>--Our Evangelist here quotes directly
 from the <I>Hebrew,</I> warily departing from the <I>Septuagint,</I> which
 renders the words, "From Egypt have I recalled his children," meaning
 Israel's children. The prophet is reminding his people how dear Israel
 was to God in the days of his youth; how Moses was bidden to say to
 Pharaoh, "Thus saith the Lord, Israel is My <I>son,</I> My first-born; and
 I say unto thee, Let <I>My</I> son go, that he may serve Me; and if thou
 refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay <I>thy</I> son, even thy
 first-born" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:22,23">Ex 4:22, 23</A>);

 how, when Pharaoh refused, God having slain all <I>his</I> first-born, 
 "called His own son out of Egypt," by a stroke of high-handed power and 
 love. Viewing the words in this light, even if our Evangelist had not 
 applied them to the recall from Egypt of God's own beloved, 
 Only-begotten Son, the application would have been irresistibly made by 
 all who have learnt to pierce beneath the surface to the deeper 
 relations which Christ bears to His people, and both to God; and who 
 are accustomed to trace the analogy of God's treatment of each 
 respectively.</P>

 they not sped?" so Herod wonders that his messengers, with pious zeal,
 are not hastening with the news that all is ready to receive him as a
 worshipper. What can be keeping them? Have they missed their way? Has
 any disaster befallen them? At length his patience is exhausted. He
 makes his inquiries and finds they are already far beyond his reach on
 their way home.

 of a Higher than they. He that sitteth in the heavens doth laugh at
 thee; the Lord hath thee in derision. He disappointeth the devices of
 the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise. He

 Bitter satire!

 <B>was exceeding wroth</B>--To be made a fool of is what none like, and proud
 kings cannot stand. Herod burns with rage and is like a wild bull in a
 net. So he

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>sent forth</B>--a band of hired murderers.

 <B>that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof</B>--environs.

 <B>from two years old and under, according to the time which he had
 diligently</B>--carefully.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>inquired of the wise men</B>--In this ferocious step Herod was like
 himself--as crafty as cruel. He takes a large sweep, not to miss his
 mark. He thinks this will surely embrace his victim. And so it had, if
 He had been there. But He is gone. Heaven and earth shall sooner pass
 away than thou shalt have that Babe into thy hands. Therefore, Herod,
 thou must be content to want Him: to fill up the cup of thy bitter
 mortifications, already full enough--until thou die not less of a broken
 heart than of a loathsome and excruciating disease. Why, ask skeptics
 and skeptical critics, is not this massacre, if it really occurred,
 recorded by J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>, who is minute enough in detailing the cruelties of
 Herod? To this the answer is not difficult. If we consider how small a
 town Bethlehem was, it is not likely there would be many male children
 in it from two years old and under; and when we think of the number of
 fouler atrocities which J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>

 to make anything of his silence on this.</P>

 be Himself the Ram, caught in another sort of thicket, in order that 
 your babes may escape a worse doom than they now endure. And if these

 expressly warned not to settle there, nor to Galilee, for he only went
 thither when he found it unsafe to settle in Judea but to "the land of

 after ten years' defiance of the Jewish law and cruel tyranny, the

 our Lord had never been at Nazareth until now. Did we know exactly the 
 sources from which the matter of each of the Gospels was drawn up, or 
 the mode in which these were used, this apparent discrepancy would 
 probably disappear at once. In neither case is there any inaccuracy. At 
 the same time it is difficult, with these facts before us, to conceive 
 that either of these two Evangelists wrote his Gospel with that of the 
 other before him--though many think this a precarious inference.

 <B>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall
 be called a Nazarene</B>--better, perhaps, "Nazarene." The best explanation
 of the origin of this name appears to be that which traces it to the
 word <I>netzer</I> in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:1">Isa 11:1</A>

 --the small <I>twig, sprout,</I> or <I>sucker,</I> which the prophet 
 there says, "shall come forth from the stem (or rather, 'stump') of 
 Jesse, the branch which should fructify from his roots." The little 
 town of Nazareth, mentioned neither in the Old Testament nor in J<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>, was probably so called from its insignificance: 
 a weak twig in contrast to a stately tree; and a special contempt 
 seemed to rest upon it--"Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:46">Joh 1:46</A>)

 --over and above the general contempt in which all Galilee was held, 
 from the number of Gentiles that settled in the upper territories of 
 it, and, in the estimation of the Jews, debased it.  Thus, in the 
 providential arrangement by which our Lord was brought up at the 
 insignificant and opprobrious town called <I>Nazareth,</I> there was 
 involved, first, a local humiliation; next, an allusion to Isaiah's 
 prediction of His lowly, twig-like upspringing from the branchless, 
 dried-up stump of Jesse; and yet further, a standing memorial of that 
 humiliation which "the prophets," in a number of the most striking 
 predictions, had attached to the Messiah.</P>

 peculiar recommendation of his Gospel, that "he had traced down all
 things with precision from the very first"

 chapter left Him.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>came John the Baptist, preaching</B>--about six months before his Master.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>in the wilderness of Judea</B>--the desert valley of the Jordan, thinly
 peopled and bare in pasture, a little north of Jerusalem.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt3_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. And saying, Repent ye</B>--Though the word strictly denotes a
 <I>change of mind,</I> it has respect here (and wherever it is used in
 connection with salvation) primarily to that <I>sense of sin</I> which
 leads the sinner to flee from the wrath to come, to look for relief only
 from above, and eagerly to fall in with the provided remedy.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for the kingdom of heaven is at hand</B>--This sublime phrase, used in
 none of the other Gospels, occurs in this peculiarly Jewish Gospel
 nearly thirty times; and being suggested by Daniel's grand vision of the
 Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven to the Ancient of days, to
 receive His investiture in a world-wide kingdom 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:13,14">Da 7:13, 14</A>),

 it was fitted at once both to meet the national expectations and to 
 turn them into the right channel. A kingdom for which <I>repentance</I> 
 was the proper preparation behooved to be essentially spiritual. 
 Deliverance from sin, the great blessing of Christ's kingdom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:21">Mt 1:21</A>),

 can be valued by those only to whom sin is a burden

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:12">Mt 9:12</A>).

 John's great work, accordingly, was to awaken this feeling and hold out 
 the hope of a speedy and precious remedy.</P>

 the scene of his ministry corresponding to its rough nature.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight</B>--This
 prediction is quoted in all the four Gospels, showing that it was
 regarded as a great outstanding one, and the predicted forerunner as the
 connecting link between the old and the new economies. Like the great
 ones of the earth, the Prince of peace was to have His immediate
 approach proclaimed and His way prepared; and the call here--taking it
 generally--is a call to put out of the way whatever would obstruct His
 progress and hinder His complete triumph, whether those hindrances were
 public or personal, outward or inward. In Luke 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:5,6">Lu 3:5, 6</A>)

 the quotation is thus continued: "Every valley shall be filled, and 
 every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be 
 made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth; and all flesh 
 shall see the salvation of God." Levelling and smoothing are here the 
 obvious figures whose sense is conveyed in the first words of the 
 proclamation--"<I>Prepare ye the way of the Lord.</I>" The idea is that 
 every obstruction shall be so removed as to reveal to the whole world 
 the salvation of God in Him whose name is the "Saviour." (Compare

 need of deliverance from sin, of their expectation of the coming
 Deliverer, and of their readiness to welcome Him when He appeared. The
 baptism itself startled, and was intended to startle, them. They were
 familiar enough with the <I>baptism of proselytes</I> from heathenism; but
 this <I>baptism of Jews</I> themselves was quite new and strange to them.</P>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>O generation of vipers</B>--"Viper brood," expressing the deadly influence
 of both sects alike upon the community. Mutually and entirely
 antagonistic as were their religious principles and spirit, the stern
 prophet charges both alike with being the poisoners of the nation's
 religious principles. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:34,23:33">Mt 12:34; 23:33</A>,

 this strong language of the Baptist is anew applied by the faithful and
 true Witness to the Pharisees specifically--the only party that had 
 zeal enough actively to diffuse this poison.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>who hath warned you</B>--given you the hint, as the idea is.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>to flee from the wrath to come?</B>--"What can have brought <I>you</I>
 hither?" John more than suspected it was not so much their own spiritual
 anxieties as the popularity of his movement that had drawn them thither.
 What an expression is this, "The wrath to come!" God's "wrath," in
 Scripture, is His righteous displeasure against sin, and consequently
 against all in whose skirts sin is found, arising out of the essential
 and eternal opposition of His nature to all moral evil. This is called
 "the <I>coming</I> wrath," not as being wholly future--for as a merited
 sentence it lies on the sinner already, and its effects, both inward and
 outward, are to some extent experienced even now--but because the
 impenitent sinner will not, until "the judgment of the great day," be
 concluded under it, will not have sentence publicly and irrevocably
 passed upon him, will not have it discharged upon him and experience its
 effects without mixture and without hope. In this view of it, it is a
 wrath <I>wholly</I> to come, as is implied in the noticeably different form
 of the expression employed by the apostle in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:10">1Th 1:10</A>.

 Not that even true penitents came to John's baptism with all these 
 views of "the wrath to come." But what he says is that this was the 
 <I>real import of the step itself.</I> In this view of it, how striking 
 is the word he employs to express that step--<I>fleeing</I> from it--as 
 of one who, beholding a tide of fiery wrath rolling rapidly towards 
 him, sees in instant flight his only escape!</P>

 <A NAME="Mt3_8"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>8. Bring forth therefore fruits</B>--the true reading clearly is "fruit";

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>meet for repentance</B>--that is, such fruit as <I>befits</I> a true penitent.
 John now being gifted with a knowledge of the human heart, like a true
 minister of righteousness and lover of souls here directs them how to
 evidence and carry out their repentance, supposing it genuine; and in
 the following verses warns them of their danger in case it were not.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt3_9"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>9. And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our
 father</B>--that pillow on which the nation so fatally reposed, that
 rock on which at length it split.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up
 children unto Abraham</B>--that is, "Flatter not yourselves with the
 fond delusion that God stands in need of you, to make good His promise
 of a seed to Abraham; for I tell you that, though you were all to
 perish, God is as able to raise up a seed to Abraham out of those stones
 as He was to take Abraham himself out of the rock whence he was hewn,
 out of the hole of the pit whence he was digged" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:1">Isa 51:1</A>).

 Though the stern speaker may have pointed as he spoke to the pebbles of
 the bare clay hills that lay around (so S<FONT SIZE=-1>TANLEY'S</FONT> 
 <I>Sinai and Palestine</I>), it was clearly the calling of the 
 <I>Gentiles</I>--at that time stone-dead in their sins, and quite as
 unconscious of it--into the room of unbelieving and disinherited Israel 
 that he meant thus to indicate (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:43,Ro+11:20,30">Mt 21:43;

 <B>the axe is laid unto</B>--"lieth at."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the root of the trees</B>--as it were ready to strike: an expressive
 figure of impending judgment, only to be averted in the way next
 described.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,
 and cast into the fire</B>--Language so personal and individual as this
 can scarcely be understood of any national judgment like the approaching
 destruction of Jerusalem, with the breaking up of the Jewish polity and
 the extrusion of the chosen people from their peculiar privileges which
 followed it; though this would serve as the dark shadow, cast before, of
 a more terrible retribution to come. The "fire," which in another verse
 is called "unquenchable," can be no other than that future "torment" of
 the impenitent whose "smoke ascendeth up for ever and ever," and which
 by the Judge Himself is styled "everlasting punishment" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:46">Mt 25:46</A>).
 What a strength, too, of just indignation is in that word "cast" or
 "flung into the fire!"</P>

 of all others, "that shall baptize you."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>with the Holy Ghost</B>--"So far from entertaining such a thought as laying
 claim to the honors of Messiahship, the meanest services I can render to
 that 'Mightier than I that is coming after me' are too high an honor for
 me; I am but the servant, but the Master is coming; I administer but the
 outward symbol of purification; His it is, as His sole prerogative, to
 dispense the inward reality." Beautiful spirit, distinguishing this
 servant of Christ throughout!

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and with fire</B>--To take this as a distinct baptism from that of the
 Spirit--a baptism of the impenitent with hell-fire--is exceedingly
 unnatural. Yet this was the view of O<FONT SIZE=-1>RIGEN</FONT>
 among the Fathers; and among
 moderns, of N<FONT SIZE=-1>EANDER</FONT>,
 M<FONT SIZE=-1>EYER</FONT>,
 D<FONT SIZE=-1>E</FONT>
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>ETTE</FONT>, and
 L<FONT SIZE=-1>ANGE</FONT>. Nor is it much better
 to refer it to the fire of the great day, by which the earth and the
 works that are therein shall be burned up. Clearly, as we think, it is
 but the <I>fiery</I> character of the Spirit's operations upon the
 soul--searching, consuming, refining, sublimating--as nearly all good
 interpreters understand the words. And thus, in two successive clauses,
 the two most familiar emblems--<I>water</I> and <I>fire</I>--are employed to
 set forth the same purifying operations of the Holy Ghost upon the soul.</P>

 separate the solid from the spiritually worthless, as wheat, by the
 winnowing fan, from the chaff. (Compare the similar representation in

 contradiction of figures:--to be burnt up, but with a fire that is
 unquenchable; the one expressing the <I>utter destruction</I> of all that

 <B>13. Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized
 of him</B>--Moses rashly anticipated the divine call to deliver his
 people, and for this was fain to flee the house of bondage, and wait in
 obscurity for forty years more 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:11">Ex 2:11</A>,

 &c.). Not so this greater than Moses. All but thirty years had He now 
 spent in privacy at Nazareth, gradually ripening for His public work, 
 and calmly awaiting the time appointed of the Father. Now it had 
 arrived; and this movement from Galilee to Jordan is the step, 
 doubtless, of deepest interest to all heaven since that first one which 
 brought Him into the world. Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:21">Lu 3:21</A>)

 has this important addition--"Now <I>when all the people were 
 baptized,</I> it came to pass, that Jesus being baptized," 
 &c.--implying that Jesus waited till all other applicants for baptism 
 that day had been disposed of, ere He stepped forward, that He might 
 not seem to be merely one of the crowd. Thus, as He rode into Jerusalem 
 upon an ass "whereon yet never man sat"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:30">Lu 19:30</A>),

 and lay in a sepulchre "wherein was never man yet laid"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:41">Joh 19:41</A>),
 
 so in His baptism, too. He would be "separate from sinners."</P>

 <A NAME="Mt3_14"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>14. But John forbade him</B>--rather, "was (in the act of) hindering
 him," or "attempting to hinder him."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to
 me?</B>--(How John came to recognize Him, when he says he knew Him not, 
 see on

 <A HREF="JFB43.HTM#Joh1_31">John 1. 31-34</A>.)

 The emphasis of this most remarkable speech lies all in the pronouns:
 "What! Shall the Master come for baptism to the servant--the sinless 
 Saviour to a sinner?" That thus much is in the Baptist's words will be 
 clearly seen if it be observed that he evidently regarded Jesus as 
 <I>Himself needing no purification</I> but rather <I>qualified to 
 impart it to those who did.</I> And do not all his other testimonies to 
 Christ fully bear out this sense of the words? But it were a pity if, 
 in the glory of this testimony to Christ, we should miss the beautiful 
 spirit in which it was borne--"Lord, must <I>I</I> baptize <I>Thee?</I> 
 Can I bring myself to do such a thing?"--reminding us of Peter's 
 exclamation at the supper table, "Lord, dost Thou wash my feet?" while 
 it has nothing of the false humility and presumption which dictated 
 Peter's next speech. "Thou shalt never wash my feet"

 <B>15. And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now</B>--"Let
 it pass for the present"; that is, "Thou recoilest, and no wonder, for
 the seeming incongruity is startling; but in the present case do as thou
 art bidden."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for thus it becometh us</B>--"us," not in the sense of "me and

 <B>to fulfil all righteousness</B>--If this be rendered, with S<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>CRIVENER</FONT>, "every ordinance," or, with C<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>AMPBELL</FONT>, "every institution," the meaning is obvious 
 enough; and the same sense is brought out by "all righteousness," or 
 compliance with everything enjoined, baptism included. Indeed, if this 
 be the meaning, our version perhaps best brings out the force of the 
 opening word "Thus." But we incline to think that our Lord meant more 
 than this. The import of circumcision and of baptism seems to be 
 radically the same. And if our remarks on the circumcision of our Lord 
 (see on

 <A HREF="JFB42.htm#Lu2_21">Lu 2:21-24</A>)

 are well founded, He would seem to have said, "Thus do I impledge 
 Myself to the whole righteousness of the Law--thus symbolically do 
 enter on and engage to fulfil it all." Let the thoughtful reader weigh 
 this.

 <B>16. And Jesus when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the
 water</B>--rather, "from the water." Mark has "out of the water"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:10">Mr 1:10</A>).

 "and"--adds Luke 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:21">Lu 3:21</A>),

 "while He was praying"; a grand piece of information. Can there be a
 doubt about the burden of that prayer; a prayer sent up, probably,
 while yet in the water--His blessed head suffused with the baptismal
 element; a prayer continued likely as He stepped out of the stream, and
 again stood upon the dry ground; the work before Him, the needed and
 expected Spirit to rest upon Him for it, and the glory He would then 
 put upon the Father that sent Him--would not these fill His breast, and 
 find silent vent in such form as this?--"Lo, I come; I delight to do 
 Thy will, O God. Father, glorify Thy name. Show Me a token for good. 
 Let the Spirit of the Lord God come upon Me, and I will preach the 
 Gospel to the poor, and heal the broken-hearted, and send forth 
 judgment unto victory." While He was yet speaking--

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>lo, the heavens were opened</B>--Mark says, sublimely, "He saw the heavens
 cleaving" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:10">Mr 1:10</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and he saw the Spirit of God descending</B>--that is, He only, with the
 exception of His honored servant, as he tells us himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:32-34">Joh 1:32-34</A>);
 
 the by-standers apparently seeing nothing.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>like a dove, and lighting upon him</B>--Luke says, "in a bodily shape"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:22">Lu 3:22</A>);

 that is, the blessed Spirit, assuming the corporeal form of a dove, 
 descended thus upon His sacred head. But why in this form?  The 
 Scripture use of this emblem will be our best guide here. "My dove, 
 <I>my undefiled</I> is one," says the Song of Solomon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:9">So 6:9</A>).

 This is chaste purity. Again, "Be ye <I>harmless</I> as doves," says 
 Christ Himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:16">Mt 10:16</A>).

 This is the same thing, in the form of inoffensiveness towards men. "A 
 conscience void of offense toward God and toward men"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:16">Ac 24:16</A>)

 expresses both. Further, when we read in the Song of Solomon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:14">So 2:14</A>),

 "O my dove, that art in the <I>clefts</I> of the rocks, in the 
 <I>secret places</I> of the stairs (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:8">Isa 60:8</A>),

 let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy 
 voice, and thy countenance is comely"--it is shrinking modesty, 
 meekness, gentleness, that is thus charmingly depicted. In a word--not 
 to allude to the historical emblem of the dove that flew back to the 
 ark, bearing in its mouth the olive leaf of <I>peace</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:11">Ge 8:11</A>)
 
 --when we read 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:13">Ps 68:13</A>),

 "Ye shall be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her 
 feathers with yellow gold," it is <I>beauteousness</I> that is thus 
 held forth. And was not such that "holy, harmless, undefiled One," the 
 "separate from sinners?" "Thou art fairer than the children of men; 
 grace is poured into Thy lips; therefore God hath blessed Thee for 
 ever!" But the fourth Gospel gives us one more piece of information 
 here, on the authority of one who saw and testified of it: "John bare 
 record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, 
 and <FONT SIZE=-1>IT ABODE UPON</FONT> H<FONT SIZE=-1>IM.</FONT>" And 
 lest we should think that this was an accidental thing, he adds that 
 this last particular was expressly given him as part of the sign by 
 which he was to recognize and identify Him as the Son of God: "And I 
 knew Him not: but He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said 
 unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>AND REMAINING ON</FONT> H<FONT SIZE=-1>IM,</FONT> the same is 
 He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. And I saw and bare record that 
 this is the Son of God"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:32-34">Joh 1:32-34</A>).

 And when with this we compare the predicted descent of the Spirit upon 
 Messiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:2">Isa 11:2</A>),

 "And <I>the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him,</I>" we cannot 
 doubt that it was this permanent and perfect resting of the Holy Ghost 
 upon the Son of God--now and henceforward in His <I>official</I> 
 capacity--that was here visibly manifested.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt3_17"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>17. And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is</B>--Mark and Luke give
 it in the direct form, "Thou art."

 Lu 3:22</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased</B>--The verb is put in the
 aorist to express absolute complacency, once and for ever felt towards
 Him. The English here, at least to modern ears, is scarcely strong
 enough. "I delight" comes the nearest, perhaps, to that ineffable
 <I>complacency</I> which is manifestly intended; and this is the rather to
 be preferred, as it would immediately carry the thoughts back to that
 august Messianic prophecy to which the voice from heaven plainly alluded

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1">Isa 42:1</A>),

 "Behold My Servant, whom I uphold; Mine Elect, <FONT SIZE=-1>IN 
 WHOM</FONT> M<FONT SIZE=-1>Y SOUL DELIGHTETH.</FONT>" Nor are the words 
 which follow to be overlooked, "I have put My Spirit upon Him; He shall 
 bring forth judgment to the Gentiles." (The <I>Septuagint</I> perverts 
 this, as it does most of the Messianic predictions, interpolating the 
 word "Jacob," and applying it to the Jews). Was this voice heard by the 
 by-standers? From Matthew's form of it, one might suppose it so 
 designed; but it would appear that it was not, and probably John only 
 heard and saw anything peculiar about that great baptism. Accordingly, 
 the words, "Hear ye Him," are not added, as at the Transfiguration.</P>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:12">Mr 1:12</A>)

 fixes what we should have presumed was meant, that it was "immediately"
 after His baptism; and with this agrees the statement of Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:1">Lu 4:1</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>was Jesus led up</B>--that is, from the low Jordan valley to some more
 elevated spot.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>of the Spirit</B>--that blessed Spirit immediately before spoken of as
 descending upon Him at His baptism, and abiding upon Him. Luke,
 connecting these two scenes, as if the one were but the sequel of the
 other, says, "Jesus, being full of the Holy Ghost, returned from Jordan,
 and was led," &c. Mark's expression has a startling sharpness about
 it--"Immediately the Spirit driveth Him" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:12">Mr 1:12</A>),

 "putteth," or "hurrieth Him forth," or "impelleth Him." (See the same
 word in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:43,5:40,Mt+9:25,13:52,Joh+10:4">Mr 1:43; 5:40;
 Mt 9:25; 13:52; 
 Joh 10:4</A>). 

 The thought thus strongly expressed is the mighty constraining impulse
 of the Spirit under which He went; while Matthew's more gentle 
 expression, "was led up," intimates how purely voluntary on His own 
 part this action was.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>into the wilderness</B>--probably the wild Judean desert. The particular
 spot which tradition has fixed upon has hence got the name of
 <I>Quarantana</I> or <I>Quarantaria,</I> from the forty days--"an almost
 perpendicular wall of rock twelve or fifteen hundred feet above the
 plain" [R<FONT SIZE=-1>OBINSON</FONT>, <I>Palestine</I>]. The supposition of those who incline
 to place the temptation amongst the mountains of Moab is, we think, very
 improbable.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>to be tempted</B>--The <I>Greek</I> word (<I>peirazein</I>) means simply to
 <I>try</I> or make proof of; and when ascribed to God in His dealings with
 men, it means, and can mean no more than this. Thus,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:1">Ge 22:1</A>,

 "It came to pass that God did tempt Abraham," or put his faith to a 
 severe proof. (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:2">De 8:2</A>).

 But for the most part in Scripture the word is used in a bad sense, and 
 means to entice, solicit, or provoke to sin.  Hence the name here given 
 to the wicked one--"the tempter"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:3">Mt 4:3</A>).
 
 Accordingly "to be tempted" here is to be understood both ways. The
 Spirit conducted Him into the wilderness simply to have His faith
 <I>tried;</I> but as the agent in this trial was to be the wicked one, whose
 whole object would be to seduce Him from His allegiance to God, it was a
 <I>temptation</I> in the bad sense of the term. The unworthy inference which
 some would draw from this is energetically repelled by an apostle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:13-17">Jas 1:13-17</A>).

 imputations upon another. Hence that other name given him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:10">Re 12:10</A>),

 "The accuser of the brethren, who accuseth them before our God day and 
 night." Mark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:13">Mr 1:13</A>)

 says, "He was forty days tempted of <I>Satan,</I>" a word signifying an
 <I>adversary,</I> one who lies in wait for, or sets himself in 
 opposition to another. These and other names of the same fallen spirit 
 point to different features in his character or operations. What was 
 the high design of this? First, as we judge, to give our Lord a taste 
 of what lay before Him in the work He had undertaken; next, to make 
 trial of the glorious equipment for it which He had just received; 
 further, to give Him encouragement, by the victory now to be won, to go 
 forward spoiling principalities and powers, until at length He should 
 make a show of them openly, triumphing over them in His cross: that the 
 tempter, too, might get a taste, at the very outset, of the new kind of 
 material in <I>man</I> which he would find he had here to deal with; 
 finally, that He might acquire experimental ability "to succor them 
 that are tempted"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:18">Heb 2:18</A>).

 The temptation evidently embraced two stages: the one continuing 
 throughout the forty days' fast; the other, at the conclusion of that 
 period.</P>

 <B>2. And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights</B>--Luke says
 "When they were quite ended" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:2">Lu 4:2</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he was afterward an hungered</B>--evidently implying that the sensation
 of hunger was unfelt during all the forty days; coming on only at their
 close. So it was apparently with Moses 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:28">Ex 34:28</A>)
 
 and Elijah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:8">1Ki 19:8</A>)

 for the same period. A supernatural power of endurance was of course 
 imparted to the body, but this probably operated through a natural 
 law--the absorption of the Redeemer's Spirit in the dread conflict with 
 the tempter.  (See on

 <A HREF="JFB44.htm#Ac9_9">Ac 9:9</A>). 

 Had we only this Gospel, we should suppose the temptation did not begin 
 till after this.  But it is clear, from Mark's statement, that "He was 
 in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:13">Mr 1:13</A>),

 and Luke's, "being forty days tempted of the devil"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:2">Lu 4:2</A>),

 that there was a forty days' temptation <I>before</I> the three 
 specific temptations afterwards recorded. And this is what we have 
 called the First Stage. What the precise nature and object of the forty 
 days' temptation were is not recorded. But two things seem plain 
 enough. First, the tempter had utterly failed of his object, else it 
 had not been renewed; and the terms in which he opens his second attack 
 imply as much. But further, the tempter's whole object during the forty 
 days evidently was to get Him to distrust the heavenly testimony borne 
 to Him at His baptism as
 <FONT SIZE=-1>THE</FONT>
 S<FONT SIZE=-1>ON OF</FONT>
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>OD</FONT>--to persuade Him to regard it as but a splendid
 illusion--and, generally, to dislodge from His breast the consciousness
 of His Sonship. With what plausibility the events of His previous
 history from the beginning would be urged upon Him in support of this
 temptation it is easy to imagine. And it makes much in support of this
 view of the forty days' temptation that the particulars of it are not
 recorded; for how the details of such a purely internal struggle could
 be recorded it is hard to see. If this be correct, how naturally does
 the S<FONT SIZE=-1>ECOND</FONT>
 S<FONT SIZE=-1>TAGE</FONT> of the temptation open! In Mark's brief notice of the
 temptation there is one expressive particular not given either by
 Matthew or by Luke--that "He was with the wild beasts" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:12">Mr 1:12</A>),

 no doubt to add terror to solitude, and aggravate the horrors of the
 whole scene.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt4_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. And when the tempter came to him</B>--Evidently we have here a new
 scene.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he said, if thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made
 bread</B>--rather, "loaves," answering to "stones" in the plural; whereas
 Luke, having said, "Command this stone," in the singular, adds, "that it
 be made bread," in the singular 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:3">Lu 4:3</A>).

 The sensation of hunger, unfelt during all the forty days, seems now to 
 have come on in all its keenness--no doubt to open a door to the 
 tempter, of which he is not slow to avail himself; "Thou still clingest 
 to that vainglorious confidence that Thou art the Son of God, carried 
 away by those illusory scenes at the Jordan. Thou wast born in a 
 stable; but Thou art the Son of God! hurried off to Egypt for fear of 
 Herod's wrath; but Thou art the Son of God! a carpenter's roof supplied 
 Thee with a home, and in the obscurity of a despicable town of Galilee 
 Thou hast spent thirty years, yet still Thou art the Son of God! and a 
 voice from heaven, it seems, proclaimed it in Thine ears at the Jordan! 
 Be it so; but after <I>that,</I> surely Thy days of obscurity and trial 
 should have an end. Why linger for weeks in this desert, wandering 
 among the wild beasts and craggy rocks, unhonored, unattended, 
 unpitied, ready to starve for want of the necessaries of life? Is this 
 befitting "the Son of God?" At the bidding of "the Son of God" surely 
 those stones shall all be turned into loaves, and in a moment present 
 an abundant repast."</P>

 <A NAME="Mt4_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4. But he answered and said, It is written</B>--

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:3">De 8:3</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Man shall not live by bread alone</B>--more emphatically, as in the
 <I>Greek,</I> "Not by bread alone shall man live."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God</B>--Of all
 passages in Old Testament Scripture, none could have been pitched upon
 more apposite, perhaps not one so apposite, to our Lord's purpose. "The
 Lord .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. led thee (said Moses to Israel, at the close of their
 journeyings) these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to
 prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep
 His commandments, or no. And He humbled thee, and suffered thee to
 hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy
 fathers know; that He might make thee know that man doth not live by
 bread only," &c., "Now, if Israel spent, not forty days, but forty
 years in a waste, howling wilderness, where there were no means of human
 subsistence, not starving, but divinely provided for, on purpose to
 prove to every age that human support depends not upon bread, but upon
 God's unfailing word of promise and pledge of all needful providential
 care, am I, distrusting this word of God, and despairing of relief, to
 take the law into My own hand? True, the Son of God is able enough to
 turn stones into bread: but what the Son of God is able to do is not the
 present question, but what is <I>man's duty</I> under want of the
 necessaries of life. And as Israel's condition in the wilderness did not
 justify their unbelieving murmurings and frequent desperation, so
 neither would Mine warrant the exercise of the power of the Son of God
 in snatching despairingly at unwarranted relief. As man, therefore, I
 will await divine supply, nothing doubting that at the fitting time it
 will arrive." The <I>second</I> temptation in this Gospel is in Luke's the
 <I>third.</I> That Matthew's order is the right one will appear, we think,
 quite clearly in the sequel.</P>

 Ne 11:1</A>) 

 from its being "the city of the Great King," the seat of the temple,
 the metropolis of all Jewish worship.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple</B>--rather, "the pinnacle"--a
 certain well-known projection. Whether this refers to the highest
 summit of the temple, which bristled with golden spikes
 [J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>, <I>Antiquities,</I> 5.5,6]; or whether it refers to another peak,
 on Herod's royal portico, overhanging the ravine of Kedron, at the
 valley of Hinnom--an immense tower built on the very edge of this
 precipice, from the top of which dizzy height
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT> says one could
 not look to the bottom [<I>Antiquities,</I> 15.11,5]--is not certain; but
 the latter is probably meant.</P>

 <B>6. And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God</B>--As this temptation
 starts with the same point as the first--our Lord's determination not to
 be disputed out of His Sonship--it seems to us clear that the one came
 directly after the other; and as the remaining temptation shows that the
 hope of carrying that point was abandoned, and all was staked upon a
 desperate venture, we think that remaining temptation is thus shown to
 be the last; as will appear still more when we come to it.

 "But what is this I see?" exclaims stately B<FONT SIZE=-1>ISHOP</FONT> 
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ALL</FONT>. "Satan himself with a Bible under his arm

 of God's Word in the former temptation, was eager to try the effect of 
 it from his own mouth

 stone</B>--The quotation is, precisely as it stands in the <I>Hebrew</I> and
 the <I>Septuagint,</I> save that after the first clause the words, "to keep
 thee in all thy ways," are here omitted. Not a few good expositors have
 thought that this omission was intentional, to conceal the fact that
 this would <I>not</I> have been one of "His ways," that is, of duty. But as
 our Lord's reply makes no allusion to this, but seizes on the great
 principle involved in the promise quoted, so when we look at the promise
 itself, it is plain that the sense of it is precisely the same whether
 the clause in question be inserted or not.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt4_7"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>7. Jesus said unto him, It is written again</B>--

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:16">De 6:16</A>),

 as if he should say, "True, it is so written, and on that promise I 
 implicitly rely; but in using it there is another Scripture which must 
 not be forgotten."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God</B>--"Preservation in danger is
 divinely pledged: shall I then <I>create</I> danger, either to put the
 promised security skeptically to the proof, or wantonly to demand a
 display of it? That were 'to tempt the Lord my God,' which, being
 expressly forbidden, would forfeit the right to expect preservation."</P>

 <A NAME="Mt4_8"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>8. Again, the devil taketh him up</B>--"conducteth him," as before.

 <B>an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the
 world, and the glory of them</B>--Luke 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:5">Lu 4:5</A>)

 adds the important clause, "in a moment of time"; a clause which seems 
 to furnish a key to the true meaning. That a scene was presented to our 
 Lord's natural eye seems plainly expressed. But to limit this to the 
 most extensive scene which the natural eye could take in, is to give a 
 sense to the expression, "all the kingdoms of the world," quite 
 violent. It remains, then, to gather from the expression, "in a moment 
 of time"-- which manifestly is intended to intimate some supernatural 
 operation--that it was permitted to the tempter to extend 
 preternaturally for a moment our Lord's range of vision, and throw a 
 "glory" or glitter over the scene of vision: a thing not inconsistent 
 with the analogy of other scriptural statements regarding the permitted 
 operations of the wicked one. In this case, the "exceeding height" of 
 the "mountain" from which this sight was beheld would favor the effect 
 to be produced.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt4_9"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>9. And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee</B>--"and the
 glory of them," adds Luke 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:6">Lu 4:6</A>).

 But Matthew having already said that this was "showed Him," did not 
 need to repeat it here. Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:6">Lu 4:6</A>)

 adds these other very important clauses, here omitted--"for that is," 
 or "has been," "delivered unto me, and to whomsoever I will I give it." 
 Was this wholly false? That were not like Satan's unusual policy, which 
 is to insinuate his lies under cover of some truth. What truth, then, 
 is there here? We answer, Is not Satan thrice called by our Lord 
 Himself, "the prince of this world"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:31,14:30,16:11">Joh 12:31; 14:30; 16:11</A>)?
 
 Does not the apostle call him "the god of this world"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:4">2Co 4:4</A>)?

 And still further, is it not said that Christ came to destroy by His 
 death "him that <I>hath the power of death,</I> that is, the devil"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:14">Heb 2:14</A>)?
 
 No doubt these passages only express men's voluntary subjection to the
 rule of the wicked one while they live, and his power to surround death
 to them, when it comes, with all the terrors of the wages of sin. But
 as this is a real and terrible sway, so all Scripture represents men as
 righteously sold under it. In this sense he speaks what is not devoid of
 truth, when he says, "All this is delivered unto me." But how does he
 deliver this "to whomsoever he will?" As employing whomsoever he pleases
 of his willing subjects in keeping men under his power. In this case his
 offer to our Lord was that of a <I>deputed</I> supremacy commensurate with
 his own, though as <I>his gift</I> and for <I>his ends.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>if thou wilt fall down and worship me</B>--This was the sole but monstrous
 condition. No Scripture, it will be observed, is quoted now, because
 none could be found to support so blasphemous a claim. In fact, he has
 ceased now to present his temptations under the mask of piety, and he
 stands out unblushingly as the rival of God Himself in his claims on the
 homage of men. Despairing of success as an angel of light, he throws off
 all disguise, and with a splendid bribe solicits divine honor. This
 again shows that we are now at the last of the temptations, and that
 Matthew's order is the true one.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt4_10"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>10. Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan</B>--Since the tempter
 has now thrown off the mask, and stands forth in his true character, our
 Lord no longer deals with him as a pretended friend and pious
 counsellor, but calls him by his right name--His knowledge of which from
 the outset He had carefully concealed till now--and orders him off. This
 is the final and conclusive evidence, as we think, that Matthew's must
 be the right order of the temptations. For who can well conceive of the
 tempter's returning to the assault after this, in the pious character
 again, and hoping still to dislodge the consciousness of His Sonship,
 while our Lord must in that case be supposed to quote Scripture to one
 He had called the devil to his face--thus throwing His pearls before
 worse than swine?

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for it is written</B>--

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:13">De 6:13</A>).

 Thus does our Lord part with Satan on the rock of Scripture.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Thou shalt worship</B>--In the <I>Hebrew</I> and the <I>Septuagint</I> it is,
 "Thou shalt <I>fear</I>"; but as the sense is the same, so "worship" is
 here used to show emphatically that what the tempter claimed was
 precisely what God had forbidden.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve</B>--The word "serve" in
 the second clause, is one never used by the <I>Septuagint</I> of any but
 <I>religious</I> service; and in this sense exclusively is it used in the
 New Testament, as we find it here. Once more the word "only," in the
 second clause--not expressed in the <I>Hebrew</I> and the <I>Septuagint</I>--is
 here added to bring out emphatically the <I>negative</I> and <I>prohibitory</I>
 feature of the command. (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:10">Ga 3:10</A>

 exhausted"--or "quite ended," as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:2">Lu 4:2</A>

 --"every (mode of) temptation, he departed from him till a season." The 
 definite "season" here indicated is expressly referred to by our Lord 
 in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:30,Lu+22:52,53">Joh 14:30

 <B>and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him</B>--or supplied Him with
 food, as the same expression means in

 Thus did angels to Elijah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:5-8">1Ki 19:5-8</A>).

 Excellent critics think that they ministered, not food only, but 
 supernatural support and cheer also. But this would be the natural 
 <I>effect</I> rather than the direct <I>object</I> of the visit, which 
 was plainly what we have expressed. And after having refused to claim 
 the <I>illegitimate</I> ministration of angels in His behalf, oh, with 
 what deep joy would He accept their services when sent, unasked, at the 
 close of all this temptation, direct from Him whom He had so gloriously 
 honored! What "angels' food" would this repast be to Him! and as He 
 partook of it, might not a Voice from heaven be heard again, by any who 
 could read the Father's mind, "Said I not well, This is my beloved Son, 
 in whom I am well pleased?"</P>

 <I>There is here a notable gap in the history,</I> which but for the fourth
 Gospel we should never have discovered. From the former Gospels we
 should have been apt to draw three inferences, which from the fourth one
 we know to be erroneous: First, that our Lord awaited the close of
 John's ministry, by his arrest and imprisonment, before beginning His
 own; next, that there was but a brief interval between the baptism of
 our Lord and the imprisonment of John; and further, that our Lord not
 only opened His work in Galilee, but never ministered out of it, and
 never visited Jerusalem at all nor kept a passover till He went thither
 to become "our Passover, sacrificed for us." The fourth Gospel alone
 gives the true succession of events; not only recording those important
 openings of our Lord's public work which preceded the Baptist's
 imprisonment--extending to the end of the third chapter--but so
 specifying the passover which occurred during our Lord's ministry as to
 enable us to line off, with a large measure of certainty, the events of
 the first three Gospels according to the successive passovers which they
 embraced. E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>, the ecclesiastical historian, who, early in the
 fourth century, gave much attention to this subject, in noticing these
 features of the Evangelical Records, says
 [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 3.24] that John wrote his Gospel at the
 entreaty of those who knew the important materials he possessed, and
 filled up what is wanting in the first three Gospels. Why it was
 reserved for the fourth Gospel, published at so late a period, to supply
 such important particulars in the life of Christ, it is not easy to
 conjecture with any probability. It may be, that though not
 unacquainted with the general facts, they were not furnished with
 reliable details. But one thing may be affirmed with tolerable
 certainty, that as our Lord's teaching at Jerusalem was of a depth and
 grandeur scarcely so well adapted to the prevailing character of the
 first three Gospels, but altogether congenial to the fourth; and as the
 bare mention of the successive passovers, without any account of the
 transactions and discourses they gave rise to, would have served little
 purpose in the first three Gospels, there may have been no way of
 preserving the unity and consistency of each Gospel, so as to furnish by
 means of them all the precious information we get from them, save by the
 plan on which they are actually constructed.</P>

 <B>13. And leaving Nazareth</B>--The prevalent opinion is that this refers
 to a <I>first</I> visit to Nazareth after His baptism, whose details are
 given by Luke 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:16">Lu 4:16</A>,

 &c.); a <I>second</I> visit being that detailed by our Evangelist

 and by Mark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:1-6">Mr 6:1-6</A>).

 But to us there seem all but insuperable difficulties in the
 supposition of two visits to Nazareth after His baptism; and on the 
 grounds stated in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:16">Lu 4:16</A>,

 &c., we think that the <I>one only visit</I> to Nazareth is that 
 recorded by Matthew

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:53-58">Mt 13:53-58</A>),

 Mark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:1-6">Mr 6:1-6</A>),

 and Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:14-30">Lu 4:14-30</A>).
 
 But how, in that case, are we to take the word
 
 "<I>leaving</I> Nazareth" here? We answer, just as the same word is used in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:3">Ac 21:3</A>,

 "Now when we had sighted Cyprus, and <I>left</I> it on the left, we 
 sailed into Syria,"--that is, without entering Cyprus at all, but 
 merely "sighting" it, as the nautical phrase is, they steered southeast 
 of it, leaving it on the northwest. So here, what we understand the 
 Evangelist to say is, that Jesus, on His return to Galilee, did not, as 
 might have been expected, make Nazareth the place of His stated 
 residence, but, "leaving [or passing by] Nazareth,"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the 
 seacoast</B>--maritime Capernaum, on the northwest shore of the Sea of 
 Galilee; but the precise spot is unknown.  (See on

 <A HREF="#Mt11_23">Mt 11:23</A>). 

 Our Lord seems to have chosen it for several reasons. Four or five of 
 the Twelve lived there; it had a considerable and mixed population, 
 securing some freedom from that intense bigotry which even to this day 
 characterizes all places where Jews in large numbers dwell nearly 
 alone; it was centrical, so that not only on the approach of the annual 
 festivals did large numbers pass through it or near it, but on any 
 occasion multitudes could easily be collected about it; and for 
 crossing and recrossing the lake, which our Lord had so often occasion 
 to do, no place could be more convenient.  But one other high reason 
 for the choice of Capernaum remains to be mentioned, the only one 
 specified by our Evangelist.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim</B>--the one lying to the west
 of the Sea of Galilee, the other to the north of it; but the precise
 boundaries cannot now be traced out.</P>

 the sea</B>--the coast skirting the Sea of Galilee westward--beyond
 Jordan--a phrase commonly meaning eastward of Jordan; but here and in
 several places it means westward of the Jordan. The word seems to have
 got the general meaning of "the other side"; the nature of the case
 determining which side that was.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Galilee of the Gentiles</B>--so called from its position, which made 
 it the frontier between the Holy Land and the external world. While 
 Ephraim and Judah, as S<FONT SIZE=-1>TANLEY</FONT> says, were separated 
 from the world by the Jordan valley on one side and the hostile 
 Philistines on another, the northern tribes were in the direct highway 
 of all the invaders from the north, in unbroken communication with the 
 promiscuous races who have always occupied the heights of Lebanon, and 
 in close and peaceful alliance with the most commercial nation of the 
 ancient world, the Ph&oelig;nicians. Twenty of the cities of Galilee 
 were actually annexed by Solomon to the adjacent kingdom of Tyre, and 
 formed, with their territory, the "boundary" or "offscouring" 
 (<I>Gebul</I> or <I>Cabul</I>) of the two dominions--at a later time 
 still known by the general name of "the boundaries (coasts or borders) 
 of Tyre and Sidon." In the first great transportation of the Jewish 
 population, Naphtali and Galilee suffered the same fate as the 
 trans-jordanic tribes before Ephraim or Judah had been molested

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:29">2Ki 15:29</A>).

 In the time of the Christian era this original disadvantage of their
 position was still felt; the speech of the Galileans "bewrayed them" by 
 its uncouth pronunciation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:73">Mt 26:73</A>);
 
 and their distance from the seats of government and civilization at
 Jerusalem and C&aelig;sarea gave them their character for turbulence or
 independence, according as it was viewed by their friends or their
 enemies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>16. The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which
 sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up</B>--The prophetic
 strain to which these words belong commences with the seventh chapter of
 Isaiah, to which the sixth chapter is introductory, and goes down to the
 end of the twelfth chapter, which hymns the spirit of that whole strain
 of prophecy. It belongs to the reign of Ahaz and turns upon the combined
 efforts of the two neighboring kingdoms of Syria and Israel to crush
 Judah. In these critical circumstances Judah and her king were, by
 their ungodliness, provoking the Lord to sell them into the hands of
 their enemies. What, then, is the burden of this prophetic strain, on to
 the passage here quoted? First, Judah shall not, cannot perish, because
 I<FONT SIZE=-1>MMANUEL,</FONT> the Virgin's Son, is to come forth from his loins. Next, one
 of the invaders shall soon perish, and the kingdoms of neither be
 enlarged. Further, while the Lord will be the Sanctuary of such as
 confide in these promises and await their fulfilment, He will drive to
 confusion, darkness, and despair the vast multitude of the nation who
 despised His oracles, and, in their anxiety and distress, betook
 themselves to the lying oracles of the heathen. This carries us down to
 the end of the eighth chapter. At the opening of the ninth chapter a
 sudden light is seen breaking in upon one particular part of the
 country, the part which was to suffer most in these wars and
 devastations--"the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, the way of
 the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee and the Gentiles." The rest of the
 prophecy stretches over both the Assyrian and the Chaldean captivities
 and terminates in the glorious Messianic prophecy of the eleventh
 chapter and the choral hymn of the twelfth chapter. Well, this is the
 point seized on by our Evangelist. By Messiah's taking up His abode in
 those very regions of Galilee, and shedding His glorious light upon
 them, this prediction, He says, of the Evangelical prophet was now
 fulfilled; and if it was not thus fulfilled, we may confidently affirm
 it was not fulfilled in any age of the Jewish ceremony, and has received
 no fulfilment at all. Even the most rationalistic critics have
 difficulty in explaining it in any other way.</P>

 Person and ministry; but the <I>economy</I> of it was only "at hand" until

 Was this the same calling as that recorded in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:35-42">Joh 1:35-42</A>?

 Clearly not. For, (1) That call was given while Jesus was yet in Judea: 
 this, after His return to Galilee. (2) Here, Christ calls Andrew: 
 there, Andrew solicits an interview with Christ. (3) Here, Andrew and 
 Peter are called together: there, Andrew having been called, with an 
 unnamed disciple, who was clearly the beloved disciple (see on

 <A HREF="JFB43.htm#Joh1_40">Joh 1:40</A>),
 
 goes and fetches Peter his brother to Christ, who then calls him. (4)
 Here, John is called along with James his brother: there, John is called
 along with Andrew, after having at their own request had an interview
 with Jesus; no mention being made of James, whose call, if it then took
 place, would not likely have been passed over by his own brother. Thus
 far nearly all are agreed. But on the <I>next</I> question opinion is
 divided: Was this the same calling as that recorded in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:1-11">Lu 5:1-11</A>?

 Many able critics think so. But the following considerations are to us 
 decisive against it. First here, the four are called separately, in 
 pairs: in Luke, all together. Next, in Luke, after a glorious miracle: 
 here, the one pair are casting their net, the other are mending theirs.  
 Further, here, our Lord had made no public appearance in Galilee, and 
 so had gathered none around Him; He is walking solitary by the shores 
 of the lake when He accosts the two pairs of fishermen: in Luke, the 
 multitude are pressing upon Him, and hearing the word of God, as He 
 stands by the Lake of Gennesaret--a state of things implying a somewhat 
 advanced stage of His early ministry, and some popular enthusiasm.

 were houses of local worship. It cannot be proved that they
 existed before the Babylonish captivity; but as they began to be erected
 soon after it, probably the idea was suggested by the religious
 inconveniences to which the captives had been subjected. In our Lord's
 time, the rule was to have one wherever ten learned men or professed
 students of the law resided; and they extended to Syria, Asia Minor,
 Greece, and most places of the dispersion. The larger towns had
 several, and in Jerusalem the number approached five hundred. In point
 of officers and mode of worship, the Christian congregations are
 modelled after the synagogue.

 containing ten cities, founded and chiefly inhabited by Greek settlers.

 Thus not only was all Palestine upheaved, but all the adjacent regions.

 give the reader some idea both of the vast concourse and of the varied 
 complexion of eager attendants upon the great Preacher, to whom the 
 astonishing discourse of the next three chapters was addressed. On the 
 importance which our Lord Himself attached to this first preaching 
 circuit, and the preparation which He made for it, see on

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:17-49">Lu 6:17-49</A>

 --only reported more fully by Matthew, and less fully, as well as with 
 considerable variation, by Luke--is the opinion of many very able 
 critics (of the Greek commentators; of C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>, 
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT>, M<FONT SIZE=-1>ALDONATUS</FONT>--Who 
 stands almost alone among Romish commentators; and of most moderns, as

 SIZE=-1>ISCHENDORF</FONT>, S<FONT SIZE=-1>TIER</FONT>, W<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>IESELER</FONT>, R<FONT SIZE=-1>OBINSON</FONT>). The prevailing 
 opinion of these critics is that Luke's is the original form of the 
 discourse, to which Matthew has added a number of sayings, uttered on 
 other occasions, in order to give at one view the great outlines of our 
 Lord's ethical teaching. But that they are <I>two distinct 
 discourses</I>--the one delivered about the close of His first 
 missionary tour, and the other after a second such tour and the solemn 
 choice of the Twelve--is the judgment of others who have given much 
 attention to such matters (of most Romish commentators, including 
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>RASMUS</FONT>; and among the moderns, of L<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ANGE</FONT>, G<FONT SIZE=-1>RESWELL</FONT>, B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>IRKS</FONT>, W<FONT SIZE=-1>EBSTER</FONT> and W<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ILKINSON</FONT>. The question is left undecided by A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>).  A<FONT SIZE=-1>UGUSTINE'S</FONT> opinion--that 
 they were both delivered on one occasion, Matthew's on the mountain, 
 and to the disciples; Luke's in the plain, and to the promiscuous 
 multitude--is so clumsy and artificial as hardly to deserve notice. To 
 us the weight of argument appears to lie with those who think them two 
 separate discourses. It seems hard to conceive that Matthew should have 
 put this discourse before his own calling, if it was not uttered till 
 long after, and was spoken in his own hearing as one of the newly 
 chosen Twelve. Add to this, that Matthew introduces his discourse 
 amidst very definite markings of time, which fix it to our Lord's first 
 preaching tour; while that of Luke, which is expressly said to have 
 been delivered immediately after the choice of the Twelve, could not 
 have been spoken till long after the time noted by Matthew. It is hard, 
 too, to see how either discourse can well be regarded as the expansion 
 or contraction of the other. And as it is beyond dispute that our Lord 
 repeated some of His weightier sayings in different forms, and with 
 varied applications, it ought not to surprise us that, after the lapse 
 of perhaps a year--when, having spent a whole night on the hill in 
 prayer to God, and set the Twelve apart, He found Himself surrounded by 
 crowds of people, few of whom probably had heard the Sermon on the 
 Mount, and fewer still remembered much of it--He should go over its 
 principal points again, with just as much sameness as to show their 
 enduring gravity, but at the same time with that difference which shows 
 His exhaustless fertility as the great Prophet of the Church.</P>

 smaller band of devoted adherents. Though the latter only answered to
 the subjects of His kingdom, described in this discourse, there were

 <B>3. Blessed</B>--Of the two words which our translators render "blessed,"
 the one here used points more to what is <I>inward,</I> and so might be
 rendered "happy," in a lofty sense; while the other denotes rather what
 comes to us <I>from without</I> (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:34">Mt 25:34</A>).

 But the distinction is not always clearly carried out. One 
 <I>Hebrew</I> word expresses both. On these precious Beatitudes, 
 observe that though eight in number, there are here but <I>seven</I> 
 distinct features of character. The eighth one--the "persecuted for 
 righteousness' sake"--denotes merely the possessors of the seven 
 preceding features, on account of which it is that they are persecuted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:12">2Ti 3:12</A>).

 Accordingly, instead of any distinct promise to this class, we have 
 merely a repetition of the first promise. This has been noticed by 
 several critics, who by the <I>sevenfold</I> character thus set forth 
 have rightly observed that a <I>complete</I> character is meant to be 
 depicted, and by the <I>sevenfold</I> blessedness attached to it, a 
 <I>perfect</I> blessedness is intended.  Observe, again, that the 
 language in which these Beatitudes are couched is purposely fetched 
 from the Old Testament, to show that the new kingdom is but the old in 
 a new form; while the characters described are but the varied forms of 
 that <I>spirituality</I> which was the essence of real religion all 
 along, but had well-nigh disappeared under corrupt teaching. Further, 
 the things here promised, far from being mere arbitrary rewards, will 
 be found in each case to grow out of the characters to which they are 
 attached, and in their completed form are but the appropriate 
 coronation of them. Once more, as "the kingdom of heaven," which is the 
 first and the last thing here promised, has two stages--a present and a 
 future, an initial and a consummate stage--so the fulfilment of each of 
 these promises has two stages--a present and a future, a partial and a 
 perfect stage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. Blessed are the poor in spirit</B>--All familiar with Old Testament
 phraseology know how frequently God's true people are styled "the poor"
 (the "oppressed," "afflicted," "miserable") or "the needy"--or both
 together (as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:17,Isa+41:17">Ps 40:17;
 Isa 41:17</A>). 

 The explanation of this lies in the fact that it is generally "the poor
 of this world" who are "rich in faith"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:5">Jas 2:5</A>;
 
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:10,Re+2:9">2Co 6:10;
 Re 2:9</A>); 

 while it is often "the ungodly" who "prosper in the world"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:12">Ps 73:12</A>).
 
 Accordingly, in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:20,21">Lu 6:20, 21</A>,

 it seems to be this class--the literally "poor" and "hungry"--that are
 specially addressed. But since God's people are in so many places 
 styled "the poor" and "the needy," with no evident reference to their 
 temporal circumstances (as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:10,69:29-33,132:15,Isa+61:1,66:2">Ps 68:10; 69:29-33; 132:15;
 Isa 61:1; 66:2</A>), 

 it is plainly a <I>frame of mind</I> which those terms are meant to
 express. Accordingly, our translators sometimes render such words "the 
 humble"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:12,17">Ps 10:12, 17</A>),
 
 "the meek" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:26">Ps 22:26</A>),
 
 "the lowly" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:34">Pr 3:34</A>),

 as having no reference to outward circumstances. But here the 
 explanatory words, "in spirit," fix the sense to "those who in their 
 deepest consciousness realize their entire need" (compare the 
 <I>Greek</I> of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:21,Joh+11:33,13:21,Ac+20:22,Ro+12:11,1Co+5:3,Php+3:3">Lu 10:21;
 Joh 11:33; 13:21; 
 Ac 20:22; 
 Ro 12:11; 
 1Co 5:3; 
 Php 3:3</A>). 

 This self-emptying conviction, that "before God we are void of
 everything," lies at the foundation of all spiritual excellence, 
 according to the teaching of Scripture. Without it we are inaccessible 
 to the riches of Christ; with it we are in the fitting state for 
 receiving all spiritual supplies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:17,18,Mt+9:12,13">Re 3:17, 18;
 Mt 9:12, 13</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for theirs is the kingdom of heaven</B>--(See on

 <A HREF="#Mt3_2">Mt 3:2</A>). 

 The poor in spirit not only shall have--they already have--the kingdom. 
 The very sense of their poverty is begun riches. While others "walk in 
 a vain show"--"in a shadow," "an image"--in an unreal world, taking a 
 false view of themselves and all around them--the poor in spirit are 
 rich in the knowledge of their real case. Having courage to look this 
 in the face, and own it guilelessly, they feel strong in the assurance 
 that "unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:4">Ps 112:4</A>);
 
 and soon it breaks forth as the morning. God wants nothing from us as
 the price of His saving gifts; we have but to feel our universal
 destitution, and cast ourselves upon His compassion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:27,28,1Jo+1:9">Job 33:27, 28;
 1Jo 1:9</A>). 

 So the poor in spirit are enriched with the fulness of Christ, which is
 the kingdom in substance; and when He shall say to them from His great 
 white throne, "Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom 
 <I>prepared for you,</I>" He will invite them merely to the full 
 enjoyment of an already possessed inheritance.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt5_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4. Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted</B>--This
 "mourning" must not be taken loosely for that feeling which is wrung
 from men under pressure of the ills of life, nor yet strictly for sorrow
 on account of committed sins. Evidently it is that entire feeling which
 the sense of our spiritual poverty begets; and so the second beatitude
 is but the complement of the first. The one is the intellectual, the
 other the emotional aspect of the same thing. It is poverty of spirit
 that says, "I am undone"; and it is the mourning which this causes that
 makes it break forth in the form of a lamentation--"Woe is me! for I am
 undone." Hence this class are termed "mourners <I>in Zion,</I>" or, as we
 might express it, religious mourners, in sharp contrast with all other
 sorts 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:1-3,66:2">Isa 61:1-3; 66:2</A>).

 Religion, according to the Bible, is neither a set of intellectual
 convictions nor a bundle of emotional feelings, but a compound of both, 
 the former giving birth to the latter.  Thus closely do the first two 
 beatitudes cohere. The mourners shall be "comforted." Even now they get 
 beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise 
 for the spirit of heaviness. Sowing in tears, they reap even here in 
 joy. Still, all present comfort, even the best, is partial, 
 interrupted, short-lived. But the days of our mourning shall soon be 
 ended, and then God shall wipe away all tears from our eyes. Then, in 
 the fullest sense, shall the mourners be "comforted."</P>

 <A NAME="Mt5_5"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>5. Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth</B>--This 
 promise to the meek is but a repetition of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:11">Ps 37:11</A>;

 only the word which our Evangelist renders "the meek," after the 
 <I>Septuagint,</I> is the same which we have found so often translated 
 "the poor," showing how closely allied these two features of character 
 are. It is impossible, indeed, that "the poor in spirit" and "the 
 mourners" in Zion should not at the same time be "meek"; that is to 
 say, persons of a lowly and gentle carriage. How fitting, at least, it 
 is that they should be so, may be seen by the following touching 
 appeal: "Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, 
 to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work, to speak evil of 
 no man, to be no brawlers, <I>but gentle, showing all meekness unto all 
 men:</I> <FONT SIZE=-1>FOR WE OURSELVES WERE ONCE FOOLISH,</FONT> 
 disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures 
 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour 
 toward man appeared: .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. according to His mercy He saved
 us," &c.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:1-7">Tit 3:1-7</A>).

 But He who had no such affecting reasons for manifesting this beautiful 
 carriage, said, nevertheless, of Himself, "Take My yoke upon you, and 
 learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest 
 unto your souls"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:29">Mt 11:29</A>);

 and the apostle besought one of the churches by "the meekness and 
 gentleness of Christ"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:1">2Co 10:1</A>).

 In what esteem this is held by Him who seeth not as man seeth, we may 
 learn from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:4">1Pe 3:4</A>,

 where the true adorning is said to be that of "a meek and quiet spirit, 
 which in the sight of God is of great price." Towards men this 
 disposition is the opposite of high-mindedness, and a quarrelsome and 
 revengeful spirit; it "rather takes wrong, and suffers itself to be 
 defrauded"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:7">1Co 6:7</A>);

 it "avenges not itself, but rather gives place unto wrath"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:19">Ro 12:19</A>);

 like the meek One, "when reviled, it reviles not again; when it 
 suffers, it threatens not: but commits itself to Him that judgeth 
 righteously"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:19-22">1Pe 2:19-22</A>).

 "The earth" which the meek are to inherit might be rendered "the 
 land"--bringing out the more immediate reference to Canaan as the 
 promised land, the secure possession of which was to the Old Testament 
 saints the evidence and manifestation of God's favor resting on them, 
 and the ideal of all true and abiding blessedness. Even in the Psalm 
 from which these words are taken the promise to the meek is not held 
 forth as an arbitrary reward, but as having a kind of natural 
 fulfilment. When they delight themselves in the Lord, He gives them the 
 desires of their heart: when they commit their way to Him, He brings it 
 to pass; bringing forth their righteousness as the light, and their 
 judgment as the noonday: the little that they have, even when despoiled 
 of their rights, is better than the riches of many wicked

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:1-24">Ps 37:1-24</A>).

 All things, in short, are theirs--in the possession of that favor which 
 is life, and of those rights which belong to them as the children of 
 God--whether the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things 
 to come; all are theirs

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:21,22">1Co 3:21, 22</A>);

 and at length, overcoming, they "inherit all things"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:7">Re 21:7</A>).

 Thus are the meek the only rightful occupants of a foot of ground or a 
 crust of bread here, and heirs of all coming things.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt5_6"> </A>

 <B>6. Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness:
 for they shall be filled</B>--"shall be saturated." "From this verse,"
 says T<FONT SIZE=-1>HOLUCK</FONT>, "the reference to the Old Testament background ceases."
 Surprising! On the contrary, none of these beatitudes is more manifestly
 dug out of the rich mine of the Old Testament. Indeed, how could any one
 who found in the Old Testament "the poor in spirit," and "the mourners
 in Zion," doubt that he would also find those same characters also
 <I>craving</I> that righteousness which they feel and mourn their want of?
 But what is the precise meaning of "righteousness" here? Lutheran
 expositors, and some of our own, seem to have a hankering after that
 more restricted sense of the term in which it is used with reference to
 the sinner's justification before God. (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:6,Isa+45:24,Ro+4:6,2Co+5:21">Jer 23:6;
 Isa 45:24; 
 Ro 4:6; 
 2Co 5:21</A>). 

 But, in so comprehensive a saying as this, it is clearly to be
 taken--as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:10">Mt 5:10</A>

 also--in a much wider sense, as denoting that spiritual and entire
 conformity to the law of God, under the want of which the saints groan, 
 and the possession of which constitutes the only true saintship. The 
 Old Testament dwells much on this righteousness, as that which alone 
 God regards with approbation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:7,23:3,106:3,Pr+12:28,16:31,Isa+64:5">Ps 11:7; 23:3; 106:3;
 Pr 12:28; 16:31; 
 Isa 64:5</A>,

 &c.). As hunger and thirst are the keenest of our appetites, our Lord,
 by employing this figure here, plainly means "those whose deepest 
 cravings are after spiritual blessings." And in the Old Testament we 
 find this craving variously expressed: "Hearken unto Me, ye that follow 
 after righteousness, ye that seek the Lord"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:1">Isa 51:1</A>);

 "I have waited for Thy salvation, O Lord," exclaimed dying Jacob

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:18">Ge 49:18</A>);

 "My soul," says the sweet Psalmist, "breaketh for the longing that it 
 hath unto Thy judgments at all times"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:20">Ps 119:20</A>):

 and in similar breathings does he give vent to his deepest longings in 
 that and other Psalms. Well, our Lord just takes up here--this blessed 
 frame of mind, representing it as--the surest pledge of the coveted 
 supplies, as it is the best preparative, and indeed itself the 
 beginning of them. "They shall be saturated," He says; they shall not 
 only have what they so highly value and long to possess, but they shall 
 have their fill of it.  Not here, however. Even in the Old Testament 
 this was well understood.  "Deliver me," says the Psalmist, in language 
 which, beyond all doubt, stretches beyond the present scene, "from men 
 of the world, which have their portion in this life: as for me, I shall 
 behold Thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, 
 with Thy likeness"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:13-15">Ps 17:13-15</A>).

 The foregoing beatitudes--the first four--represent the saints rather 
 as <I>conscious of their need of salvation,</I> and acting suitably to 
 that character, than as possessed of it. The next three are of a 
 different kind--representing the saints as <I>having now found 
 salvation,</I> and conducting themselves accordingly.</P>

 <B>7. Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy</B>--Beautiful
 is the connection between this and the preceding beatitude. The one has
 a natural tendency to beget the other. As for the words, they seem
 directly fetched from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:25">Ps 18:25</A>,

 "With the merciful Thou wilt show Thyself merciful." Not that our 
 mercifulness comes absolutely first. On the contrary, our Lord Himself 
 expressly teaches us that God's method is to awaken in us compassion 
 towards our fellow men by His own exercise of it, in so stupendous a 
 way and measure, towards ourselves. In the parable of the unmerciful 
 debtor, the servant to whom his lord forgave ten thousand talents was 
 naturally expected to exercise the small measure of the same compassion 
 required for forgiving his fellow servant's debt of a hundred pence; 
 and it is only when, instead of this, he relentlessly imprisoned him 
 till he should pay it up, that his lord's indignation was roused, and 
 he who was designed for a vessel of mercy is treated as a vessel of 
 wrath

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:23-35">Mt 18:23-35</A>;
 
 and see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:23,24,6:15,Jam+2:13">Mt 5:23, 24; 6:15;
 Jas 2:13</A>). 

 "According to the view given in Scripture," says T<FONT
 SIZE=-1>RENCH</FONT> most justly, "the Christian stands in a middle
 point, between a mercy received and a mercy yet needed. Sometimes the
 first is urged upon him as an argument for showing mercy--'forgiving
 one another, as Christ forgave you'

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:13,Eph+4:32">Col 3:13;
 Eph 4:32</A>): 

 sometimes the last--'Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain
 mercy'; 'Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven'

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:37,Jam+5:9">Lu 6:37;
 Jas 5:9</A>). 

 And thus, while he is ever to look back on the mercy received as the
 source and motive of the mercy which he shows, he also looks forward to 
 the mercy which he yet needs, and which he is assured that the 
 merciful--according to what B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT> beautifully 
 calls the <I>benigna talio</I> ('the gracious requital') of the kingdom
 of God--shall receive, as a new provocation to its abundant exercise."
 The foretastes and beginnings of this judicial recompense are richly 
 experienced here below: its perfection is reserved for that day when, 
 from His great white throne, the King shall say, "Come, ye blessed of 
 My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of 
 the world; for I was an hungered, and thirsty, and a stranger, and 
 naked, and sick, and in prison, and ye ministered unto Me." Yes, thus 
 He acted towards us while on earth, even laying down His life for us; 
 and He will not, He cannot disown, in the merciful, the image of 
 Himself.</P>

 <B>8. Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God</B>--Here, too,
 we are on Old Testament ground. There the difference between outward and
 inward purity, and the acceptableness of the latter only in the sight of
 God, are everywhere taught. Nor is the "vision of God" strange to the
 Old Testament; and though it was an understood thing that this was not
 possible in the present life 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:20">Ex 33:20</A>;
 
 and compare

 yet spiritually it was known and felt to be the privilege of the saints
 even here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:24,6:9,17:1,48:15,Ps+27:4,36:9,63:2,Isa+38:3,11">Ge 5:24;

 Ps 27:4; 36:9; 63:2; 
 Isa 38:3, 11</A>, 

 &c.). But oh, with what grand simplicity, brevity, and power is this
 great fundamental truth here expressed! And in what striking contrast 
 would such teaching appear to that which was then current, in which 
 exclusive attention was paid to ceremonial purification and external 
 morality!  This heart purity begins in a "heart sprinkled from an evil 
 conscience," or a "conscience purged from dead works"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:22,9:14">Heb 10:22; 9:14</A>;
 
 and see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:9">Ac 15:9</A>);
 
 and this also is taught in the Old Testament

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:1,2">Ps 32:1, 2</A>;
 
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:5-8,Isa+6:5-8">Ro 4:5-8;
 Isa 6:5-8</A>). 

 The conscience thus purged--the heart thus sprinkled--there is light
 within wherewith to see God. "If we say that we have fellowship with
 Him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: but if we walk
 in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with the
 other"--He with us and we with Him--"and the blood of Jesus Christ His
 Son cleanseth us"--us who have this fellowship, and who, without such
 continual cleansing, would soon lose it again--"from all sin"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:6,7">1Jo 1:6, 7</A>).

 "Whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him, neither known Him"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:6">1Jo 3:6</A>);

 "He that doeth evil hath not seen God"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:11">3Jo 11</A>).

 The inward vision thus clarified, and the whole inner man in sympathy 
 with God, each looks upon the other with complacency and joy, and we 
 are "changed into the same image from glory to glory." But the full and 
 beatific vision of God is reserved for that time to which the Psalmist 
 stretches his views--"As for me, I shall behold Thy face in 
 righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Thy likeness"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:15">Ps 17:15</A>).

 Then shall His servants serve Him: and they shall see His face; and His 
 name shall be in their foreheads

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:3,4">Re 22:3, 4</A>).

 They shall see Him as He is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:2">1Jo 3:2</A>).

 But, says the apostle, expressing the converse of this 
 beatitude--"Follow holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:14">Heb 12:14</A>).</P>

 it.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for they shall be called the children of God</B>--shall be called sons
 of God. Of all these beatitudes this is the only one which could hardly
 be expected to find its definite ground in the Old Testament; for that
 most glorious character of God, the likeness of which appears in the
 peacemakers, had yet to be revealed. His glorious name, indeed--as "The
 Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant
 in goodness and truth, forgiving iniquity and transgression and
 sin"--had been proclaimed in a very imposing manner 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:6">Ex 34:6</A>),

 and manifested in action with affecting frequency and variety in the 
 long course of the ancient economy. And we have undeniable evidence 
 that the saints of that economy felt its transforming and ennobling 
 influence on their own character. But it was not till Christ "made 
 peace by the blood of the cross" that God could manifest Himself as 
 "the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, 
 that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting 
 covenant"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:20">Heb 13:20</A>)

 --could reveal Himself as "in Christ reconciling the world unto 
 Himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them," and hold Himself 
 forth in the astonishing attitude of beseeching men to be "reconciled 
 to Himself"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:19,20">2Co 5:19, 20</A>).

 When this reconciliation actually takes place, and one has "peace with 
 God through our Lord Jesus Christ"--even "the peace of God which 
 passeth all understanding"--the peace-receivers become transformed into 
 peace-diffusers. God is thus seen reflected in them; and by the family 
 likeness these peacemakers are recognized as the children of God. In 
 now coming to the eighth, or supplementary beatitude, it will be seen 
 that all that the saints are <I>in themselves</I> has been already 
 described, in seven features of character; that number indicating 
 <I>completeness</I> of delineation. The last feature, accordingly, is a 
 passive one, representing the treatment that the characters already 
 described may expect from the world. He who shall one day fix the 
 destiny of all men here pronounces certain characters "blessed"; but He 
 ends by forewarning them that the world's estimation and treatment of 
 them will be the reserve of His.</P>

 <B>10. Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake,</B>
 &c.--How entirely this final beatitude has its ground in the Old
 Testament, is evident from the concluding words, where the encouragement
 held out to endure such persecutions consists in its being but a
 continuation of what was experienced by the Old Testament servants of
 God. But how, it may be asked, could such beautiful features of
 character provoke persecution? To this the following answers should
 suffice: "Every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to
 the light, lest his deeds should be reproved." "The world cannot hate
 you; but Me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof
 are evil." "If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but
 because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world,
 therefore the world hateth you." "There is yet one man (said wicked Ahab
 to good Jehoshaphat) by whom we may inquire of the Lord: but I hate him;
 for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:20,7:7,15:19,2Ch+18:7">Joh 3:20; 7:7; 15:19;
 2Ch 18:7</A>). 

 But more particularly, the seven characters here described are all in
 the teeth of the spirit of the world, insomuch that such hearers of 
 this discourse as breathed that spirit must have been startled, and had 
 their whole system of thought and action rudely dashed. Poverty of 
 spirit runs counter to the pride of men's heart; a pensive disposition, 
 in the view of one's universal deficiencies before God, is ill relished 
 by the callous, indifferent, laughing, self-satisfied world; a meek and 
 quiet spirit, taking wrong, is regarded as pusillanimous, and rasps 
 against the proud, resentful spirit of the world; that craving after 
 spiritual blessings rebukes but too unpleasantly the lust of the flesh, 
 the lust of the eye, and the pride of life; so does a merciful spirit 
 the hard-heartedness of the world; purity of heart contrasts painfully 
 with painted hypocrisy; and the peacemaker cannot easily be endured by 
 the contentious, quarrelsome world. Thus does "righteousness" come to 
 be "persecuted." But blessed are they who, in spite of this, dare to be 
 righteous.

 <B>and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you,
 falsely, for my sake</B>--Observe this. He had before said, "for
 righteousness' sake." Here He identifies Himself and His cause with that
 of righteousness, binding up the cause of righteousness in the world
 with the reception of Himself. Would Moses, or David, or Isaiah, or
 Paul have so expressed themselves? Never. Doubtless they suffered for
 righteousness' sake. But to have called this "their sake," would, as
 every one feels, have been very unbecoming. Whereas He that speaks,
 being Righteousness incarnate (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:24,Ac+3:14,Re+3:7">Mr 1:24;

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:22,23">Lu 6:22, 23</A>),

 where every indignity trying to flesh and blood is held forth as the 
 probable lot of such as were faithful to Him, the word is even stronger 
 than here: "leap," as if He would have their inward transport to 
 overpower and absorb the sense of all these affronts and sufferings; 
 nor will anything else do it.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets
 which were before you:</B>--that is, "You do but serve yourselves heirs to
 their character and sufferings, and the reward will be common."</P>

 <A NAME="Mt5_13"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>13-16.</B> We have here the practical application of the foregoing
 principles to those disciples who sat listening to them, and to their
 successors in all time. Our Lord, though He began by pronouncing certain
 <I>characters</I> to be blessed--without express reference to any of His
 hearers--does not close the beatitudes without intimating that such
 characters were in existence, and that already they were before Him.
 Accordingly, from characters He comes to <I>persons</I> possessing them,
 saying, "Blessed are ye when men shall revile you," &c. 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:11">Mt 5:11</A>).
 
 And now, continuing this mode of direct personal address, He startles
 those humble, unknown men by pronouncing them the exalted benefactors of
 their whole species.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Ye are the salt of the earth</B>--to preserve it from corruption, to
 season its insipidity, to freshen and sweeten it. The value of salt for
 these purposes is abundantly referred to by classical writers as well as
 in Scripture; and hence its symbolical significance in the religious
 offerings as well of those without as of those within the pale of
 revealed religion. In Scripture, mankind, under the unrestrained
 workings of their own evil nature, are represented as entirely corrupt.
 Thus, before the flood

 Tit 3:2, 3</A>).

 The remedy for this, says our Lord here, is the active presence of His
 disciples among their fellows. The character and principles of 
 Christians, brought into close contact with it, are designed to arrest 
 the festering corruption of humanity and season its insipidity. But 
 how, it may be asked, are Christians to do this office for their fellow 
 men, if their righteousness only exasperate them, and recoil, in every 
 form of persecution, upon themselves? The answer is: That is but the 
 first and partial effect of their Christianity upon the world: though 
 the great proportion would dislike and reject the truth, a small but 
 noble band would receive and hold it fast; and in the struggle that 
 would ensue, one and another even of the opposing party would come over 
 to His ranks, and at length the Gospel would carry all before it.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but if the salt have lost his savour</B>--"become unsavory" or "insipid";
 losing its saline or salting property. The meaning is: If that
 Christianity on which the health of the world depends, does in any age,
 region, or individual, exist only in <I>name,</I> or if it contain not
 those <I>saving elements</I> for want of which the world languishes,

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>wherewith shall it be salted?</B>--How shall the salting qualities be
 restored to it? (Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:50">Mr 9:50</A>).

 Whether salt ever does lose its saline property--about which there is a
 difference of opinion--is a question of no moment here. The point of 
 the case lies in the supposition--that <I>if it should lose it,</I> the 
 consequence would be as here described. So with Christians. The 
 question is not: Can, or do, the saints ever totally lose that grace 
 which makes them a blessing to their fellow men? But, What is to be the 
 issue of that Christianity which is found wanting in those elements 
 which can alone stay the corruption and season the tastelessness of an 
 all-pervading carnality?  The restoration or non-restoration of
 <I>grace,</I> or true living Christianity, to those who have lost it, 
 has, in our judgment, nothing at all to do here. The question is not, 
 If a man lose his grace, how shall <I>that</I> grace be restored to 
 him? but, Since living Christianity is the only "salt of the earth," if 
 men lose that, <I>what else</I> can supply its place? What follows is 
 the appalling answer to this question.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out</B>--a figurative
 expression of indignant exclusion from the kingdom of God (compare

 Joh 6:37; 9:34</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and to be trodden under foot of men</B>--expressive of contempt and scorn.
 It is not the mere want of a certain character, but the want of it in
 those whose <I>profession</I> and <I>appearance</I> were fitted to beget
 expectation of finding it.</P>

 which our Lord appropriates to Himself 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:12,9:5">Joh 8:12; 9:5</A>;
 
 and see

 --a title expressly said to be unsuitable even to the highest of all
 the prophets

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:8">Joh 1:8</A>)

 --it must be applied here by our Lord to His disciples only as they 
 shine with His light upon the world, in virtue of His Spirit dwelling 
 in them, and the same mind being in them which was also in Christ 
 Jesus. Nor are Christians anywhere else so called. Nay, as if to avoid 
 the august title which the Master has appropriated to Himself, 
 Christians are said to "shine"--not as "lights," as our translators 
 render it, but--"as <I>luminaries</I> in the world"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:15">Php 2:15</A>);

 and the Baptist is said to have been "the burning and shining"--not 
 "light," as in our translation, but "<I>lamp</I>" of his day

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:35">Joh 5:35</A>).

 Let it be observed, too, that while the two figures of salt and 
 sunlight both express the same function of Christians--their blessed 
 influence on their fellow men--they each set this forth under a 
 different aspect. Salt operates <I>internally,</I> in the mass with 
 which it comes in contact; the sunlight operates <I>externally,</I> 
 irradiating all that it reaches. Hence Christians are warily styled 
 "the salt of the <I>earth</I>"--with reference to the masses of mankind 
 with whom they are expected to mix; but "the light of the 
 <I>world</I>"--with reference to the vast and variegated surface which 
 feels its fructifying and gladdening radiance. The same distinction is 
 observable in the second pair of those seven parables which our Lord 
 spoke from the Galilean Lake--that of the "mustard seed," which grew to 
 be a great overshadowing tree, answering to the sunlight which invests 
 the world, and that of the "leaven," which a woman took and, like the 
 salt, <I>hid</I> in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:31-33">Mt 13:31-33</A>).

 world, instead of hiding their light, are so to hold it forth before men
 that they may see what a life the disciples of Christ lead, and seeing
 this, may glorify their Father for so redeeming, transforming, and
 ennobling earth's sinful children, and opening to themselves the way to

 <B>17. Think not that I am come</B>--that I came.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>to destroy the law, or the prophets</B>--that is, "the authority and

 Lu 16:16;
 Ac 13:15</A>).

 This general way of taking the phrase is much better than understanding
 "the law" and "the prophets" separately, and inquiring, as many good 
 critics do, in what sense our Lord could be supposed to meditate the 
 subversion of each. To the various classes of His hearers, who might 
 view such supposed abrogation of the law and the prophets with very 
 different feelings, our Lord's announcement would, in effect, be such 
 as this--"Ye who tremble at the word of the Lord, <I>fear</I> not that 
 I am going to sweep the foundation from under your feet: Ye restless 
 and revolutionary spirits, <I>hope</I> not that I am going to head any 
 revolutionary movement: And ye who hypocritically affect great 
 reverence for the law and the prophets, <I>pretend</I> not to find 
 anything in My teaching derogatory to God's living oracles."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil</B>--Not to subvert, abrogate,
 or annul, but to establish the law and the prophets--to unfold them, to
 embody them in living form, and to enshrine them in the reverence,
 affection, and character of men, am I come.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt5_18"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>18. For verily I say unto you</B>--Here, for the first time, does that
 august expression occur in our Lord's recorded teaching, with which we
 have grown so familiar as hardly to reflect on its full import. It is
 the expression manifestly, of <I>supreme legislative authority;</I> and as
 the subject in connection with which it is uttered is the Moral Law, no
 higher claim to an authority <I>strictly divine</I> could be advanced. For
 when we observe how jealously Jehovah asserts it as His exclusive
 prerogative to give law to men

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:1-5,19:37,26:1-4,13-16">Le 18:1-5; 19:37; 26:1-4, 13-16</A>,

 &c.), such language as this of our Lord will appear totally unsuitable, 
 and indeed abhorrent, from any creature lips. When the Baptist's 
 words--"I say unto you"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:9">Mt 3:9</A>)

 --are compared with those of his Master here, the difference of the two 
 cases will be at once apparent.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Till heaven and earth pass</B>--Though even the Old Testament announces
 the ultimate "perdition of the heavens and the earth," in contrast with
 the immutability of Jehovah 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:24-27">Ps 102:24-27</A>),

 the prevalent representation of the heavens and the earth in Scripture, 
 when employed as a popular figure, is that of their <I>stability</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:89-91,Ec+1:4,Jer+33:25,26">Ps 119:89-91;
 Ec 1:4; 
 Jer 33:25, 26</A>). 

 It is the enduring stability, then, of the great truths and principles,
 moral and spiritual, of the Old Testament revelation which our Lord 
 thus expresses.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>one jot</B>--the smallest of the <I>Hebrew</I> letters.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Hebrew</I> letters are distinguished from others like them.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled</B>--The meaning
 is that "not so much as the smallest loss of authority or vitality shall
 ever come over the law." The expression, "till all be fulfilled," is
 much the same in meaning as "it <I>shall</I> be had in undiminished and
 enduring honor, from its greatest to its least requirements." Again,
 this general way of viewing our Lord's words here seems far preferable
 to that <I>doctrinal</I> understanding of them which would require us to
 determine the different kinds of "fulfilment" which the <I>moral</I> and
 the <I>ceremonial</I> parts of it were to have.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt5_19"> </A>

 "annul," or "make invalid."

 <B>one of these least commandments</B>--an expression equivalent to "one of
 the least of these commandments."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 but of course embracing all similar schools and teaching in the 
 Christian Church.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven</B>--As the thing
 spoken of is not the practical breaking, or disobeying, of the law, but
 annulling or enervating its obligation by a vicious system of
 interpretation, and teaching others to do the same; so the thing
 threatened is not exclusion from heaven, and still less the lowest place
 in it, but a degraded and contemptuous position in the present stage of
 the kingdom of God. In other words, they shall be reduced by the
 retributive providence that overtakes them, to the same condition of
 dishonor to which, by their system and their teaching, they have brought
 down those eternal principles of God's law.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but whosoever shall do and teach them</B>--whose principles and teaching
 go to exalt the authority and honor of God's law, in its lowest as well
 as highest requirements.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven</B>--shall, by that
 providence which watches over the honor of God's moral administration,
 be raised to the same position of authority and honor to which they
 exalt the law.</P>

 <I>degree;</I> for all Scripture teaches that entrance into God's kingdom,
 whether in its present or future stage, depends, not on the degree of
 our excellence in anything, but solely on our having the character
 itself which God demands. Our righteousness, then--if it is to contrast
 with the <I>outward</I> and <I>formal</I> righteousness of the scribes and
 Pharisees--must be <I>inward, vital, spiritual.</I> Some, indeed, of the
 scribes and Pharisees themselves might have the very righteousness here
 demanded; but our Lord is speaking, not of persons, but of the
 <I>system</I> they represented and taught.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven</B>--If this refer,
 as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:19">Mt 5:19</A>,

 rather to the earthly stage of this kingdom, the meaning is that 
 without a righteousness exceeding that of the Pharisees, we cannot be

 <B>21. Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time</B>--or, as in
 the <I>Margin,</I> "to them of old time." Which of these translations is
 the right one has been much controverted. Either of them is
 grammatically defensible, though the latter--"<I>to</I> the ancients"--is
 more consistent with New Testament usage (see the <I>Greek</I> of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:12,26,Re+6:11,9:4">Ro 9:12, 26;
 Re 6:11; 9:4</A>); 

 and most critics decide in favor of it.  But it is not a question of
 <I>Greek</I> only. Nearly all who would translate "to the ancients" 
 take the speaker of the words quoted to be <I>Moses in the law;</I> 
 "the ancients" to be <I>the people</I> to whom Moses gave the law; and 
 the intention of our Lord here to be to contrast His own teaching, more 
 or less, with that of Moses; either as opposed to it--as some go the 
 length of affirming--or at least as modifying, enlarging, elevating it. 
 But who can reasonably imagine such a thing, just after the most solemn 
 and emphatic proclamation of the perpetuity of the law, and the honor 
 and glory in which it was to be held under the new economy? To us it 
 seems as plain as possible that our Lord's one object is to contrast 
 the traditional perversions of the law with the true sense of it as 
 expounded by Himself. A few of those who assent to this still think 
 that "to the ancients" is the only legitimate translation of the words; 
 understanding that our Lord is reporting what had been said to the 
 ancients, not by Moses, but by the perverters of his law. We do not 
 object to this; but we incline to think (with B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>EZA</FONT>, and after him with F<FONT SIZE=-1>RITZSCHE</FONT>, 
 O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT>, S<FONT SIZE=-1>TIER</FONT>, and B<FONT

 our Lord meant here, referring to the corrupt teachers rather than the 
 perverted people.

 Thus was this commandment reduced, from a holy law of the 
 heart-searching God, to a mere criminal statute, taking cognizance only 
 of outward actions, such as that which we read in

 <B>22. But I say unto you</B>--Mark the authoritative tone in which--as
 Himself the Lawgiver and Judge--Christ now gives the true sense, and
 explains the deep reach, of the commandment.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in
 danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca!
 shall be in danger of the council; but whosoever shall say, Thou fool!
 shall be in danger of hell-fire</B>--It is unreasonable to deny, as
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LEXANDER</FONT> does, that three degrees of punishment are here meant to be
 expressed, and to say that it is but a threefold expression of one and
 the same thing. But Romish expositors greatly err in taking the first
 two--"the judgment" and "the council"--to refer to degrees of <I>temporal</I>
 punishment with which lesser sins were to be visited under the Gospel,
 and only the last--"hell-fire"--to refer to the future life. All three
 clearly refer to <I>divine retribution,</I> and that alone, for breaches of
 this commandment; though this is expressed by an <I>allusion</I> to Jewish
 tribunals. The "judgment," as already explained, was the lowest of
 these; the "council," or "Sanhedrim,"--which sat at Jerusalem--was the
 highest; while the word used for "hell-fire" contains an allusion to the
 "valley of the son of Hinnom" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+18:16">Jos 18:16</A>).

 In this valley the Jews, when steeped in idolatry, went the length of 
 burning their children to Molech "on the high places of Tophet"--in 
 consequence of which good Josiah defiled it, to prevent the repetition 
 of such abominations

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:10">2Ki 23:10</A>);

 and from that time forward, if we may believe the Jewish writers, a 
 fire was kept burning in it to consume the carrion and all kinds of 
 impurities that collected about the capital. Certain it is, that while 
 the final punishment of the wicked is described in the Old Testament by 
 allusions to this valley of Tophet or Hinnom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:33,66:24">Isa 30:33; 66:24</A>),

 our Lord Himself describes the same by merely quoting these terrific
 descriptions of the evangelical prophet

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:43-48">Mr 9:43-48</A>).

 What precise degrees of unholy feeling towards our brothers are
 indicated by the words "Raca" and "fool" it would be as useless as it 
 is vain to inquire. Every age and every country has its modes of 
 expressing such things; and no doubt our Lord seized on the then 
 current phraseology of unholy disrespect and contempt, merely to 
 express and condemn the different degrees of such feeling when brought 
 out in words, as He had immediately before condemned the feeling 
 itself.  In fact, so little are we to make of mere <I>words,</I> apart 
 from the feeling which they express, that as <I>anger</I> is expressly 
 said to have been borne by our Lord towards His enemies though mixed 
 with "grief for the hardness of their hearts"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:5">Mr 3:5</A>),

 and as the apostle teaches us that there is an anger which is not
 sinful

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:26">Eph 4:26</A>);

 so in the Epistle of James

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:20">Jas 2:20</A>)

 we find the words, "O vain (or, empty) man"; and our Lord Himself
 applies the very word "fools" twice in one breath to the blind guides 
 of the people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:17,19">Mt 23:17, 19</A>)

 --although, in both cases, it is to <I>false reasoners</I> rather than 
 persons that such words are applied. The spirit, then, of the whole 
 statement may be thus given: "For ages ye have been taught that the 
 sixth commandment, for example, is broken only by the murderer, to pass 
 sentence upon whom is the proper business of the recognized tribunals. 
 But I say unto you that it is broken even by causeless anger, which is 
 but hatred in the bud, as hatred is incipient murder

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:15">1Jo 3:15</A>);

 and if by the feelings, much more by those <I>words</I> in which all 
 ill feeling, from the slightest to the most envenomed, are wont to be 
 cast upon a brother: and just as there are gradations in human courts 
 of judicature, and in the sentences which they pronounce according to 
 the degrees of criminality, so will the judicial treatment of all the 
 breakers of this commandment at the divine tribunal be according to 
 their real criminality before the heart-searching Judge." Oh, what holy 
 teaching is this!</P>

 importance.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy
 brother hath aught</B>--of just complaint "against thee."</P>

 <A NAME="Mt5_24"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>24. Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be 
 reconciled to thy brother</B>--The meaning evidently is--not, "dismiss 
 from thine own breast all ill feeling," but "get thy brother to dismiss 
 from his mind all grudge against thee."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and then come and offer thy gift</B>--"The picture," says 
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HOLUCK</FONT>, "is drawn from life. It transports us to
 the moment when the Israelite, having brought his sacrifice to the 
 court of the Israelites, awaited the instant when the priest would 
 approach to receive it at his hands. He waits with his gift at the 
 rails which separate the place where he stands from the court of the 
 priests, into which his offering will presently be taken, there to be 
 slain by the priest, and by him presented upon the altar of sacrifice." 
 It is at this solemn moment, when about to cast himself upon divine 
 mercy, and seek in his offering a seal of divine forgiveness, that the 
 offerer is supposed, all at once, to remember that some brother has a 
 just cause of complaint against him through breach of this commandment 
 in one or other of the ways just indicated. What then? Is he to say, As 
 soon as I have offered this gift I will go straight to my brother, and 
 make it up with him? Nay; but before another step is taken--even before 
 the offering is presented--this reconciliation is to be sought, though 
 the gift have to be left unoffered before the altar. The converse of 
 the truth here taught is very strikingly expressed in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+11:25,26">Mr 11:25, 26</A>:

 "And <I>when ye stand praying</I> (in the very act), forgive, if ye
 have aught (of just complaint) against any; that your Father also which 
 is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. But if ye do not forgive, 
 neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive you," &c. Hence the 
 beautiful practice of the early Church, to see that all differences 
 amongst brethren and sisters in Christ were made up, in the spirit of 
 love, before going to the Holy Communion; and the Church of England has 
 a rubrical direction to this effect in her Communion service.  
 Certainly, if this be the highest act of worship on earth, such 
 reconciliation though obligatory on all other occasions of 
 worship--must be peculiarly so then.</P>

 <B>26. Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, 
 till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing</B>--a fractional Roman
 coin, to which our "farthing" answers sufficiently well.  That our Lord 
 meant here merely to give a piece of prudential advice to his hearers, 
 to keep out of the hands of the law and its officials by settling all 
 disputes with one another privately, is not for a moment to be 
 supposed, though there are critics of a school low enough to suggest 
 this. The concluding words--"Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no 
 means come out," &c.--manifestly show that though the <I>language</I> 
 is drawn from human disputes and legal procedure, He is dealing with a 
 higher than any human quarrel, a higher than any human tribunal, a 
 higher than any human and temporal sentence.  In this view of the 
 words--in which nearly all critics worthy of the name agree--the spirit 
 of them may be thus expressed: "In expounding the sixth commandment, I 
 have spoken of offenses between man and man; reminding you that the 
 offender has another party to deal with besides him whom he has wronged 
 on earth, and assuring you that all worship offered to the Searcher of 
 hearts by one who knows that a brother has just cause of complaint 
 against him, and yet takes no steps to remove it, is vain: But I cannot 
 pass from this subject without reminding you of One whose cause of 
 complaint against you is far more deadly than any that man can have 
 against man: and since with that Adversary you are already on the way 
 to judgment, it will be your wisdom to make up the quarrel without 
 delay, lest sentence of condemnation be pronounced upon you, and then 
 will execution straightway follow, from the effects of which you shall 
 never escape as long as any remnant of the offense remains unexpiated." 
 It will be observed that as the <I>principle</I> on which we are to 
 "agree" with this "Adversary" is not here specified, and the precise 
 <I>nature</I> of the retribution that is to light upon the despisers of 
 this warning is not to be gathered from the mere use of the word 
 "prison"; so, the <I>remedilessness</I> of the punishment is not in so 
 many words expressed, and still less is its actual <I>cessation</I> 
 taught.  The language on all these points is designedly general; but it 
 may safely be said that the <I>unending duration</I> of future 
 punishment--elsewhere so clearly and awfully expressed by our Lord 
 Himself, as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:29,30,Mk+9:43,48">Mt 5:29, 30,

 <B>Thou shall not commit adultery</B>--Interpreting this seventh, as they did
 the sixth commandment, the traditional perverters of the law restricted
 the breach of it to <I>acts</I> of criminal intercourse between, or with,
 married persons exclusively. Our Lord now dissipates such delusions.</P>

 or, with the full consent of his will, to feed thereby his unholy 
 desires.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>hath committed adultery with her already in his heart</B>--We are 
 not to suppose, from the word here used--"adultery"--that our Lord 
 means to restrict the breach of this commandment to married persons, or 
 to criminal intercourse with such. The expressions, "<I>whosoever</I> 
 looketh," and "looketh upon a <I>woman,</I>" seem clearly to extend the 
 range of this commandment to all forms of impurity, and the counsels 
 which follow--as they most certainly were intended for all, whether
 married or unmarried--seem to confirm this. As in dealing with the 
 sixth commandment our Lord first expounds it, and then in the four 
 following verses applies His exposition

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:21-25">Mt 5:21-25</A>),

 so here He first expounds the seventh commandment, and then in the four

 occasion of stumbling" to thee.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>pluck it out and cast it from thee</B>--implying a certain indignant
 promptitude, heedless of whatever cost to feeling the act may involve.
 Of course, it is not <I>the eye simply</I> of which our Lord speaks--as if
 execution were to be done upon the bodily organ--though there have been
 fanatical ascetics who have both advocated and practiced this, showing a
 very low apprehension of spiritual things--but <I>the offending eye,</I> or
 the eye considered as the occasion of sin; and consequently, only the
 <I>sinful exercise</I> of the organ which is meant. For as one might put
 out his eyes without in the least quenching the lust to which they
 ministered, so, "if thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of
 light," and, when directed by a holy mind, becomes an "instrument of
 righteousness unto God." At the same time, just as by cutting off a
 hand, or plucking out an eye, the <I>power</I> of acting and of seeing
 would be destroyed, our Lord certainly means that we are to
 <I>strike at the root</I> of such unholy dispositions, as well as cut off
 the occasions which tend to stimulate them.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish,
 and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell</B>--He who despises
 the warning to cast from him, with indignant promptitude, an offending
 member, will find his whole body "cast," with a retributive promptitude
 of indignation, "into hell." Sharp language, this, from the lips of Love
 incarnate!</P>

 lessons seems characteristic of our Lord's manner of teaching. Compare

 <B>31. It hath been said</B>--This shortened form was perhaps intentional,
 to mark a transition from the commandments of the Decalogue to a civil
 enactment on the subject of divorce, quoted from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:1">De 24:1</A>.

 The law of divorce--according to its strictness or laxity--has so 
 intimate a bearing upon purity in the married life, that nothing could 
 be more natural than to pass from the seventh commandment to the loose 
 views on that subject then current.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of 
 divorcement</B>--a legal check upon reckless and tyrannical separation.  
 The one legitimate ground of divorce allowed by the enactment just 
 quoted was "some uncleanness"--in other words, conjugal infidelity. But 
 while one school of interpreters (that of S<FONT SIZE=-1>HAMMAI</FONT>)
 explained this quite correctly, as prohibiting divorce in every case
 save that of adultery, another school (that of 
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ILLEL</FONT>) stretched the expression so far as to
 include everything in the wife offensive or disagreeable to the 
 husband--a view of the law too well fitted to minister to caprice and 
 depraved inclination not to find extensive favor. And, indeed, to this 
 day the Jews allow divorces on the most frivolous pretexts. It was to 
 meet this that our Lord uttered what follows:</P>

 <A NAME="Mt5_32"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>32. But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving
 for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery</B>--that is,
 drives her into it in case she marries again.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced</B>--for anything short of
 conjugal infidelity.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>committeth adultery</B>--for if the commandment is broken by the one 
 party, it must be by the other also. But see on

 <A HREF="#Mt19_4">Mt 19:4-9</A>.

 Whether the innocent party, after a just divorce, may lawfully marry
 again, is not treated of here. The Church of Rome says, No; but the 
 Greek and Protestant Churches allow it.</P>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:7">Ex 20:7</A>;

 but they express all that it was currently understood to condemn, 
 namely, false swearing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:12">Le 19:12</A>,

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>But I say unto you, Swear not at all</B>--That this was meant to condemn
 swearing of every kind and on every occasion--as the Society of Friends
 and some other ultra-moralists allege--is not for a moment to be
 thought. For even Jehovah is said once and again to have sworn by
 Himself; and our Lord certainly answered upon oath to a question put to
 Him by the high priest; and the apostle several times, and in the most
 solemn language, takes God to witness that he spoke and wrote the truth;
 and it is inconceivable that our Lord should here have quoted the
 precept about not forswearing ourselves, but performing to the Lord our
 oaths, only to give a precept of His own directly in the teeth of it.
 Evidently, it is swearing in common intercourse and on frivolous
 occasions that is here meant. Frivolous oaths were indeed severely
 condemned in the teaching of the times. But so narrow was the circle of
 them that a man might swear, says
 L<FONT SIZE=-1>IGHTFOOT</FONT>, a hundred thousand times
 and yet not be guilty of vain swearing. Hardly anything was regarded as
 an oath if only the name of God were not in it; just as among ourselves,
 as T<FONT SIZE=-1>RENCH</FONT> well remarks, a certain lingering reverence for the name of
 God leads to cutting off portions of His name, or uttering sounds nearly
 resembling it, or substituting the name of some heathen deity, in
 profane exclamations or asseverations. Against all this our Lord now
 speaks decisively; teaching His audience that every oath carries an
 appeal to God, whether named or not.

 affirming the truth or the untruth of anything. (See

 <B>for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil</B>--not "of the evil
 one"; though an equally correct rendering of the words, and one which
 some expositors prefer. It is true that all evil in our world is
 originally of the devil, that it forms a kingdom at the head of which he
 sits, and that, in every manifestation of it he has an active part. But
 any reference to this here seems unnatural, and the allusion to this
 passage in the Epistle of James 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:12">Jas 5:12</A>)

 seems to show that this is not the sense of it: "Let your yea be yea;
 and your nay, nay; <I>lest ye fall into condemnation.</I>" The 
 untruthfulness of our corrupt nature shows itself not only in the 
 tendency to deviate from the strict truth, but in the disposition to 
 suspect others of doing the same; and as this is not diminished, but 
 rather aggravated, by the habit of confirming what we say by an oath, 
 we thus run the risk of having all reverence for God's holy name, and 
 even for strict truth, destroyed in our hearts, and so "fall into 
 condemnation." The practice of going beyond Yes and No in affirmations 
 and denials--as if our word for it were not enough, and we expected 
 others to question it--springs from that vicious root of untruthfulness 
 which is only aggravated by the very effort to clear ourselves of the 
 suspicion of it. And just as swearing to the truth of what we say 
 begets the disposition it is designed to remove, so the love and reign 
 of truth in the breasts of Christ's disciples reveals itself so plainly 
 even to those who themselves cannot be trusted, that their simple Yes 
 and No come soon to be more relied on than the most solemn 
 asseverations of others. Thus does the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
 like a tree cast into the bitter waters of human corruption, heal and 
 sweeten them.</P>

 <B>An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth</B>--that is, whatever penalty
 was regarded as a proper equivalent for these. This law of
 retribution--designed to take vengeance out of the hands of private
 persons, and commit it to the magistrate--was abused in the opposite way
 to the commandments of the Decalogue. While they were reduced to the
 level of civil enactments, this judicial regulation was held to be a
 warrant for taking redress into their own hands, contrary to the
 injunctions of the Old Testament itself

 some Eastern nations, who, when government despatches had to be 
 forwarded, obliged the people not only to furnish horses and carriages, 
 but to give personal attendance, often at great inconvenience, when 
 required. But the thing here demanded is a readiness to submit to 
 unreasonable demands of whatever kind, rather than raise quarrels, with 
 all the evils resulting from them. What follows is a beautiful 
 extension of this precept.</P>

 as usury was forbidden among the Jews 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:25">Ex 22:25</A>,

 such counsels as "Owe no man anything"

 <I>personal</I> affection. Usually, the former denotes "complacency in the
 character" of the person loved; but here it denotes the benignant,
 compassionate outgoings of desire for another's good.

 <B>bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for

 But though such precepts were never before expressed--perhaps not even
 conceived--with such breadth, precision, and sharpness as here, our

 we may see that the principle of this surprising verse was nothing new:
 but the form of it certainly is that of One who spake as never man 
 spake.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt5_46"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>46. For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not
 even the publicans the same?</B>--The publicans, as collectors of taxes
 due to the Roman government, were ever on this account obnoxious to the
 Jews, who sat uneasy under a foreign yoke, and disliked whatever brought
 this unpleasantly before them. But the extortion practiced by this class
 made them hateful to the community, who in their current speech ranked
 them with "harlots." Nor does our Lord scruple to speak of them as
 others did, which we may be sure He never would have done if it had been
 calumnious. The meaning, then, is, "In loving those who love you, there
 is no evidence of superior principle; the worst of men will do this:
 even a publican will go that length."</P>

 <A NAME="Mt5_47"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 religion with yourselves.

 <B>what do ye more <I>than others</I>?</B>--what do ye uncommon or extraordinary?
 that is, wherein do ye <I>excel?</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>do not even the publicans so?</B>--The true reading here appears to be,
 "Do not even the heathens the same?" Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:17">Mt 18:17</A>,

 where the excommunicated person is said to be "as an heathen man and a

 therefore to be," as My disciples and in My kingdom.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>perfect</B>--or complete. Manifestly, our Lord here speaks, not of
 <I>degrees</I> of excellence, but of the <I>kind</I> of excellence which was
 to distinguish His disciples and characterize His kingdom. When
 therefore He adds,

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect</B>--He refers to 
 that full-orbed glorious completeness which is in the great Divine 
 Model, "their Father which is in heaven."</P>

 <I>General Caution against Ostentation in Religious Duties</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>1. Take heed that ye do not your alms</B>--But the true reading seems
 clearly to be "your righteousness." The external authority for both
 readings is pretty nearly equal; but internal evidence is decidedly in
 favor of "righteousness." The subject of the second verse being
 "almsgiving" that word--so like the other in <I>Greek</I>--might easily be
 substituted for it by the copyist: whereas the opposite would not be so
 likely. But it is still more in favor of "righteousness," that if we so
 read the first verse, it then becomes a general heading for this whole
 section of the discourse, inculcating unostentatiousness in <I>all</I>
 deeds of righteousness--Almsgiving, Prayer, and Fasting being, in that
 case, but selected examples of this righteousness; whereas, if we read,
 "Do not your <I>alms,</I>" &c., this first verse will have no reference
 but to that one point. By "righteousness," in this case, we are to
 understand that same righteousness of the kingdom of heaven, whose
 leading features--in opposition to traditional perversions of it--it is
 the great object of this discourse to open up: that righteousness of
 which the Lord says, "Except your righteousness shall exceed the
 righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter
 into the kingdom of heaven" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:20">Mt 5:20</A>).

 To "<I>do</I>" this righteousness, was an old and well-understood 
 expression. Thus, "Blessed is he that doeth righteousness at all times"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:3">Ps 106:3</A>).

 It refers to the <I>actings</I> of righteousness in the life--the 
 outgoings of the gracious nature--of which our Lord afterwards said to 
 His disciples, "Herein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; 
 so shall ye be My disciples"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:8">Joh 15:8</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>before men, to be seen of them</B>--with the view or intention of being
 beheld of them. See the same expression in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:28">Mt 5:28</A>.

 True, He had required them to let their light so shine before men that 
 they might see their good works, and glorify their Father which is in 
 heaven

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:16">Mt 5:16</A>).

 But this is quite consistent with not making a display of our 
 righteousness for self-glorification. In fact, the doing of the former 
 necessarily implies our <I>not</I> doing the latter.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven</B>--When
 all duty is done to God--as primarily enjoining and finally judging of
 it--He will take care that it be duly recognized; but when done purely
 for ostentation, God cannot own it, nor is His judgment of it even
 thought of--God accepts only what is done to Himself. So much for the
 general principle. Now follow three illustrations of it.</P>

 <B>2. Therefore, when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before
 thee</B>--The expression is to be taken figuratively for <I>blazoning</I> it.
 Hence our expression to "trumpet."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>as the hypocrites do</B>--This word--of such frequent occurrence in
 Scripture, signifying primarily "one who acts a part"--denotes one who
 either <I>pretends</I> to be what he is not (as here), or <I>dissembles</I> what he really is (as in

 thine own thoughts, lest it minister to spiritual pride.</P>

 to be an unauthorized addition to the text, which the sense no doubt
 suggested. (See

 <B>not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the

 <B>that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have,</B>

 <B>and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in
 secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee
 openly</B>--Of course, it is not the simple publicity of prayer which
 is here condemned. It may be offered in any circumstances, however
 open, if not prompted by the spirit of ostentation, but dictated by the
 great ends of prayer itself. It is the <I>retiring</I> character of true
 prayer which is here taught.</P>

 <B>7. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions</B>--"Babble not" would be
 a better rendering, both for the form of the word--which in both
 languages is intended to imitate the sound--and for the sense, which
 expresses not so much the repetition of the same words as a senseless
 multiplication of them; as appears from what follows.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their
 much speaking</B>--This method of heathen devotion is still observed by
 Hindu and Mohammedan devotees. With the Jews, says
 L<FONT SIZE=-1>IGHTFOOT</FONT>, it was a
 maxim, that "Every one who multiplies prayer is heard." In the Church of
 Rome, not only is it carried to a shameless extent, but, as
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HOLUCK</FONT>
 justly observes, the very prayer which our Lord gave as an antidote to
 vain repetitions is the most abused to this superstitious end; the
 number of times it is repeated counting for so much more merit. Is not
 this just that characteristic feature of heathen devotion which our Lord
 here condemns? But praying much, and using at times the same words, is
 <I>not</I> here condemned, and has the example of our Lord Himself in its
 favor.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt6_8"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>8. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what
 things ye have need of before ye ask him</B>--and so needs not to be
 <I>informed</I> of our wants, any more than to be <I>roused</I> to attend to
 them by our incessant speaking. What a view of God is here given, in
 sharp contrast with the gods of the heathen! But let it be carefully
 noted that it is not as <I>the general Father of mankind</I> that our Lord
 says, "Your Father" knoweth what ye need before ye ask it; for it is not
 men, as such, that He is addressing in this discourse, but His own
 disciples--the poor in spirit, the mourners, the meek, hungry and
 thirsty souls, the merciful, the pure in heart, the peacemakers, who
 allow themselves to have all manner of evil said against them for the
 Son of man's sake--in short, the new-born children of God, who, making
 their Father's interests their own, are here assured that their Father,
 in return, makes their interests His, and needs neither to be told nor
 to be reminded of their wants. Yet He will have His children pray to
 Him, and links all His promised supplies to their petitions for them;
 thus encouraging us to draw near and keep near to Him, to talk and walk
 with Him, to open our every case to Him, and assure ourselves that thus
 asking we shall receive--thus seeking we shall find--thus knocking it
 shall be opened to us.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt6_9"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>9. After this manner</B>--more simply "Thus."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>therefore pray ye</B>--The "ye" is emphatic here, in contrast with the
 heathen prayers. That this matchless prayer was given not only as a
 <I>model,</I> but as a <I>form,</I> might be concluded from its very nature.
 Did it consist only of hints or directions for prayer, it could only be
 used as a directory; but seeing it is an actual prayer--designed,
 indeed, to show how much real prayer could be compressed into the fewest
 words, but still, as a prayer, only the more incomparable for that--it
 is strange that there should be a doubt whether we ought to pray that
 very prayer. Surely the words with which it is introduced, in the second
 utterance and varied form of it which we have in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:2">Lu 11:2</A>,

 ought to set this at rest: "When ye pray, <I>say,</I> Our Father." 
 Nevertheless, since the second form of it varies considerably from the 
 first, and since no example of its actual use, or express quotation of 
 its phraseology, occurs in the sequel of the New Testament, we are to 
 guard against a superstitious use of it. How early this began to appear 
 in the church services, and to what extent it was afterwards carried, 
 is known to every one versed in Church History. Nor has the spirit 
 which bred this abuse quite departed from some branches of the 
 Protestant Church, though the opposite and equally condemnable extreme 
 is to be found in other branches of it.</P>

 <I>Model Prayer</I>

 According to the Latin fathers and the Lutheran Church, the petitions
 of the Lord's Prayer are <I>seven</I> in number; according to the Greek
 fathers, the Reformed Church and the Westminster divines, they are only 
 <I>six;</I> the two last being regarded--we think, less correctly--as 
 one.  The first three petitions have to do exclusively with God: 
 "<I>Thy</I> name be hallowed"--"<I>Thy</I> kingdom come"--"<I>Thy</I> 
 will be done." And they occur in a <I>descending</I> scale--from 
 Himself down to the manifestation of Himself in His kingdom; and from 
 His kingdom to the entire subjection of its subjects, or the complete 
 doing of His will. The remaining four petitions have to do with <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OURSELVES:</FONT> "Give <I>us</I> our daily bread"--"Forgive 
 <I>us</I> our debts"--"Lead <I>us</I> not into temptation"--"Deliver 
 <I>us</I> from evil." But these latter petitions occur in an 
 <I>ascending</I> scale--from the bodily wants of every day up to our 
 final deliverance from all evil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Invocation:</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Our Father which art in heaven</B>--In the former clause we express His
 nearness to us; in the latter, His distance from us. (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:2,Isa+66:1">Ec 5:2;
 Isa 66:1</A>). 

 Holy, loving familiarity suggests the one; awful reverence the other.
 In calling Him "Father" we express a relationship we have all known and 
 felt surrounding us even from our infancy; but in calling Him our 
 Father "who art in heaven," we contrast Him with the fathers we all 
 have here below, and so raise our souls to that "heaven" where He 
 dwells, and that Majesty and Glory which are there as in their proper 
 home. These first words of the Lord's Prayer--this invocation with 
 which it opens--what a brightness and warmth does it throw over the 
 whole prayer, and into what a serene region does it introduce the 
 praying believer, the child of God, as he thus approaches Him! It is 
 true that the paternal relationship of God to His people is by no means 
 strange to the Old Testament. (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:6,Ps+103:13,Isa+63:16,Jer+3:4,19,Mal+1:6,2:10">De 32:6;
 Ps 103:13; 
 Isa 63:16; 
 Jer 3:4, 19; 
 Mal 1:6; 2:10</A>). 

 But these are only glimpses--the "back parts"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:23">Ex 33:23</A>),

 if we may so say, in comparison with the "open face" of our Father 
 revealed in Jesus.  (See on

 <A HREF="JFB47.htm#2Co3_18">2Co 3:18</A>). 

 Nor is it too much to say, that the view which our Lord gives,
 throughout this His very first lengthened discourse, of "our Father in 
 heaven," beggars all that was ever taught, even in God's own Word, or 
 conceived before by His saints, on this subject.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First Petition:</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Hallowed be</B>--that is, "Be held in reverence"; <I>regarded</I> and
 <I>treated</I> as holy.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>thy name</B>--God's name means "Himself as revealed and manifested."
 Everywhere in Scripture God defines and marks off the faith and love and
 reverence and obedience He will have from men by the disclosures which
 He makes to them of what He is; both to shut out false conceptions of
 Him, and to make all their devotion take the shape and hue of His own
 teaching. Too much attention cannot be paid to this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Second Petition:</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>10. Thy kingdom come</B>--The kingdom of God is that moral and spiritual
 kingdom which the God of grace is setting up in this fallen world, whose
 subjects consist of as many as have been brought into hearty subjection
 to His gracious scepter, and of which His Son Jesus is the glorious
 Head. In the inward reality of it, this kingdom existed ever since there
 were men who "walked with God" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:24">Ge 5:24</A>),

 and "waited for His salvation"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:18">Ge 49:18</A>);

 who were "continually with Him, holden by His right hand"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:23">Ps 73:23</A>),

 and who, even in the valley of the shadow of death, feared no evil when 
 He was with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:4">Ps 23:4</A>).
 
 When Messiah Himself appeared, it was, as a visible kingdom, "at hand."
 His death laid the deep foundations of it. His ascension on high,
 "leading captivity captive and receiving gifts for men, yea, for the
 rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell among them," and the
 Pentecostal effusion of the Spirit, by which those gifts for men
 descended upon the rebellious, and the Lord God was beheld, in the
 persons of thousands upon thousands, "dwelling" among men--was a
 glorious "coming" of this kingdom. But it is still to come, and this
 petition, "Thy kingdom come," must not cease to ascend so long as one
 subject of it remains to be brought in. But does not this prayer stretch
 further forward--to "the glory to be revealed," or that stage of the
 kingdom called "the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
 Christ" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:11">2Pe 1:11</A>)?

 Not directly, perhaps, since the petition that follows this--"Thy will 
 be done in earth, as it is in heaven"--would then bring us back to this 
 present state of imperfection. Still, the mind refuses to be so bounded 
 by stages and degrees, and in the act of praying, "Thy kingdom come," 
 it irresistibly stretches the wings of its faith, and longing, and 
 joyous expectation out to the final and glorious consummation of the 
 kingdom of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Third Petition:</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven</B>--or, as the same words
 are rendered in Luke, "as in heaven, so upon earth" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:2">Lu 11:2</A>)

 --as <I>cheerfully,</I> as <I>constantly,</I> as <I>perfectly.</I> But 
 some will ask, Will this ever be? We answer, If the "new heavens and 
 new earth" are to be just our present material system purified by fire 
 and transfigured, of course it will. But we incline to think that the 
 aspiration which we are taught in this beautiful petition to breathe 
 forth has no direct reference to any such <I>organic</I> fulfilment, 
 and is only the spontaneous and resistless longing of the renewed 
 soul--put into words--to see the whole inhabited earth in entire 
 conformity to the will of God. It asks not if ever it shall be--or if 
 ever it can be--in order to pray this prayer. It <I>must</I> have its 
 holy yearnings breathed forth, and this is just the bold yet simple 
 expression of them. Nor is the Old Testament without prayers which come 
 very near to this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:9,67:1-7,72:19">Ps 7:9; 67:1-7; 72:19</A>,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fourth Petition:</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>11. Give us this day our daily bread</B>--The compound word here rendered
 "daily" occurs nowhere else, either in classical or sacred <I>Greek,</I> and
 so must be interpreted by the analogy of its component parts. But on
 this critics are divided. To those who would understand it to mean,
 "Give us this day the bread of to-morrow"--as if the sense thus slid
 into that of Luke "Give us <I>day by day</I>" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:2">Lu 11:2</A>,

 (as B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>, M<FONT SIZE=-1>EYER</FONT>, &c.) it may
 be answered that the sense thus brought out is scarcely intelligible, 
 if not something less; that the expression "bread of to-morrow" is not 
 at all the same as bread "from day to day," and that, so understood, it 
 would seem to contradict

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:34">Mt 6:34</A>.

 The great majority of the best critics (taking the word to be 
 compounded of <I>ousia,</I> "<I>substance,</I>" or "being") understand 
 by it the "staff of <I>life,</I>" the bread of <I>subsistence,</I> and 
 so the sense will be, "Give us this day the bread which this day's 
 necessities require." In this case, the rendering of our authorized 
 version (after the <I>Vulgate,</I> L<FONT SIZE=-1>UTHER</FONT> and some 
 of the best modern critics)--"our daily bread"--is, in sense, accurate 
 enough. (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:8">Pr 30:8</A>).

 Among commentators, there was early shown an inclination to understand 
 this as a prayer for the heavenly bread, or spiritual nourishment; and 
 in this they have been followed by many superior expositors, even down 
 to our own times. But as this is quite unnatural, so it deprives the 
 Christian of one of the sweetest of his privileges--to cast his bodily 
 wants in this short prayer, by one simple petition, upon his heavenly 
 Father. No doubt the spiritual mind will, from "the meat that 
 perisheth," naturally rise in thought to "that meat which endureth to 
 everlasting life." But let it be enough that the petition about bodily 
 wants irresistibly <I>suggests</I> a higher petition; and let us not 
 rob ourselves--out of a morbid spirituality--of our one petition in 
 this prayer for that bodily provision which the immediate sequel of 
 this discourse shows that our heavenly Father has so much at heart. In 
 limiting our petitions, however, to provision <I>for the day,</I> what 
 a spirit of childlike dependence does the Lord both demand and 
 beget!</P>

 <A NAME="Mt6_12"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fifth Petition:</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>12. And forgive us our debts</B>--A vitally important view of sin, 
 this--as an offense against God demanding reparation to His dishonored 
 claims upon our absolute subjection. As the debtor in the creditor's 
 hand, so is the sinner in the hands of God. This idea of sin had indeed 
 come up before in this discourse--in the warning to agree with our 
 adversary quickly, in case of sentence being passed upon us, adjudging 
 us to payment of the last farthing, and to imprisonment till then

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:25,26">Mt 5:25, 26</A>).

 And it comes up once and again in our Lord's subsequent teaching--as in
 the parable of the creditor and his two debtors

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:41">Lu 7:41, 42</A>,
 
 &c.), and in the parable of the unmerciful debtor

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:23-352s">Mt 18:23</A>,

 &c.). But by embodying it in this brief model of acceptable prayer, and 
 as the first of three petitions more or less bearing upon sin, our Lord 
 teaches us, in the most emphatic manner conceivable, to regard this 
 view of sin as the primary and fundamental one. Answering to this is 
 the "forgiveness" which it directs us to seek--not the removal from our 
 own hearts of the stain of sin, nor yet the removal of our just dread 
 of God's anger, or of unworthy suspicions of His love, which is all 
 that some tell us we have to care about--but the removal from God's own 
 mind of His displeasure against us on account of sin, or, to retain the 
 figure, the wiping or crossing out from His "book of remembrance" of 
 all entries against us on this account.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>as we forgive our debtors</B>--the same view of sin as before; only now
 transferred to the region of offenses given and received between man and
 man. After what has been said on

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:7">Mt 5:7</A>,

 it will not be thought that our Lord here teaches that our exercise of 
 forgiveness towards our offending fellow men absolutely precedes and is 
 the proper ground of God's forgiveness of us. His whole teaching, 
 indeed--as of all Scripture--is the reverse of this. But as no one can 
 reasonably imagine himself to be the object of divine forgiveness who 
 is deliberately and habitually unforgiving towards his fellow men, so 
 it is a beautiful provision to make our right to ask and expect daily 
 forgiveness of our daily shortcomings and our final absolution and 
 acquittal at the great day of admission into the kingdom, dependent 
 upon our consciousness of a forgiving disposition towards our fellows, 
 and our preparedness to protest before the Searcher of hearts that we 
 do actually forgive them.  (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+11:25,26">Mr 11:25, 26</A>).

 God sees His own image reflected in His forgiving children; but to ask
 God for what we ourselves refuse to men, is to insult Him. So much 
 stress does our Lord put upon this, that immediately after the close of 
 this prayer, it is the one point in it which He comes back upon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:14,15">Mt 6:14, 15</A>),

 for the purpose of solemnly assuring us that the divine procedure in 
 this matter of forgiveness will be exactly what our own is.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt6_13"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Sixth Petition:</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>13. And lead us not into temptation</B>--He who honestly seeks and 
 has the assurance of, forgiveness for past sin, will strive to avoid 
 committing it for the future. But conscious that "when we would do good 
 evil is present with us," we are taught to offer this sixth petition, 
 which comes naturally close upon the preceding, and flows, indeed, 
 instinctively from it in the hearts of all earnest Christians. There is 
 some difficulty in the form of the petition, as it is certain that God 
 does bring His people--as He did Abraham, and Christ Himself--into 
 circumstances both fitted and designed to try them, or test the 
 strength of their faith. Some meet this by regarding the petition as 
 simply an humble expression of self-distrust and instinctive shrinking 
 from danger; but this seems too weak. Others take it as a prayer 
 against yielding to temptation, and so equivalent to a prayer for 
 support and deliverance when we are tempted; but this seems to go 
 beyond the precise thing intended. We incline to take it as a prayer 
 against being <I>drawn</I> or sucked, <I>of our own will,</I> into 
 temptation, to which the word here used seems to lend some 
 countenance--"Introduce us not." This view, while it does not put into
 our mouths a prayer against being tempted--which is more than the 
 divine procedure would seem to warrant--does not, on the other hand, 
 change the sense of the petition into one for support <I>under</I> 
 temptation, which the words will hardly bear; but it gives us a subject 
 for prayer, in regard to temptation, most <I>definite,</I> and of all 
 others most <I>needful.</I> It was precisely this which Peter needed to 
 ask, but did not ask, when--of his own accord, and in spite of 
 difficulties--he pressed for entrance into the palace hall of the high 
 priest, and where, once sucked into the scene and atmosphere of 
 temptation, he fell so foully. And if so, does it not seem pretty clear 
 that this was exactly what our Lord meant His disciples to pray against 
 when He said in the garden--"Watch and pray, that ye <I>enter not 
 into</I> temptation"?

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:41">Mt 26:41</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Seventh Petition:</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>But deliver us from evil</B>--We can see no good reason for 
 regarding this as but the second half of the sixth petition. With far 
 better ground might the second and third petitions be regarded as one. 
 The "but" connecting the two petitions is an insufficient reason for 
 regarding them as one, though enough to show that the one thought 
 naturally follows close upon the other. As the expression "from evil" 
 may be equally well rendered "from the evil one," a number or superior 
 critics think the devil is intended, especially from its following 
 close upon the subject of "temptation." But the comprehensive character 
 of these brief petitions, and the place which this one occupies, as 
 that on which all our desires die away, seems to us against so 
 contracted a view of it. Nor can there be a reasonable doubt that the 
 apostle, in some of the last sentences which he penned before he was 
 brought forth to suffer for his Lord, alludes to this very petition in 
 the language of calm assurance--"And the Lord shall deliver me from 
 every evil work (compare the <I>Greek</I> of the two passages), and
 will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:18">2Ti 4:18</A>).

 The final petition, then, is only rightly grasped when regarded as a
 prayer for deliverance from all evil of whatever kind--not only from 
 sin, but from all its consequences--fully and finally. Fitly, then, are 
 our prayers ended with this. For what can we desire which this does not 
 carry with it?

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.
 Amen</B>--If any reliance is to be placed on external evidence, this
 doxology, we think, can hardly be considered part of the original text.
 It is wanting in all the most ancient manuscripts; it is wanting in the
 <I>Old Latin</I> version and in the <I>Vulgate:</I> the former mounting up to
 about the middle of the second century, and the latter being a revision
 of it in the fourth century by J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT>,
 a most reverential and
 conservative as well as able and impartial critic. As might be expected
 from this, it is passed by in silence by the earliest Latin fathers; but
 even the Greek commentators, when expounding this prayer, pass by
 the doxology. On the other hand, it is found in a majority of
 manuscripts, though not the oldest; it is found in all the <I>Syriac</I> versions, even the <I>Peschito</I>--dating probably as
 early as the second
 century--although this version lacks the "Amen," which the doxology, if
 genuine, could hardly have wanted; it is found in the <I>Sahidic</I> or
 <I>Thebaic</I> version made for the Christians of Upper Egypt, possibly as
 early as the <I>Old Latin;</I> and it is found in perhaps most of the later
 versions. On a review of the evidence, the strong probability, we think,
 is that it was no part of the original text.</P>

 Having concluded His supplementary directions on the subject of prayer
 with this Divine Pattern, our Lord now returns to the subject of
 <I>Unostentatiousness</I> in our deeds of righteousness, in order to give
 one more illustration of it, in the matter of fasting.</P>

 hypocrites multiplied their fasts. And are the exhausting fasts of the
 Church of Rome, and of Romanizing Protestants, free from this taint?

 sinful, nay, in some cases enjoined

 and honest industry and sagacious enterprise are usually rewarded with 
 prosperity, many flatter themselves that all is right between them and 
 God, while their closest attention, anxiety, zeal, and time are 
 exhausted upon these earthly pursuits. To put this right, our Lord adds 
 what follows, in which there is profound practical wisdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>22. The light</B>--rather, "the lamp."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single</B>--simple,
 clear. As applied to the outward eye, this means general soundness;
 particularly, not looking two ways. Here, as also in classical
 Greek, it is used figuratively to denote the simplicity of the
 mind's eye, singleness of purpose, looking right at its object, as
 opposed to having two ends in view. (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:25-27">Pr 4:25-27</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>thy whole body shall be full of light</B>--illuminated. As with the bodily
 vision, the man who looks with a good, sound eye, walks in light, seeing
 every object clear; so a simple and persistent purpose to serve and
 please God in everything will make the whole character consistent and
 bright.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt6_23"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 have got a <I>bad</I> eye.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>thy whole body shall be full of darkness</B>--darkened. As a vitiated eye,
 or an eye that looks not straight and full at its object, sees nothing
 as it is, so a mind and heart divided between heaven and earth is all
 dark.

 <B>If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that
 darkness!</B>--As the conscience is the regulative faculty, and a man's
 inward purpose, scope, aim in life, determines his character--if these
 be not simple and heavenward, but distorted and double, what must all
 the other faculties and principles of our nature be which take their
 direction and character from these, and what must the whole man and the
 whole life be but a mass of darkness? In Luke 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:36">Lu 11:36</A>)

 the converse of this statement very strikingly expresses what pure, 
 beautiful, broad perceptions the <I>clarity of the inward eye</I> 
 imparts: "If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part 
 dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a 
 candle doth give thee light." But now for the application of this.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt6_24"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>24. No man can serve</B>--The word means to "belong wholly and be entirely
 under command to."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or
 else he will hold to the one, and despise the other</B>--Even if the two
 masters be of one character and have but one object, the servant must
 <I>take law</I> from one or the other: though he may do what is agreeable
 to both, he cannot, in the nature of the thing, be <I>servant</I> to more
 than one. Much less if, as in the present case, their interests are
 quite different, and even conflicting. In this case, if our affections
 be in the service of the one--if we "love the one"--we must of necessity
 "hate the other"; if we determine resolutely to "hold to the one," we
 must at the same time disregard, and (if he insist on his claims upon
 us) even "despise the other."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Ye cannot serve God and mammon</B>--The word "<I>mamon</I>"--better written
 with one <I>m</I>--is a foreign one, whose precise derivation cannot
 certainly be determined, though the most probable one gives it the sense
 of "what one trusts in." Here, there can be no doubt it is used for
 <I>riches,</I> considered as an idol master, or god of the heart. The
 service of this god and the true God together is here, with a kind of
 indignant curtness, pronounced impossible. But since the teaching of the
 preceding verses might seem to endanger our falling short of what is
 requisite for the present life, and so being left destitute, our Lord
 now comes to speak to that point.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt6_25"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>25. Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought</B>--"Be not 
 solicitous." The English word "thought," when our version was made, 
 expressed this idea of "solicitude," "anxious concern"--as may be seen
 in any old English classic; and in the same sense it is used in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:5">1Sa 9:5</A>,

 &c. But this sense of the word has now nearly gone out, and so the mere
 English reader is apt to be perplexed. <I>Thought</I> or forethought, 
 for temporal things--in the sense of reflection, consideration--is 
 required alike by Scripture and common sense. It is that anxious 
 solicitude, that oppressive care, which springs from unbelieving doubts 
 and misgivings, which alone is here condemned. (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:6">Php 4:6</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for
 your body, what ye shall put on</B>--In Luke 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:29">Lu 12:29</A>)

 our Lord adds, "neither be ye unsettled"--not "of doubtful mind," as in 
 our version.  When "careful (or 'full of care') about nothing," but 
 committing all in prayer and supplication with thanksgiving unto God, 
 the apostle assures us that "the peace of God, which passeth all 
 understanding, shall keep our hearts and minds in Christ Jesus"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:6,7">Php 4:6, 7</A>);

 that is, shall guard both our feelings and our thoughts from undue 
 agitation, and keep them in a holy calm. But when we commit our whole 
 temporal condition to the wit of our own minds, we get into that 
 "unsettled" state against which our Lord exhorts His disciples.

 <B>Is not the life more than meat</B>--food.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 life and raiment to clothe the body?</P>

 <B>for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your
 heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</B>--nobler
 in yourselves and dearer to God. The argument here is from the greater
 to the less; but how rich in detail! The brute creation--void of
 reason--are incapable of sowing, reaping, and storing: yet your heavenly
 Father suffers them not helplessly to perish, but sustains them without
 any of those processes. Will He see, then, His own children using all
 the means which reason dictates for procuring the things needful for the
 body--looking up to Himself at every step--and yet leave them to starve?</P>

 <B>27. Which of you, by taking thought</B>--anxious solicitude.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>can add one cubit unto his stature?</B>--"Stature" can hardly be the 
 thing intended here: first, because the subject is the <I>prolongation 
 of life,</I> by the supply of its necessaries of food and clothing: and 
 next, because no one would dream of adding a cubit--or a foot and a 
 half--to his stature, while in the corresponding passage in Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:25,26">Lu 12:25, 26</A>)

 the thing intended is represented as "that thing which is
 <I>least.</I>" But if we take the word in its primary sense of 
 "<I>age</I>" (for "stature" is but a secondary sense) the idea will be 
 this, "Which of you, however anxiously you vex yourselves about it, can 
 add so much as a step to the length of your life's journey?" To compare 
 the length of life to measures of this nature is not foreign to the 
 language of Scripture (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:5,2Ti+4:7">Ps 39:5;
 2Ti 4:7</A>,

 In this the best critics now agree.</P>

 used for fuel. (See

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>shall He not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</B>--The argument
 here is something fresh. Gorgeous as is the array of the flowers that
 deck the fields, surpassing all artificial human grandeur, it is for but
 a brief moment; you are ravished with it to-day, and to-morrow it is
 gone; your own hands have seized and cast it into the oven: Shall, then,
 God's children, so dear to Him, and instinct with a life that cannot
 die, be left naked? He does not say, Shall they not be more beauteously
 arrayed? but, Shall He not much more <I>clothe</I> them? that being all
 He will have them regard as secured to them (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:5">Heb 13:5</A>).

 The expression, "Little-faithed ones," which our Lord applies once and 
 again to His disciples

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:26,14:31,16:8">Mt 8:26; 14:31; 16:8</A>),

 can hardly be regarded as rebuking any actual manifestations of
 unbelief at that early period, and before such an audience. It is His 
 way of gently chiding the <I>spirit</I> of unbelief, so natural even to 
 the best, who are surrounded by a world of sense, and of kindling a 
 generous desire to shake it off.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt6_31"> </A>

 their aspirations and engage their supreme attention, the heathen
 naturally pursue present objects as their chief, their only good. To
 what an elevation above these does Jesus here lift His disciples!

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these
 things</B>--How precious this word! Food and raiment are pronounced
 <I>needful</I> to God's children; and He who could say, "No man knoweth the
 Father but the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:27">Mt 11:27</A>),

 says with an authority which none but Himself could claim, "Your 
 heavenly Father <I>knoweth</I> that ye have need of all these things." 
 Will not that suffice you, O ye needy ones of the household of 
 faith?</P>

 <A NAME="Mt6_33"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>33. But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and
 all these things shall be added unto you</B>--This is the great summing
 up. Strictly speaking, it has to do only with the subject of the present
 section--the right state of the heart with reference to heavenly and
 earthly things; but being couched in the form of a brief general
 directory, it is so comprehensive in its grasp as to embrace the whole
 subject of this discourse. And, as if to make this the more evident, the
 two keynotes of this great sermon seem purposely struck in it--"the
 <FONT SIZE=-1>KINGDOM</FONT>" and "the
 <FONT SIZE=-1>RIGHTEOUSNESS</FONT>" of the kingdom--as the grand objects,
 in the supreme pursuit of which all things needful for the present life
 will be added to us. The precise sense of every word in this golden
 verse should be carefully weighed. "<I>The kingdom of God</I>" is the primary
 subject of the Sermon on the Mount--that kingdom which the God of heaven
 is erecting in this fallen world, within which are all the spiritually
 recovered and inwardly subject portion of the family of Adam, under
 Messiah as its Divine Head and King. "<I>The righteousness thereof</I>" is
 the character of all such, so amply described and variously illustrated
 in the foregoing portions of this discourse. The "<I>seeking</I>" of these
 is the making them the object of supreme choice and pursuit; and the
 seeking of them "<I>first</I>" is the seeking of them before and above all
 else. The "<I>all these things</I>" which shall in that case be added to us
 are just the "all these things" which the last words of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:32">Mt 6:32</A>
 
 assured us "our heavenly Father knoweth that we have need of"; that is,
 all we require for the present life. And when our Lord says they shall
 be "<I>added,</I>" it is implied, as a matter of course, that the seekers
 of the kingdom and its righteousness shall have these as their proper
 and primary portion: the rest being their gracious reward for <I>not</I>
 seeking them. (See an illustration of the principle of this in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:11,12">2Ch 1:11, 12</A>).

 That these verses are entirely supplementary is the simplest and most
 natural view of them. All attempts to make out any evident connection
 with the immediately preceding context are, in our judgment, forced.
 But, though supplementary, these counsels are far from being of
 subordinate importance. On the contrary, they involve some of the most
 delicate and vital duties of the Christian life. In the vivid form in
 which they are here presented, perhaps they could not have been
 introduced with the same effect under any of the foregoing heads; but
 they spring out of the same great principles, and are but other forms
 and manifestations of the same evangelical "righteousness."</P>

 <I>Censorious Judgment</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:1-5">Mt 7:1-5</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>1. Judge not, that ye be not judged</B>--To "judge" here does not exactly
 mean to pronounce condemnatory judgment, nor does it refer to simple
 judging at all, whether favorable or the reverse. The context makes it
 clear that the thing here condemned is that disposition to look
 unfavorably on the character and actions of others, which leads
 invariably to the pronouncing of rash, unjust, and unlovely judgments
 upon them. No doubt it is the judgments so pronounced which are here
 spoken of; but what our Lord aims at is the spirit out of which they
 spring. Provided we eschew this unlovely spirit, we are not only
 warranted to sit in judgment upon a brother's character and actions, but
 in the exercise of a necessary discrimination are often constrained to
 do so for our own guidance. It is the violation of the law of love
 involved in the exercise of a censorious disposition which alone is here
 condemned. And the argument against it--"that ye be not
 judged"--confirms this: "that your own character and actions be not
 pronounced upon with the like severity"; that is, at the great day.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt7_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. For with what judgments ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what
 measure ye mete</B>--whatever standard of judgment ye apply to others.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>it shall be measured to you again</B>--This proverbial maxim is used by our
 Lord in other connections--as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:24">Mr 4:24</A>,

 and with a slightly different application in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:38">Lu 6:38</A>

 --as a great principle in the divine administration. Unkind judgment of 
 others will be judicially returned upon ourselves, in the day when God 
 shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ. But, as in many other 
 cases under the divine administration, such harsh judgment gets 
 self-punished even here. For people shrink from contact with those who 
 systematically deal out harsh judgment upon others--naturally 
 concluding that they themselves may be the next victims--and feel 
 impelled in self-defense, when exposed to it, to roll back upon the 
 assailant his own censures.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt7_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. And why beholdest thou the mote</B>--"splinter," here very well rendered
 "mote," denoting any small fault.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in
 thine own eye?</B>--denoting the much greater fault which we overlook in
 ourselves.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt7_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see
 clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye</B>--Our Lord uses a
 most hyperbolical, but not unfamiliar figure, to express the monstrous
 inconsistency of this conduct. The "hypocrisy" which, not without
 indignation, He charges it with, consists in the pretense of a zealous
 and compassionate charity, which cannot possibly be real in one who
 suffers worse faults to lie uncorrected in himself. He only is fit to be
 a reprover of others who jealously and severely judges himself. Such
 persons will not only be slow to undertake the office of censor on their
 neighbors, but, when constrained in faithfulness to deal with them, will
 make it evident that they do it with <I>reluctance</I> and not
 satisfaction, with <I>moderation</I> and not exaggeration, with <I>love</I>
 and not harshness.</P>

 <B>6. Give not that which is holy unto the dogs</B>--savage or snarling
 haters of truth and righteousness.

 <B>neither cast ye your pearls before swine</B>--the impure or coarse, who
 are incapable of appreciating the priceless jewels of Christianity. In
 the East, dogs are wilder and more gregarious, and, feeding on carrion
 and garbage, are coarser and fiercer than the same animals in the West.
 Dogs and swine, besides being ceremonially unclean, were peculiarly
 repulsive to the Jews, and indeed to the ancients generally.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>lest they trample them under their feet</B>--as swine do.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and turn again and rend you</B>--as dogs do. Religion is brought into
 contempt, and its professors insulted, when it is forced upon those who
 cannot value it and will not have it. But while the indiscriminately
 zealous have need of this caution, let us be on our guard against too
 readily setting our neighbors down as dogs and swine, and excusing
 ourselves from endeavoring to do them good on this poor plea.</P>

 <I>Prayer</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:7-11">Mt 7:7-11</A>).
 
 Enough, one might think, had been said on this subject in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:5-15">Mt 6:5-15</A>.
 
 But the difficulty of the foregoing duties seems to have recalled the
 subject, and this gives it quite a new turn. "How shall we ever be able
 to carry out such precepts as these, of tender, holy, yet discriminating
 love?" might the humble disciple inquire. "Go to God with it," is our
 Lord's reply; but He expresses this with a fulness which leaves nothing
 to be desired, urging now not only confidence, but importunity in
 prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>7. Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and
 it shall be opened unto you</B>--Though there seems evidently a climax
 here, expressive of more and more importunity, yet each of these terms
 used presents what we desire of God in a different light. We <I>ask</I> for
 what we <I>wish;</I> we <I>seek</I> for what we <I>miss;</I> we <I>knock</I> for that
 from which we feel ourselves <I>shut out.</I> Answering to this threefold
 representation is the triple assurance of success to our believing
 efforts. "But ah!" might some humble disciple say, "I cannot persuade
 myself that <I>I</I> have any interest with God." To meet this, our Lord
 repeats the triple assurance He had just given, but in such a form as to
 silence every such complaint.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt7_8"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>8. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth;
 and to him that knocketh it shall be opened</B>--Of course, it is presumed
 that he asks aright--that is, in faith--and with an honest purpose to
 make use of what he receives. "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of
 God. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering (undecided whether to be
 altogether on the Lord's side). For he that wavereth is like a wave of
 the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For
 <I>let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:5-7">Jas 1:5-7</A>).

 Hence, "Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may

 Father of all fathers have towards His pleading children! In the 
 corresponding passage in Luke (see on

 <A HREF="JFB42.htm#Lu11_13">Lu 11:13</A>), 

 instead of "good things," our Lord asks whether He will not much more 
 give <I>the Holy Spirit</I> to them that ask Him. At this early stage 
 of His ministry, and before such an audience, He seems to avoid such 
 sharp doctrinal teaching as was more accordant with His plan at the 
 riper stage indicated in Luke, and in addressing His own disciples 
 exclusively.</P>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for this is the law and the prophets</B>--"This is the substance of all
 relative duty; all Scripture in a nutshell." Incomparable summary! How
 well called "the royal law!"

 It is true that similar maxims are found floating in the writings of 
 the cultivated Greeks and Romans, and naturally enough in the 
 Rabbinical writings. But so expressed as it is here--in immediate 
 connection with, and as the sum of <I>such</I> duties as has been just 
 enjoined, and such principles as had been before taught--it is to be 
 found nowhere else.  And the best commentary upon this fact is, that 
 never till our Lord came down thus to teach did men effectually and 
 widely exemplify it in their practice. The precise sense of the maxim 
 is best referred to common sense. It is not, of course, what--in our 
 wayward, capricious, gasping moods--we should <I>wish</I> that men 
 would do to us, that we are to hold ourselves bound to do to them; but 
 only what--in the exercise of an impartial judgment, and putting 
 ourselves in their place--we consider it reasonable that they should do 
 to us, that we are to do to them.</P>

 <I>Conclusion of the Sermon on the Mount</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:13-27">Mt 7:13-27</A>).

 "The righteousness of the kingdom," so amply described, both in 
 principle and in detail, would be seen to involve <I>self-sacrifice</I> 
 at every step. Multitudes would never face this. But it must be faced, 
 else the consequences will be fatal. This would divide all within the 
 sound of these truths into two classes: the many, who will follow the 
 path of ease and self-indulgence--end where it might; and the few, who, 
 bent on eternal safety above everything else, take the way that leads 
 to it--at whatever cost. This gives occasion to the two opening verses 
 of this application.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>13. Enter ye in at the strait gate</B>--as if hardly wide enough to admit
 one at all. This expresses the difficulty of the first right step in
 religion, involving, as it does, a triumph over all our natural
 inclinations. Hence the still stronger expression in Luke 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:24">Lu 13:24</A>),
 
 "Strive to enter in at the strait gate."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for wide is the gate</B>--easily entered.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and broad is the way</B>--easily trodden.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>that leadeth to destruction, and</B>--thus lured "many there be which go
 in thereat."</P>

 <A NAME="Mt7_14"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>14. Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth
 unto life</B>--In other words, the whole course is as difficult as the
 first step; and (so it comes to pass that).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>few there be that find it</B>--The recommendation of the broad way is the
 ease with which it is trodden and the abundance of company to be found
 in it. It is sailing with a fair wind and a favorable tide. The natural
 inclinations are not crossed, and fears of the issue, if not easily
 hushed, are in the long run effectually subdued. The one disadvantage of
 this course is its end--it "leadeth to destruction." The great Teacher
 says it, and says it as "One having authority." To the supposed
 injustice or harshness of this He never once adverts. He leaves it to
 be inferred that such a course righteously, naturally, necessarily so
 ends. But whether men see this or no, here He lays down the law of the
 kingdom, and leaves it with us. As to the other way, the disadvantage of
 it lies in its narrowness and solicitude. Its very first step involves a
 revolution in all our purposes and plans for life, and a surrender of
 all that is dear to natural inclination, while all that follows is but a
 repetition of the first great act of self-sacrifice. No wonder, then,
 that few find and few are found in it. But it has one advantage--it
 "leadeth unto life." Some critics take "the gate" here, not for the
 first, but the last step in religion; since gates seldom open into
 roads, but roads usually terminate in a gate, leading straight to a
 mansion. But as this would make our Lord's words to have a very inverted
 and unnatural form as they stand, it is better, with the majority of
 critics, to view them as we have done. But since such teaching would be
 as unpopular as the way itself, our Lord next forewarns His hearers that
 preachers of smooth things--the true heirs and representatives of the
 false prophets of old--would be rife enough in the new kingdom.</P>

 teaching, which is the proper fruit of the tree.

 <B>Do men gather grapes of thorns</B>--any kind of prickly plant.

 interpreter of the actions of our life--no one who knows how the Church
 of Rome makes a merit of actions, quite apart from the motives that
 prompt them, and how the same tendency manifests itself from time to
 time even among Protestant Christians, can think it too obvious to be
 insisted on by the teachers of divine truth. Here follows a wholesome
 digression.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt7_19"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>19. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and

 <B>20. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them</B>--that is, But the
 point I now press is not so much the end of such, as the means of
 detecting them; and this, as already said, is their fruits. The
 hypocrisy of teachers now leads to a solemn warning against religious
 hypocrisy in general.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt7_21"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>21. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord</B>--the reduplication
 of the title "Lord" denoting zeal in according it to Christ (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:45">Mr 14:45</A>).

 Yet our Lord claims and expects this of all His disciples, as when He
 washed their feet: "Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so 
 I am"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:13">Joh 13:13</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of
 my Father which is in heaven</B>--that will which it had been the great
 object of this discourse to set forth. Yet our Lord says warily, not
 "the will of <I>your</I> Father," but "of <I>My</I> Father"; thus claiming a
 relationship to His Father with which His disciples might not
 intermeddle, and which He never lets down. And He so speaks here to give
 authority to His asseverations. But now He rises higher still--not
 formally <I>announcing</I> Himself as the Judge, but intimating what men
 will say to Him, and He to them, <I>when</I> He sits as their final judge.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt7_22"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>22. Many will say to me in that day</B>--What day? It is emphatically
 unnamed. But it is the day to which He had just referred, when men shall
 "enter" or not enter "into the kingdom of heaven." (See a similar way of
 speaking of "that day" in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:12,4:8">2Ti 1:12; 4:8</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Lord, Lord</B>--The reiteration denotes surprise. "What, Lord? How is this?
 Are <I>we</I> to be disowned?"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>have we not prophesied</B>--or, "publicly taught." As one of the special
 gifts of the Spirit in the early Church, it has the sense of "inspired
 and authoritative teaching," and is ranked next to the apostleship. (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:28,Eph+4:11">1Co 12:28;
 Eph 4:11</A>). 

 In this sense it is used here, as appears from what follows.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>in thy name</B>--or, "to thy name," and so in the two following
 clauses--"having reference to Thy name as the sole power in which we did
 it."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many
 wonderful works</B>--or, miracles. These are selected as three examples
 of the highest services rendered to the Christian cause, and through the
 power of Christ's own name, invoked for that purpose; He Himself, too,
 responding to the call. And the threefold repetition of the question,
 each time in the same form, expresses in the liveliest manner the
 astonishment of the speakers at the view now taken of them.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt7_23"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>23. And then will I profess unto them</B>--or, openly proclaim--tearing
 off the mask.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>I never knew you</B>--What they claimed--intimacy with Christ--is 
 just what He repudiates, and with a certain scornful dignity. "Our 
 acquaintance was not broken off--there never was any."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>depart from me</B>--(Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:41">Mt 25:41</A>).

 The connection here gives these words an awful significance. They 
 claimed intimacy with Christ, and in the corresponding passage,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:26">Lu 13:26</A>,

 are represented as having gone out and in with Him on familiar terms. 
 "So much the worse for you," He replies: "I bore with that long enough; 
 but now--begone!"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>ye that work iniquity</B>--not "that <I>wrought</I> iniquity"; for 
 they are represented as fresh from the scenes and acts of it as they 
 stand before the Judge. (See on the almost identical, but even more
 vivid and awful, description of the scene in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:24-27">Lu 13:24-27</A>).

 That the apostle alludes to these very words in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:19">2Ti 2:19</A>

 there can hardly be any doubt--"Nevertheless the foundation of God 
 standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord <I>knoweth</I> them that are 
 His. And, Let every one that nameth the <I>name</I> of Christ depart 
 from iniquity."</P>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:12">Lu 5:12</A>.

 Much has been written on this disease of leprosy, but certain points 
 remain still doubtful. All that needs be said here is that it was a 
 cutaneous disease, of a loathsome, diffusive, and, there is reason to 
 believe, when thoroughly pronounced, incurable character; that though 
 in its distinctive features it is still found in several countries--as 
 Arabia, Egypt, and South Africa--it prevailed, in the form of what is 
 called white leprosy, to an unusual extent, and from a very early 
 period, among the Hebrews; and that it thus furnished to the whole 
 nation a familiar and affecting symbol of <FONT SIZE=-1>SIN</FONT>, 
 considered as (1) <I>loathsome,</I> (2) <I>spreading,</I> (3) 
 <I>incurable.</I> And while the ceremonial ordinances for detection and 
 cleansing prescribed in this case by the law of Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:1-14:57">Le 13:1-14:57</A>)

 held forth a coming remedy "for sin and for uncleanness"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:7,2Ki+5:1,7,10,13,14">Ps 51:7;
 2Ki 5:1, 7, 10, 13, 14</A>), 

 the numerous cases of leprosy with which our Lord came in contact, and
 the glorious cures of them which He wrought, were a fitting 
 manifestation of the work which He came to accomplish. In this view, it 
 deserves to be noticed that the first of our Lord's miracles of healing 
 recorded by Matthew is this cure of a leper.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and worshipped him</B>--in what sense we shall presently see. Mark says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:40">Mr 1:40</A>),

 he came, "beseeching and kneeling to Him," and Luke says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:12">Lu 5:12</A>),
 
 "he fell on his face."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean</B>--As this is the
 only cure of leprosy recorded by all the three first Evangelists, it was
 probably the first case of the kind; and if so, this leper's faith in
 the power of Christ must have been formed in him by what he had heard of
 His other cures. And how striking a faith is it! He does not say he
 <I>believed</I> Him able, but with a brevity expressive of a confidence
 that knew no doubt, he says simply, "Thou canst." But of Christ's
 willingness to heal him he was not so sure. It needed more knowledge of
 Jesus than he could be supposed to have to assure him of that. But one
 thing he was sure of, that He had but to "will" it. This shows with what
 "worship" of Christ this leper fell on his face before Him. Clear
 theological knowledge of the Person of Christ was not then possessed
 even by those who were most with Him and nearest to Him. Much less could
 full insight into all that we know of the Only-begotten of the Father be
 expected of this leper. But he who at that moment felt and owned that to
 heal an incurable disease needed but the <I>fiat</I> of the Person who
 stood before him, had assuredly that very faith in the germ which now
 casts its crown before Him that loved us, and would at any time die for
 His blessed name.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt8_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. And Jesus</B>--or "He," according to another reading,--"moved with
 compassion," says Mark 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:41">Mr 1:41</A>);
 
 a precious addition.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>put forth his hand, and touched him</B>--Such a touch occasioned
 ceremonial defilement

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+5:3">Le 5:3</A>);

 even as the leper's coming near enough for contact was against the
 Levitical regulations

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:46">Le 13:46</A>).

 But as the man's faith told him there would be no case for such 
 regulations if the cure he hoped to experience should be accomplished, 
 so He who had healing in His wings transcended all such statutes.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>saying, I will; be thou clean</B>--How majestic those two words! By not
 assuring the man of His <I>power</I> to heal him, He delightfully sets His
 seal to the man's previous confession of that power; and by assuring him
 of the one thing of which he had any doubt, and for which he waited--His
 <I>will</I> to do it--He makes a claim as divine as the cure which
 immediately followed it.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>And immediately his leprosy was cleansed</B>--Mark, more emphatic, says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:42">Mr 1:42</A>),

 "And as soon as He had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from
 him, and he was cleansed"--as perfectly as instantaneously. What a 
 contrast this to modern pretended cures!</P>

 <B>for a testimony unto them</B>--a palpable witness that the Great Healer
 had indeed come, and that "God had visited His people." What the sequel
 was, our Evangelist Matthew does not say; but Mark thus gives it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:45">Mr 1:45</A>):

 "But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the
 matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, 
 but was without in desert places: and they came to Him from every 
 quarter." Thus--by an over-zealous, though most natural and not very 
 culpable, infringement of the injunction to keep the matter quiet--was 
 our Lord, to some extent, thwarted in His movements. As His whole 
 course was sublimely noiseless

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:19">Mt 12:19</A>),

 so we find Him repeatedly taking steps to prevent matters prematurely 
 coming to a crisis with Him. (But see on

 <A HREF="JFB41.htm#Mr5_19">Mr 5:19, 20</A>).
 
 "And He withdrew Himself," adds Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:16">Lu 5:16</A>),

 "into the wilderness, and prayed"; retreating from the popular 
 excitement into the secret place of the Most High, and thus coming 
 forth as dew upon the mown grass, and as showers that water the earth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:6">Ps 72:6</A>).

 And this is the secret both of strength and of sweetness in the 
 servants and followers of Christ in every age.</P>

 The incidents here are two: in the corresponding passage of Luke they 
 are three. Here they are introduced before the mission of the Twelve: 
 in Luke, when our Lord was making preparation for His final journey to 
 Jerusalem. But to conclude from this, as some good critics do (as 
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>, E<FONT SIZE=-1>LLICOTT</FONT>, &c.) that
 one of these incidents at least occurred twice--which led to the
 mention of the others at the two different times--is too artificial.
 Taking them, then, as one set of occurrences, the question arises. Are
 they recorded by Matthew or by Luke in their proper place?
 N<FONT SIZE=-1>EANDER</FONT>,
 S<FONT SIZE=-1>CHLEIERMACHER</FONT>, and
 O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT> adhere to Luke's
 order; while M<FONT SIZE=-1>EYER</FONT>,
 D<FONT SIZE=-1>E</FONT>
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>ETTE</FONT>, and
 L<FONT SIZE=-1>ANGE</FONT> prefer that of Matthew. Probably
 the first incident is here in its right place. But as the command, in
 the second incident, to preach the kingdom of God, would scarcely have
 been given at so early a period, it is likely that it and the third
 incident have their true place in Luke. Taking these three incidents up
 here then we have,</P>

 I. <I>The Rash or Precipitate Disciple</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>20. And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of
 the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head</B>--Few as there were of the scribes who attached
 themselves to Jesus, it
 would appear, from his calling Him Teacher, that this one was a
 "disciple" in that looser sense of the word in which it is applied to
 the crowds who flocked after Him, with more or less conviction that His
 claims were well founded. But from the answer which he received we are
 led to infer that there was more of transient emotion--of temporary
 impulse--than of intelligent principle in the speech. The preaching of
 Christ had riveted and charmed him; his heart had swelled; his
 enthusiasm had been kindled; and in this state of mind he will go
 anywhere with Him, and feels impelled to tell Him so. "Wilt thou?"
 replies the Lord Jesus. "Knowest thou whom thou art pledging thyself to
 follow, and whither haply He may lead thee? No warm home, no downy
 pillow has He for thee: He has them not for Himself. The foxes are not
 without their holes, nor do the birds of the air lack their nests; but
 the Son of man has to depend on the hospitality of others, and borrow
 the pillow whereon He lays His head." How affecting is this reply! And
 yet He rejects not this man's offer, nor refuses him the liberty to
 follow Him. Only He will have him know what he is doing, and "count the
 cost." He will have him weigh well the real nature and the strength of
 his attachment, whether it be such as will abide in the day of trial. If
 so, he will be right welcome, for Christ puts none away. But it seems
 too plain that in this case that had not been done. And so we have
 called this the Rash or Precipitate Disciple.</P>

 As this is more fully given in Luke 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:59">Lu 9:59</A>),

 we must take both together. "And He said unto another of His disciples, 
 Follow Me. But he said,"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. But Jesus said unto
 him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead</B>--or, as more
 definitely in Luke, "Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and
 preach the kingdom of God" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:60">Lu 9:60</A>).

 This disciple did not, like the former, volunteer his services, but is 
 called by the Lord Jesus, not only to follow, but to preach Him. And he 
 is quite willing; only he is not ready just yet. "Lord, I <I>will;</I> 
 but"--"There is a difficulty in the way just now; but that once 
 removed, I am Thine." What now is this difficulty? Was his father 
 actually dead--lying a corpse--having only to be buried? Impossible. As 
 it was the practice, as noticed on

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:12">Lu 7:12</A>,
 
 to bury on the day of death, it is not very likely that this disciple
 would have been here at all if his father had just breathed his last;
 nor would the Lord, if He was there, have hindered him discharging the
 last duties of a son to a father. No doubt it was the common case of a
 son having a frail or aged father, not likely to live long, whose head
 he thinks it his duty to see under the ground ere he goes abroad. "This
 aged father of mine will soon be removed; and if I might but delay till
 I see him decently interred, I should then be free to preach the kingdom
 of God wherever duty might call me." This view of the case will explain
 the curt reply, "Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach
 the kingdom of God." Like all the other paradoxical sayings of our Lord,
 the key to it is the different senses--a higher and a lower--in which
 the same word "dead" is used: There are two kingdoms of God in existence
 upon earth; the kingdom of nature, and the kingdom of grace: To the one
 kingdom all the children of this world, even the most ungodly, are fully
 alive; to the other, only the children of light: The reigning irreligion
 consists not in indifference to the common humanities of social life,
 but to things spiritual and eternal: Fear not, therefore, that your
 father will in your absence be neglected, and that when he breathes his
 last there will not be relatives and friends ready enough to do to him
 the last offices of kindness. Your wish to discharge these yourself is
 natural, and to be allowed to do it a privilege not lightly to be
 foregone. But the kingdom of God lies now all neglected and needy: Its
 more exalted character few discern; to its paramount claims few are
 alive: and to "preach" it fewer still are qualified and called: But thou
 art: The Lord therefore hath need of thee: Leave, then, those claims of
 nature, high though they be, to those who are dead to the still higher
 claims of the kingdom of grace, which God is now erecting upon
 earth--Let the dead bury their dead; but go thou and preach the kingdom
 of God. And so have we here the genuine, but Procrastinating or
 Entangled Disciple.</P>

 III. <I>The Irresolute or Wavering Disciple</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:62">Lu 9:62</A>:

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B><I>And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough,
 and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</I></B> But for the very
 different replies given, we should hardly have discerned the difference
 between this and the second case: the one man called, indeed, and the
 other volunteering, as did the first; but both seemingly alike willing,
 and only having a difficulty in their way just at that moment. But, by
 help of what is said respectively to each, we perceive the great
 difference between the two cases. From the warning given against
 "looking back," it is evident that this man's discipleship was not yet
 <I>thorough,</I> his separation from the world not entire. It is not a case
 of <I>going</I> back, but of <I>looking</I> back; and as there is here a
 manifest reference to the case of "Lot's wife" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:26">Ge 19:26</A>;

 and see on

 <A HREF="JFB42.htm#Lu17_32">Lu 17:32</A>), 

 we see that it is not <I>actual return</I> to the world that we have 
 here to deal with, but a <I>reluctance to break with it.</I> The figure 
 of putting one's hand to the plough and looking back is an exceedingly 
 vivid one, and to an agricultural people most impressive. As ploughing 
 requires an eye intent on the furrow to be made, and is marred the 
 instant one turns about, so will they come short of salvation who 
 prosecute the work of God with a distracted attention, a divided heart. 
 The reference may be chiefly to ministers; but the application at least 
 is general. As the image seems plainly to have been suggested by the 
 case of Elijah and Elisha, a difficulty may be raised, requiring a 
 moment's attention.  When Elijah cast his mantle about Elisha, which 
 the youth quite understood to mean appointing him his successor, he was 
 ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen, the last pair held by himself. 
 Leaving his oxen, he ran after the prophet, and said, "Let me, I pray 
 thee, kiss my father and my mother, and [then] I will follow thee." Was 
 this said <I>in the same spirit</I> with the same speech uttered by our 
 disciple?  Let us see. "And Elijah said unto him, Go back again: for 
 what have I done to thee." Commentators take this to mean that Elijah 
 had really done nothing to hinder him from going on with all his 
 ordinary duties.  But to us it seems clear that Elijah's intention was 
 to try what manner of spirit the youth was of:--"Kiss thy father and 
 mother? And why not?  By all means, go home and stay with them; for 
 what have I done to thee?  I did but throw a mantle about thee; but 
 what of that?" If this was his meaning, Elisha thoroughly apprehended 
 and nobly met it. "He returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, 
 and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen 
 (the wood of his ploughing implements), and gave unto the people, and 
 they did eat: then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto 
 him"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:19-21">1Ki 19:19-21</A>).

 We know not if even his father and mother had time to be called to this 
 hasty feast. But this much is plain, that, though in affluent 
 circumstances, he gave up his lower calling, with all its prospects, 
 for the higher and at that time perilous, office to which he was 
 called. What now is the bearing of these two cases? Did Elisha do wrong 
 in bidding them farewell with whom he was associated in his early 
 calling? Or, if not, would this disciple have done wrong if he had done 
 the same thing, and in the same spirit, with Elisha? Clearly not.  
 Elisha's doing it proved that he could <I>with safety</I> do it; and 
 our Lord's warning is not against bidding them farewell which were at 
 home at his house, but against the probable <I>fatal consequences</I> 
 of that step; lest the embraces of earthly relationship should prove
 too strong for him, and he should never return to follow Christ. 
 Accordingly, we have called this the Irresolute or Wavering 
 Disciple.</P>

 <B>9. And as Jesus passed forth from thence</B>--that is, from the scene of
 the paralytic's cure in Capernaum, towards the shore of the Sea of
 Galilee, on which that town lay. Mark, as usual, pictures the scene more
 in detail, thus 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:13">Mr 2:13</A>):

 "And He went forth again by the seaside; and all the multitude resorted
 unto Him, and He taught them"--or, "kept teaching them." "And as He 
 passed by"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he saw a man, named Matthew</B>--the writer of this precious Gospel, 
 who here, with singular modesty and brevity, relates the story of his 
 own calling. In Mark and Luke he is called <I>Levi,</I> which seems to 
 have been his family name. In their lists of the twelve apostles, 
 however, Mark and Luke give him the name of Matthew, which seems to 
 have been the name by which he was known as a disciple. While he 
 himself sinks his family name, he is careful not to sink his 
 occupation, the obnoxious associations with which he would place over 
 against the grace that called him from it, and made him an apostle.  
 (See on

 <A HREF="#Mt10_3">Mt 10:3</A>).
 
 Mark alone tells us 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:14">Mr 2:14</A>)

 that he was "the son of Alph&aelig;us"--the same, probably, with the
 father of James the Less. From this and other considerations it is 
 pretty certain that he must at least have heard of our Lord before this 
 meeting. Unnecessary doubts, even from an early period, have been 
 raised about the identity of Levi and Matthew. No capable jury, with 
 the evidence before them which we have in the Gospels, would hesitate 
 in giving a unanimous verdict of identity.

 <B>sitting at the receipt of custom</B>--as a publican, which Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:27">Lu 5:27</A>)

 calls him. It means the place of receipt, the toll house or booth in 
 which the collector sat. Being in this case by the seaside, it might be 
 the ferry tax for the transit of persons and goods across the lake, 
 which he collected.  (See on

 <A HREF="#Mt5_46">Mt 5:46</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and he saith unto him, Follow me</B>--Witching words these, from the lips

 in the hearts of those they were spoken to.

 <B>10. And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house</B>--The
 modesty of our Evangelist signally appears here. Luke says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:29">Lu 5:29</A>)

 that "Levi made Him <I>a great feast,</I>" or "reception," while
 Matthew merely says, "He sat at meat"; and Mark and Luke say that it 
 was in Levi's "own house," while Matthew merely says, "He sat at meat 
 <I>in the house.</I>" Whether this feast was made now, or not till 
 afterwards, is a point of some importance in the order of events, and 
 not agreed among harmonists.  The probability is that it did not take 
 place till a considerable time afterwards. For Matthew, who ought 
 surely to know what took place while his Lord was speaking at his own 
 table, tells us that the visit of Jairus, the ruler of the synagogue, 
 occurred at that moment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:18">Mt 9:18</A>).
 
 But we know from Mark and Luke that this visit of Jairus did not take
 place till after our Lord's return, at a later period from the country
 of the Gadarenes. (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:21-43,Lu+8:40-56">Mr 5:21,
 &c., and Lu 8:40</A>,

 &c.). We conclude, therefore, that the feast was not made in the
 novelty of his discipleship, but after Matthew had had time to be 
 somewhat established in the faith; when returning to Capernaum, his 
 compassion for old friends, of his own calling and character, led him 
 to gather them together that they might have an opportunity of hearing 
 the gracious words which proceeded out of His Master's mouth, if haply 
 they might experience a like change.

 <B>They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick</B>--that
 is, "Ye deem yourselves whole; My mission, therefore, is not to you: The
 physician's business is with the sick; therefore eat I with publicans

 <B>I will have mercy, and not sacrifice</B>--that is, the one rather than
 the other. "Sacrifice," the chief part of the ceremonial law, is here
 put for a religion of literal adherence to mere rules; while "mercy"
 expresses such compassion for the fallen as seeks to lift them up. The
 duty of keeping aloof from the polluted, in the sense of "having no
 fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness," is obvious enough;
 but to understand this as prohibiting such intercourse with them as is
 necessary to their recovery, is to abuse it. This was what these
 pharisaical religionists did, and this is what our Lord here exposes.

 <B>for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners

 they are undisputed. We have here just the former statement stripped of
 its figure. "The righteous" are the whole; "sinners," the sick. When 
 Christ "called" the latter, as He did Matthew, and probably some of 
 those publicans and sinners whom he had invited to meet Him, it was to 
 heal them of their spiritual maladies, or save their souls: "The 
 righteous," like those miserable self-satisfied Pharisees, "He sent 
 empty away."</P>

 <I>Two Blind Men Healed</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:27-31">Mt 9:27-31</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>27. And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed
 him</B>--hearing, doubtless, as in a later case is expressed, "that
 Jesus passed by" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:30">Mt 20:30</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>crying, and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us</B>--It is
 remarkable that in the only other recorded case in which the blind
 applied to Jesus for their sight, and obtained it, they addressed Him,
 over and over again, by this one Messianic title, so well known--"Son of
 David" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:30">Mt 20:30</A>).

 Can there be a doubt that their faith fastened on such great Messianic 
 promises as this, "Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened," &c.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:5">Isa 35:5</A>)?

 and if so, this appeal to Him, as the Consolation of Israel, to do His
 predicted office, would fall with great weight upon the ears of 
 Jesus.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt9_28"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>28. And when he was come into the house</B>--To try their faith and
 patience, He seems to have made them no answer. But

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the blind men came to Him</B>--which, no doubt, was what He desired.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? they
 said unto him, Yea, Lord</B>--Doubtless our Lord's design was not only to
 put their faith to the test by this question, but to deepen it, to raise
 their expectation of a cure, and so prepare them to receive it; and the
 cordial acknowledgment, so touchingly simple, which they immediately
 made to Him of His power to heal them, shows how entirely that object
 was gained.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt9_29"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>29. Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it
 unto you</B>--not, Receive a cure <I>proportioned</I> to your faith, but,
 Receive this cure as <I>granted to</I> your faith. Thus would they carry
 about with them, in their restored vision, a gracious seal of the faith
 which drew it from their compassionate Lord.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt9_30"> </A>

 expression is very strong, denoting great earnestness.</P>

 effect of the possession.</P>

 <B>33. And when the devil</B>--demon.

 given; the object being simply to record the instantaneous restoration
 of the natural faculties on the removal of the malignant oppression of
 them, the form which the popular astonishment took, and the very
 different effect of it upon another class.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in
 Israel</B>--referring, probably, not to this case only, but to
 all those miraculous
 displays of healing power which seemed to promise a new era in the
 history of Israel. Probably they meant by this language to indicate, as
 far as they thought it safe to do so, their inclination to regard Him as
 the promised Messiah.</P>

 became a fixed mode of calumniating them--a theory which would be 
 ridiculous if it were not melancholy as an outburst of the darkest 
 malignity. (See on

 As the Mission of the Twelve supposes the previous choice of them--of
 which our Evangelist gives no account, and which did not take place till
 a later stage of our Lord's public life--it is introduced here out of
 its proper place, which is after what is recorded in

 <B>35. And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their
 synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every
 sickness and every disease <I>among the people</I></B>--The italicized words
 are of more than doubtful authority here, and were probably introduced
 here from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:23">Mt 4:23</A>.

 The language here is so identical with that used in describing the
 first circuit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:23">Mt 4:23</A>),

 that we may presume the work done on both occasions was much the same.  
 It was just a further preparation of the soil, and a fresh sowing of 
 the precious seed.  (See on

 <A HREF="#Mt4_23">Mt 4:23</A>). 

 To these fruitful journeyings of the Redeemer, "with healing in His 
 wings," Peter no doubt alludes, when, in his address to the household 
 of Cornelius, he spoke of "How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the 
 Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all 
 that were oppressed of the devil: for God was with Him"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:36-38">Mt 9:36-38</A>).

 He had now returned from His preaching and healing circuit, and the 
 result, as at the close of the first one, was the gathering of a vast 
 and motley multitude around Him. After a whole night spent in prayer, 
 He had called His more immediate disciples, and from them had solemnly 
 chosen the twelve; then, coming down from the mountain, on which this 
 was transacted, to the multitudes that waited for Him below, He had 
 addressed to them--as we take it--that discourse which bears so strong 
 a resemblance to the Sermon on the Mount that many critics take it to 
 be the same. (See on

 and

 <A HREF="#Mt5_1">Mt 5:1</A>, 

 Introductory Remarks). Soon after this, it should seem, the multitudes 
 still hanging on Him, Jesus is touched with their wretched and helpless 
 condition, and acts as is now to be described.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>36. But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on
 them, because they fainted</B>--This reading, however, has hardly any
 authority at all. The true reading doubtless is, "were harassed."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and were scattered abroad</B>--rather, "lying about," "abandoned," or
 "neglected."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>as sheep, having no shepherd</B>--their pitiable condition as wearied
 under bodily fatigue, a vast disorganized mass, being but a faint
 picture of their wretchedness as the victims of pharisaic guidance;
 their souls uncared for, yet drawn after and hanging upon Him. This
 moved the Redeemer's compassion.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt9_37"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>37. Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is 
 plenteous</B>--His eye doubtless rested immediately on the Jewish 
 field, but this he saw widening into the vast field of "the world"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:38">Mt 13:38</A>),

 teeming with souls having to be gathered to Him.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but the labourers</B>--men divinely qualified and called to
 gather them in--"are few."</P>

 <A NAME="Mt9_38"> </A>

 <B>38. Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest</B>--the great Lord and

 The last three verses of the ninth chapter form the proper introduction 
 to the Mission of the Twelve, as is evident from the remarkable fact 
 that the Mission of the Seventy was prefaced by the very same words.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>1. And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them
 power</B>--The word signifies both "power," and "authority" or "right."
 Even if it were not evident that here both ideas are included, we find
 both words expressly used in the parallel passage of Luke 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:1">Lu 9:1</A>)

 --"He gave them power and authority"--in other words, He both

 Evangelists enumerate the twelve in immediate connection with their
 appointment

 Lu 6:13-16</A>). 

 But our Evangelist, not intending to record the appointment, but only
 the Mission of the Twelve, gives their names here. And as in the Acts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:13">Ac 1:13</A>)

 we have a list of the Eleven who met daily in the upper room with the 
 other disciples after their Master's ascension until the day of 
 Pentecost, we have four catalogues in all for comparison.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>The first, Simon, who is called Peter</B>--(See on

 <A HREF="JFB43.htm#Joh1_42">Joh 1:42</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and Andrew his brother; James <I>the son</I> of Zebedee, and John his
 brother</B>--named after James, as the younger of the two.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt10_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. Philip and Bartholomew</B>--That this person is the same with "Nathanael
 of Cana in Galilee" is justly concluded for the three following reasons:
 First, because Bartholomew is not so properly an individual's name as a
 family surname; next, because not only in this list, but in Mark's and
 Luke's 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:18,Lu+6:14">Mr 3:18;
 Lu 6:14</A>), 

 he follows the name of "Philip," who was the instrument of bringing
 Nathanael first to Jesus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:45">Joh 1:45</A>);

 and again, when our Lord, after His resurrection, appeared at the Sea 
 of Tiberias, "Nathanael of Cana in Galilee" is mentioned along with six 
 others, all of them apostles, as being present

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:2">Joh 21:2</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Matthew the publican</B>--In none of the four lists of the Twelve is 
 this apostle so branded but in his own, as if he would have all to know 
 how deep a debtor he had been to his Lord.  (See on

 <A HREF="#Mt1_3">Mt 1:3, 5, 6</A>;

 <A HREF="#Mt9_9">9:9</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>James the son of Alphaeus</B>--the same person apparently who is called
 <I>Cleopas</I> or <I>Clopas</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:18,Joh+19:25">Lu 24:18;
 Joh 19:25</A>); 

 and, as he was the husband of Mary, sister to the Virgin, James the
 Less must have been our Lord's cousin.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus</B>--the same, without doubt,
 as "Judas the brother of James," mentioned in both the lists of Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:16,Ac+1:13">Lu 6:16;
 Ac 1:13</A>), 

 while no one of the name of Lebbaeus or Thaddaeus is so. It is he who
 in John

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:22">Joh 14:22</A>)

 is sweetly called "Judas, not Iscariot." That he was the author of the 
 Catholic Epistle of "Jude," and not "the Lord's brother"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:55">Mt 13:55</A>),

 unless these be the same, is most likely.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt10_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4. Simon the Canaanite</B>--rather "Kananite," but better still, "the
 Zealot," as he is called in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:15">Lu 6:15</A>,

 where the original term should not have been retained as in our version 
 ("Simon, called Zelotes"), but rendered "Simon, called the Zealot." The 
 word "Kananite" is just the <I>Aramaic,</I> or <I>Syro-Chaldaic,</I> 
 term for "Zealot." Probably before his acquaintance with Jesus, he 
 belonged to the sect of the Zealots, who bound themselves, as a sort of 
 voluntary ecclesiastical police, to see that the law was not broken 
 with impunity.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and Judas Iscariot</B>--that is, Judas of Kerioth, a town of Judah

 <B>5. These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not
 into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter
 ye not</B>--The Samaritans were Gentiles by blood; but being the
 descendants of those whom the king of Assyria had transported from the
 East to supply the place of the ten tribes carried captive, they had
 adopted the religion of the Jews, though with admixtures of their own:
 and, as the nearest neighbors of the Jews, they occupied a place
 intermediate between them and the Gentiles. Accordingly, when this
 prohibition was to be taken off, on the effusion of the Spirit at
 Pentecost, the apostles were told that they should be Christ's witnesses
 first "in Jerusalem, and in all Judea," then "in Samaria," and lastly,
 "unto the uttermost part of the earth"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:3">Lu 9:3</A>).

 The true reading, however, evidently is "a staff"--meaning, that they
 were not to procure even that much expressly for this missionary
 journey, but to go with what they had. No doubt it was the
 misunderstanding of this that gave rise to the reading "staves" in so 
 many manuscripts Even if this reading were genuine, it could not mean 
 "more than one"; for who, as A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> well asks,

 <B>13. And if the house be worthy</B>--showing this by giving you a welcome.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>let your peace come upon it</B>--This is best explained by the injunction
 to the Seventy, "And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be
 to this house" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:5">Lu 10:5</A>).

 This was the ancient salutation of the East, and it prevails to this 
 day. But from the lips of Christ and His messengers, it means something 
 far higher, both in the gift and the giving of it, than in the current 
 salutation.  (See on

 <A HREF="JFB43.htm#Joh14_27">Joh 14:27</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you</B>--If your peace
 finds a shut, instead of an open, door in the heart of any household,
 take it back to yourselves, who know how to value it; and it will taste
 the sweeter to you for having been offered, even though rejected.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt10_14"> </A>

 By this symbolical action they vividly shook themselves from all
 <I>connection</I> with such, and all <I>responsibility</I> for the 
 guilt of rejecting them and their message.  Such symbolical actions 
 were common in ancient times, even among others than the Jews, as 
 strikingly appears in Pilate

 <B>16. Behold, I send you forth</B>--The "I" here is emphatic, holding up
 Himself as the Fountain of the Gospel ministry, as He is also the Great
 Burden of it.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>as sheep</B>--defenseless.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:12">Joh 10:12</A>).
 
 To be left exposed, as sheep to wolves, would have been startling
 enough; but that the sheep should be <I>sent</I> among the wolves would
 sound strange indeed. No wonder this announcement begins with the
 exclamation, "Behold."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves</B>--Wonderful
 combination this! Alone, the wisdom of the serpent is mere cunning, and
 the harmlessness of the dove little better than weakness: but in
 combination, the wisdom of the serpent would save them from unnecessary
 exposure to danger; the harmlessness of the dove, from sinful expedients
 to escape it. In the apostolic age of Christianity, how harmoniously
 were these qualities displayed! Instead of the fanatical thirst for
 martyrdom, to which a later age gave birth, there was a manly
 combination of unflinching zeal and calm discretion, before which
 nothing was able to stand.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt10_21"> </A>

 father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents,

 against them with the authorities. The deep and virulent hostility of
 the old nature and life to the new--as of Belial to Christ--was to issue
 in awful wrenches of the dearest ties; and the disciples, in the
 prospect of their cause and themselves being launched upon society, are
 here prepared for the worst.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt10_22"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>22. And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake</B>--The
 universality of this hatred would make it evident to them, that since it
 would not be owing to any temporary excitement, local virulence, or
 personal prejudice, on the part of their enemies, so no amount of
 discretion on their part, consistent with entire fidelity to the truth,
 would avail to stifle that enmity--though it might soften its violence,
 and in some cases avert the outward manifestations of it.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but he that endureth to the end shall be saved</B>--a great saying,
 repeated, in connection with similar warnings, in the prophecy of the
 destruction of Jerusalem 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:13">Mt 24:13</A>);

 and often reiterated by the apostle as a warning against "drawing back 
 unto perdition"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:6,13,6:4-6,10:23,26-29,38,39">Heb 3:6, 13;
 6:4-6; 10:23, 26-29, 38, 39</A>,

 of the want of "root" from the first in the Christian profession

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:13">Lu 8:13</A>),

 by our Lord Himself once and again, had special reference to the brief
 opportunities which Israel was to have of "knowing the time of His
 visitations."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for verily I say unto you</B>--what will startle you, but at the same time
 show you the solemnity of your mission, and the need of economizing the

 <B>the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come</B>--To understand
 this--as L<FONT SIZE=-1>ANGE</FONT> and others do--in the first instance, of Christ's own
 peregrinations, as if He had said, "Waste not your time upon hostile
 places, for I Myself will be after you ere your work be over"--seems
 almost trifling. "The coming of the Son of man" has a fixed doctrinal
 sense, here referring immediately to the crisis of Israel's history as
 the visible kingdom of God, when Christ was to come and judge it; when
 "the wrath would come upon it to the uttermost"; and when, on the ruins
 of Jerusalem and the old economy, He would establish His own kingdom.
 This, in the uniform language of Scripture, is more immediately "the
 coming of the Son of man," "the day of vengeance of our God"

 undoubtedly is the right form of this word. The other reading came in no
 doubt from the Old Testament "Baalzebub," the god of Ekron 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:2">2Ki 1:2</A>),

 Satan. Though we nowhere read that our Lord was actually called

 hateful name

 Three relations in which Christ stands to His people are here mentioned:

 this is peculiarly solemn, "I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear," 
 even Him

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell</B>--A decisive 
 proof this that there is a hell for the body as well as the soul in the 
 eternal world; in other words, that the torment that awaits the lost 
 will have elements of suffering adapted to the <I>material</I> as well 
 as the spiritual part of our nature, both of which, we are assured, 
 will exist for ever. In the corresponding warning contained in Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:4">Lu 12:4</A>),

 Jesus calls His disciples "My friends," as if He had felt that such

 them.</P>

 is but an extension of the Psalmist's complaint

 against our Lord Himself

 nearest relations, which would put them to the severest test.</P>

 me</B>--(Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:9">De 33:9</A>).

 As the preference of the one would, in the case supposed, necessitate 
 the abandonment of the other, our Lord here, with a sublime, yet awful 
 self-respect, asserts His own claims to supreme affection.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt10_38"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>38. And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not
 worthy of me</B>--a saying which our Lord once and again emphatically
 reiterates

 Lu 9:23; 14:27</A>). 

 We have become so accustomed to this expression--"taking up one's
 cross"--in the sense of "being prepared for trials in general for 
 Christ's sake," that we are apt to lose sight of its primary and proper 
 sense here--"a preparedness to go forth even to crucifixion," as when 
 our Lord had to bear His own cross on His way to Calvary--a saying the 
 more remarkable as our Lord had not as yet given a hint that He would 
 die this death, nor was crucifixion a Jewish mode of capital 
 punishment.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt10_39"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>39. He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life

 Lu 17:33; 
 Joh 12:25</A>). 

 The pith of such paradoxical maxims depends on the double sense
 attached to the word "life"--a lower and a higher, the natural and the 
 spiritual, the temporal and eternal. An entire sacrifice of the lower, 
 with all its relationships and interests--or, a willingness to make it 
 which is the same thing--is indispensable to the preservation of the 
 higher life; and he who cannot bring himself to surrender the one for 
 the sake of the other shall eventually lose both.</P>

 here a descending climax--"a prophet," "a righteous man," "a little
 one"; signifying that however low we come down in our services to those
 that are Christ's, all that is done for His sake, and that bears the
 stamp of love to His blessed name, shall be divinely appreciated and
 owned and rewarded.</P>

 <B>1. And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his
 twelve disciple</B>--rather, "the twelve disciples,"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities</B>--This was
 scarcely a fourth circuit--if we may judge from the less formal way in
 which it was expressed--but, perhaps, a set of visits paid to certain
 places, either not reached at all before, or too rapidly passed through,
 in order to fill up the time till the return of the Twelve. As to their
 labors, nothing is said of them by our Evangelist. But Luke 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:6">Lu 9:6</A>)
 
 says, "They departed, and went through, the towns," or "villages,"
 "preaching the Gospel, and healing everywhere." Mark 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:12,13">Mr 6:12, 13</A>),

 as usual, is more explicit: "And they went out, and preached that men 
 should repent. And they cast out many devils (demons) and anointed with 
 oil many that were sick, and healed them." Though this "anointing with 
 oil" was not mentioned in our Lord's instructions--at least in any of 
 the records of them--we know it to have been practiced long after this 
 in the apostolic Church (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:14">Jas 5:14</A>,

 and compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:12,13">Mr 6:12, 13</A>)

 --not <I>medicinally,</I> but as a sign of the healing virtue which
 was communicated by their hands, and a symbol of something still more 
 precious. It was <I>unction,</I> indeed, but, as B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT> remarks, it was something very different from what 
 Romanists call <I>extreme</I> unction. He adds, what is very probable,
 that they do not appear to have carried the oil about with them, but, 
 as the Jews used oil as a medicine, to have employed it just as they 
 found it with the sick, in their own higher way.</P>

 The connection of this with what goes before it and the similarity of

 have lain near Capernaum.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>woe unto thee, Bethsaida</B>--"fishing-house," a fishing station--on the
 western side of the Sea of Galilee, and to the north of Capernaum; the
 birthplace of three of the apostles--the brothers Andrew and Peter, and
 Philip. These two cities appear to be singled out to denote the whole
 region in which they lay--a region favored with the Redeemer's presence,
 teaching, and works above every other.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for if the mighty works</B>--the miracles

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon</B>--ancient and
 celebrated commercial cities, on the northeastern shores of the
 Mediterranean Sea, lying north of Palestine, and the latter the
 northernmost. As their wealth and prosperity engendered luxury and its
 concomitant evils--irreligion and moral degeneracy--their overthrow was
 repeatedly foretold in ancient prophecy, and once and again fulfilled by
 victorious enemies. Yet they were rebuilt, and at this time were in a
 flourishing condition.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes</B>--remarkable
 language, showing that they had done less violence to conscience, and
 so, in God's sight, were less criminal than the region here spoken of.</P>

 <B>which art exalted unto heaven</B>--Not even of Chorazin and Bethsaida is
 this said. For since at Capernaum Jesus had His stated abode during the
 whole period of His public life which He spent in Galilee, it was
 <I>the most favored spot upon earth,</I> the most exalted in privilege.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>shall be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been
 done in thee, had been done in Sodom</B>--destroyed for its pollutions.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>24. But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land
 of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee</B>--"It has been indeed,"
 says Dr. S<FONT SIZE=-1>TANLEY</FONT>, "more tolerable, in one sense, in the day of its
 earthly judgment, for the land of Sodom than for Capernaum; for the
 name, and perhaps even the remains of Sodom are still to be found on the
 shores of the Dead Sea; while that of Capernaum has, on the Lake of
 Gennesareth, been utterly lost." But the judgment of which our Lord here
 speaks is still future; a judgment not on material cities, but their
 responsible inhabitants--a judgment final and irretrievable.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt11_25"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>25. At that time Jesus answered and said</B>--We are not to understand
 by this, that the previous discourse had been concluded, and that this
 is a record only of something said about the same period. For the
 connection is most close, and the word "answered"--which, when there is
 no one to answer, refers to something just before said, or rising in the
 mind of the speaker in consequence of something said--confirms this.
 What Jesus here "answered" evidently was the melancholy results of His
 ministry, lamented over in the foregoing verses. It is as if He had
 said, "Yes; but there is a brighter side to the picture; even in those
 who have rejected the message of eternal life, it is the pride of their
 own hearts only which has blinded them, and the glory of the truth does
 but the more appear in their inability to receive it. Nor have all
 rejected it even here; souls thirsting for salvation have drawn water
 with joy from the wells of salvation; the weary have found rest; the
 hungry have been filled with good things, while the rich have been sent
 empty away."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>I thank thee</B>--rather, "I assent to thee." But this is not strong 
 enough. The idea of "<I>full</I>" or "cordial" concurrence is conveyed 
 by the preposition. The thing expressed is adoring acquiescence, holy 
 satisfaction with that law of the divine procedure about to be 
 mentioned. And as, when He afterwards uttered the same words, He 
 "exulted in spirit" (see on

 <A HREF="JFB42.htm#Lu10_21">Lu 10:21</A>),

 probably He did the same now, though not recorded.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>O Father, Lord of heaven and earth</B>--He so styles His Father here, to
 signify that from Him of right emanates all such high arrangements.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>because thou hast hid these things</B>--the knowledge of these saving
 truths.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>from the wise and prudent</B>--The former of these terms points to the
 men who pride themselves upon their speculative or philosophical
 attainments; the latter to the men of worldly shrewdness--the clever,
 the sharp-witted, the men of affairs. The distinction is a natural one,
 and was well understood. (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:19">1Co 1:19</A>,

 &c.). But why had the Father hid from such the things that belonged to 
 their peace, and why did Jesus so emphatically set His seal to this 
 arrangement? Because it is not for the offending and revolted to speak 
 or to speculate, but to listen to Him from whom we have broken loose, 
 that we may learn whether there be any recovery for us at all; and if 
 there be, on what principles--of what nature--to what ends. To bring 
 our own "wisdom and prudence" to such questions is impertinent and 
 presumptuous; and if the truth regarding them, or the glory of it, be 
 "hid" from us, it is but a fitting retribution, to which all the 
 right-minded will set their seal along with Jesus.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>hast revealed them unto babes</B>--to babe-like men; men of unassuming
 docility, men who, conscious that they know nothing, and have no right
 to sit in judgment on the things that belong to their peace, determine
 simply to "hear what God the Lord will speak." Such are well called
 "babes." (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:13,1Co+13:11,14:20">Heb 5:13;

 <A NAME="Mt11_26"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>26. Even so, Father; for so it seemed good</B>--the emphatic and 
 chosen term for expressing any object of divine complacency; whether 
 Christ Himself (see on

 <A HREF="#Mt3_17">Mt 3:17</A>), 

 or God's gracious eternal arrangements (see on

 <A HREF="JFB50.htm#Php2_13">Php 2:13</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>in thy sight</B>--This is just a sublime echo of the foregoing words; as
 if Jesus, when He uttered them, had paused to reflect on it, and as if
 the glory of it--not so much in the light of its own reasonableness as
 of God's absolute will that so it should be--had filled His soul.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt11_27"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>27. All things are delivered unto me of my Father</B>--He does not say,
 They are <I>revealed</I>--as to one who knew them not, and was an entire
 stranger to them save as they were discovered to Him--but, They are
 "delivered over," or "committed," to Me of My Father; meaning the whole
 administration of the kingdom of grace. So in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:35">Joh 3:35</A>,

 "The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into His hand" 
 (see on

 <A HREF="JFB43.htm#Joh3_35">Joh 3:35</A>). 

 But though the "all things" in both these passages refer properly to 
 the kingdom of grace, they of course include all things necessary to 
 the full execution of that trust--that is, <I>unlimited</I> power. (So

 <B>and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man
 the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will</B>--willeth

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>to reveal him</B>--What a saying is this, that "the Father and the Son
 are mutually and exclusively known to each other!" A higher claim to
 equality with the Father cannot be conceived. Either, then, we have here
 one of the revolting assumptions ever uttered, or the proper divinity of
 Christ should to Christians be beyond dispute. "But, alas for me!" may
 some burdened soul, sighing for relief, here exclaim. If it be thus with
 us, what can any poor creature do but lie down in passive despair,
 unless he could dare to hope that <I>he</I> may be one of the favored class
 "to whom the Son is willing to reveal the Father." But nay. This
 testimony to the sovereignty of that gracious "will," on which alone
 men's salvation depends, is designed but to reveal the source and
 enhance the glory of it when once imparted--not to paralyze or shut the
 soul up in despair. Hear, accordingly, what follows:</P>

 <A NAME="Mt11_28"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>28. Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
 give you rest</B>--Incomparable, ravishing sounds these--if ever such were
 heard in this weary, groaning world! What gentleness, what sweetness is
 there in the very style of the invitation--"Hither to Me"; and in the
 words, "All ye that toil and are burdened," the universal wretchedness
 of man is depicted, on both its sides--the <I>active</I> and the <I>passive</I> forms of it.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt11_29"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>29. Take my yoke upon you</B>--the yoke of subjection to Jesus.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find
 rest unto your souls</B>--As Christ's willingness to empty Himself to the
 uttermost of His Father's requirements was the spring of ineffable
 repose to His own Spirit, so in the same track does He invite all to
 follow Him, with the assurance of the same experience.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt11_30"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>30. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light</B>--Matchless paradox,
 even among the paradoxically couched maxims in which our Lord delights!
 That rest which the soul experiences when once safe under Christ's wing
 makes all yokes easy, all burdens light.</P>

 The season of the year when this occurred is determined by the event
 itself. Ripe corn ears are found in the fields only just before harvest.
 The barley harvest seems clearly intended here, at the close of our
 March and beginning of our April. It coincided with the Passover season,
 as the wheat harvest with Pentecost. But in Luke 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:1">Lu 6:1</A>)

 we have a still more definite note of time, if we could be certain of 
 the meaning of the peculiar term which he employs to express it. "It
 came to pass (he says) on the sabbath, which was the 
 <I>first-second,</I>" for that is the proper rendering of the word, and 
 not "the second sabbath after the first," as in our version. Of the 
 various conjectures what this may mean, that of S<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>CALIGER</FONT> is the most approved, and, as we think, the 
 freest from difficulty, namely, the first sabbath after the second day 
 of the Passover; that is, the first of the seven sabbaths which were to 
 be reckoned from the second day of the Passover, which was itself a 
 sabbath, until the next feast, the feast of Pentecost

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:15,16,De+16:9,10">Le 23:15, 16;
 De 16:9, 10</A>) 

 In this case, the day meant by the Evangelist is the first of those
 seven sabbaths intervening between Passover and Pentecost. And if we 
 are right in regarding the "feast" mentioned in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:1">Joh 5:1</A>

 as a <I>Passover,</I> and consequently the second during our Lord's 
 public ministry (see on

 <A HREF="JFB43.htm#Joh5_1">Joh 5:1</A>), 

 this plucking of the ears of corn must have occurred immediately after 
 the scene and the discourse recorded in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:19-47">Joh 5:19-47</A>,

 which, doubtless, would induce our Lord to hasten His departure for the 
 north, to avoid the wrath of the Pharisees, which He had kindled at 
 Jerusalem. Here, accordingly, we find Him in the fields--on His way 
 probably to Galilee.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>1. At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn</B>--"the
 cornfields" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:23,Lu+6:1">Mr 2:23;
 Lu 6:1</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and his disciples were an hungered</B>--not as one may be before his
 regular meals; but evidently from shortness of provisions: for Jesus
 defends their plucking the corn-ears and eating them on the plea of
 <I>necessity.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat</B>--"rubbing them in
 their hands"

 act itself was expressly permitted 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:25">De 23:25</A>).

 it was regarded as sinful.</P>

 <B>4. How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the showbread,
 which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with
 him, but only for the priests?</B>--No example could be more apposite than
 this. The man after God's own heart, of whom the Jews ever boasted, when
 suffering in God's cause and straitened for provisions, asked and
 obtained from the high priest what, according to the law, it was illegal
 for anyone save the priests to touch. Mark 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:26">Mr 2:26</A>)

 says this occurred "in the days of Abiathar the high priest." But this
 means not during his high priesthood--for it was under that of his 
 father Ahimelech--but simply, in his time. Ahimelech was soon succeeded 
 by Abiathar, whose connection with David, and prominence during his 
 reign, may account for his name, rather than his father's, being here 
 introduced. Yet there is not a little confusion in what is said of 
 these priests in different parts of the Old Testament. Thus he is 
 called both the son of the father of Ahimelech

 could not be presented, and the new-baked showbread

 could not be prepared and presented every sabbath morning, without a 
 good deal of servile work on the part of the priests; not to speak of 
 circumcision, which, when the child's eighth day happened to fall on a 
 sabbath, had to be performed by the priests on that day. (See on

 temple</B>--or rather, according to the reading which is best supported,
 "something greater." The argument stands thus: "The ordinary rules for
 the observance of the sabbath give way before the requirements of the
 temple; but there are rights here before which the temple itself must
 give way." Thus indirectly, but not the less decidedly, does our Lord
 put in His own claims to consideration in this question--claims to be
 presently put in even more nakedly.</P>

 the great principle of all religion, which the Scripture everywhere
 recognizes--that ceremonial observances must give way before moral
 duties, and particularly the necessities of nature--ye would have
 refrained from these captious complaints against men who in this matter
 are blameless. But our Lord added a specific application of this great
 principle to the law of the sabbath, preserved only in Mark: "And he
 said unto them, the sabbath was made for man, and not man for the
 sabbath" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:27">Mr 2:27</A>).

 <B>he went into their synagogue</B>--"and taught." He had now, no doubt,
 arrived in Galilee; but this, it would appear, did not occur at
 Capernaum, for after it was over, He "withdrew Himelf," it is said
 "<I>to the sea</I>" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:7">Mr 3:7</A>),

 It was his right hand, as Luke

 graphically notes.

 Lu 6:7</A>)

 say they "watched Him whether He would heal on the sabbath day." They
 were now come to the length of dogging His steps, to collect materials
 for a charge of impiety against Him. It is probable that it was to
 their <I>thoughts</I> rather than their words that Jesus addressed
 Himself in what follows.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt12_10"> </A>

 "A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+12:10">Pr 12:10</A>),

 and would instinctively rescue it from death or suffering on the 
 sabbath day; how much more his nobler fellow man! But the reasoning, as 
 given in the other two Gospels, is singularly striking: "But He knew 
 their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise 
 up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth. Then 
 said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing: Is it lawful on the 
 sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life or to destroy it?"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:8,9">Lu 6:8, 9</A>),

 or as in Mark 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:4">Mr 3:4</A>),

 "to kill?" He thus shuts them up to this startling alternative: "Not
 to do good, when it is in the power of our hand to do it, is to do 
 evil; not to save life, when we can, is to kill"--and must the letter 
 of the sabbath rest be kept at this expense?  This unexpected thrust 
 shut their mouths. By this great ethical principle our Lord, we see, 
 held Himself bound, as man. But here we must turn to Mark, whose 
 graphic details make the second Gospel so exceedingly precious. "When 
 He had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the 
 hardness of their hearts, He saith unto the man"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:5">Mr 3:5</A>).

 This is one of the very few passages in the Gospel history which reveal
 our Lord's <I>feelings.</I> How holy this anger was appears from the 
 "grief" which mingled with it at "the hardness of their hearts."</P>

 <A NAME="Mt12_13"> </A>

 stretched it forth</B>--the power to obey going forth with the word of
 command.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and it was restored whole, like as the other</B>--The poor man, having
 faith in this wonderful Healer--which no doubt the whole scene would
 singularly help to strengthen--disregarded the proud and venomous
 Pharisees, and thus gloriously put them to shame.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt12_14"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>14. Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how
 they might destroy him</B>--This is the first explicit mention of their
 murderous designs against our Lord. Luke 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:11">Lu 6:11</A>)

 says, "they were filled with madness, and communed one with another 
 what they might do to Jesus." But their doubt was not, <I>whether</I> 
 to get rid of Him, but <I>how</I> to compass it. Mark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:6">Mr 3:6</A>),

 as usual, is more definite: "The Pharisees went forth, and straightway
 took counsel with the Herodians against Him, how they might destroy 
 Him." These Herodians were supporters of Herod's dynasty, created by 
 C&aelig;sar--a political rather than religious party. The Pharisees 
 regarded them as untrue to their religion and country. But here we see 
 them combining together against Christ as a common enemy. So on a 
 subsequent occasion

 says "it was <I>to the sea</I>"--to some distance, no doubt, from the
 scene of the miracle, the madness, and the plotting just recorded.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all</B>--Mark 
 gives the following interesting details: "A great multitude from 
 Galilee followed Him, and from Judea and from Jerusalem, and from 
 Idumea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great 
 multitude, when they had heard what great things He did, came unto Him. 
 And He spake to His disciples, that a small ship"--or "wherry"--"should 
 wait on Him because of the multitude, lest they should throng Him. For 
 He had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon Him for to touch 
 Him, as many as had plagues. And unclean spirits, when they saw Him, 
 fell down before Him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God. And 
 He straitly charged them that they should not make Him known"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:7-12">Mr 3:7-12</A>).

 How glorious this extorted homage to the Son of God! But as this was
 not the time, so neither were they the fitting preachers, as B<FONT

 merely seizes the spirit, instead of the letter of the prediction in
 this point. The grandeur and completeness of Messiah's victories would
 prove, it seems, not more wonderful than the unobtrusive noiselessness
 with which they were to be achieved. And whereas one rough touch will
 break a bruised reed, and quench the flickering, smoking flax, His
 it should be, with matchless tenderness, love, and skill, to lift up the
 meek, to strengthen the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees, to

 The precise time of this section is uncertain. Judging from the
 statements with which Mark introduces it, we should conclude that it was
 when our Lord's popularity was approaching its zenith, and so before the
 feeding of the five thousand. But, on the other hand, the advanced state
 of the charges brought against our Lord, and the plainness of His
 warnings and denunciations in reply, seem to favor the later period at
 which Luke introduces it. "And the multitude," says Mark 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:20,21">Mr 3:20, 21</A>),

 "cometh together again," referring back to the immense gathering which
 Mark had before recorded

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:2">Mr 2:2</A>)

 --"so that they could not so much as eat bread. And when His

 beside Himself." Compare

 "Is this the Son of David?" And as questions put in this form (in 
 <I>Greek</I>) suppose doubt, and expect rather a negative answer, the 
 meaning is, "Can it possibly be?"--the people thus indicating their 
 secret impression that this <I>must</I> be He; yet saving themselves
 from the wrath of the ecclesiastics, which a direct assertion of it 
 would have brought upon them. (On a similar question, see on

 says, "the scribes which came down from Jerusalem"; so that this had 
 been a hostile party of the ecclesiastics, who had come all the way 
 from Jerusalem to collect materials for a charge against Him.  (See on

 that the bitterest enemies of our Lord were unable to deny the reality 
 of His miracles; and next, that they believed in an <I>organized 
 infernal kingdom of evil,</I> under one chief. This belief would be of 
 small consequence, had not our Lord set His seal to it; but this He 
 immediately does. Stung by the unsophisticated testimony of "all the 
 people," they had no way of holding out against His claims but by the 
 desperate shift of ascribing His miracles to Satan.</P>

 shall then his kingdom stand?</B>--The argument here is irresistible. "No
 organized society can stand--whether kingdom, city, or household--when
 turned against itself; such intestine war is suicidal: But the works I
 do are destructive of Satan's kingdom: That I should be in league with
 Satan, therefore, is incredible and absurd."</P>

 &c.). Our Lord here seems to admit that such works were wrought by
 them; in which case the Pharisees stood self-condemned, as expressed in 
 Luke

 <A NAME="Mt12_31"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>31. Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be
 forgiven unto men</B>--The word "blasphemy" properly signifies
 "detraction," or "slander." In the New Testament it is applied, as it is
 here, to vituperation directed against God as well as against men; and
 in this sense it is to be understood as an aggravated form of sin. Well,
 says our Lord, all sin--whether in its ordinary or its more aggravated
 forms--shall find forgiveness with God. Accordingly, in Mark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:28">Mr 3:28</A>)

 the language is still stronger: "All sin shall be forgiven unto the
 sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme." 
 There is no sin whatever, it seems, of which it may be said,  "That is
 not a pardonable sin." This glorious assurance is not to be limited by 
 what follows; but, on the contrary, what follows is to be explained by 
 this.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto
 men.</B></P>

 <A NAME="Mt12_32"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>32. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be
 forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall
 not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to
 come</B>--In Mark the language is awfully strong, "hath never forgiveness,
 but is in danger of eternal damnation"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:29">Mr 3:20</A>)--or

 rather, according to what appears to be the preferable though very
 unusual reading, "in danger of eternal guilt"--a guilt which he will
 underlie for ever. Mark has the important addition

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:30">Mr 3:30</A>),

 "Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit." (See on

 <A HREF="#Mt10_25">Mt 10:25</A>). 

 What, then, is this sin against the Holy Ghost--the unpardonable sin? 
 One thing is clear: Its unpardonableness cannot arise from anything in 
 the nature of sin itself; for that would be a naked contradiction to 
 the emphatic declaration of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:31">Mt 12:31</A>,

 that all manner of sin is pardonable. And what is this but the 
 fundamental truth of the Gospel? (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:38,39,Ro+3:22,24,1Jo+1:7">Ac 13:38, 39;
 Ro 3:22, 24; 
 1Jo 1:7</A>, 
 
 &c.). Then, again when it is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:32">Mt 12:32</A>),

 that to speak against or blaspheme the Son of man is pardonable, but
 the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost is not pardonable, it is not to be
 conceived that this arises from any greater sanctity in the one blessed
 Person than the other. These remarks so narrow the question that the
 true sense of our Lord's words seem to disclose themselves at once. It
 is a contrast between slandering "the Son of man" <I>in His veiled
 condition and unfinished work</I>--which might be done "ignorantly, in
 unbelief"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:13">1Ti 1:13</A>),

 and slandering the same blessed Person after the blaze of glory which
 <I>the Holy Ghost</I> was soon to throw around His claims, and in the 
 full knowledge of all that.  This would be to slander Him with eyes 
 open, or to do it "presumptuously." To blaspheme Christ in the former 
 condition--when even the apostles stumbled at many things--left them 
 still open to conviction on fuller light: but to blaspheme Him in the 
 latter condition would be to hate the light the clearer it became, and 
 resolutely to shut it out; which, of course, precludes salvation.  (See 
 on

 <A HREF="JFB58.htm#Heb10_26">Heb 10:26-29</A>). 

 The Pharisees had not as yet done this; but in charging Jesus with 
 being in league with hell they were displaying beforehand a malignant 
 determination to shut their eyes to all evidence, and so, <I>bordering 
 upon,</I> and <I>in spirit</I> committing, the unpardonable sin.</P>

 <B>how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance

 deepest significance and vast application. In

 things</B>--or "putteth forth evil things." The word "putteth"
 indicates the spontaneity of what comes from the heart; for it is out 
 of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaketh. We have here a 
 new application of a former saying (see on

 <A HREF="#Mt7_16">Mt 7:16-20</A>).

 Here, the sentiment is, "There are but two kingdoms, interests,
 parties--with the proper workings of each: If I promote the one, I 
 cannot belong to the other; but they that set themselves in wilful 
 opposition to the kingdom of light openly proclaim to what other 
 kingdom they belong. As for you, in what ye have now uttered, ye have

 supposition, as one way of accounting for the miracle we witnessed; if
 it will not stand, let it go; why make so much of it, and bear down with
 such severity for it?" Jesus replies, "It was not nothing, and at the
 great day will not be treated as nothing: Words, as the index of the
 heart, however idle they may seem, will be taken account of, whether
 good or bad, in estimating character in the day of judgment."</P>

 something of an immediate and decisive nature, to show, not that His

 they were from above, not from beneath. These were not the same class

 "Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye

 Jonas.</B></P>

 <A NAME="Mt12_40"> </A>

 Son of man be to this generation"

 three days after His death. (For the first, see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:19">Joh 2:19</A>).

 Jonah's case was analogous to this, as being a signal judgment of God;
 reversed in three days; and followed by a glorious mission to the 
 Gentiles. The expression "in the heart of the earth," suggested by the 
 expression of Jonah with respect to the sea

 (<U>2:3</U>,

 in the <I>Septuagint</I>), means simply the grave, but this considered 
 as the most emphatic expression of real and total entombment. The 
 period during which He was to lie in the grave is here expressed in 
 round numbers, according to the Jewish way of speaking, which was to 
 regard any part of a day, however small, included within a period of 
 days, as a full day. (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:20,21">Mr 3:20, 21</A>.

 In His zeal and ardor He seemed indifferent both to food and repose,
 and "they went to lay hold of Him" as one "beside Himself." Mark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:32">Mr 3:32</A>)

 says graphically, "And the multitude sat about Him"--or "around
 Him."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>47. Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand
 without, desiring to speak with thee,</B> &c.--Absorbed in the awful
 warnings He was pouring forth, He felt this to be an unseasonable
 interruption, fitted to dissipate the impression made upon the large
 audience--such an interruption as duty to the nearest relatives did not
 require Him to give way to. But instead of a direct rebuke, He seizes on
 the incident to convey a sublime lesson, expressed in a style of
 inimitable condescension.</P>

 <B>1. The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the seaside.</B></P>

 <A NAME="Mt13_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he
 went into a ship</B>--the article in the received text lacks authority

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore</B>--How graphic this
 picture!--no doubt from the pen of an eye-witness, himself impressed
 with the scene. It was "the same day" on which the foregoing solemn
 discourse was delivered, when His kindred thought Him "beside Himself"
 for His indifference to food and repose--that same day retiring to the
 seashore of Galilee; and there seating Himself, perhaps for coolness and
 rest, the crowds again flock around Him, and He is fain to push off from
 them, in the boat usually kept in readiness for Him; yet only to begin,
 without waiting to rest, a new course of teaching by parables to the
 eager multitudes that lined the shore. To the parables of our Lord there
 is nothing in all language to be compared, for simplicity, grace,
 fulness, and variety of spiritual teaching. They are adapted to all
 classes and stages of advancement, being understood by each according to
 the measure of his spiritual capacity.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt13_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying,</B> &c.--These
 parables are <FONT SIZE=-1>SEVEN</FONT> in number; and it is not a little remarkable that
 while this is the <I>sacred number,</I> the first <FONT SIZE=-1>FOUR</FONT> of them were spoken
 to the mixed multitude, while the remaining <FONT SIZE=-1>THREE</FONT> were spoken to the
 Twelve in private--these divisions, <I>four</I> and <I>three,</I> being
 themselves notable in the symbolical arithmetic of Scripture. Another
 thing remarkable in the structure of these parables is, that while the
 first of the Seven--that of the Sower--is of the nature of an
 Introduction to the whole, the remaining Six consist of
 <I>three pairs</I>--the Second and Seventh, the Third and Fourth, and
 the Fifth and Sixth,
 corresponding to each other; each pair setting forth the same general
 truths, but with a certain diversity of aspect. All this can hardly be
 accidental.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First Parable:</I>
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT>

 <I>Reason for Teaching in Parables</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:10-17">Mt 13:10-17</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>10. And the disciples came, and said unto him</B>--"they that were with
 Him, when they were alone" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:10">Mr 4:10</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Why speakest thou to them in parables?</B>--Though before this He had
 couched some things in the parabolic form, for more vivid illustration,
 it would appear that He now, for the first time, formally employed this
 method of teaching.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt13_11"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>11. He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to
 know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven</B>--The word "mysteries" in
 Scripture is not used in its classical sense--of religious secrets, nor
 yet of things incomprehensible, or in their own nature difficult to be
 understood--but in the sense of things of purely divine revelation, and,
 usually, things darkly announced under the ancient economy, and during
 all that period darkly understood, but fully published under the Gospel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:6-10,Eph+3:3-6,8,9">1Co 2:6-10;
 Eph 3:3-6, 8, 9</A>). 

 "The mysteries of the kingdom of heaven," then, mean those glorious
 Gospel truths which at that time only the more advanced disciples could 
 appreciate, and they but partially.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but to them it is not given</B>--(See on

 <A HREF="#Mt11_25">Mt 11:25</A>).

 Parables serve the double purpose of <I>revealing</I> and
 <I>concealing;</I> presenting "the mysteries of the kingdom" to those 
 who know and relish them, though in never so small a degree, in a new 
 and attractive light; but to those who are insensible to spiritual 
 things yielding only, as so many tales, some temporary 
 entertainment.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt13_12"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>12. For whosoever hath</B>--that is, keeps; as a thing which he values.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance</B>--He will be
 rewarded by an increase of what he so much prizes.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but whosoever hath not</B>--who lets this go or lie unused, as a thing
 on which he sets no value.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>from him shall be taken away even that he hath</B>--or as it is in Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:18">Lu 8:18</A>),

 "what he seemeth to have," or, thinketh he hath. This is a principle of 
 immense importance, and, like other weighty sayings, appears to have 
 been uttered by our Lord on more than one occasion, and in different 
 connections.  (See on

 <A HREF="#Mt25_9">Mt 25:9</A>). 

 As a great ethical principle, we see it in operation everywhere, under 
 the general law of <I>habit;</I> in virtue of which moral principles 
 become stronger by exercise, while by disuse, or the exercise of their 
 contraries, they wax weaker, and at length expire. The same principle 
 reigns in the intellectual world, and even in the animal--if not in the 
 vegetable also--as the facts of physiology sufficiently prove. Here, 
 however, it is viewed as a divine ordination, as a judicial retribution 
 in continual operation under the divine administration.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt13_13"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>13. Therefore speak I to them in parables</B>--which our Lord, be it
 observed, did not begin to do till His miracles were malignantly
 ascribed to Satan.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>because they seeing, see not</B>--They "saw," for the light shone on them
 as never light shone before; but they "saw not," for they closed their
 eyes.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and hearing, they hear not; neither do they understand</B>--They "heard,"
 for He taught them who "spake as never man spake"; but they "heard not,"
 for they took nothing in, apprehending not the soul-penetrating,
 life-giving words addressed to them. In Mark and Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:12,Lu+8:10">Mr 4:12;
 Lu 8:10</A>), 

 what is here expressed as a human fact is represented as the fulfilment
 of a divine purpose--"that seeing they may see, and not perceive," &c. 
 The explanation of this lies in the statement of the foregoing 
 verse--that, by a fixed law of the divine administration, the duty men 
 voluntarily refuse to do, and in point of fact do not do, they at 
 length become morally incapable of doing.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt13_14"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>14. And in them is fulfilled</B>--rather, "is fulfilling," or "is receiving
 its fulfilment."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the prophecy of Esaias, which saith</B>--

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:9,10">Isa 6:9, 10</A>

 --here quoted according to the <I>Septuagint</I>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand,</B> &c.--They were
 thus judicially sealed up under the darkness and obduracy which they
 deliberately preferred to the light and healing which Jesus brought nigh
 to them.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt13_15"> </A>

 <A NAME="Mt13_16"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>16. But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your cars, for they
 hear</B>--that is, "Happy ye, whose eyes and ears, voluntarily and gladly
 opened, are drinking in the light divine."</P>

 <A NAME="Mt13_17"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>17. For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men
 have desired</B>--rather, "coveted."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear
 those things which ye hear, and have not heard them</B>--Not only were the
 disciples blessed above the blinded just spoken of, but favored above
 the most honored and the best that lived under the old economy, who had
 but glimpses of the things of the new kingdom, just sufficient to kindle
 in them desires not to be fulfilled to any in their day. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:23,24">Lu 10:23, 24</A>,

 where the same saying is repeated on the return of the Seventy--the 
 words, instead of "many prophets and righteous men," are "many prophets 
 <I>and kings</I>"; for several of the Old Testament saints were 
 kings.</P>

 <B>24, 36-38. Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The 
 kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his

 charming simplicity and clearness, expounded to us by the Great 
 Preacher Himself.  Accordingly, we pass to:

 <A NAME="Mt13_26"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>26. But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then
 appeared the tares also</B>--the growth in both cases running parallel, as
 antagonistic principles are seen to do.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt13_27"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>27. So the servants of the householder came</B>--that is, Christ's
 ministers.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field?
 from whence then hath it tares?</B>--This well expresses the surprise,
 disappointment, and anxiety of Christ's faithful servants and people at
 the discovery of "false brethren" among the members of the Church.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt13_28"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>28. He said unto them, An enemy hath done this</B>--Kind words these from
 a good Husbandman, honorably clearing His faithful servants of the wrong
 done to his field.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them
 up?</B>--Compare with this the question of James and John 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:54">Lu 9:54</A>),

 "Lord, wilt Thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and 
 consume" those Samaritans? In this kind of zeal there is usually a 
 large mixture of carnal heat. (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:20">Jas 1:20</A>).</P>

 <A NAME="Mt13_29"> </A>

 is it your business."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>lest, while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with
 them</B>--Nothing could more clearly or forcibly teach the difficulty of
 distinguishing the two classes, and the high probability that in the
 attempt to do so these will be confounded.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt13_30"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>30, 39. Let both grow together</B>--that is, in the visible Church.

 <B>until the harvest</B>--till the one have ripened for full salvation, 
 the other for destruction. (See on

 <A HREF="#Mt13_39">Mt 13:39</A>).

 <B>Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn
 them</B>--"in the fire"

 the two classes (as in

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>31. Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
 heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed
 in his field;</B></P>

 <A NAME="Mt13_32"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>32. Which indeed is the least of all seeds</B>--not absolutely, but
 popularly and proverbially, as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:6">Lu 17:6</A>,

 "If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed," that is, "never so little 
 faith."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs</B>--not absolutely,
 but in relation to the small size of the seed, and in warm latitudes
 proverbially great.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in
 the branches thereof</B>--This is added, no doubt, to express the
 <I>amplitude</I> of the tree. But as this seed has a hot, fiery vigor,
 gives out its best virtues when bruised, and is grateful to the taste of
 birds, which are accordingly attracted to its branches both for shelter
 and food, is it straining the parable, asks T<FONT SIZE=-1>RENCH</FONT>,
 to suppose that,
 besides the wonderful <I>growth</I> of His kingdom, our Lord selected this
 seed to illustrate further the <I>shelter, repose</I> and
 <I>blessedness</I> it is destined to afford to the nations of the
 world?</P>

 <I>The Leaven</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>33. Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like
 unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till
 the whole was leavened</B>--This parable, while it teaches the same
 general truth as the foregoing one, holds forth, perhaps, rather the
 <I>inward</I> growth of the kingdom, while "the Mustard Seed" seems to
 point chiefly to the <I>outward.</I> It being a woman's work to knead, it
 seems a refinement to say that "the woman" here represents <I>the Church,</I>
 as the instrument of depositing the leaven. Nor does it yield much
 satisfaction to understand the "three measures of meal" of that
 threefold division of our nature into "spirit, soul, and body," alluded
 to in

 <B>I will open my mouth in parables,</B> &c.--Though the Psalm seems to
 contain only a summary of Israelitish <I>history,</I> the Psalmist himself
 calls it "a parable," and "dark sayings from of old"--as containing,
 <I>underneath the history,</I> truths for all time, not fully brought to
 light till the Gospel day.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt13_36"> </A>

 <B>36-38. Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house:
 and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of
 the tares of the field,</B> &c.--In the parable of the Sower, "the seed
 is the word of God" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:11">Lu 8:11</A>).

 But here that word has been received into the heart, and has converted 
 him that received it into a new creature, a "child of the kingdom," 
 according to that saying of James

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:18">Jas 1:18</A>),

 "Of His own will begat He us with the word of truth, that we should be
 a kind of first-fruits of His creatures." It is worthy of notice that 
 this vast field of the world is here said to be <I>Christ's 
 own</I>--"His field," says the parable. (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:8">Ps 2:8</A>).</P>

 <B>38. The tares are the children of the wicked one</B>--As this sowing could
 only be "while men slept," no blame seems intended, and certainly none
 is charged upon "the servants"; it is probably just the dress of the
 parable.</P>

 By "tares" is meant, not what in our husbandry is so called, but some
 noxious plant, probably <I>darnel.</I> "The tares are the children of 
 the wicked one"; and by their being sown "among the wheat" is meant 
 their being deposited within the territory of the visible Church. As 
 they resemble the children of the kingdom, so they are produced, it 
 seems, by a similar process of "sowing"--the seeds of evil being 
 scattered and lodging in the soil of those hearts upon which falls the 
 seed of the world. The enemy, after sowing his "tares," "went his 
 way"--his dark work soon done, but taking time to develop its true 
 character.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>The harvest is the end of the world</B>--the period of Christ's second
 coming, and of the judicial separation of the righteous and the wicked.
 Till then, no attempt is to be made to effect such separation. But to
 stretch this so far as to justify allowing openly scandalous persons to
 remain in the communion of the Church, is to wrest the teaching of this
 parable to other than its proper design, and go in the teeth of
 apostolic injunctions

 being found by accident, as in the former case, is found by one whose
 <I>business</I> it is to seek for such, and who finds it just in the way of
 <I>searching</I> for such treasures. But in both cases the surpassing value

 The object of this brief parable is the same as that of the Tares and
 Wheat. But as its details are fewer, so its teaching is less rich and
 varied.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>47. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast
 into the sea, and gathered of every kind</B>--The word here rendered "net"
 signifies a large <I>drag-net,</I> which draws everything after it,
 suffering nothing to escape, as distinguished from a <I>casting-net</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:16,18">Mr 1:16, 18</A>).

 The far-reaching efficacy of the Gospel is thus denoted. This Gospel
 net "gathered of every kind," meaning every variety of character.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt13_48"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>48. Which, when it was full, they drew to shore</B>--for the separation
 will not be made till the number of the elect is accomplished.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and sat down</B>--expressing the deliberateness with which the judicial
 separation will at length be made.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away</B>--literally,
 "the rotten," but here meaning, "the foul" or "worthless" fish:
 corresponding to the "tares" of the other parable.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt13_49"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>49. So shall it be at the end of the world,</B> &c.--(See on

 <A HREF="#Mt13_42">Mt 13:42</A>).

 We have said that each of these two parables holds forth the same truth
 under a slight diversity of aspect. What is that diversity? First, the 
 <I>bad,</I> in the former parable, are represented as vile seed sown 
 among the wheat by the enemy of souls; in the latter, as foul fish 
 drawn forth out of the great sea of human beings by the Gospel net 
 itself. Both are important truths--that the Gospel draws within its 
 pale, and into the communion of the visible Church, multitudes who are 
 Christians only in name; and that the injury thus done to the Church on 
 earth is to be traced to the wicked one. But further, while the former 
 parable gives chief prominence to the present mixture of good and bad, 
 in the latter, the prominence is given to the future separation of the 
 two classes.</P>

 relatives our own townsfolk? Whence, then, such wisdom and such
 miracles?" These particulars of our Lord's <I>human</I> history constitute
 the most valuable testimony, first, to His true and real humanity--for
 they prove that during all His first thirty years His townsmen had
 discovered nothing about Him different from other men; secondly, to the
 divine character of His mission--for these Nazarenes proclaim both the
 unparalleled character of His teaching and the reality and glory of His
 miracles, as transcending human ability; and thirdly, to His wonderful
 humility and self-denial--in that when He was such as they now saw Him

 they His step-brothers and step-sisters, children of Joseph by a former

 way of speaking among the Jews respecting persons of collateral 
 descent? On this subject an immense deal has been written, nor are

 ground but a vague tradition, arising probably from the wish for some 
 such explanation. The first opinion undoubtedly suits the text best in 
 all the places where the parties are certainly referred to

 But, in addition to other objections, many of the best interpreters, 
 thinking it in the last degree improbable that our Lord, when hanging 
 on the cross, would have committed His mother to John if He had had 
 full brothers of His own then alive, prefer the third opinion; 
 although, on the other hand, it is not to be doubted that our Lord 
 might have good reasons for entrusting the guardianship of His doubly 
 widowed mother to the beloved disciple in preference even to full 
 brothers of His own. Thus dubiously we prefer to leave this vexed 
 question, encompassed as it is with difficulties. As to the names here 
 mentioned, the <I>first</I> of them, "J<FONT SIZE=-1>AMES</FONT>," is
 afterwards called "the Lord's brother" (see on

 <A HREF="JFB48.htm#Ga1_19">Ga 1:19</A>),

 but is perhaps not to be confounded with "James the son of
 Alph&aelig;us," one of the Twelve, though many think their identity 
 beyond dispute. This question also is one of considerable difficulty, 
 and not without importance; since the James who occupies so prominent a 
 place in the Church of Jerusalem, in the latter part of the Acts, was 
 apparently the apostle, but is by many regarded as "the Lord's 
 brother," while others think their identity best suits all the 
 statements. The <I>second</I> of those here named, "J<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OSES</FONT>" (or Joseph), must not be confounded with "Joseph 
 called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:23">Ac 1:23</A>);

 and the <I>third</I> here named, "S<FONT SIZE=-1>IMON</FONT>," is not 
 to be confounded with Simon the Kananite or Zealot (see on

 <A HREF="#Mt10_4">Mt 10:4</A>). 

 These three are nowhere else mentioned in the New Testament. The 
 <I>fourth</I> and last-named, "J<FONT SIZE=-1>UDAS</FONT>," can hardly 
 be identical with the apostle of that name--though the brothers of both 
 were of the name of "James"--nor (unless the two be identical, was this 
 Judas) with the author of the catholic Epistle so called.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The time of this section was after that Passover which was nigh at hand
 when our Lord fed the five thousand 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:4">Joh 6:4</A>)

 --the third Passover, as we take it, since His public ministry began, 
 but which He did not keep at Jerusalem for the reason mentioned in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:1">Joh 7:1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>1. Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of 
 Jerusalem</B>--or "from Jerusalem." Mark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:1">Mr 7:1</A>)

 says they "came from" it: a deputation probably sent from the capital
 expressly to watch Him. As He had not come to them at the last 
 Passover, which they had reckoned on, they now come to Him. "And," says 
 Mark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:2,3">Mr 7:2, 3</A>),

 "when they saw some of His disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to
 say, with unwashen hands"--hands not ceremonially cleansed by 
 washing--"they found fault. For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except 
 they wash their hands oft"--literally, "in" or "with the fist"; that 
 is, probably washing the one hand by the use of the other--though some 
 understand it, with our version, in the sense of "diligently," 
 "sedulously"--"eat not, holding the tradition of the elders"; acting 
 religiously according to the custom handed down to them. "And when they 
 come from the market"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:4">Mr 7:4</A>)

 --"And after market": after any common business, or attending a court
 of justice, where the Jews, as W<FONT SIZE=-1>EBSTER</FONT> and W<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ILKINSON</FONT> remark, after their subjection to the Romans, 
 were especially exposed to intercourse and contact with 
 heathens--"except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there 
 be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups and pots, 
 brazen vessels and tables"--rather, "couches," such as were used at 
 meals, which probably were merely <I>sprinkled</I> for ceremonial 
 purposes. "Then the Pharisees and scribes asked Him,"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>saying</B>--as follows:</P>

 <A NAME="Mt15_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for
 they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</B></P>

 <A NAME="Mt15_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the
 commandment of God by your tradition?</B>--The charge is retorted with
 startling power: "The tradition they transgress is but <I>man's,</I> and is
 itself the occasion of heavy transgression, undermining the authority of
 <I>God's law.</I>"</P>

 <A NAME="Mt15_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4. For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother</B>--

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:16">De 5:16</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death</B>--

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:17">Ex 21:17</A>).</P>

 <A NAME="Mt15_5"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>5. But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is
 a gift</B>--or simply, "A gift!" In Mark 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:11">Mr 7:11</A>),

 it is, "<I>Corban!</I>" that is, "An oblation!" meaning, any unbloody
 offering or gift dedicated to sacred uses.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;</B></P>

 <A NAME="Mt15_6"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>6. And honour not his father or his mother, <I>he shall be free</I></B>--that
 is, It is true, father--mother--that by giving to thee this, which I now
 present, thou mightest be profited by me; but I have gifted it to pious
 uses, and therefore, at whatever cost to thee, I am not now at liberty
 to alienate any portion of it. "And," it is added in Mark 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:12">Mr 7:12</A>),

 "ye suffer him no more to do aught for his father or his mother." To
 dedicate property to God is indeed lawful and laudable, but not at the
 expense of filial duty.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect</B>--cancelled or
 nullified it "by your tradition."</P>

 <A NAME="Mt15_7"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>7. Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying</B>--

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:13">Isa 29:13</A>).</P>

 <A NAME="Mt15_8"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>8. This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth,</B> &c.--By putting
 the commandments of men on a level with the divine requirements,
 <I>their whole worship was rendered vain</I>--a principle of deep moment in
 the service of God. "For," it is added in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:8">Mr 7:8</A>,

 "laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as
 the washing of pots and cups; and many other such like things ye do." 
 The drivelling nature of their multitudinous observances is here 
 pointedly exposed, in contrast with the manly observance of "the 
 commandment of God"; and when our Lord says, "Many other such like 
 things ye do," it is implied that He had but given a specimen of the 
 hideous treatment which the divine law received, and the grasping 
 disposition which, under the mask of piety, was manifested by the 
 ecclesiastics of that day.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt15_9"> </A>

 <A NAME="Mt15_10"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>10. And he called the multitude, and said unto them</B>--The foregoing
 dialogue, though in the people's hearing, was between Jesus and the
 pharisaic cavillers, whose object was to disparage Him with the people.
 But Jesus, having put them down, turns to the multitude, who at this
 time were prepared to drink in everything He said, and with admirable
 plainness, strength, and brevity, lays down the great principle of real
 pollution, by which a world of bondage and uneasiness of conscience
 would be dissipated in a moment, and the sense of sin be reserved for
 deviations from the holy and eternal law of God.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Hear and understand:</B></P>

 <A NAME="Mt15_11"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>11. Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which
 cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man</B>--This is expressed even
 more emphatically in Mark 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:15,16">Mr 7:15, 16</A>),

 and it is there added, "If any man have ears to hear, let him hear." As
 in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:9">Mt 13:9</A>,

 this so oft-repeated saying seems designed to call attention to the 
 <I>fundamental</I> and <I>universal</I> character of the truth it 
 refers to.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt15_12"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>12. Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the
 Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?</B>--They had given
 vent to their irritation, and perhaps threats, not to our Lord Himself,
 from whom they seem to have slunk away, but to some of the disciples,
 who report it to their Master.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt15_13"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>13. But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father
 hath not planted, shall be rooted up</B>--They are offended, are they?
 Heed it not: their corrupt teaching is already doomed: the garden of the
 Lord upon earth, too long cumbered with their presence, shall yet be
 purged of them and their accursed system: yea, and whatsoever is not of
 the planting of My heavenly Father, the great Husbandman 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:1">Joh 15:1</A>),
 
 shall share the same fate.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt15_14"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>14. Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the
 blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch</B>--Striking
 expression of the ruinous effects of erroneous teaching!</P>

 <A NAME="Mt15_15"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>15. Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this
 parable</B>--"when He was entered into the house from the people," says
 Mark 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:17">Mr 7:17</A>).</P>

 <A NAME="Mt15_16"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>16. And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?</B>--Slowness
 of spiritual apprehension in His genuine disciples grieves the Saviour:
 from others He expects no better 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:11">Mt 13:11</A>).</P>

 <A NAME="Mt15_17"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>17, 18. Do not ye yet understand that whatsoever entereth in at the
 mouth,</B> &c.--Familiar though these sayings have now become, what
 freedom from bondage to outward things do they proclaim, on the one
 hand; and on the other, how searching is the truth which they
 express--that nothing which enters from without can really defile us;
 and that only the evil that is in the heart, that is allowed to stir
 there, to rise up in thought and affection, and to flow forth in
 voluntary action, really defiles a man!</P>

 <A NAME="Mt15_18"> </A>

 <A NAME="Mt15_19"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>19. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts</B>--"evil reasonings";
 referring here more immediately to those corrupt reasonings which had
 stealthily introduced and gradually reared up that hideous fabric of
 tradition which at length practically nullified the unchangeable
 principles of the moral law. But the statement is far broader than this;
 namely that the first shape which the evil that is in the heart takes,
 when it begins actively to stir, is that of "considerations" or
 "reasonings" on certain suggested actions.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies</B>--detractions, whether directed against God or man;
 here the reference
 seems to be to the latter. Mark 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:22">Mr 7:22</A>)

 adds, "covetousnesses"--or desires after more; "wickednesses"--here
 meaning, perhaps, malignities of various forms; "deceit, 
 lasciviousness"--meaning, excess or enormity of any kind, though by 
 later writers restricted to lewdness; "an evil eye"--meaning, all looks 
 or glances of envy, jealousy, or ill will towards a neighbor; "pride, 
 foolishness"--in the Old Testament sense of "folly"; that is, criminal 
 senselessness, the folly of the <I>heart.</I> How appalling is this 
 black catalogue!</P>

 <A NAME="Mt15_20"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>20. These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen
 hands defileth not a man</B>--Thus does our Lord sum up this whole
 searching discourse.</P>

 The time of this section--which is beyond doubt, and will presently be
 mentioned--is of immense importance, and throws a touching interest
 around the incidents which it records.</P>

 <I>Peter's Confession, and the Benediction Pronounced upon Him.</I>

 <B>13. When Jesus came into the coasts</B>--"the parts," that is, the
 territory or region. In Mark 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:27">Mr 8:27</A>)

 it is "the towns" or "villages."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>of C&aelig;sarea Philippi</B>--It lay at the foot of Mount Lebanon, near the
 sources of the Jordan, in the territory of Dan, and at the northeast
 extremity of Palestine. It was originally called <I>Panium</I> (from a
 cavern in its neighborhood dedicated to the god <I>Pan</I>) and <I>Paneas.</I> Philip, the tetrarch, the only good son of Herod
 the Great, in whose
 dominions Paneas lay, having beautified and enlarged it, changed its
 name to <I>C&aelig;sarea,</I> in honor of the Roman emperor, and added
 <I>Philippi</I> after his own name, to distinguish it from the other
 <I>C&aelig;sarea</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:1">Ac 10:1</A>)

 on the northeast coast of the Mediterranean Sea. [J<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>, <I>Antiquities,</I> 15.10,3; 18.2,1]. This 
 quiet and distant retreat Jesus appears to have sought with the view of 
 talking over with the Twelve the fruit of His past labors, and breaking 
 to them for the first time the sad intelligence of His approaching 
 death.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he asked his disciples</B>--"by the way," says Mark 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:27">Mr 8:27</A>),

 and "as He was alone praying," says Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:18">Lu 9:18</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>saying, Whom</B>--or more grammatically, "Who"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>do men say that I the Son of man am?</B>--(or, "that the Son of man
 is"--the recent editors omitting here the <I>me</I> of Mark and Luke

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:27,Lu+9:18">Mr 8:27;
 Lu 9:18</A>]; 

 though the evidence seems pretty nearly balanced)--that is, "What are
 the views generally entertained of Me, the Son of man, after going up 
 and down among them so long?" He had now closed the first great stage 
 of His ministry, and was just entering on the last dark one. His 
 spirit, burdened, sought relief in retirement, not only from the 
 multitude, but even for a season from the Twelve. He retreated into 
 "the secret place of the Most High," pouring out His soul "in 
 supplications and prayers, with strong crying and tears"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7">Heb 5:7</A>).

 On rejoining His disciples, and as they were pursuing their quiet 
 journey, He asked them this question.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt16_14"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>14. And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist</B>--risen
 from the dead. So that Herod Antipas was not singular in his surmise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:1,2">Mt 14:1, 2</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>some, Elias</B>--(Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:15">Mr 6:15</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and others, Jeremias</B>--Was this theory suggested by a supposed
 resemblance between the "Man of Sorrows" and "the weeping prophet?"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>or one of the prophets</B>--or, as Luke 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:8">Lu 9:8</A>)

 expresses it, "that one of the old prophets is risen again." In another 
 report of the popular opinions which Mark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:15">Mr 6:15</A>)

 gives us, it is thus expressed, "That it is a prophet [or], as one of
 the prophets": in other words, That He was a prophetical person, 
 resembling those of old.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt16_15"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>15. He saith unto them, But whom</B>--rather, "who."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>say ye that I am?</B>--He had never put this question before, but the
 crisis He was reaching made it fitting that He should now have it from
 them. We may suppose this to be one of those moments of which the
 prophet says, in His name, "Then I said, I have labored in vain; I have
 spent my strength for naught, and in vain" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:4">Isa 49:4</A>):

 Lo, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree; and what 
 is it? As the result of all, I am taken for John the Baptist, for 
 Elias, for Jeremias, for one of the prophets. Yet some there are that 
 have beheld My glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father, 
 and I shall hear their voice, for it is sweet.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt16_16"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>16. And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of
 the living God</B>--He does not say, "Scribes and Pharisees, rulers and
 people, are all perplexed; and shall we, unlettered fishermen, presume
 to decide?" But feeling the light of his Master's glory shining in his
 soul, he breaks forth--not in a tame, prosaic acknowledgment,
 "<I>I believe that Thou art,</I>" &c.--but in the language of
 adoration--such as one uses in worship,
 "T<FONT SIZE=-1>HOU</FONT>
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>RT THE</FONT>
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>HRIST, THE</FONT>
 S<FONT SIZE=-1>ON OF THE</FONT>
 L<FONT SIZE=-1>IVING</FONT>
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>OD</FONT>!"
 He first owns Him the promised <I>Messiah</I> (see on

 <A HREF="#Mt1_16">Mt 1:16</A>); 

 then he rises higher, echoing the voice from heaven--"This is My 
 beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased"; and in the important 
 addition--"Son of the L<FONT SIZE=-1>IVING</FONT> G<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OD</FONT>"--he recognizes the essential and eternal life of God 
 as in this His Son--though doubtless without that distinct perception 
 afterwards vouchsafed.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt16_17"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>17. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou</B>--Though
 it is not to be doubted that Peter, in this noble testimony to Christ,
 only expressed the conviction of all the Twelve, yet since he alone
 seems to have had clear enough apprehensions to put that conviction in
 proper and suitable words, and courage enough to speak them out, and
 readiness enough to do this at the right time--so he only, of all the
 Twelve, seems to have met the present want, and communicated to the
 saddened soul of the Redeemer at the critical moment that balm which was
 needed to cheer and refresh it. Nor is Jesus above giving indication of
 the deep satisfaction which this speech yielded Him, and hastening to
 respond to it by a signal acknowledgment of Peter in return.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Simon Bar-jona</B>--or, "son of Jona"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:42">Joh 1:42</A>),
 
 or "Jonas"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:15">Joh 21:15</A>).

 This name, denoting his humble fleshly extraction, seems to have been 
 purposely here mentioned, to contrast the more vividly with the 
 spiritual elevation to which divine illumination had raised him.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee</B>--"This is not the
 fruit of human teaching."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but my Father which is in heaven</B>--In speaking of God, Jesus, it 
 is to be observed, never calls Him, "our Father" (see on

 <A HREF="JFB43.htm#Joh20_17">Joh 20:17</A>),

 but either "your Father"--when He would encourage His timid believing 
 ones with the assurance that He was theirs, and teach themselves to 
 call Him so--or, as here, "My Father," to signify some peculiar action 
 or aspect of Him as "the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."</P>

 <A NAME="Mt16_18"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>18. And I say also unto thee</B>--that is, "As thou hast borne such
 testimony to Me, even so in return do I to thee."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>That thou art Peter</B>--At his first calling, this new name was 
 announced to him as an honor afterwards to be conferred on him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:43">Joh 1:43</A>).

 Now he gets it, with an explanation of what it was meant to convey.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and upon this rock</B>--As "Peter" and "Rock" are one word in the dialect
 familiarly spoken by our Lord--the <I>Aramaic</I> or <I>Syro-Chaldaic,</I> which
 was the mother tongue of the country--this exalted <I>play upon the word</I> can be fully seen only in languages which have one
 word for both. Even
 in the <I>Greek</I> it is imperfectly represented. In French, as
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>EBSTER</FONT>
 and W<FONT SIZE=-1>ILKINSON</FONT> remark, it is perfect, <I>Pierre--pierre.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>I will build my Church</B>--not on the man Simon Bar-jona; but on 
 him as the heavenly-taught confessor of a faith. "My Church," says our 
 Lord, calling the Church H<FONT SIZE=-1>IS</FONT> 
 O<FONT SIZE=-1>WN</FONT>; a magnificent expression regarding Himself,
 remarks B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>--nowhere else occurring in the 
 Gospels.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and the gates of hell</B>--"of Hades," or, the unseen world; meaning, the
 gates of Death: in other words, "It shall never perish." Some explain it
 of "the assaults of the powers of darkness"; but though that expresses a
 glorious truth, probably the former is the sense here.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt16_19"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>19. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven</B>--the
 kingdom of God about to be set up on earth

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and
 whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven</B>--Whatever this mean, it was soon expressly
 <I>extended to all the apostles</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:18">Mt 18:18</A>);

 so that the claim of supreme authority in the Church, made for Peter by 
 the Church of Rome, and then arrogated to themselves by the popes as 
 the legitimate successors of St. Peter, is baseless and impudent. As 
 first in confessing Christ, Peter got this commission before the rest; 
 and with these "keys," on the day of Pentecost, he first "opened the 
 door of faith" to the <I>Jews,</I> and then, in the person of 
 Cornelius, he was honored to do the same to the <I>Gentiles.</I> Hence, 
 in the lists of the apostles, Peter is always first named.  See on

 <A HREF="#Mt18_18">Mt 18:18</A>. 

 One thing is clear, that not in all the New Testament is there the 
 vestige of any authority either claimed or exercised by Peter, or 
 conceded to him, above the rest of the apostles--a thing conclusive 
 against the Romish claims in behalf of that apostle.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt16_20"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>20. Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he
 was Jesus the Christ</B>--Now that He had been so explicit, they might
 naturally think the time come for giving it out openly; but here they
 are told it had not.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt16_21"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Announcement of His Approaching Death
 and Rebuke of Peter</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:21-28">Mt 16:21-28</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The occasion here is evidently the same.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>21. From that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples</B>--that
 is, with an <I>explicitness and frequency</I> He had never observed before.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>how that he must go unto Jerusalem and suffer many things</B>--"and be
 rejected," 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:31,Lu+9:22">Mr 8:31;
 Lu 9:22</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>of the elders and chief priests and scribes</B>--not as before, merely by
 not receiving Him, but by formal deeds.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and be killed, and be raised again the third day</B>--Mark 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:32">Mr 8:32</A>)

 adds, that "He spake that saying openly"--"explicitly," or "without
 disguise."</P>

 <A NAME="Mt16_22"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>22. Then Peter took him</B>--aside, apart from the rest; presuming on
 the distinction just conferred on him; showing how <I>unexpected</I> and
 <I>distasteful</I> to them all was the announcement.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and began to rebuke him</B>--affectionately, yet with a certain generous
 indignation, to chide Him.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>saying, Be it far from thee: this shall not be unto thee</B>--that is,
 "If I can help it": the same spirit that prompted him in the garden to
 draw the sword in His behalf 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:10">Joh 18:10</A>).</P>

 <A NAME="Mt16_23"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>23. But he turned, and said</B>--in the hearing of the rest; for Mark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:33">Mr 8:33</A>)

 expressly says, "When He had turned about and looked on His disciples,
 He rebuked Peter"; perceiving that he had but boldly uttered what 
 others felt, and that the check was needed by them also.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Get thee behind me, Satan</B>--the same words as He had addressed to the
 Tempter 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:8">Lu 4:8</A>);

 for He felt in it a satanic lure, a whisper from hell, to move Him from 
 His purpose to suffer. So He shook off the Serpent, then coiling around 
 Him, and "felt no harm"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:5">Ac 28:5</A>).

 How quickly has the "rock" turned to a devil! The fruit of divine 
 teaching the Lord delighted to honor in Peter; but the mouthpiece of 
 hell, which he had in a moment of forgetfulness become, the Lord shook 
 off with horror.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>thou art an offence</B>--a stumbling-block.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>unto me</B>--"Thou playest the Tempter, casting a stumbling-block in My
 way to the Cross. Could it succeed, where wert thou? and how should the
 Serpent's head be bruised?"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for thou savourest not</B>--thou thinkest not.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the things that be of God, but those that be of men</B>--"Thou art carried
 away by human views of the way of setting up Messiah's kingdom, quite
 contrary to those of God." This was kindly said, not to take off the
 sharp edge of the rebuke, but to explain and justify it, as it was
 evident Peter knew not what was in the bosom of his rash speech.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt16_24"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>24. Then said Jesus unto his disciples</B>--Mark 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:34">Mr 8:34</A>)

 says, "When He had called the people unto Him, with His disciples also,
 He said unto them"--turning the rebuke of one into a warning to all.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his
 cross, and follow me.</B></P>

 <A NAME="Mt16_25"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>25. For whosoever will save</B>--is minded to save, or bent on saving.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>his life shall lose it, and whosoever will lose his life for my sake 
 shall find it</B>--(See on

 <A HREF="#Mt10_38">Mt 10:38,39</A>).

 "A suffering and dying Messiah liketh you ill; but what if His servants 
 shall meet the same fate? They may not; but who follows Me must be 
 prepared for the worst."</P>

 <A NAME="Mt16_26"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>26. For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and
 lose his own soul</B>--or forfeit his own soul?

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</B>--Instead of these
 weighty words, which we find in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:36">Mr 8:36</A>

 also, it is thus expressed in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:25">Lu 9:25</A>:

 "If he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away," or 
 better, "If he gain the whole world, and destroy or forfeit himself." 
 How awful is the stake as here set forth! If a man makes the present 
 world--in its various forms of riches, honors, pleasures, and such 
 like--the object of supreme pursuit, be it that he gains the world; yet 
 along with it he forfeits his own soul. Not that any ever did, or ever 
 will gain the whole world--a very small portion of it, indeed, falls to 
 the lot of the most successful of the world's votaries--but to make the 
 extravagant concession, that by giving himself entirely up to it, a man 
 gains the whole world; yet, setting over against this gain the 
 forfeiture of his soul--necessarily following the surrender of his 
 whole heart to the world--what is he profited? But, if not the whole 
 world, yet possibly something else may be conceived as an equivalent 
 for the soul. Well, what is it?--"Or what shall a man give in exchange 
 for his soul?" Thus, in language the weightiest, because the simplest, 
 does our Lord shut up His hearers, and all who shall read these words 
 to the end of the world, to the priceless value to every man of his own 
 soul. In Mark and Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:38,Lu+9:26">Mr 8:38;
 Lu 9:26</A>) 

 the following words are added: "Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of 
 Me and of My words [shall be ashamed of belonging to Me, and ashamed of 
 My Gospel] in this adulterous and sinful generation" (see on

 <A HREF="#Mt12_39">Mt 12:39</A>), 

 "of him shall the Son of man be ashamed when He cometh in the glory of 
 His Father, with the holy angels." He will render back to that man his 
 own treatment, disowning him before the most august of all assemblies, 
 and putting him to "<I>shame</I> and everlasting <I>contempt</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:2">Da 12:2</A>).

 "O shame," exclaims B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>, "to be put to shame 
 before God, Christ, and angels!" The sense of <I>shame</I> is founded 
 on our love of <I>reputation,</I> which causes instinctive aversion to 
 what is fitted to lower it, and was given us as a preservative from all 
 that is properly <I>shameful.</I> To be <I>lost to shame</I> is to be 
 nearly past hope.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:5,Jer+6:15,Jer+3:3">Zep 3:5;
 Jer 6:15; 3:3</A>).

 But when Christ and "His words" are unpopular, the same instinctive
 desire to <I>stand well with others</I> begets that temptation to be 
 ashamed of Him which only the expulsive power of a higher affection can 
 effectually counteract.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt16_27"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>27. For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his
 angels</B>--in the splendor of His Father's authority and with all His
 angelic ministers, ready to execute His pleasure.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and then he shall reward,</B> &c.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt16_28"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>28. Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here</B>--"some of those
 standing here."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>which shall not taste of death, fill they see the Son of man coming in
 his kingdom</B>--or, as in Mark 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:1">Mr 9:1</A>),

 "till they see the kingdom of God come with power"; or, as in Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:27">Lu 9:27</A>),

 more simply still, "till they see the kingdom of God." The reference, 
 beyond doubt, is to the firm establishment and victorious progress, in 
 the lifetime of some then present, of that new kingdom of Christ, which 
 was destined to work the greatest of all changes on this earth, and be 
 the grand pledge of His final coming in glory.</P>

 <B>22. And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them</B>--Mark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:30">Mr 9:30</A>),

 as usual, is very precise here: "And they departed thence"--that is,
 from the scene of the last miracle--"and passed through Galilee; and He 
 would not that any man should know it." So this was not a preaching, 
 but a private, journey through Galilee. Indeed, His public ministry in 
 Galilee was now all but concluded. Though He sent out the Seventy after 
 this to preach and heal, He Himself was little more in public there, 
 and He was soon to bid it a final adieu. Till this hour arrived, He was 
 chiefly occupied with the Twelve, preparing them for the coming events.

 <B>The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And they
 were exceeding sorry</B>--Though the shock would not be so great as at the
 first announcement 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:21,22">Mt 16:21, 22</A>),

 their "sorrow" would not be the less, but probably the greater, the 
 deeper the intelligence went down into their hearts, and a new wave 
 dashing upon them by this repetition of the heavy tidings. Accordingly, 
 Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:43,44">Lu 9:43, 44</A>),

 connecting it with the scene of the miracle just recorded, and the 
 teaching which arose out of it--or possibly with all His recent 
 teaching--says our Lord forewarned the Twelve that they would soon 
 stand in need of all that teaching: "But while they wondered every one 
 at all things which Jesus did, He said unto His disciples, Let these 
 sayings sink down into your ears; for the Son of man shall be 
 delivered," &c.: "Be not carried off your feet by the grandeur you have 
 lately seen in Me, but remember what I have told you, and now tell you 
 again, that that Sun in whose beams ye now rejoice is soon to set in 
 midnight gloom." Remarkable is the antithesis in those words of our 
 Lord preserved in all the three narratives--"The son of <I>man</I> 
 shall be betrayed into the hands of <I>men.</I>" Luke adds

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:45">Lu 9:45</A>)

 that "they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that 
 they perceived it not"--for the plainest statements, when they 
 encounter long-continued and obstinate prejudices, are seen through a 
 distorting and dulling medium--"and were afraid to ask Him"; deterred 
 partly by the air of lofty sadness with which doubtless these sayings 
 were uttered, and on which they would be reluctant to break in, and 
 partly by the fear of laying themselves open to rebuke for their 
 shallowness and timidity. How artless is all this!</P>

 The time of this section is evidently in immediate succession to that of
 the preceding one. The brief but most pregnant incident which it records
 is given by Matthew alone--for whom, no doubt, it would have a peculiar
 interest, from its relation to his own town and his own familiar lake.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>24. And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute
 money</B>--the double drachma; a sum equal to two Attic drachmas, and
 corresponding to the Jewish "half-shekel," payable, towards the
 maintenance of the temple and its services, by every male Jew of twenty
 years old and upward. For the origin of this annual tax, see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:13,14,2Ch+24:6,9">Ex 30:13, 14;
 2Ch 24:6, 9</A>. 

 Thus, it will be observed, it was not a civil, but an ecclesiastical
 tax. The tax mentioned in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:25">Mt 17:25</A>

 was a civil one. The whole teaching of this very remarkable scene 
 depends upon this distinction.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>came to Peter</B>--at whose house Jesus probably resided while at
 Capernaum. This explains several things in the narrative.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?</B>--The question seems to
 imply that the payment of this tax was <I>voluntary,</I> but <I>expected;</I>
 or what, in modern phrase, would be called a "voluntary assessment."</P>

 <A NAME="Mt17_25"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>25. He saith, yes</B>--that is, "To be sure He does"; as if eager to remove
 even the suspicion of the contrary. If Peter knew--as surely he
 did--that there was at this time no money in the bag, this reply must be
 regarded as a great act of faith in his Master.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>And when he was come into the house</B>--Peter's.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Jesus prevented him</B>--anticipated him; according to the old sense of
 the word "prevent."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>saying, What thinkest thou, Simon?</B>--using his family name for
 familiarity.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>of whom do the kings of the earth take custom</B>--meaning custom on goods
 exported or imported.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>or tribute</B>--meaning the poll-tax, payable to the Romans by everyone
 whose name was in the census. This, therefore, it will be observed, was
 strictly a <I>civil</I> tax.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>of their own children, or of strangers</B>--This cannot mean "foreigners,"
 from whom sovereigns certainly do not raise taxes, but those who are not
 of their own family, that is, their subjects.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt17_26"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>26. Peter saith unto him, Of strangers</B>--"of those not their children."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free</B>--By "the children"
 our Lord cannot here mean Himself and the Twelve together, in some loose
 sense of their near relationship to God as their common Father. For
 besides that our Lord never once mixes Himself up with His disciples in
 speaking of their relation to God, but ever studiously keeps His
 relation and theirs apart (see, for example, on the last words of this
 chapter)--this would be to teach the right of believers to exemption
 from the dues required for sacred services, in the teeth of all that
 Paul teaches and that He Himself indicates throughout. He can refer
 here, then, only to Himself; using the word "children" evidently in
 order to express the general principle observed by sovereigns, who do
 not draw taxes from their own children, and thus convey the truth
 respecting His own exemption the more strikingly:--namely, "If the
 sovereign's own family be exempt, you know the inference in My case"; or
 to express it more nakedly than Jesus thought needful and fitting: "This
 is a tax for upholding My Father's House. As His Son, then, that tax is
 not due by Me--I <FONT SIZE=-1>AM FREE.</FONT>"</P>

 <A NAME="Mt17_27"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>27. Notwithstanding, lest we should offend</B>--stumble.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>them</B>--all ignorant as they are of My relation to the Lord of the
 Temple, and should misconstrue a claim to exemption into indifference to
 His honor who dwells in it.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>go thou to the sea</B>--Capernaum, it will be remembered, lay on the Sea
 of Galilee.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when
 thou hast opened his mouth, thou shall find a piece of money</B>--a
 stater. So it should have been rendered, and not indefinitely, as in our
 version, for the coin was an Attic silver coin equal to two of the
 afore-mentioned "didrachms" of half a shekel's value, and so, was the
 exact sum required for both. Accordingly, the Lord adds,

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>that take, and give unto them for me and thee</B>--literally, "instead
 of Me and thee"; perhaps because the payment was a
 <I>redemption of the person</I> paid for 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:12">Ex 30:12</A>)

 --in which view Jesus certainly was "free." If the house was Peter's, 
 this will account for payment being provided on this occasion, not for 
 all the Twelve, but only for him and His Lord. Observe, our Lord does 
 not say "for us," but "for Me and thee"; thus distinguishing the 
 Exempted One and His non-exempted disciple.</P>

 <B>not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their
 angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven</B>--A
 difficult verse; but perhaps the following may be more than an
 illustration:--Among men, those who nurse and rear the royal children,
 however humble in themselves, are allowed free entrance with their
 charge, and a degree of familiarity which even the highest state
 ministers dare not assume. Probably our Lord means that, in virtue of
 their charge over His disciples 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:13,Joh+1:51">Heb 1:13;
 Joh 1:51</A>), 

 the angels have <I>errands</I> to the throne, a <I>welcome</I> there,
 and a <I>dear familiarity</I> in dealing with "His Father which is in 
 heaven," which on their own matters they could not assume.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>11. For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost</B>--or "is
 lost." A golden saying, once and again repeated in different forms. Here
 the connection seems to be, "Since the whole object and errand of the
 Son of man into the world is to save the lost, take heed lest, by
 causing offenses, ye lose the saved." That this is the idea intended we
 may gather from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:14">Mt 18:14</A>.</P>

 <B>12, 13. How think ye? If a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them
 be gone astray,</B> &c.--This is another of those pregnant sayings which
 our Lord uttered more than once. See on the delightful parable of the
 lost sheep in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:4-7">Lu 15:4-7</A>.

 Only the object <I>there</I> is to show what the good Shepherd will do, 
 when even one of His sheep is lost, to <I>find</I> it; <I>here</I> the 
 object is to show, when found, how reluctant He is to <I>lose</I> it. 
 Accordingly, it is added,</P>

 <A NAME="Mt18_14"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>14. Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven that

 <B>15. Moreover, if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and 
 tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, 
 thou hast gained thy brother,</B> &c.--Probably our Lord had reference 
 still to the late dispute, Who should be the greatest? After the 
 rebuke--so gentle and captivating, yet so dignified and divine--under 
 which they would doubtless be smarting, perhaps each would be saying,
 It was not <I>I</I> that began it, it was not I that threw out unworthy 
 and irritating insinuations against my brethren. Be it so, says our 
 Lord; but as such things will often arise, I will direct you how to 
 proceed. <I>First,</I> Neither harbor a grudge against your offending 
 brother, nor break forth upon him in presence of the unbelieving; but 
 take him aside, show him his fault, and if he own and make reparation 
 for it, you have done more service to him than even justice to 
 yourself. <I>Next,</I> If this fail, take two or three to witness how 
 just your complaint is, and how brotherly your spirit in dealing with 
 him. <I>Again,</I> If this fail, bring him before the Church or 
 congregation to which both belong.  <I>Lastly,</I> If even this fail, 
 regard him as no longer a brother Christian, but as one "without"--as 
 the Jews did Gentiles and publicans.</P>

 loosed in heaven</B>--Here, what had been granted but a short time 
 before to Peter only (see on

 <A HREF="#Mt16_19">Mt 16:19</A>) 

 is plainly extended to all the Twelve; so that whatever it means, it 
 means nothing peculiar to Peter, far less to his pretended successors 
 at Rome. It has to do with admission to and rejection from the 
 membership of the Church. But see on

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>there am I in the midst of them</B>--On this passage--so full of sublime
 encouragement to Christian union in action and prayer--observe, first,
 the connection in which it stands. Our Lord had been speaking of church
 meetings before which the obstinate perversity of a brother was in the
 last resort to be brought, and whose decision was to be final--such
 honor does the Lord of the Church put upon its lawful assemblies. But
 not these assemblies only does He deign to countenance and honor. For
 even two uniting to bring any matter before Him shall find that they are
 not alone, for My Father is with them, says Jesus. Next, observe the
 <I>premium here put upon union in prayer.</I> As this cannot exist with
 fewer than two, so by letting it down so low as that number, He gives
 the utmost conceivable encouragement to union in this exercise. But what
 kind of union? Not an agreement merely to pray in concert, but to pray
 <I>for some definite thing.</I> "As touching anything which they shall
 ask," says our Lord--anything they shall agree to ask in concert. At
 the same time, it is plain He had certain things at that moment in His
 eye, as most fitting and needful subjects for such concerted prayer.
 The Twelve had been "falling out by the way" about the miserable
 question of precedence in their Master's kingdom, and this, as it
 stirred their corruptions, had given rise--or at least was in danger of
 giving rise--to "offenses" perilous to their souls. The Lord Himself
 had been directing them how to deal with one another about such matters.
 "But now shows He unto them a more excellent way." Let them bring all
 such matters--yea, and everything whatsoever by which either their own
 loving relationship to each other, or the good of His kingdom at large,
 might be affected--to their Father in heaven; and if they be but agreed
 in petitioning Him about that thing, it shall be done for them of His
 Father which is in heaven. But further, it is not merely union in prayer
 for the same thing--for that might be with very jarring ideas of the
 thing to be desired--but it is to symphonious prayer, the prayer by
 kindred spirits, members of one family, servants of one Lord,
 constrained by the same love, fighting under one banner, cheered by
 assurances of the same victory; a living and loving union, whose voice
 in the divine ear is as the sound of many waters. Accordingly, what they
 ask "<I>on earth</I>" is done for them, says Jesus, "of My Father which is
 <I>in heaven.</I>" Not for nothing does He say, "of
 M<FONT SIZE=-1>Y</FONT>
 F<FONT SIZE=-1>ATHER</FONT>"--not "<FONT SIZE=-1>YOUR</FONT>
 F<FONT SIZE=-1>ATHER</FONT>"; as is evident from what follows: "For where two or three are
 gathered together <I>unto My name</I>"--the "My" is emphatic, "<I>there am I</I> in the midst of them." As His name would prove
 a spell to draw together
 many clusters of His dear disciples, so if there should be but two or
 three, that will attract Himself down into the midst of them; and
 related as He is to both the parties, the petitioners and the
 Petitioned--to the one on earth by the tie of His assumed flesh, and to
 the other in heaven by the tie of His eternal Spirit--their symphonious
 prayers on earth would thrill upward through Him to heaven, be carried
 by Him into the holiest of all, and so reach the Throne. Thus will He be
 the living Conductor of the prayer upward, and the answer downward.</P>

 probably been an object of special envy, and his forwardness in
 continually answering for all the rest would likely be cast up to

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take
 account of his servants</B>--or, would scrutinize the accounts of his
 revenue collectors.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt18_24"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>24. And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which 
 owed him ten thousand talents</B>--If <I>Attic</I> talents are here 
 meant, 10,000 of them would amount to above <I>a million and a half</I> 
 sterling; if Jewish talents, to a much larger sum.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt18_25"> </A>

 sold, and his wife and children, and all that he had, and payment to
 be made</B>--(See

 obeisance to him.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all</B>--This was
 just an acknowledgment of the justice of the claim made against him, and
 a piteous imploration of mercy.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt18_27"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>27. Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and
 loosed him, and forgave him the debt</B>--Payment being hopeless, the
 master is first moved with compassion; next, liberates his debtor from
 prison; and then cancels the debt freely.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt18_28"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>28. But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellow
 servants</B>--Mark the difference here. The first case is that of master
 and servant; in this case, both are on a footing of equality. (See

 debt was to the other less than <I>one to a million.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat</B>--he seized and
 throttled him.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>saying, Pay me that thou owest</B>--Mark the mercilessness even of the
 tone.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt18_29"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>29. And his fellow servant fell down at his feet, and besought him,
 saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all</B>--The same
 attitude, and the same words which drew compassion from his master, are
 here employed towards himself by his fellow servant.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt18_30"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>30. And he would not; but went and cast him into prison, till he
 should pay the debt,</B> &c.--Jesus here vividly conveys the intolerable
 injustice and impudence which even the servants saw in this act on the
 part of one so recently laid under the heaviest obligation to their
 common master.</P>

 thou wicked servant,</B> &c.--Before bringing down his vengeance upon
 him, he calmly points out to him how shamefully unreasonable and
 heartless his conduct was; which would give the punishment inflicted on
 him a double sting.</P>

 departed from Galilee</B>--This marks a very solemn period in our Lord's
 public ministry. So slightly is it touched here, and in the
 corresponding passage of Mark 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:1">Mr 10:1</A>),

 that few readers probably note it as the Redeemer's <I>Farewell to 
 Galilee,</I> which however it was.  See on the sublime statement of 
 Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:51">Lu 9:51</A>),

 the Jordan, into Perea, the dominions of Herod Antipas. But though one 
 might conclude from our Evangelist that our Lord went straight from the 
 one region to the other, we know from the other Gospels that a 
 considerable time elapsed between the departure from the one and the 
 arrival at the other, during which many of the most important events in 
 our Lord's public life occurred--probably a large part of what is

 marriage, as such, by divine appointment; and to the purpose of God,
 expressed by the sacred historian, that in all time one man and one
 woman should by marriage become one flesh--so to continue as long as

 your inability to endure the strictness of the original law.

 avoided altogether."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This parable, recorded only by Matthew, is closely connected with the
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:27-30">end 
 of the nineteenth chapter</A>,

 being spoken with reference to Peter's question as to how it should
 fare with those who, like himself, had left all for Christ. It is 
 designed to show that while <I>they</I> would be richly rewarded, a 
 certain equity would still be observed towards <I>later</I> converts 
 and workmen in His service.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>1. For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder,</B>
 &c.--The figure of a vineyard, to represent the rearing of souls for
 heaven, the culture required and provided for that purpose, and the care
 and pains which God takes in that whole matter, is familiar to every
 reader of the Bible.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:8-16,Isa+5:1-7,Jer+2:21,Lu+20:9-16,Joh+15:1-8">Ps 80:8-16;
 Isa 5:1-7; 
 Jer 2:21;

 Joh 15:1-8</A>). 

 At vintage time, as W<FONT SIZE=-1>EBSTER</FONT> and W<FONT
 SIZE=-1>ILKINSON</FONT> remark, labor was scarce, and masters were 
 obliged to be early in the market to secure it. Perhaps the pressing 
 nature of the work of the Gospel, and the comparative paucity of 
 laborers, may be incidentally suggested,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:37,38">Mt 9:37, 38</A>.

 The "laborers," as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:38">Mt 9:38</A>,

 are first, the <I>official</I> servants of the Church, but after them 
 and along with them <I>all</I> the servants of Christ, whom He has laid 
 under the weightiest obligation to work in His service.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt20_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny</B>--a usual day's
 hire.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he sent them into his vineyard.</B></P>

 <A NAME="Mt20_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. And he went out about the third hour</B>--about nine o'clock, or after
 a fourth of the working day had expired: the day of twelve hours was
 reckoned from six to six.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and saw others standing idle in the market place</B>--unemployed.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt20_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4. And said unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is
 right</B>--just, equitable, in proportion to their time.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>I will give you. And they went their way.</B></P>

 <A NAME="Mt20_5"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>5. Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour</B>--about noon, and
 about three o'clock in the afternoon.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and did likewise</B>--hiring and sending into his vineyard fresh laborers
 each time.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt20_6"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>6. And about the eleventh hour</B>--but one hour before the close of the
 working day; a most unusual hour both for offering and engaging

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and found others standing idle, and saith, Why stand ye here all the
 day idle?</B>--Of course they had not been there, or not been disposed to
 offer themselves at the proper time; but as they were now willing, and
 the day was not over, and "yet there was room," they also are engaged,
 and on similar terms with all the rest.</P>

 masters and laborers (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:15">De 24:15</A>);

 pointing to the day of final account.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward</B>--answering to Christ
 Himself, represented "as a Son over His own house"

 received every man a penny</B>--a full day's wages.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt20_10"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 received more</B>--This is that calculating, mercenary spirit which had
 peeped out--though perhaps very slightly--in Peter's question

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:27">Mt 19:27</A>),

 servants of Christ.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt20_11"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>11. And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman
 of the house</B>--rather, "the householder," the word being the same as in

 <A NAME="Mt20_12"> </A>

 <B>12. Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made
 them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat</B>--the burning
 heat.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>of the day</B>--who have wrought not only longer but during a more trying
 period of the day.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt20_13"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>13. But he answered one of them</B>--doubtless the spokesman of the
 complaining party.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for
 a penny?</B> &c.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt20_14"> </A>

 <A NAME="Mt20_15"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>15. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine
 eye evil, because I am good?</B>--that is, "You appeal to <I>justice,</I> and
 by that your mouth is shut; for the sum you agreed for is paid you. Your
 case being disposed of, with the terms I make with other laborers you
 have nothing to do; and to grudge the benevolence shown to others, when
 by your own admission you have been honorably dealt with, is both
 unworthy envy of your neighbor, and discontent with the goodness that
 engaged and rewarded you in his service at all."</P>

 <A NAME="Mt20_16"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>16. So the last shall be first, and the first last</B>--that is, "Take
 heed lest by indulging the spirit of these murmurers at the penny given
 to the last hired, ye miss your own penny, though first in the vineyard;
 while the consciousness of having come in so late may inspire these last
 with such a humble frame, and such admiration of the grace that has
 hired and rewarded them at all, as will put them into the foremost place
 in the end."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for many be called, but few chosen</B>--This is another of our Lord's terse
 and pregnant sayings, more than once uttered in different connections.
 (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:30,22:14">Mt 19:30; 22:14</A>).

 The "calling" of which the New Testament almost invariably speaks is
 what divines call <I>effectual</I> calling, carrying with it a 
 supernatural operation on the will to secure its consent. But that 
 cannot be the meaning of it here; the "called" being emphatically 
 distinguished from the "chosen." It can only mean here the "invited." 
 And so the sense is, Many receive the invitations of the Gospel whom 
 God has never "chosen to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit 
 and belief of the truth"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:13">2Th 2:13</A>).

 But what, it may be asked, has this to do with the subject of our 
 parable? Probably this--to teach us that men who have wrought in 
 Christ's service all their days may, by the spirit which they manifest 
 at the last, make it too evident that, as between God and their own 
 souls, they never were chosen workmen at all.</P>

 Now commences, as A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> remarks, that series of parables and discourses
 of our Lord with His enemies, in which He develops, more completely than
 ever before, His hostility to their hypocrisy and iniquity: and so they
 are stirred up to compass His death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>The Authority of Jesus Questioned, and the Reply</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:23-27">Mt 21:23-27</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>23. By what authority doest thou these things!</B>--referring particularly
 to the expulsion of the buyers and sellers from the temple, 

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and who gave thee this authority?</B></P>

 <A NAME="Mt21_24"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>24. And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one
 thing,</B> &c.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt21_25"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>25. The baptism of John</B>--meaning his whole mission and ministry, of
 which baptism was the proper character.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>whence was it? from heaven, or of men?</B>--What wisdom there was in
 this way of meeting their question will best appear by their reply.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then
 believe him?</B>--"Why did ye not believe the testimony which he bore to
 Me, as the promised and expected Messiah?" for that was the burden of
 John's whole testimony.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt21_26"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>26. But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people</B>--rather, "the
 multitude." In Luke 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:6">Lu 20:6</A>)
 
 it is, "all the people will stone us"--"stone us to death."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for all hold John as a prophet</B>--Crooked, cringing hypocrites! No
 wonder Jesus gave you no answer.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt21_27"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>27. And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell</B>--Evidently their
 difficulty was, how to answer, so as neither to shake their
 determination to reject the claims of Christ nor damage their reputation
 with the people. For the truth itself they cared nothing whatever.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things</B>--What composure
 and dignity of wisdom does our Lord here display, as He turns their
 question upon themselves, and, while revealing His knowledge of their
 hypocrisy, closes their mouths! Taking advantage of the surprise,
 silence, and awe produced by this reply, our Lord followed it up
 immediately by the two following parables.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt21_28"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Parable of the Two Sons</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:28-32">Mt 21:28-32</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>28. But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the
 first and said, Son, go work to-day in my vineyard</B>--for true religion
 is a practical thing, a "bringing forth fruit unto God."</P>

 <A NAME="Mt21_29"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>29. He answered and said, I will not</B>--T<FONT SIZE=-1>RENCH</FONT> notices the rudeness of
 this answer, and the total absence of any attempt to excuse such
 disobedience, both characteristic; representing careless, reckless
 sinners resisting God to His face.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt21_30"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>30. And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and
 said, I <I>go,</I> sir</B>--"I, sir." The emphatic "I," here, denotes the
 self-righteous complacency which says, "God, I thank thee that <I>I</I> am
 not as other men" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:11">Lu 18:11</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and went not</B>--<I>He</I> did not "afterward repent" and refuse to go; for
 there was here no <I>intention</I> to go. It is the class that "say and do
 not" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:3">Mt 23:3</A>)

 --a falseness more abominable to God, says S<FONT SIZE=-1>TIER</FONT>, 
 than any "I will not."</P>

 <A NAME="Mt21_31"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>31. Whether of them twain did the will of his Father? They say unto
 him, The first</B>--Now comes the application.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and
 the harlots go</B>--or, "are going"; even now entering, while ye hold back.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>into the kingdom of God before you</B>--The publicans and the harlots were
 the first son, who, when told to work in the Lord's vineyard, said, I
 will not; but afterwards repented and went. Their early life was a flat
 and flagrant refusal to do what they were commanded; it was one
 continued rebellion against the authority of God. The chief priests and
 the elders of the people, with whom our Lord was now speaking, were the
 second son, who said, I go, sir, but went not. They were early called,
 and all their life long professed obedience to God, but never rendered
 it; their life was one of continued disobedience.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt21_32"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>32. For John came unto you in the way of righteousness</B>--that is, 
 calling you to repentance; as Noah is styled "a preacher of 
 righteousness"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:5">2Pe 2:5</A>),

 when like the Baptist he warned the old world to "flee from the wrath
 to come."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and ye believed him not</B>--They did not reject him; nay, they "were
 willing for a season to rejoice in his light" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:35">Joh 5:35</A>);

 but they would not receive his testimony to Jesus.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but the publicans and the harlots believed him</B>--Of the publicans this
 is twice expressly recorded,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:12,7:29">Lu 3:12; 7:29</A>.

 Of the harlots, then, the same may be taken for granted, though the
 fact is not expressly recorded. These outcasts gladly believed the 
 testimony of John to the coming Saviour, and so hastened to Jesus when 
 He came. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:37,15:1">Lu 7:37; 15:1</A>,
 
 &c.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might
 believe him</B>--Instead of being "provoked to jealousy" by their example,
 ye have seen them flocking to the Saviour and getting to heaven,
 unmoved.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt21_33"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Parable of the Wicked Husbandmen</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:33-46">Mt 21:33-46</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>33. Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which 
 planted a vineyard</B>--(See on

 <A HREF="JFB42.htm#Lu13_6">Lu 13:6</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a
 tower</B>--These details are taken, as is the basis of the parable itself,
 from that beautiful parable of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:1-7">Isa 5:1-7</A>,

 in order to fix down the application and sustain it by Old Testament 
 authority.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and let it out to husbandmen</B>--These are just the ordinary spiritual
 guides of the people, under whose care and culture the fruits of
 righteousness are expected to spring up.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and went into a far country</B>--"for a long time" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:9">Lu 20:9</A>),

 leaving the vineyard to the laws of the spiritual husbandry during the 
 whole time of the Jewish economy. On this phraseology, see on

 <A HREF="JFB41.htm#Mr4_26">Mr 4:26</A>.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt21_34"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>34. And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants
 to the husbandmen</B>--By these "servants" are meant the prophets and
 other extraordinary messengers, raised up from time to time.  See on

 <A HREF="#Mt23_37">Mt 23:37</A>.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>that they might receive the fruits of it</B>--Again see on

 <A HREF="JFB42.htm#Lu13_6">Lu 13:6</A>.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt21_35"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>35. And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one</B>--see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+37:15,38:6">Jer 37:15; 38:6</A>.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and killed another</B>--see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+26:20-23">Jer 26:20-23</A>.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and stoned another</B>--see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:21">2Ch 24:21</A>.
 
 Compare with this whole verse

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:35,23:37">Mt 23:37</A>,

 where our Lord reiterates these charges in the most melting strain.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt21_36"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>36. Again, he sent other servants more than the first; and they did
 unto them likewise</B>--see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:13,2Ch+36:16,18,Ne+9:26">2Ki 17:13;
 2Ch 36:16, 18; 
 Ne 9:26</A>.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt21_37"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>37. But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will
 reverence my son</B>--In Mark 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:6">Mr 12:6</A>)

 this is most touchingly expressed: "Having yet therefore one son, His
 well-beloved, He sent Him also last unto them, saying, They will 
 reverence My Son." Luke's version of it too

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:13">Lu 20:13</A>)

 is striking: "Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I 
 will send My beloved Son: it may be they will reverence Him when they 
 see Him." Who does not see that our Lord here severs Himself, by the 
 sharpest line of demarcation, from all merely <I>human</I> messengers, 
 and claims for Himself <I>Sonship</I> in its loftiest sense? (Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:3-6">Heb 3:3-6</A>).

 The expression, "<I>It may be</I> they will reverence My Son," is 
 designed to teach the almost unimaginable guilt of <I>not</I> 
 reverentially welcoming God's Son.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt21_38"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>38. But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves</B>--Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:18-20,Joh+11:47-53">Ge 37:18-20;
 Joh 11:47-53</A>.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>This is the heir</B>--Sublime expression this of the great truth, that
 God's inheritance was destined for, and in due time is to come into the
 possession of, His own Son <I>in our nature</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:2">Heb 1:2</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance</B>--that so,
 from mere <I>servants,</I> we may become <I>lords.</I> This is the deep aim of
 the depraved heart; this is emphatically "the root of all evil."</P>

 <A NAME="Mt21_39"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>39. And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard</B>--compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:11-13">Heb 13:11-13</A>
 
 ("without the gate--without the camp");

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:13,Joh+19:17">1Ki 21:13;
 Joh 19:17</A>.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and slew him.</B></P>

 <A NAME="Mt21_40"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>40. When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh</B>--This represents
 "the settling time," which, in the case of the Jewish ecclesiastics, was
 that judicial trial of the nation and its leaders which issued in the
 destruction of their whole state.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>what will he do unto those husbandmen?</B></P>

 <A NAME="Mt21_41"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>41. They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men</B>--an
 emphatic alliteration not easily conveyed in English: "He will badly
 destroy those bad men," or "miserably destroy those miserable men," is
 something like it.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render
 him the fruits in their seasons</B>--If this answer was given by the
 Pharisees, to whom our Lord addressed the parable, they thus unwittingly
 pronounced their own condemnation: as did David to Nathan the prophet

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:5-7">2Sa 12:5-7</A>),

 and Simon the Pharisee to our Lord 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:43">Lu 7:43</A>,

 &c.).  But if it was given, as the two other Evangelists agree in 
 representing it, by our Lord Himself, and the explicitness of the

 <B>2. The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a 
 marriage for his son</B>--"In this parable," as 
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>RENCH</FONT> admirably remarks, "we see how the Lord is
 revealing Himself in ever clearer light as the central Person of the 
 kingdom, giving here a far plainer hint than in the last parable of the 
 nobility of His descent. There He was indeed the Son, the only and 
 beloved one

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:6">Mr 12:6</A>),

 of the Householder; but here His race is royal, and He appears as
 Himself at once the King and the King's Son

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:1">Ps 72:1</A>).

 The last was a parable of the Old Testament history; and Christ is 
 rather the last and greatest of the line of its prophets and teachers 
 than the founder of a new kingdom. In that, God appears 
 <I>demanding</I> something <I>from</I> men; in this, a parable of 
 grace, God appears more as <I>giving</I> something <I>to</I> them.  
 Thus, as often, the two complete each other: this taking up the matter 
 where the other left it." The "marriage" of Jehovah to His people 
 Israel was familiar to Jewish ears; and in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:1-17">Ps 45:1-17</A>

 this marriage is seen consummated in the Person of Messiah 

 "<FONT SIZE=-1>THE</FONT> K<FONT SIZE=-1>ING</FONT>," Himself addressed
 as "G<FONT SIZE=-1>OD</FONT>" and yet as anointed by 
 "H<FONT SIZE=-1>IS</FONT> G<FONT SIZE=-1>OD</FONT>" with the oil of 
 gladness above His fellows. These apparent contradictions (see on

 <A HREF="JFB42.htm#Lu20_41">Lu 20:41-44</A>)

 are resolved in this parable; and Jesus, in claiming to be this King's 
 Son, <I>serves Himself Heir to all that the prophets and sweet singers 
 of Israel held forth as to Jehovah's ineffably near and endearing union 
 to His people.</I> But observe carefully, that <FONT SIZE=-1>THE</FONT> 
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>RIDE</FONT> does not come into view in this parable; its
 design being to teach certain truths under the figure of <I>guests</I>
 at a wedding <I>feast,</I> and the want of a wedding <I>garment,</I> 
 which would not have harmonized with the introduction of the Bride.</P>

 Gospel.

 "bidden," from the first choice of them onwards through every summons
 addressed to them by the prophets to hold themselves in readiness for
 the appearing of their King.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>to the wedding</B>--or the marriage festivities, when the preparations
 were all concluded.

 showed.</P>

 Christ's death, resurrection, ascension, and effusion of the Spirit, to
 which the parable could not directly allude, but when only it could be
 said, with strict propriety, "that all things were ready." Compare

 all as many as they found, both bad and good</B>--that is, without making
 any distinction between open sinners and the morally correct. The Gospel
 call fetched in Jews, Samaritans, and outlying heathen alike. Thus far
 the parable answers to that of "the Great Supper" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:16-24">Lu 14:16</A>,

 follows:</P>

 <A NAME="Mt22_11"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>11. And when the king came in to see the guests</B>--Solemn
 expression this, of that <I>omniscient inspection of every professed
 disciple of the Lord Jesus</I> from age to age, in virtue of which his
 true character will hereafter be judicially proclaimed!

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he saw there a man</B>--This shows that it is the judgment of
 <I>individuals</I> which is intended in this latter part of the parable:
 the first part represents rather <I>national</I> judgment.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>which had not on a wedding garment</B>--The language here is drawn from
 the following remarkable passage in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:7,8">Zep 1:7, 8</A>:

 --"Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord God; for the day of the 
 Lord is at hand: for the Lord hath prepared a sacrifice, He hath bid 
 His guests. And it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord's 
 sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and 
 all such as are clothed with strange apparel." The custom in the East 
 of presenting festival garments (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+45:22,2Ki+5:22">Ge 45:22;
 2Ki 5:22</A>), 

 even though nor clearly proved, Is certainly presupposed here. It 
 undoubtedly means something which they bring not of their own--for how 
 could they have any such dress who were gathered in from the highways 
 indiscriminately?--but which they <I>receive</I> as their appropriate 
 dress. And what can that be but what is meant by "putting on the Lord 
 Jesus," as
 "T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT>
 L<FONT SIZE=-1>ORD</FONT>
 O<FONT SIZE=-1>UR</FONT>
 R<FONT SIZE=-1>IGHTEOUSNESS</FONT>?"
 (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:13,14">Ps 45:13, 14</A>).

 Nor could such language be strange to those in whose ears had so long
 resounded those words of prophetic joy: "I will greatly rejoice in the 
 Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for He hath clothed me with 
 the garments of salvation, He hath covered me with the robe of 
 righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a 
 bride adorneth herself with her jewels"

 <A NAME="Mt22_12"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>12. Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding garment?
 And he was speechless</B>--being self-condemned.</P>

 brightness and glory and joy and felicity of the kingdom above, but 
 thrust into a region of "darkness," with all its horrors, this is the 
 dismal retribution here announced, that awaits the unworthy at the

 thus, it will be seen, of great importance, as limiting those
 injunctions which He would have them obey to what they fetched from the
 law itself. In requiring implicit obedience to such injunctions, He
 would have them to recognize the authority with which they taught over
 and above the obligations of the law itself--an important principle
 truly; but He who denounced the traditions of such teachers

 it is, "Ye fools, did not He that made that which is without make that 
 which is within also?"--"He to whom belongs the outer life, and of 
 right demands its subjection to Himself, is the inner man less His?" A 
 remarkable example this of our Lord's power of drawing the most 
 striking illustrations of great truths from the most familiar objects 
 and incidents in life. To these words, recorded by Luke, He adds the 
 following, involving a principle of immense value: "But rather give 
 alms of such things as ye have, and behold, all things are clean unto 
 you"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:41">Lu 11:41</A>).

 of their character

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:14">Lu 16:14</A>),

 our Lord bids them exemplify the opposite character, and then their 
 <I>outside,</I> ruled by this, would be beautiful in the eye of God, 
 and their meals would be eaten with clean hands, though much fouled 
 with the business of this everyday world. (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:3">Ac 23:3</A>).

 The process of whitewashing the sepulchres, as L<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>IGHTFOOT</FONT> says, was performed on a certain day every 
 year, not for ceremonial cleansing, but, as the following words seem
 rather to imply, to beautify them.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead
 men's bones, and of all uncleanness</B>--What a powerful way of conveying
 the charge, that with all their fair show their hearts were full of
 corruption! (Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+5:9,Ro+3:13">Ps 5:9;
 Ro 3:13</A>). 

 But our Lord, stripping off the figure, next holds up their iniquity in
 naked colors.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children 
 of them which killed the prophets</B>--that is, "ye be witnesses that 
 ye have inherited, and voluntarily served yourselves heirs to, the 
 truth-hating, prophet-killing, spirit of your fathers." Out of 
 pretended respect and honor, they repaired and beautified the 
 sepulchres of the prophets, and with whining hypocrisy said, "If we had 
 been in their days, how differently should we have treated these 
 prophets?" While all the time they were witnesses to themselves that 
 they were the children of them that killed the prophets, convicting 
 themselves daily of as exact a resemblance in spirit and character to 
 the very classes over whose deeds they pretended to mourn, as child to 
 parent. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:44">Lu 11:44</A>

 our Lord gives another turn to this figure of a grave: "Ye are as 
 graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware 
 of them." As one might unconsciously walk over a grave concealed from 
 view, and thus contract ceremonial defilement, so the plausible 
 exterior of the Pharisees kept people from perceiving the pollution 
 they contracted from coming in contact with such corrupt 
 characters.</P>

 "am about to send." In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:49">Lu 11:49</A>

 the variation is remarkable: "Therefore also, said the wisdom of God, I 
 will send them," &c. What precisely is meant by "the wisdom of God" 
 here, is somewhat difficult to determine. To us it appears to be simply 
 an announcement of a purpose of the Divine Wisdom, in the high style of 
 ancient prophecy, to send a last set of messengers whom the people 
 would reject, and rejecting, would fill up the cup of their iniquity. 
 But, whereas in Luke it is "I, the Wisdom of God, will send them," in 
 Matthew it is "I, Jesus, am sending them"; language only befitting the 
 one sender of all the prophets, the Lord God of Israel now in the 
 flesh. They are evidently evangelical messengers, but called by the 
 familiar Jewish names of "prophets, wise men, and scribes," whose 
 counterparts were the inspired and gifted servants of the Lord Jesus; 
 for in Luke

 it is "prophets and apostles."

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:20-22">2Ch 24:20-22</A>,

 as the <I>last recorded</I> and most suitable case for illustration.

 collected vengeance of heaven broke at once over its devoted head. In

 <B>37. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest
 them which are sent unto thee,</B> &c.--How ineffably grand and melting
 is this apostrophe! It is the very heart of God pouring itself forth
 through human flesh and speech. It is this incarnation of the innermost
 life and love of Deity, pleading with men, bleeding for them, and
 ascending only to open His arms to them and win them back by the power
 of this story of matchless love, that has conquered the world, that will
 yet "draw all men unto Him," and beautify and ennoble Humanity itself!
 "Jerusalem" here does not mean the mere city or its inhabitants; nor is
 it to be viewed merely as the metropolis of the <I>nation,</I> but as the
 <I>center of their religious life</I>--"the city of their solemnities,
 whither the tribes went up, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord";
 and at this moment it was full of them. It is the whole family of God,
 then, which is here apostrophized by a name dear to every Jew, recalling
 to him all that was distinctive and precious in his religion. The
 intense feeling that sought vent in this utterance comes out first in
 the redoubling of the opening word--"Jerusalem, Jerusalem!" but, next,
 in the picture of it which He draws--"that killest the prophets, and
 stonest them which are sent unto thee!"--not content with spurning God's
 messages of mercy, that canst not suffer even the messengers to live!
 When He adds, "How often would I have gathered thee!" He refers surely
 to something beyond the six or seven times that He visited and taught in
 Jerusalem while on earth. No doubt it points to "the prophets," whom
 they "killed," to "them that were sent unto her," whom they "stoned."
 But whom would He have gathered so often? "Thee," truth-hating,
 mercy-spurning, prophet-killing Jerusalem--how often would I have
 gathered <I>thee!</I> Compare with this that affecting clause in the great
 ministerial commission, "that repentance and remission of sins should be
 preached in His name among all nations, <I>beginning at Jerusalem!</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:47">Lu 24:47</A>).

 What encouragement to the heartbroken at their own long-continued and 
 obstinate rebellion! But we have not yet got at the whole heart of this 
 outburst. I would have gathered thee, He says, "even as a hen gathereth 
 her chickens under her wings." Was ever imagery so homely invested with 
 such grace and such sublimity as this, at our Lord's touch? And yet how 
 exquisite the figure itself--of protection, rest, warmth, and all 
 manner of conscious well-being in those poor, defenseless, dependent 
 little creatures, as they creep under and feel themselves overshadowed 
 by the capacious and kindly wing of the mother bird! If, wandering 
 beyond hearing of her peculiar call, they are overtaken by a storm or 
 attacked by an enemy, what can they do but in the one case droop and 
 die, and in the other submit to be torn in pieces? But if they can 
 reach in time their place of safety, under the mother's wing, in vain 
 will any enemy try to drag them thence. For rising into strength, 
 kindling into fury, and forgetting herself entirely in her young, she 
 will let the last drop of her blood be shed out and perish in defense 
 of her precious charge, rather than yield them to an enemy's talons. 
 How significant all this of what Jesus is and does for men! Under His 
 great Mediatorial wing would He have "gathered" Israel. For the figure, 
 see

 But what was the result of all this tender and mighty love? The answer 
 is, "And ye would not." O mysterious word! mysterious the resistance of

 <B>Ye shall not see me henceforth</B>--What? Does Jesus mean that He was
 Himself the Lord of the temple, and that it became "deserted" when
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>E</FONT>
 finally left it? It is even so. Now is thy fate sealed, O Jerusalem, for
 the glory is departed from thee! That glory, once visible in the holy of
 holies, over the mercy seat, when on the day of atonement the blood of
 typical expiation was sprinkled on it and in front of it--called by the
 Jews the <I>Shekinah,</I> or the <I>Dwelling,</I> as being the visible
 pavilion of Jehovah--that glory, which Isaiah 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:1-13">Isa 6:1-13</A>)

 P<FONT SIZE=-1>ARABLE OF THE</FONT>
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>EN</FONT>
 V<FONT SIZE=-1>IRGINS.</FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This and the following parable are in Matthew alone.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>1. Then</B>--at the time referred to at the close of the preceding chapter,
 the time of the Lord's Second Coming to reward His faithful servants and
 take vengeance on the faithless. <I>Then</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took
 their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom</B>--This supplies a
 key to the parable, whose object is, in the main, the same as that of
 the last parable--to illustrate
 <I>the vigilant and expectant attitude of faith,</I> in respect of which
 believers are described as "they that look for Him"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:28">Heb 9:28</A>),

 and "love His appearing"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:8">2Ti 4:8</A>).

 In the last parable it was that of servants waiting for their absent 
 Lord; in this it is that of virgin attendants on a Bride, whose duty it 
 was to go forth at night with lamps, and be ready on the appearance of 
 the Bridegroom to conduct the Bride to his house, and go in with him to 
 the marriage. This entire and beautiful change of figure brings out the 
 lesson of the former parable in quite a new light. But let it be 
 observed that, just as in the parable of the Marriage Supper
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:15-24">Lu 14:15-24</A>),

 so in this--the <I>Bride</I> does not come into view at all in this
 parable; the <I>Virgins</I> and the <I>Bridegroom</I> holding forth all
 the intended instruction: nor could believers be represented both as
 Bride and Bridal Attendants without incongruity.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt25_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. And five of them were wise, and five were foolish</B>--They are 
 not distinguished into good and bad, as T<FONT SIZE=-1>RENCH</FONT> 
 observes, but into "wise" and "foolish"--just as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:25-27">Mt 7:25-27</A>

 those who reared their house for eternity are distinguished into "wise" 
 and "foolish builders"; because in both cases a certain degree of 
 goodwill towards the truth is assumed.  To make anything of the equal 
 number of both classes would, we think, be precarious, save to warn us 
 how large a portion of those who, up to the last, so nearly resemble 
 those that love Christ's appearing will be disowned by Him when He 
 comes.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt25_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</B></P>

 <A NAME="Mt25_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4. But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps</B>--What are
 these "lamps" and this "oil"? Many answers have been given. But since
 the foolish as well as the wise took their lamps and went forth with
 them to meet the Bridegroom, these lighted lamps and this advance a
 certain way in company with the wise, must denote that Christian
 profession which is common to all who bear the Christian name; while the
 insufficiency of this without something else, of which they never
 possessed themselves, shows that "the foolish" mean those who, with all
 that is common to them with real Christians,
 <I>lack the essential preparation for meeting Christ.</I> Then, since the
 wisdom of "the wise" consisted in their taking with their lamps a supply
 of oil in their vessels, keeping their lamps burning till the Bridegroom
 came, and so fitting them to go in with Him to the marriage, this supply
 of oil must mean that <I>inward reality of grace</I> which alone will stand
 when He appears whose eyes are as a flame of fire. But this is too
 general; for it cannot be for nothing that this inward grace is here set
 forth by the familiar symbol of <I>oil,</I> by which
 <I>the Spirit of all grace</I> is so constantly represented in Scripture.
 Beyond all doubt, this was what was symbolized by that precious
 anointing oil with which Aaron and his sons were consecrated to the
 priestly office 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:23-25,30">Ex 30:23-25, 30</A>);

 by "the oil of gladness above His fellows" with which Messiah was to be 
 anointed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:7,Heb+1:9">Ps 45:7;
 Heb 1:9</A>),

 even as it is expressly said, that "God giveth not the Spirit by
 measure unto Him"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:34">Joh 3:34</A>);

 and by the bowl full of golden oil, in Zechariah's vision, which, 
 receiving its supplies from the two olive trees on either side of it, 
 poured it through seven golden pipes into the golden lamp-stand to keep 
 it continually burning bright

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:1-14">Zec 4:1-14</A>)

 --for the prophet is expressly told that it was to proclaim the great 
 truth, "Not by might, nor by power, but by M<FONT SIZE=-1>Y</FONT> 
 S<FONT SIZE=-1>PIRIT,</FONT> saith the Lord of hosts [shall this temple 
 be built]. Who art thou, O great mountain [of opposition to this 
 issue]? Before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain [or, be swept out 
 of the way], and he shall bring forth the head stone [of the temple], 
 with shoutings [crying], G<FONT SIZE=-1>RACE,</FONT> G<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>RACE</FONT> unto it." This supply of oil, then, representing 
 that inward grace which distinguishes the wise, must denote, more 
 particularly, that "supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ," which, as it 
 is the source of the new spiritual life at the first, is the secret of 
 its <I>enduring</I> character. Everything <I>short of this</I> may be 
 possessed by "the foolish"; while it is the possession of this that 
 makes "the wise" to be "ready" when the Bridegroom appears, and fit to 
 "go in with Him to the marriage." Just so in the parable of the Sower,
 the stony-ground hearers, "having no deepness of earth" and "no root in 
 themselves" 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:5,Mk+4:17">Mt 13:5;
 Mr 4:17</A>),

 though they spring up and get even into ear, never ripen, while they in 
 the good ground bear the precious grain.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt25_5"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>5. While the bridegroom tarried</B>--So in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:48">Mt 24:48</A>,

 "My Lord delayeth His coming"; and so Peter says sublimely of the 
 ascended Saviour, "Whom the heaven must receive until the times of 
 restitution of all things"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:21">Ac 3:21</A>,
 
 and compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:11,12">Lu 19:11, 12</A>).

 Christ "tarries," among other reasons, to try the faith and patience of
 His people. 

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>they all slumbered and slept</B>--the wise as well as the foolish. The world
 "slumbered" signifies, simply, "nodded," or, "became drowsy"; while the
 world "slept" is the usual word for lying down to sleep, denoting two
 stages of spiritual declension--first, that half-involuntary lethargy or
 drowsiness which is apt to steal over one who falls into inactivity; and
 then a conscious, deliberate yielding to it, after a little vain
 resistance. Such was the state alike of the wise and the foolish
 virgins, even till the cry of the Bridegroom's approach awoke them. So
 likewise in the parable of the Importunate Widow: "When the Son of man
 cometh, shall He find faith on the earth?" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:8">Lu 18:8</A>).</P>

 <A NAME="Mt25_6"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>6. And at midnight</B>--that is, the time when the Bridegroom will be least
 expected; for "the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:2">1Th 5:2</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>there was a cry made, Behold, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet
 him</B>--that is, Be ready to welcome Him.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt25_7"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>7. Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps</B>--the foolish
 virgins as well as the wise. How very long do both parties seem the
 same--almost to the moment of decision! Looking at the mere form of the
 parable, it is evident that the folly of "the foolish" consisted not in
 having no oil at all; for they must have had oil enough in their lamps
 to keep them burning up to this moment: their folly consisted in not
 making provision against its <I>exhaustion,</I> by taking with their lamp
 an <I>oil-vessel</I> wherewith to replenish their lamp from time to time,
 and so have it burning until the Bridegroom should come. Are we,
 then--with some even superior expositors--to conclude that the foolish
 virgins must represent true Christians as well as do the wise, since
 only true Christians have the Spirit, and that the difference between
 the two classes consists only in the one having the necessary
 watchfulness which the other wants? Certainly not. Since the parable was
 designed to hold forth the prepared and the unprepared to meet Christ at
 His coming, and how the unprepared might, up to the very last, be
 confounded with the prepared--the structure of the parable behooved to
 accommodate itself to this, by making the lamps of the foolish to burn,
 as well as those of the wise, up to a certain point of time, and only
 then to discover their inability to burn on for want of a fresh supply
 of oil. But this is evidently just a <I>structural device;</I> and the real
 difference between the two classes who profess to love the Lord's
 appearing is a <I>radical one</I>--the possession by the one class of
 <I>an enduring principle of spiritual life,</I> and the want of it by the
 other.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt25_8"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>8. And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our
 lamps are gone out</B>--rather, as in the <I>Margin,</I> "are going out"; for
 oil will not light an extinguished lamp, though it will keep a burning
 one from going out. Ah! now at length they have discovered not only
 their own folly, but the wisdom of the other class, and they do homage
 to it. They did not perhaps despise them before, but they thought them
 righteous overmuch; now they are forced, with bitter mortification, to
 wish they were like them.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt25_9"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>9. But the wise answered, <I>Not so;</I> lest there be not enough 
 for us and you</B>--The words "Not so," it will be seen, are not in the 
 original, where the reply is very elliptical--"In case there be not 
 enough for us and you." A truly wise answer this. "And what, then, if 
 we shall share it with you? Why, both will be undone."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves</B>--Here again
 it would be straining the parable beyond its legitimate design to make
 it teach that men may get salvation even after they are supposed and
 required to have it already gotten. It is merely a friendly way of
 reminding them of the proper way of obtaining the needed and precious
 article, with a certain reflection on them for having it now to seek.
 Also, when the parable speaks of "selling" and "buying" that valuable
 article, it means simply, "Go, get it in the only legitimate way." And
 yet the word "buy" is significant; for we are elsewhere bidden, "buy
 wine and milk without money and without price," and "buy of Christ gold
 tried in the fire," &c.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:1,Re+3:18">Isa 55:1;
 Re 3:18</A>). 

 Now, since what we pay the demanded price for becomes thereby <I>our
 own property,</I> the salvation which we thus take gratuitously at 
 God's hands, being bought in His own sense of that word, becomes ours 
 thereby in inalienable possession.  (Compare for the language,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:23,Mt+13:44">Pr 23:23;

 <A NAME="Mt25_10"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>10. And while they went to buy, the Bridegroom came; and they that were
 ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut</B>--They are
 sensible of their past folly; they have taken good advice: they are in
 the act of getting what alone they lacked: a very little more, and they
 also are ready. But the Bridegroom comes; the ready are admitted; "the
 door is shut," and they are undone. How graphic and appalling this
 picture of one <I>almost saved--but lost!</I></P>

 <A NAME="Mt25_11"> </A>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:22">Mt 7:22</A>

 this reiteration of the name was an exclamation rather of surprise;
 here it is a piteous cry of urgency, bordering on despair. Ah! now at 
 length their eyes are wide open, and they realize all the consequences 
 of their past folly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>12. But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you

 here, and "I never knew you" in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:23">Mt 7:23</A>

 --as if this were gentler, and so implied a milder fate, reserved for 
 "the foolish" of this parable--is to be resisted, though advocated by 
 such critics as O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT>, S<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>TIER</FONT>, and A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>. Besides being 
 inconsistent with the general tenor of such language, and particularly 
 the solemn moral of the whole

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:13">Mt 25:13</A>),

 it is a <I>kind</I> of criticism which tampers with some of the most 
 awful warnings regarding the future. If it be asked why unworthy guests 
 were admitted to the marriage of the King's Son, in a former parable, 
 and the foolish virgins are excluded in this one, we may answer, in the 
 admirable words of G<FONT SIZE=-1>ERHARD</FONT>, quoted by T<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>RENCH</FONT>, that those festivities are celebrated in this 
 life, in the Church militant; these at the last day, in the Church 
 triumphant; to those, even they are admitted who are not adorned with 
 the wedding garment; but to these, only they to whom it is granted to 
 be arrayed in fine linen clean and white, which is the righteousness of 
 saints

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:8">Re 19:8</A>);

 to those, men are called by the trumpet of the Gospel; to these by the 
 trumpet of the Archangel; to those, who enters may go out from them, or 
 be cast out; who is once introduced to these never goes out, nor is 
 cast out, from them any more: wherefore it is said, "The door is 
 shut."</P>

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>RENCH</FONT> observes with his usual felicity, "the
 virgins were represented as <I>waiting</I> for their Lord, we have the
 servants <I>working</I> for Him; there the <I>inward spiritual life</I> of the
 faithful was described; here his <I>external activity.</I> It is not,
 therefore, without good reason that they appear in their actual
 order--that of the Virgins first, and of the Talents following--since it
 is the sole condition of a profitable outward activity for the kingdom
 of God, that the life of God be diligently maintained within the heart."</P>

 <B>14. For <I>the kingdom of heaven is</I> as a man</B>--The ellipsis is better

 <B>who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods</B>--Between
 master and slaves this was not uncommon in ancient times. Christ's
 "servants" here mean all who, by their Christian profession, stand in
 the relation to Him of entire subjection. His "goods" mean all their
 gifts and endowments, whether original or acquired, natural or
 spiritual. As all that slaves have belongs to their master, so Christ
 has a claim to everything which belongs to His people, everything which,
 may be turned to good, and He demands its appropriation to His service,
 or, viewing it otherwise, they first offer it up to Him; as being "not
 their own, but bought with a price" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:19,20">1Co 6:19, 20</A>),

 rewarded. And thus there is perfect equity.

 enlisted in Christ's service, and his opportunities in providence for
 employing the gifts bestowed on him.

 ashamed before Him at His coming!"

 blame of their fruitlessness.</P>

 <B>and went and hid thy talent in the earth</B>--This depicts the conduct
 of all those who shut up their gifts from the active service of Christ,
 without actually prostituting them to unworthy uses. Fitly, therefore,
 may it, at least, comprehend those, to whom
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>RENCH</FONT> refers, who, in the
 early Church, pleaded that they had enough to do with their own souls,
 and were afraid of losing them in trying to save others; and so, instead
 of being the salt of the earth, thought rather of keeping their own
 saltness by withdrawing sometimes into caves and wildernesses, from all
 those active ministries of love by which they might have served their
 brethren.

 <B>Thou wicked and slothful servant</B>--"Wicked" or "bad" means
 "falsehearted," as opposed to the others, who are emphatically styled
 "<I>good</I> servants." The addition of "slothful" is to mark the precise
 nature of his wickedness: it consisted, it seems, not in his doing
 anything <I>against,</I> but simply nothing <I>for</I> his master.

 imputed to him, but simply his demand of

 or all <I>except</I> believers in Christ, will seem amazing to any simple
 reader. Yet this is the exposition of O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT>,
 S<FONT SIZE=-1>TIER</FONT>,
 K<FONT SIZE=-1>EIL</FONT>,
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>
 (though latterly with some diffidence), and of a number, though not
 all, of those who hold that Christ will come the second time before the
 millennium, and that the saints will be caught up to meet Him in the
 air before His appearing. Their chief argument is, the impossibility of
 any that ever knew the Lord Jesus wondering, at the Judgment Day, that
 they should be thought to have done--or left undone--anything "unto
 Christ." To that we shall advert when we come to it. But here we may
 just say, that if this scene does not describe a personal, public,
 final judgment on men, according to the treatment they have given to
 Christ--and consequently men within the Christian pale--we shall have
 to consider again whether our Lord's teaching on the greatest themes of
 human interest does indeed possess that incomparable simplicity and
 transparency of meaning which, by universal consent, has been ascribed
 to it. If it be said, But how can this be the general judgment, if only
 those within the Christian pale be embraced by it?--we answer, What is
 here described, as it certainly does not meet the case of all the
 family of Adam, is of course <I>so far</I> not general. But we have no
 right to conclude that the whole "judgment of the great day" will be
 limited to the point of view here presented. Other explanations will
 come up in the course of our exposition.

 Jesus, and that on the eve of His deepest humiliation! It is to intimate
 that in then addressing the heirs of the kingdom,
 <I>He will put on all His regal majesty.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>say unto them on his right hand, Come</B>--the same sweet word with which
 He had so long invited all the weary and heavy laden to come unto Him
 for rest. Now it is addressed exclusively to such as <I>have</I> come and
 found rest. It is still, "Come," and to "rest" too; but to rest in a
 higher style, and in another region.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
 foundation of the world</B>--The whole story of this their blessedness is
 given by the apostle, in words which seem but an expression of these:
 "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath
 blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ;
 according as He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the
 world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love."
 They were chosen from everlasting to the possession and enjoyment of all
 spiritual blessings in Christ, and so chosen in order to be holy and
 blameless in love. This is the holy love whose practical manifestations
 the King is about to recount in detail; and thus we see that their whole
 life of love to Christ is the fruit of an eternal purpose of love to
 them in Christ.</P>

 <B>40. And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto 
 you,</B> &c.--Astonishing dialogue this between the King, from the 
 Throne of His glory, and His wondering people! "I was an hungered, and 
 ye gave Me meat," &c.--"Not we," they reply. "We never did that, Lord: 
 We were born out of due time, and enjoyed not the privilege of 
 ministering unto Thee." "But ye did it to these My brethren, now beside 
 you, when cast upon your love." "Truth, Lord, but was that doing it to 
 Thee? Thy name was indeed dear to us, and we thought it a great honor 
 to suffer shame for it. When among the destitute and distressed we 
 discerned any of the household of faith, we will not deny that our 
 hearts leapt within us at the discovery, and when their knock came to 
 our dwelling, 'our bowels were moved,' as though 'our Beloved Himself 
 had put in His hand by the hole of the door.' Sweet was the fellowship 
 we had with them, as if we had 'entertained angels unawares'; all 
 difference between giver and receiver somehow melted away under the 
 beams of that love of Thine which knit us together; nay, rather, as 
 they left us with gratitude for our poor givings, we seemed the 
 debtors--not they. But, Lord, were we all that time in company with 
 Thee? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes, that scene was all with Me," replies the 
 King--"Me in the disguise of My poor ones. The door shut against Me by 
 others was opened by you--'Ye took Me in.' Apprehended and imprisoned 
 by the enemies of the truth, ye whom the truth had made free sought Me 
 out diligently and found Me; visiting Me in My lonely cell at the risk 
 of your own lives, and cheering My solitude; ye gave Me a coat, for I 
 shivered; and then I felt warm. With cups of cold water ye moistened My 
 parched lips; when famished with hunger ye supplied Me with crusts, and 
 my spirit revived--/Y<FONT SIZE=-1>E DID IT UNTO</FONT> M<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>E</FONT>.'" What thoughts crowd upon us as we listen to such a 
 description of the scenes of the Last Judgment! And in the light of 
 this view of the heavenly dialogue, how bald and wretched, not to say 
 unscriptural, is that view of it to which we referred at the outset, 
 which makes it a dialogue between Christ and <I>heathens</I> who never 
 heard of His name, and of course never felt any stirrings of His love 
 in their hearts! To us it seems a poor, superficial objection to the 
 <I>Christian</I> view of this scene, that Christians could never be 
 supposed to ask such questions as the "blessed of Christ's Father" are 
 made to ask here. If there were any difficulty in explaining this, the 
 difficulty of the other view is such as to make <I>it,</I> at least, 
 insufferable. But there is no real difficulty. The surprise expressed 
 is not at their being told that they acted from love to Christ, but 
 that <I>Christ Himself</I> was the <I>Personal Object</I> of all their 
 deeds: that they found <I>Him</I> hungry, and supplied Him with food: 
 that they brought water to <I>Him,</I> and slaked His thirst; that 
 seeing <I>Him</I> naked and shivering, they put warm clothing upon Him, 
 paid <I>Him</I> visits when lying in prison for the truth, and sat by 
 <I>His</I> bedside when laid down with sickness. This is the 
 astonishing interpretation which Jesus says "the King" will give to 
 them of their own actions here below. And will any Christian reply, 
 "How could this astonish them? Does not every Christian know that He 
 does these very things, when He does them at all, just as they are here 
 represented?" Nay, rather, is it conceivable that they should 
 <I>not</I> be astonished, and almost doubt their own ears, to hear such 
 an account of their own actions upon earth from the lips of the Judge? 
 And remember, that Judge has come in His glory, and now sits upon the 
 throne of His glory, and all the holy angels are with Him; and that it
 is from those glorified Lips that the words come forth, "Ye did all 
 this unto M<FONT SIZE=-1>E</FONT>." Oh, can we imagine such a word 
 addressed to <I>ourselves,</I> and then fancy ourselves replying, "Of 
 course we did--To whom else did we anything? It must be others than we 
 that are addressed, who never knew, in all their good deeds, what they 
 were about?" Rather, can we imagine ourselves not overpowered with 
 astonishment, and scarcely able to credit the testimony borne to us by 
 the King?</P>

 "In <I>our</I> eyes, Lord? We never saw Thee before, and never, sure,
 behaved we so to Thee." "But thus ye treated these little ones that
 believe in Me and now stand on My right hand. In the disguise of these

 <B>3. Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was
 condemned</B>--The condemnation, even though not unexpected, might well
 fill him with horror. But perhaps this unhappy man expected, that, while
 he got the bribe, the Lord would miraculously escape, as He had once and
 again done before, out of His enemies' power: and if so, his remorse
 would come upon him with all the greater keenness.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>repented himself</B>--but, as the issue too sadly showed, it was "the
 sorrow of the world, which worketh death" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:10">2Co 7:10</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and
 elders</B>--A remarkable illustration of the power of an awakened
 conscience. A short time before, the promise of this sordid pelf was
 temptation enough to his covetous heart to outweigh the most
 overwhelming obligations of duty and love; now, the possession of it so
 lashes him that he cannot use it, cannot even keep it!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4. Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent 
 blood</B>--What a testimony this to Jesus! Judas had been with Him in 
 all circumstances for three years; his post, as treasurer to Him and 
 the Twelve

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:6">Joh 12:6</A>),

 gave him peculiar opportunity of watching the spirit, disposition, and
 habits of his Master; while his covetous nature and thievish practices 
 would incline him to dark and suspicious, rather than frank and 
 generous, interpretations of all that He said and did.  If, then, he 
 could have fastened on one questionable feature in all that he had so 
 long witnessed, we may be sure that no such speech as this would ever 
 have escaped his lips, nor would he have been so stung with remorse as 
 not to be able to keep the money and survive his crime.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that</B>--"Guilty or
 innocent is nothing to us: We have Him now--begone!" Was ever speech
 more hellish uttered?</P>

 <B>5. And he cast down the pieces of silver</B>--The sarcastic, diabolical
 reply which he had got, in place of the sympathy which perhaps he
 expected, would deepen his remorse into an agony.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>in the temple</B>--the temple proper, commonly called "the sanctuary," or
 "the holy place," into which only the priests might enter. How is this
 to be explained? Perhaps he flung the money in after them. But thus were
 fulfilled the words of the prophet--"I cast them to the potter in the
 house of the Lord" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:13">Zec 11:13</A>).

 <B>6. And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not 
 lawful for to put them into the treasury</B>--"the <I>Corban,</I>" or 
 chest containing the money dedicated to sacred purposes (see on

 <A HREF="#Mt15_5">Mt 15:5</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>because it is the price of blood</B>--How scrupulous now! But those
 punctilious scruples made them unconsciously fulfil the Scripture.</P>

 <B>9. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,
 saying</B>--

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:12,13">Zec 11:12, 13</A>).

 Never was a complicated prophecy, otherwise hopelessly dark, more 
 marvellously fulfilled. Various conjectures have been formed to account 
 for Matthew's ascribing to Jeremiah a prophecy found in the book of 
 Zechariah. But since with this book he was plainly familiar, having 
 quoted one of its most remarkable prophecies of Christ but a few 
 chapters before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:4,5">Mt 21:4, 5</A>),

 the question is one more of critical interest than real importance. 
 Perhaps the true explanation is the following, from L<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>IGHTFOOT</FONT>: "Jeremiah of old had the first place among the 
 prophets, and hereby he comes to be mentioned above all the rest in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:14">Mt 16:14</A>;

 because he stood first in the volume of the prophets (as he proves from
 the learned D<FONT SIZE=-1>AVID</FONT> K<FONT SIZE=-1>IMCHI</FONT>)
 therefore he is first named. When, therefore, Matthew produceth a text
 of Zechariah under the name of Jeremy, he only cites the words of the
 volume of the prophets under his name who stood first in the volume of
 the prophets. Of which sort is that also of our Saviour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:41">Lu 24:41</A>),

 'All things must be fulfilled which are written of Me in the Law, and
 the Prophets, and the Psalms,' or the Book of Hagiographa, in which the
 Psalms were placed first."</P>

 Into this holiest of all none might enter, not even the high priest, 
 save once a year, on the great day of atonement, and then only with the 
 blood of atonement in his hands, which he sprinkled "upon and before 
 the mercy seat seven times"

 during all the long ages that preceded the death of Christ the thick 
 veil remained; the blood of bulls and of goats continued to be shed and 
 sprinkled; and once a year access to God through an atoning sacrifice 
 was vouchsafed--<I>in a picture,</I> or rather, was <I>dramatically 
 represented,</I> in those symbolical actions--nothing more. But 
 <I>now,</I> the one atoning Sacrifice being provided in the precious 
 blood of Christ, access to this holy God could no longer be denied; and 
 so the moment the Victim expired on the altar, that thick veil which 
 for so many ages had been the dread symbol of <I>separation between God 
 and guilty men</I> was, without a hand touching it, mysteriously "rent 
 in twain from top to bottom"--"the Holy Ghost this signifying, that the 
 way into the holiest of all was <FONT SIZE=-1>NOW</FONT> made 
 manifest!" How emphatic the statement, <I>from top to bottom;</I> as if 
 to say, Come boldly now to the Throne of Grace; <I>the veil is clean 
 gone;</I> the mercy seat stands open to the gaze of sinners, and the 
 way to it is sprinkled with the blood of Him--"who through the eternal 
 Spirit hath offered Himself without spot to God!" Before, it was death 
 <I>to go in,</I> now it is <I>death to stay out.</I> See more on this

 <I>An Earthquake--The Rocks Rent--The Graves Opened, that the Saints

 <B>51. and the earth did quake</B>--From what follows it would seem that
 this earthquake was local, having for its object the rending of the
 rocks and the opening of the graves.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and the rocks rent</B>--"were rent"--the physical creation thus sublimely
 proclaiming, at the bidding of its Maker, the <I>concussion</I> which at
 that moment was taking place in the moral world at the most critical
 moment of its history. Extraordinary rents and fissures have been
 observed in the rocks near this spot.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt27_52"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>52. And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which 
 slept arose</B>--These sleeping saints (see on

 <A HREF="JFB52.htm#1Th4_14">1Th 4:14</A>) 

 were Old Testament believers, who--according to the usual punctuation 
 in our version--were quickened into resurrection life at the moment of 
 their Lord's death, but lay in their graves till His resurrection, when 
 they came forth. But it is far more natural, as we think, and consonant 
 with other Scriptures, to understand that only the graves were opened, 
 probably by the earthquake, at our Lord's death, and this only in 
 preparation for the subsequent exit of those who slept in them, when 
 the Spirit of life should enter into them from their risen Lord, and 
 along with Him they should come forth, trophies of His victory over the 
 grave.  Thus, in the opening of the graves at the moment of the 
 Redeemer's expiring, there was a glorious symbolical proclamation that 
 the death which had just taken place had "swallowed up death in 
 victory"; and whereas the saints that slept in them were awakened only 
 by their risen Lord, to accompany Him out of the tomb, it was fitting 
 that "the Prince of Life .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. should be <I>the First</I> 
 that should rise from the dead"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:23,1Co+15:20,23,Col+1:18,Re+1:5">Ac 26:23;

 resurrection they were now alive, had been condemned.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and appeared unto many</B>--that there might be undeniable evidence of
 their own resurrection first, and through it of their Lord's. Thus,
 while it was not deemed fitting that He Himself should appear again in
 Jerusalem, save to the disciples, provision was made that the fact of
 His resurrection should be left in no doubt. It must be observed,
 however, that the resurrection of these sleeping saints was not like
 those of the widow of Nain's son, of Jairus' daughter, of Lazarus, and
 of the man who "revived and stood upon his feet," on his dead body
 touching the bones of Elisha 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:21">2Ki 13:21</A>)

 --which were mere temporary recallings of the departed spirit to the 
 <I>mortal</I> body, to be followed by a final departure of it "till the 
 trumpet shall sound." But this was a resurrection <I>once for all, to 
 life everlasting;</I> and so there is no room to doubt that they went 
 to glory with their Lord, as bright trophies of His victory over 
 death.</P>

 His condemnation expressly turned. The meaning, then, clearly is that He
 must have been what He professed to be; in other words, that He was no
 impostor. There was no medium between those two. See, on

 <I>The Guards Bribed</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:11-15">Mt 28:11-15</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The whole of this important portion is peculiar to Matthew.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>11. Now when they were going</B>--while the women were on their way to
 deliver to His brethren the message of their risen Lord.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>some of the watch came into the city, and showed unto the chief priests
 all the things that were done</B>--Simple, unsophisticated soldiers! How
 could ye imagine that such a tale as ye had to tell would not at once
 commend itself to your scared employers? Had they doubted this for a
 moment, would they have ventured to go near them, knowing it was death
 to a Roman soldier to be proved asleep when on guard? and of course that
 was the only other explanation of the case.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt28_12"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>12. And when they were assembled with the elders</B>--But Joseph at least
 was absent: Gamaliel probably also; and perhaps others.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers</B>--It
 would need a good deal; but the whole case of the Jewish authorities was
 now at stake. With what contempt must these soldiers have regarded the
 Jewish ecclesiastics!</P>

 <A NAME="Mt28_13"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>13. Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away
 while we slept</B>--which, as we have observed, was a capital offense for
 soldiers on guard.</P>

 <A NAME="Mt28_14"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>14. And if this come to the governor's ears</B>--rather, "If this come
 before the governor"; that is, not in the way of mere report, but for
 judicial investigation.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>we will persuade him, and secure you</B>--The "we" and the "you" are
 emphatic here--"we shall [take care to] persuade him and keep you from
 trouble," or "save you harmless." The grammatical form of this clause
 implies that the thing supposed was expected to happen. The meaning
 then is, "If this come before the governor--as it likely will--we shall
 see to it that," &c. The "persuasion" of Pilate meant, doubtless,
 quieting him by a bribe, which we know otherwise he was by no means
 above taking (like Felix afterwards,

 <B>15. So they took the money, and did as they were taught</B>--thus
 consenting to brand themselves with infamy.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day</B>--to
 the date of the publication of this Gospel. The wonder is that so clumsy
 and incredible a story lasted so long. But those who are resolved
 <I>not</I> to come to the light will catch at straws.

 <B>16. Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee</B>--but certainly
 not before the second week after the resurrection, and probably somewhat
 later.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them</B>--It should have been
 rendered "the mountain," meaning some certain mountain which He had
 named to them--probably the night before He suffered, when He said,
 "After I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:32,Mk+14:28">Mt 26:32;
 Mr 14:28</A>). 

 What it was can only be conjectured; but of the two between which
 opinions are divided--the Mount of the Beatitudes or Mount Tabor--the 
 former is much the more probable, from its nearness to the Sea of 
 Tiberias, where last before this the Narrative tells us that He met and 
 dined with seven of them.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:1">Joh 21:1</A>,

 &c.). That the interview here recorded was the same as that referred to 
 in one place only--

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:6">1Co 15:6</A>

 --when "He was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the 
 greater part remained unto that day, though some were fallen asleep," 
 is now the opinion of the ablest students of the evangelical history. 
 Nothing can account for such a number as five hundred assembling at one 
 spot but the expectation of some promised manifestation of their risen 
 Lord: and the promise before His resurrection, twice repeated after it, 
 best explains this immense gathering.</P>

 <B>17. And when they saw him, they worshipped him; but some
 doubted</B>--certainly none of "the Eleven," after what took place at previous
 interviews in Jerusalem. But if the five hundred were now present, we
 may well believe this of some of them.</P>

 of all nations"; for "teaching," in the more usual sense of that word,
 comes in afterwards, and is expressed by a different term.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
 Holy Ghost</B>--It should be, "into the name"; as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:2">1Co 10:2</A>,

 "And were all baptized unto (or rather '<I>into</I>') Moses"; and

 term; or instructing the converted and baptized disciples.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I</B>--The
 "I" here is emphatic. It is enough that <I>I</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>am with you alway</B>--"all the days"; that is, till making converts,
 baptizing, and building them up by Christian instruction, shall be no
 more.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>even unto the end of the world. Amen</B>--This glorious Commission embraces
 two primary departments, the <I>Missionary</I> and the <I>Pastoral,</I> with
 two sublime and comprehensive <I>Encouragements</I> to undertake and go
 through with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 First, The M<FONT SIZE=-1>ISSIONARY</FONT> department

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:18">Mt 28:18</A>):

 "Go, make disciples of all nations." In the corresponding passage of 
 Mark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:15">Mr 16:15</A>)

 it is, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every 
 creature." The only difference is, that in this passage the 
 <I>sphere,</I> in its world-wide compass and its universality of 
 <I>objects,</I> is more fully and definitely expressed; while in the 
 former the great <I>aim</I> and certain <I>result</I> is delightfully 
 expressed in the command to "make disciples of all nations." "Go, 
 conquer the world for Me; carry the glad tidings into all lands and to 
 every ear, and deem not this work at an end till all nations shall have 
 embraced the Gospel and enrolled themselves My disciples." Now, Was all 
 this meant to be done by the Eleven men nearest to Him of the multitude 
 then crowding around the risen Redeemer? Impossible. Was it to be done 
 even in their lifetime? Surely not. In that little band Jesus virtually 
 addressed Himself to all who, in every age, should take up from them 
 the same work. Before the eyes of the Church's risen Head were spread 
 out, in those Eleven men, all His servants of every age; and one and 
 all of them received His commission at that moment. Well, what next? 
 Set the seal of visible discipleship upon the converts, by "baptizing 
 them into the name," that is, into the whole fulness of the grace "of 
 the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost," as belonging to 
 them who believe. (See on

 <A HREF="JFB47.htm#2Co13_14">2Co 13:14</A>). 

 This done, the Missionary department of your work, which in its own 
 nature is temporary, must merge in another, which is permanent. This 
 is</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Second, The P<FONT SIZE=-1>ASTORAL</FONT> department

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:20">Mt 28:20</A>):

 "Teach them"--teach these baptized members of the Church visible--"to 
 observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you," My apostles, 
 during the three years ye have been with Me.

 <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 What must have been the feelings which such a Commission awakened?
 "W<FONT SIZE=-1>E</FONT> who have scarce conquered our own 
 misgivings--we, fishermen of Galilee, with no letters, no means, no 
 influence over the humblest creature, conquer the world for Thee, Lord?  
 Nay, Lord, do not mock us." "I mock you not, nor send you a warfare on 
 your own charges. For"--Here we are brought to</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Third, The E<FONT SIZE=-1>NCOURAGEMENTS</FONT> to undertake and go through with this work.
 These are two; one in the van, the other in the rear of the Commission
 itself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 First Encouragement: "All power in <I>heaven</I>"--the whole power of
 Heaven's love and wisdom and strength, "and all power in <I>earth</I>"--power
 over all persons, all passions, all principles, all movements--to bend
 them to this one high object, the evangelization of the world: All this
 "is <I>given unto Me.</I>" as the risen Lord of all, to be
 <I>by Me placed at your command</I>--"Go ye therefore." But there remains a</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Second Encouragement: "And lo! I am with you all the days"--not only
 to perpetuity, but without one day's interruption, "even to the end of
 the world," The "Amen" is of doubtful genuineness in this place. If,
 however, it belongs to the text, it is the Evangelist's own closing
 word.</P>
