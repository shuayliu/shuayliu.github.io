 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT> 
 name <I>Zechariah</I> means <I>one whom Jehovah remembers:</I> a common
 name, four others of the same name occurring in the Old Testament. Like 
 Jeremiah and Ezekiel, he was a priest as well as a prophet, which 
 adapts him for the sacerdotal character of some of his prophecies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:13">Zec 6:13</A>).

 He is called "the son of Berechiah the son of Iddo"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:1">Zec 1:1</A>);
 
 but simply "the son of Iddo" in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:1,6:14">Ezr 5:1; 6:14</A>.

 Probably his father died when he was young; and hence, as sometimes
 occurs in Jewish genealogies, he is called "the son of Iddo," his
 grandfather. Iddo was one of the priests who returned to Zerubbabel
 and Joshua from Babylon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+12:4">Ne 12:4</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Zechariah entered early on his prophetic functions 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:4">Zec 2:4</A>);

 only two months later than Haggai, in the second year of Darius' reign, 
 520 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT> The design of both prophets was to 
 encourage the people and their religious and civil leaders, Joshua and 
 Zerubbabel, in their work of rebuilding the temple, after the 
 interruption caused by the Samaritans (see

 <A HREF="JFB37.htm#Introduction"><I>Introduction</I></A> 

 to Haggai). Zechariah does so especially by unfolding in detail the 
 glorious future in connection with the present depressed appearance of 
 the theocracy, and its visible symbol, the temple. He must have been 
 very young in leaving Babylonia, where he was born. The Zechariah, son 
 of Barachias, mentioned by our Lord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:35">Mt 23:35</A>)

 as slain between the porch and the altar, must have been the one called 
 the son of <I>Jehoiada</I> in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:21">2Ch 24:21</A>,

 who so perished: the same person often had two names; and our Lord, in 
 referring to the <I>Hebrew</I> Bible, of which Second Chronicles is the 
 last book, would naturally mention the last martyr in the <I>Hebrew</I> 
 order of the canon, as He had instanced Abel as the first. Owing to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:9,Zec+11:12,13">
 Mt 27:9
 quoting Zec 11:12, 13</A>

 as the words of <I>Jeremiah,</I> M<FONT SIZE=-1>EDE</FONT> doubts the 
 authenticity of the ninth through the fourteenth chapters, and ascribes 
 them to <I>Jeremiah:</I> he thinks that these chapters were not found 
 till after the return from the captivity, and being approved by 
 Zechariah, were added to his prophecies, as Agur's Proverbs were added 
 to those of Solomon. All the oldest authorities, except two manuscripts 
 of the old Italian or Pre-Vulgate version, read <I>Jeremiah</I> in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:9">Mt 27:9</A>.

 The quotation there is not to the letter copied from Zechariah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:1,2,32:6-12">Jer 18:1, 2; 32:6-12</A>,

 may also have been in the mind of Matthew, and perhaps in the mind of
 Zechariah, whence the former mentions <I>Jeremiah.</I> H<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ENGSTENBERG</FONT> similarly thinks that Matthew names 
 <I>Jeremiah,</I> rather than <I>Zechariah,</I> to turn attention to the 
 fact that Zechariah's prophecy is but a reiteration of the fearful 
 oracle in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:1-19:15">Jer 18:1-19:15</A>,

 to be fulfilled in the destruction of the Jewish nation. Jeremiah had 
 already, by the image of a potter's vessel, portrayed their ruin in 
 Nebuchadnezzar's invasion; and as Zechariah virtually repeats this 
 threat, to be inflicted again under Messiah for the nation's rejection 
 of Him, Matthew, virtually, by mentioning <I>Jeremiah,</I> implies that 
 the "field of blood"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:8,9">Mt 27:8, 9</A>],

 now bought by "the reward of iniquity"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:18">Ac 1:18</A>]

 in the valley of Hinnom, was long ago a scene of prophetic doom in 
 which awful disaster had been symbolically predicted: that the present 
 purchase of that field with the traitor's price renewed the prophecy 
 and revived the curse--a curse pronounced of old by Jeremiah, and once 
 fulfilled in the Babylonian siege--a curse reiterated by Zechariah, and 
 again to be verified in the Roman desolation. L<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>IGHTFOOT</FONT> (referring to B. B<FONT SIZE=-1>ATHRA</FONT> 
 and K<FONT SIZE=-1>IMCHI</FONT>) less probably thinks the third 
 division of Scripture, the prophets, began with Jeremiah, and that the 
 whole body of prophets is thus quoted by the name "Jeremiah." The 
 mention of "Ephraim" and "Israel" in these chapters as distinct from 
 Judah, does not prove that the prophecy was written while the ten 
 tribes existed as a separate kingdom. It rather implies that hereafter 
 not only Judah, but the ten tribes also, shall be restored, the earnest 
 of which was given in the numbers out of the ten tribes who returned 
 with their brethren the Jews from captivity under Cyrus. There is 
 nothing in these characters to imply that a king reigned in Judah at 
 that time. The editor of the <I>Hebrew</I> canon joined these chapters 
 to Zechariah, not to Jeremiah; the <I>Septuagint,</I> three hundred 
 years <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, confirms this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophecy consists of four parts: (1) Introductory,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:1-6">Zec 1:1-6</A>.
 
 (2) Symbolical,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:7">Zec 1:7</A>,

 to the end of the sixth chapter, containing nine visions; all these 
 were vouchsafed in one night, and are of a symbolical character. (3) 
 Didactic, the seventh and eighth chapters containing an answer to a 
 query of the Beth-elites concerning a certain feast. And (4) Prophetic, 
 the ninth chapter to the end. These six last chapters predict 
 Alexander's expedition along the west coast of Palestine to Egypt; 
 God's protection of the Jews, both at that time and under the 
 Maccabees; the advent, sufferings, and reign of Messiah; the 
 destruction of Jerusalem by Rome, and dissolution of the Jews' polity; 
 their conversion and restoration; the overthrow of the wicked 
 confederacy which assailed them in Canaan; and the Gentiles' joining in 
 their holy worship 
 [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ENDERSON</FONT>]. 
 The difference in style between the former and the latter chapters is
 due to the difference of subject; the first six chapters being of a 
 symbolical and peculiar character, while the poetical style of the 
 concluding chapters is adapted admirably to the subjects treated. The 
 titles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:1,12:1">Zec 9:1; 12:1</A>)

 accord with the prophetic matter which follows; nor is it necessary for
 unity of authorship that the introductory formulas occurring in the 
 first eight chapters should occur in the last six. The non-reference in 
 the last six chapters to the completion of the temple and the Jews' 
 restoration after the captivity is just what we should expect, if, as 
 seems likely, these chapters were written long after the completion of 
 the temple and the restoration of the Jews' polity after the captivity,
 in circumstances different from those which engaged the prophet when he 
 wrote the earlier chapters.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The style varies with the subject: at one time conversational, at
 another poetical. His symbols are enigmatical and are therefore
 accompanied with explanations. His prose is like that of Ezekiel--diffuse,
 uniform, and repetitious. The rhythm is somewhat unequal, and
 the parallelisms are not altogether symmetrical. Still, there is found
 often much of the elevation met with in the earlier prophets, and a
 general congruity between the style and the subjects. Graphic vividness
 is his peculiar merit. Chald&aelig;isms occur occasionally. Another special
 characteristic of Zechariah is his introduction of spiritual beings
 into his prophetic scenes.</P>

 <B>18. four horns</B>--To a pastoral people like the Jews the

 The number <I>four</I> in Zechariah's time referred to the four 
 cardinal points of the horizon. Wherever God's people turned, there 
 were foes to encounter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:7">Ne 4:7</A>);

 the Assyrian, Chaldean, and Samaritan on the north; Egypt and Arabia on 
 the south; Philistia on the west; Ammon and Moab on the east. But the 
 Spirit in the prophet looked farther; namely, to the <I>four</I> world 
 powers, the only ones which were, or are, to rise till the kingdom of 
 Messiah, the fifth, overthrows and absorbs all others in its universal 
 dominion. Babylon and Medo-Persia alone had as yet risen, but soon 
 Gr&aelig;co-Macedonia was to succeed (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:13">Zec 9:13</A>

 The fact that the repairing of the evils caused to Judah and Israel by
 <I>all four</I> kingdoms is spoken of here, proves that the exhaustive 
 fulfilment is yet future, and only the earnest of it given in the 
 overthrow of the two world powers which up to Zechariah's time had

 That only two of the four had as yet risen, is an argument having no
 weight with us, as we believe God's Spirit in the prophets regards the
 future as present; we therefore are not to be led by Rationalists who
 on such grounds deny the reference here and in

 are its sins which had hitherto brought down God's judgments. The 
 "change of raiment" implies its restoration to God's favor. Satan 
 suggested to the Jews that so consciously polluted a priesthood and 
 people could offer no acceptable sacrifice to God, and therefore they 
 might as well desist from the building of the temple. Zechariah 
 encourages them by showing that their demerit does not disqualify them 
 for the work, as they are accepted in the righteousness of another, 
 their great High Priest, the Branch

 However,

 plainly speaks of the literal body of Moses, the resurrection of which 
 at the transfiguration Satan seems to have opposed on the ground of 
 Moses' error at Meribah; the same divine rebuke, "the Lord rebuke

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:6">Zec 4:6</A>

 is, that man's power by itself can neither retard nor advance God's

 <B>bring forth the head-stone</B>--Primarily, bring it forth from the place
 where it was chiselled and give it to the workmen to put on the top of
 the building. It was customary for chief magistrates to lay the
 foundation, and also the crowning top-stone (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:10">Ezr 3:10</A>).

 Antitypically, the reference is to the time when the full number of the
 spiritual Church shall be completed, and also when "all Israel shall be
 saved" (compare

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:3">Isa 26:3</A>,

 <I>Margin</I>). Thus the Jews are urged to pray perseveringly and 
 earnestly that the same grace which completed it may always preserve 
 it. "Shoutings" of acclamation accompanied the foundation of the 
 literal temple

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:11,13">Ezr 3:11, 13</A>).

 So shoutings of "Hosanna" greeted the Saviour in entering Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:9">Mt 21:9</A>),

 when about to complete the purchase of salvation by His death: His Body

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:20,21">Joh 2:20, 21</A>).

 So when the full number of the saints and of Israel is complete, and 
 God shall say, "It is done," then again shall "a great voice of much 
 people in heaven" attribute all to the "grace" of God, saying, 
 "Alleluia! Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, unto the Lord

 W<FONT SIZE=-1>ORDSWORTH</FONT>
 explains them to mean the Law and the Gospel: the two Testaments that
 <I>witness</I> in the Church for the truth of God. But this is at
 variance with the sense here, which requires Joshua and Zerubbabel to
 be primarily meant. So Moses (the prophet and lawgiver) and Aaron (the
 high priest) ministered to the Lord among the covenant-people at the
 exodus; Ezekiel (the priest) and Daniel (a ruler) in the Babylonian
 captivity; so it shall be in restored Israel. Some think Elijah will
 appear again (compare the transfiguration,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:3,11,Mal+4:4,5,Joh+1:21">Mt 17:3, 11,

 Joh 1:21</A>)

 with Moses.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:6">Re 11:6</A>,

 which mentions the very miracles performed by Elijah and Moses
 (shutting heaven so as not to rain, and turning water into blood), 
 favors this (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:19,1Ki+17:1,Lu+4:25,Jam+5:16,17">Ex 7:19;
 1Ki 17:1; 
 Lu 4:25; 
 Jas 5:16, 17</A>).

 The period is the same, "three years and six months"; the scene also is
 in Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:8">Re 11:8</A>),

 "where our Lord was crucified." It is supposed that for the first three 
 and a half years of the hebdomad

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:20-27">Da 9:20-27</A>),

 God will be worshipped in the temple; in the latter three and a half 
 years, Antichrist will break the covenant

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:27">Da 9:27</A>),
 
 and set himself up in the temple to be worshipped as God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:4">2Th 2:4</A>).
 
 The witnesses prophesy the former three and a half years, while
 corruptions prevail and faith is rare 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:8">Lu 18:8</A>);

 then they are slain and remain dead three and a half years. Probably, 
 besides individual witnesses and literal years, there is a fulfilment 
 in long periods and general witnesses, such as the Church and the Word, 
 the civil and religious powers so far as they have witnessed for God. 
 So "the beast" in Revelation answers to the civil power of the 
 apostasy; "the false prophet" to the spiritual power. Man needs the 
 <I>priest</I> to atone for guilt, and the <I>prophet-king</I> to teach 
 holiness with kingly authority. These two typically united in 
 Melchisedek were divided between two till they meet in Messiah, the 
 Antitype.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:11-13">Zec 6:11-13</A>
 
 accords with this. The Holy Spirit in this His twofold power of
 applying to man the grace of the <I>atonement,</I> and that of
 <I>sanctification,</I> must in one point of view be meant by the two olive
 trees which supply the bowl at the top of the candlestick (that is,
 Messiah at the head of the Church); for it is He who filled Jesus with
 all the fulness of His unction 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:34">Joh 3:34</A>).

 But this does not exclude the primary application to <I>Joshua and

 and whence He sends forth His ministers of judgment on the heathen 
 [M<FONT SIZE=-1>AURER</FONT>]. The temple on Mount Moriah is the symbol 
 of the theocracy; hence the nearest spot accessible to chariots in the

 D<FONT SIZE=-1>IEU</FONT>]. The other view is better, namely, "<I>Messiah's</I> throne." As Priest He expiates sin; as King, extirpates it. "<I>Counsel</I>

 because Christ is to be a king on His throne and a priest, and because

 relying on the hope of the Messiah afterwards to glorify it. The
 completion of the temple shall "come to pass," if ye diligently on your

 aside God's gracious purpose as to Messiah's coming. But there is,
 secondarily, meant, that Messiah's glory as priest-king of Israel shall
 not be manifested to the Jews till they turn to Him with obedient
 penitence. They meanwhile are cast away "branches" until they be grafted
 in again on the Branch and their own olive tree

 hypocrisy appeared because they showed more concern about a ceremony of

 They falsely made the fast an end intrinsically meritorious in itself, 
 not a means towards God's glory in their sanctification. The true 
 principle of piety, <I>reference to God,</I> was wanting: hence the 
 emphatic repetition of "unto Me." Before settling questions as to the 
 outward forms of piety (however proper, as in this case), the great 
 question was as to piety itself; that being once settled, all their 
 outward observances become sanctified, being "unto the Lord"

 The sense is, It is not fasts that Jehovah requires of you, but that ye

 heathen of the unsatisfactoriness of their systems of religion and

 Jew, so that proselytes embraced the worship of Jehovah from various

 <B>Hadrach</B>--a part of Syria, near Damascus. As the name is not mentioned
 in ancient histories, it probably was the less-used name of a region
 having two names ("Hadrach" and "Bikathaven,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+1:5">Am 1:5</A>,

 <I>Margin</I>); hence it passed into oblivion. An ancient 
 R<FONT SIZE=-1>ABBI</FONT> J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSE</FONT>
 is, however, stated to have expressly mentioned it. An Arab, Jos.
 Abassi, in 1768 also declared to
 M<FONT SIZE=-1>ICHAELIS</FONT> 
 that there was then a town of that name, and that it was capital of the
 region Hadrach. The name means "enclosed" in Syrian, that is, the west
 interior part of Syria, <I>enclosed</I> by hills, the C&oelig;lo-Syria of
 S<FONT SIZE=-1>TRABO</FONT> 
 [M<FONT SIZE=-1>AURER</FONT>].
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> 
 considers Hadrach to be the metropolis of C&oelig;lo-Syria, as Damascus
 was of the region about that city.
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGSTENBERG</FONT>
 regards Hadrach as a symbolical name of Persia, which Zechariah avoids
 designating by its proper name so as not to offend the government under
 which he lived. But the context seems to refer to the Syrian region.
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>ESENIUS</FONT> 
 thinks that the name is that of a Syrian king, which might more easily
 pass into oblivion than that of a region. Compare the similar "land of

 upon all Israel," namely, to punish the ungodly and to protect His 
 people. He, who has chastised His people, will not fail to punish men 
 for their sins severely. The "all," I think, implies that whereas men's 
 attention generally (whence "man" is the expression) was directed to 
 Jehovah's judgments, <I>all</I> Israel especially looks to Him.</P>

 we are not to relax our prayers. The former rain of conversion may have

 sanctification. Though at Pentecost there was a former rain on the 
 Jewish Church, a latter rain is still to be looked for, when the full 
 harvest of the nation's conversion shall be gathered in to God. The 
 spirit of prayer in the Church is an index at once of her piety, and of 
 the spiritual blessings she may expect from God. When the Church is

 Forty years before the destruction of the temple, the tract called 
 "Massecheth Joma" states, its doors of their own accord opened, and 
 Rabbi Johanan in alarm said, I know that thy desolation is impending 
 according to Zechariah's prophecy. C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>

 boundary: "Lebanon," the route by which the Romans, according to J<FONT

 SIZE=-1>OORE</FONT>, from H<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGSTENBERG</FONT>, refers the 
 passage to the civil war which caused the calling in of the Romans, 
 who, like a storm sweeping through the land from Lebanon, deprived 
 Judea of its independence. Thus the passage forms a fit introduction to 
 the prediction as to Messiah born when Judea became a Roman province.

 me as a servant," namely, <I>in husbandry</I>
 [M<FONT SIZE=-1>AURER</FONT>]. 
 However, husbandry and keeping cattle might be regarded as jointly the
 occupation of the person questioned: then

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:14">Am 7:14</A>,

 so, if you have never pretended to be a prophet, whence come those
 wounds?" The <I>Hebrew</I> is literally, "<I>between</I> thine hands." The
 hands were naturally held up to ward off the blows, and so were "thrust

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:3">Zec 13:3</A>)

 "between" the bones of the hand. <I>Stoning</I> was the usual 
 punishment; "thrusting through" was also a fit retribution on one who 
 tried to "thrust Israel away" from the Lord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:10">De 13:10</A>);
 
 and perfects the type of Messiah, condemned as a false prophet, and
 pierced with "wounds <I>between</I> His hands." Thus the transition to the
 direct prophecy of Him 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:7">Zec 13:7</A>)

 is natural, which it would not be if He were not indirectly and in type

 wounded him for it in zeal for God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:3">Zec 13:3</A>).

 The Holy Spirit in Zechariah alludes indirectly to Messiah, the
 Antitype, wounded by those whom He came to befriend, who ought to have 
 been His "friends," who were His kinsmen (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:3">Zec 13:3</A>,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:31,32">Mt 26:31, 32</A>).
 
 Thus it is a resumption of the prophecy of His betrayal

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:4,10,13,14">Zec 11:4, 10, 13, 14</A>),

 and the subsequent punishment of the Jews. It explains the mystery why 
 He, who came to be a blessing, was cut off while bestowing the 
 blessing. God regards sin in such a fearful light that He spared not 
 His own co-equal Son in the one Godhead, when that Son bore the 
 sinner's guilt.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Awake</B>--Compare a similar address to the sword of justice personified

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:6,7">Jer 46:6, 7</A>).
 
 For "smite" (imperative),

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:31">Mt 26:31</A>

 has "I will smite." The act of the sword, it is thus implied, is 
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>OD'S</FONT> 
 act. So the prophecy in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:9">Isa 6:9</A>,

 "Hear ye," is imperative; the fulfilment as declared by Jesus is future

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:14">Mt 13:14</A>),
 
 "ye shall hear."

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:13,Ro+13:4">Ps 17:13;
 Ro 13:4</A>). 

 Not merely a show, or expression, of justice (as Socinians think) is
 distinctly implied here, but an actual execution of it on Messiah the 
 shepherd, the substitute for the sheep, by God as judge. Yet God in 
 this shows His love as gloriously as His justice. For God calls Messiah 
 "<I>My</I> shepherd," that is, provided

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:8">Re 13:8</A>)

 apprehension was the partial fulfilment

 a pledge of the dispersion of the Jewish nation (once the Lord's

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+100:3">Ps 100:3</A>)

 are still the Lord's "sheep," awaiting their being "gathered" by Him

 "the little ones," namely, the humble followers of Christ from the

 saved again by a special interposition from the destruction of 
 Jerusalem, having retired to Pella when Cestius Gallus so unaccountably 
 withdrew from Jerusalem. Ever since there has been a Jewish "remnant" 
 of "the little ones .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. according to the election of 
 grace." The hand of Jehovah was laid in wrath on the Shepherd that His

 <B>8, 9.</B> Two-thirds of the Jewish nation were to perish in the Roman
 wars, and a third to survive. Probably from the context 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:2-9">Zec 14:2-9</A>),
 
 which has never yet been fulfilled, the destruction of the two-thirds
 (literally, "the proportion of two," or "portion of two") and the saving
 of the remnant, the one-third, are still future, and to be fulfilled
 under Antichrist.</P>

 It hence appears that the Jews' conversion is not to precede, but to
 follow, their external deliverance by the special interposition of 
 Jehovah; which latter shall be the main cause of their conversion, 
 combined with a preparatory inward shedding abroad in their hearts of 
 the Holy Spirit

 This implies that all things, even the most common, shall be sacred to 
 Jehovah, and not merely the things which under the law had peculiar 
 sanctity attached to them. The "bells" were metal plates hanging from 
 the necks of horses and camels as ornaments, which <I>tinkled</I> (as 
 the <I>Hebrew</I> root means) by striking against each other. Bells 
 attached to horses are found represented on the walls of Sennacherib's 
 palace at Koyunjik.

 The priesthood of Christ will be explained more fully both by the 
 Mosaic types and by the New Testament in that temple of which Ezekiel 
 speaks. Then the Song of Solomon, now obscure, will be understood, for 
 the marriage feast of the Lamb will be celebrated in heaven

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:1-21">Re 19:1-21</A>),

 and on earth it will be a Solomonic period, peaceful, glorious, and 
 nuptial. There will be no king but a prince; the sabbatic period of the 
 judges will return, but not with the Old Testament, but New Testament 
 glory
