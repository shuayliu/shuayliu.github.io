 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HIS</FONT> is called by E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> 
 ([<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 2.23], about the year 330 <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT>) the first of the Catholic Epistles, that is, the
 Epistles intended for general circulation, as distinguished from Paul's 
 Epistles, which were addressed to particular churches or individuals.
 In the oldest manuscripts of the New Testament extant, they stand 
 <I>before</I> the Epistles of Paul. Of them, two only are mentioned by 
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> as <I>universally acknowledged</I> 
 (<I>Homologoumena</I>), namely, the First Epistle of Peter, and the 
 First Epistle of John. <I>All,</I> however, are found in every existing 
 manuscript of the whole New Testament.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is not to be wondered at that Epistles not addressed to
 particular churches (and particularly one like that of James, addressed
 to the Israelite believers scattered abroad) should be for a time less
 known. The first mention of James' Epistle by name occurs early in the
 third century, in O<FONT SIZE=-1>RIGEN</FONT>
 [<I>Commentary</I> on John 1:19, 4.306], who was
 born about 185, and died <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 254.

 quotes it. So also H<FONT SIZE=-1>ERMAS</FONT> [<I>Shepherd</I>] quotes

 I<FONT SIZE=-1>REN&AElig;US</FONT>

 C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT> A<FONT SIZE=-1>LEXANDRIA</FONT> 
 commented on it, according to C<FONT SIZE=-1>ASSIODORUS</FONT>.  
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>PHREM THE</FONT> S<FONT SIZE=-1>YRIAN</FONT> 
 [<I>Against the Greeks,</I> 3.51] quotes

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:1">Jas 5:1</A>.

 An especially strong proof of its authenticity is afforded by its
 forming part of the old <I>Syriac</I> version, which contains no other
 of <I>the disputed books</I> (<I>Antilegomena,</I> 
 [E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>, <I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 3.25]),
 except the Epistle to the Hebrews. None of the Latin fathers before the
 fourth century quote it; but soon after the Council of Nicea it was
 admitted as canonical both by the East and West churches, and specified
 as such in the Councils of Hippo and Carthage (397 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT>).  This is just what we might expect; a
 writing known only partially at first, when subsequently it obtained a 
 wider circulation, and the proofs were better known of its having been 
 recognized in apostolic churches, having in them men endowed with the 
 discernment of spirits, which qualified them for discriminating between 
 inspired and uninspired writings, was universally accepted. Though 
 <I>doubted</I> for a time, at last the disputed books (James, Second 
 Peter, Second and Third John, Jude, and Revelation) were universally 
 and undoubtingly accepted, so that no argument for the Old Testament 
 Apocrypha can be drawn from their case: as to <I>it</I> the Jewish 
 Church had <I>no doubt;</I> it was <I>known not</I> to be inspired.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 L<FONT SIZE=-1>UTHER'S</FONT> objection to it ("an Epistle of straw,
 and destitute of an evangelic character") was due to his mistaken idea
 that it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:14-26">Jas 2:14-26</A>)

 opposes the doctrine of justification by faith, and not by works, 
 taught by Paul. But the two apostles, while looking at justification 
 from distinct standpoints, perfectly harmonize and mutually complement 
 the definitions of one another. Faith precedes love and the works of 
 love; but without them it is dead. Paul regards faith in the 
 justification of the sinner <I>before God;</I> James, in the 
 justification of the believer <I>evidently before men.</I> The error 
 which James meets was the Jewish notion that their possession and 
 knowledge of the law of God would justify them, even though they 
 disobeyed it (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:22,Ro+2:17-25">Jas 1:22
 with Ro 2:17-25</A>).

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:3,4:1,12">Jas 1:3; 4:1, 12</A>

 seem plainly to allude to

 Also the tenor of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:14-26">Jas 2:14-26</A>

 on "justification," seems to allude to Paul's teaching, so as to
 correct false Jewish notions of a different kind from those which he
 combatted, though not unnoticed by him also

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:17">Ro 2:17</A>,

 &c.).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Paul 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:9">Ga 2:9</A>)

 arranges the names "James, Cephas, John," in the order in which their 
 Epistles stand. James who wrote this Epistle (according to most ancient 
 writers) is called

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:19">Ga 1:19</A>),

 "the Lord's brother." He was son of Alpheus or Cleopas

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:13-18">Lu 24:13-18</A>)

 and Mary, sister of the Virgin Mary. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:40,Joh+19:25">Mr 15:40
 with Joh 19:25</A>,

 which seems to identify the mother of James the Less with the wife of
 Cleopas, not with the Virgin Mary, Cleopas' wife's sister. Cleopas is 
 the <I>Hebrew,</I> Alpheus the <I>Greek</I> mode of writing the same 
 name. Many, however, as H<FONT SIZE=-1>EGESIPPUS</FONT> [E<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>, <I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 23.1], 
 distinguish <I>the Lord's brother</I> from the son of Alpheus. But the 
 Gospel according to the Hebrews, quoted by J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT>, 
 represents James, the Lord's brother, as present at the institution of 
 the Eucharist, and therefore identical with the apostle James. So the 
 Apocryphal Gospel of James. In Acts, James who is put foremost in 
 Jerusalem after the death of James, the son of Zebedee, is not 
 distinguished from James, the son of Alpheus. He is not mentioned as 
 one of the Lord's brethren in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:14">Ac 1:14</A>;
 
 but as one of the "apostles"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:19">Ga 1:19</A>).

 He is called "the Less" (literally, "the little,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:40">Mr 15:40</A>),

 to distinguish him from James, the son of Zebedee. 
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> considers James, the brother of the Lord,
 the author of the Epistle, to have been the eldest of the sons of 
 Joseph and Mary, after Jesus (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:55">Mt 13:55</A>),

 and that James the son of Alpheus is distinguished from him by <I>the 
 latter</I> being called "the Less," (that is, junior). His arguments 
 against the Lord's brother, the bishop of Jerusalem, being the apostle, 
 are: (1) The Lord's brethren did not believe on Jesus at a time when 
 the apostles had been already called

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:3,5">Joh 7:3, 5</A>),

 therefore none of the Lord's brethren could be among the apostles (but 
 it does not follow from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:3">Joh 7:3</A>

 that <I>no one</I> of them believed).  (2) The apostles' commission was 
 to preach the Gospel <I>everywhere,</I> not to be bishops in a 
 particular locality (but it is unlikely that one not an apostle should 
 be bishop of Jerusalem, to whom even apostles yield deference,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:13,19,Ga+1:19,2:9,12">Ac 15:13, 19;
 Ga 1:19; 2:9, 12</A>.

 The Saviour's last command to the apostles collectively to <I>preach
 the Gospel everywhere,</I> is not inconsistent with each having a 
 particular sphere of labor in which he should be a missionary bishop, 
 as Peter is said to have been at Antioch).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He was surnamed "the Just." It needed peculiar wisdom so to preach
 the Gospel as not to disparage the law. As bishop of Jerusalem writing
 to the twelve tribes, he sets forth the Gospel in its aspect of
 relation to the law, which the Jews so reverenced. As Paul's Epistles
 are a commentary on the doctrines flowing from the death and
 resurrection of Christ, so James's Epistle has a close connection with
 His teaching during His life on earth, especially His Sermon on the
 Mount. In both, the law is represented as fulfilled in love: the very
 language is palpably similar (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:2,Mt+5:12">Jas 1:2
 with Mt 5:12</A>;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:4,Mt+5:48">Jas 1:4
 with Mt 5:48</A>;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:5,5:15,Mt+7:7-11">Jas 1:5; 5:15
 with Mt 7:7-11</A>;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:13,Mt+5:7,6:14,15">Jas 2:13
 with Mt 5:7; 6:14, 15</A>;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:10,Mt+5:19">Jas 2:10
 with Mt 5:19</A>;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:4,Mt+6:24">Jas 4:4
 with Mt 6:24</A>;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:11,Mt+7:1,2">Jas 4:11

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:2,Mt+6:19">Jas 5:2
 with Mt 6:19</A>).

 The whole spirit of this Epistle breathes the same
 Gospel-<I>righteousness</I> which the Sermon on the Mount inculcates as
 the highest realization of the law. James's own character as "the
 Just," or <I>legally righteous,</I> disposed him to this coincidence
 (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:20,2:10,3:18,Mt+5:20">Jas 1:20; 2:10; 3:18
 with Mt 5:20</A>).

 It also fitted him for presiding over a Church still zealous for the
 law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:18-24,Ga+2:12">Ac 21:18-24;
 Ga 2:12</A>).

 If any could win the Jews to the Gospel, he was most likely who
 presented a pattern of Old Testament righteousness, combined with 
 evangelical faith (compare also

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:8,Mt+5:44,48">Jas 2:8
 with Mt 5:44, 48</A>).

 Practice, not profession, is the test of obedience (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:17,4:17,Mt+7:2-23">Jas 2:17; 4:17
 with Mt 7:2-23</A>).

 Sins of the tongue, however lightly regarded by the world, are an
 offense against the law of love (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:26,3:2-18,Mt+5:22">Jas 1:26; 3:2-18
 with Mt 5:22</A>;

 also any swearing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:12">Jas 5:12</A>;

 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:33-37">Mt 5:33-37</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The absence of the apostolic benediction in this Epistle is probably
 due to its being addressed, not merely to the believing, but also
 indirectly to unbelieving, Israelites. To the former he commends
 humility, patience, and prayer; to the latter he addresses awful
 warnings 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:7-11,Jam+4:9,5:1-6">Jas 5:7-11; 4:9; 5:1-6</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 James was martyred at the Passover. This Epistle was probably
 written just before it. The destruction of Jerusalem foretold in it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:1">Jas 5:1</A>,

 &c.), ensued a year after his martyrdom, <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 69.  
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>EGESIPPUS</FONT> (quoted in 
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 2.23])
 narrates that he was set on a pinnacle of the temple by the scribes and 
 Pharisees, who begged him to restrain the people who were in large 
 numbers embracing Christianity. "Tell us," said they in the presence of 
 the people gathered at the feast, "which is the door of Jesus?" James 
 replied with a loud voice, "Why ask ye me concerning Jesus the Son of 
 man? He sitteth at the right hand of power, and will come again on the 
 clouds of heaven." Many thereupon cried, Hosanna to the Son of David.  
 But James was cast down headlong by the Pharisees; and praying, 
 "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do," he was stoned 
 and beaten to death with a fuller's club. The Jews, we know from Acts, 
 were exasperated at Paul's rescue from their hands, and therefore 
 determined to wreak their vengeance on James. The publication of his 
 Epistle to the dispersed Israelites, to whom it was probably carried by 
 those who came up to the periodical feasts, made him obnoxious to them, 
 especially to the higher classes, because it foretold the woes soon 
 about to fall on them and their country. Their taunting question, 
 "Which is the door of Jesus?" (that is, by what door will He come when 
 He returns?), alludes to his prophecy, "the coming of the Lord draweth 
 nigh .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. behold the Judge standeth before the <I>door</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:8,9">Jas 5:8, 9</A>).

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:7">Heb 13:7</A>

 probably refers to the martyrdom of James, who had been so long bishop 
 over the Jewish Christians at Jerusalem, "Remember them which have 
 (rather, 'had') the rule (spiritually) over you, who have spoken unto 
 you the word of God; whose faith follow, considering the end of their 
 conversation."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 His inspiration as an apostle is expressly referred to in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:19,28">Ac 15:19, 28</A>,

 "<I>My sentence is,</I>" &c.: "It seemed good to <I>the Holy Ghost, and 
 to us,</I>" &c. His episcopal authority is implied in the deference 
 paid to him by Peter and Paul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:17,21:18,Ga+1:19,2:9">Ac 12:17; 21:18;
 Ga 1:19; 2:9</A>). 

 The Lord had appeared specially to him after the resurrection

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:7">1Co 15:7</A>).

 Peter in his First Epistle (universally from the first received as 
 canonical) tacitly confirms the inspiration of James's Epistle, by 
 incorporating with his own inspired writings no less than ten passages 
 from James. The "apostle of the circumcision," Peter, and the first 
 bishop of Jerusalem, would naturally have much in common. Compare

 Its being written in the purest <I>Greek</I> shows it was intended not
 only for the Jews at Jerusalem, but also for the Hellenistic, that is,
 Greek-speaking, Jews.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The style is close, curt, and sententious, gnome following after
 gnome. A Hebraic character pervades the Epistle, as appears in the
 occasional poetic parallelisms 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:1-12">Jas 3:1-12</A>).

 Compare "assembly": <I>Greek,</I> "synagogue,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:2">Jas 2:2</A>,

 <I>Margin.</I> The images are analogical arguments, combining at once 
 logic and poetry. Eloquence and persuasiveness are prominent 
 characteristics.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The similarity to Matthew, the most Hebrew of the Gospels, is just
 what we might expect from the bishop of Jerusalem writing to
 Israelites. In it the higher spirit of Christianity is seen putting the
 Jewish law in its proper place. The law is enforced in its everlasting
 spirit, not in the letter for which the Jews were so zealous. The
 doctrines of grace, the distinguishing features of Paul's teaching to
 the Hellenists and Gentiles, are less prominent as being already taught
 by that apostle. James complements Paul's teaching, and shows to the
 Jewish Christians who still kept the legal ordinances down to the fall
 of Jerusalem, the spiritual principle of the law, namely, love
 manifested in obedience. To sketch "the perfect man" <I>continuing</I> in
 the Gospel <I>law of liberty,</I> is his theme.</P>

 pray, "Let me not have need of the gifts of men, whose gifts are few,

 he asked, though God foresaw his future abuse of His goodness would 
 deserve very differently. James has before his eye the Sermon on the 
 Mount (see my

 God hears every true prayer and grants either the thing asked, or else

 James illustrates "the perfect law of liberty" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:25">Jas 1:25</A>)

 in one particular instance of a sin against it, concluding with a

 <B><I>the Lord</I> of glory</B>--So

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:8">1Co 2:8</A>.

 As all believers, alike rich and poor, derive all their glory from
 their union with Him, "the Lord of glory," not from external advantages
 of worldly fortune, the sin in question is peculiarly inconsistent with
 His "faith." B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>, making no ellipsis of "the
 Lord," explains "glory" as in apposition with Christ who is 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>THE GLORY</FONT>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:32">Lu 2:32</A>);

 the true Shekinah glory of the temple

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:4">Ro 9:4</A>).

 <I>English Version</I> is simpler. The glory of Christ resting on the 
 poor believer should make him be regarded as highly by "brethren" as 
 his richer brother; nay, more so, if the poor believer has more of 
 Christ's spirit than the rich brother.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>with respect of persons</B>--literally, "<I>in respectings</I> of 
 persons"; "in" the practice of partial preferences of persons in 
 various ways and on various occasions.</P>

 <B>2, 3.</B> "If there chance to have come" 
 [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>assembly</B>--literally, "synagogue"; this, the latest honorable 
 use, and the only <I>Christian</I> use of the term in the New 
 Testament, occurs in James's Epistle, the apostle who maintained to the 
 latest possible moment the bonds between the Jewish synagogue and the 
 Christian Church.  Soon the continued resistance of the truth by the 
 Jews led Christians to leave the term to them exclusively

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:9">Re 3:9</A>).

 The "synagogue" implies a mere <I>assembly</I> or congregation not 
 necessarily united by any common tie. "Church," a people bound together 
 by mutual ties and laws, though often it may happen that the members 
 are not assembled [T<FONT SIZE=-1>RENCH</FONT> and V<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ITRINGA</FONT>]. Partly from James' Hebrew tendencies, partly 
 from the Jewish Christian churches retaining most of the Jewish forms, 
 this term "synagogue" is used here instead of the Christian term 
 "Church" (<I>ecclesia,</I> derived from a root, "called out," implying 
 the union of its members in spiritual bonds, independent of space, and 
 called out into separation from the world); an undesigned coincidence 
 and mark of truth. The people in the Jewish synagogue sat according to 
 their rank, those of the same trade together. The introduction of this 
 custom into Jewish Christian places of worship is here reprobated by 
 James. Christian churches were built like the synagogues, the holy 
 table in the east end of the former, as the ark was in the latter; the 
 <I>desk</I> and <I>pulpit</I> were the chief articles of furniture in 
 both alike. This shows the error of comparing the Church to the temple, 
 and the ministry to the priesthood; the temple is represented by the 
 whole body of worshippers; the church building was formed on the model 
 of the synagogue. See V<FONT SIZE=-1>ITRINGA</FONT> [<I>Synagogue and 
 Temple</I>].

 made distinctions" or "differences" (so as to prefer one to another)?

 inclination [G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>are become judges of evil thoughts</B>--The <I>Greek</I> words for 
 "judges" and for "partial," are akin in sound and meaning. A similar 
 translation ought therefore to be given to both. Thus, either for 
 "judges," &c.  translate, "<I>distinguishers</I> of (that is, 
 <I>according to</I> your) evil thoughts"; or, do ye not <I>partially 
 judge between</I> men, and are become <I>evilly-thinking judges</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:21">Mr 7:21</A>)?

 The "evil thoughts" are in the judges themselves; as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:6">Lu 18:6</A>,

 the <I>Greek,</I> "judge of injustice," is translated, "unjust judge." 
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> and W<FONT SIZE=-1>AHL</FONT> translate, 
 "Did ye not <I>doubt</I>" (respecting your <I>faith,</I> which is 
 inconsistent with the distinctions made by you between rich and poor)? 
 For the <I>Greek</I> constantly means "<I>doubt</I>" in all the New 
 Testament. So in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:6">Jas 1:6</A>,
 
 "wavering."

 Ac 10:20;
 Ro 4:20</A>,

 "staggered not." The same play on the same kindred words occurs in the
 <I>Greek</I> of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:10,23">Ro 14:10, 23</A>,

 "judge .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. doubteth." The same blame of being a judge, when 
 one ought to be an obeyer, of the law is found in

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:17">1Ti 6:17</A>).

 Not of course <I>all</I> the poor; but the poor, <I>as a class,</I> 
 furnish more believers than the rich as a class. The rich, if a 
 believer, renounces riches as his portion; the poor, if an unbeliever, 
 neglects that which is the peculiar advantage of poverty

 <B>8.</B> The <I>Greek</I> may be translated, "If, <I>however,</I> ye 
 fulfil," &c., that is, as A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>, after E<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>STIUS</FONT>, explains, "<I>Still</I> I do not say, hate the 
 rich (for their oppressions) and drive them from your assemblies; if 
 you choose to observe the royal law .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well and good; but 
 respect of persons is a breach of that law." I think the translation 
 is, "If <I>in very deed</I> (or '<I>indeed on the one hand</I>') ye 
 fulfil the royal law .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ye do well, but if (on the other 
 hand) ye respect persons, ye practice sin." The Jewish Christians 
 boasted of, and rested in, the "law"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>royal</B>--the law that is king of all laws, being the sum and 
 essence of the ten commandments. The great King, God, is love; His law 
 is the royal law of love, and that law, like Himself, reigns supreme. 
 He "is no respecter of persons"; therefore to respect persons is at 
 variance with Him and His royal law, which is at once a law of love and 
 of liberty

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:12">Jas 2:12</A>).
 
 The law is the "whole"; "the (particular) Scripture"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:18">Le 19:18</A>)

 that is, the Gospel law of love, which is not a law of external 
 constraint, but of internal, <I>free,</I> instinctive inclination. The 
 law of liberty, through God's mercy, frees us from the curse of the 
 law, that henceforth we should be free to love and obey willingly. If 
 we will not in turn practice the law of love to our neighbor, that law 
 of grace condemns us still more heavily than the old law, which spake 
 nothing but wrath to him who offended in the least particular

 <B>14.</B> James here, passing from the particular case of "mercy" or 
 "love" violated by "respect of persons," notwithstanding profession of 
 the "faith of our Lord Jesus"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:1">Jas 2:1</A>),

 combats the Jewish tendency (transplanted into their Christianity) to 
 substitute a lifeless, inoperative acquaintance with the letter of the 
 law, for change of heart to practical holiness, as if justification 
 could be thereby attained

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:3,13,23">Ro 2:3, 13, 23</A>).

 It seems hardly likely but that James had seen Paul's Epistles,
 considering that he uses the same phrases and examples (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:21,23,25,Ro+4:3,Heb+11:17,31">Jas 2:21, 23, 25,

 with Ro 3:28;
 Ga 2:16</A>).

 Whether James individually designed it or not, the Holy Spirit by him 
 combats not Paul, but those who abuse Paul's doctrine. The teaching of 
 both alike is inspired, and is therefore to be received without

 self-justiciaries; James, Antinomian advocates of a mere notional

 of faith, especially in the later Epistles, when many were abusing the 
 doctrine of faith

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:12">Php 2:12</A>,

 "Work out your own salvation": the salvation was already in germ theirs

 <B>23. scripture was fulfilled</B>--
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:6">Ge 15:6</A>,

 quoted by Paul, as realized in Abraham's justification by <I>faith;</I> 
 but by James, as realized subsequently in Abraham's <I>work</I> of 
 offering Isaac, which, he says, <I>justified</I> him. Plainly, then, 
 James must mean by <I>works</I> the same thing as Paul means by 
 <I>faith,</I> only that he speaks of faith at its manifested 
 development, whereas Paul speaks of it in its germ.  Abraham's offering 
 of Isaac was not a mere act of obedience, but an act of faith. Isaac 
 was the subject of the promises of God, that in him Abraham's seed 
 should be called. The same God calls on Abraham to slay the subject of 
 His own promise, when as yet there was no seed in whom those 
 predictions could be realized. Hence James' saying that Abraham was 
 justified by <I>such</I> a work, is equivalent to saying, as Paul does, 
 that he was justified by faith itself; for it was in fact <I>faith 
 expressed in action,</I> as in other cases saving faith is expressed in 
 words. So Paul states as the mean of salvation faith <I>expressed.</I> 
 The "Scripture" would not be "fulfilled," as James says it was, but 
 contradicted by any interpretation which makes man's <I>works</I> 
 justify him before God: for that Scripture makes no mention of works at 
 all, but says that Abraham's <I>belief</I> was counted to him for 
 righteousness. God, in the first instance, "justifies the 
 <I>ungodly</I>" through faith; subsequently the believer is justified 
 <I>before the world</I> as righteous through faith manifested in words 
 and works (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:35-37">Mt 25:35-37</A>,
 
 "the righteous,"

 justification; but he was <I>called</I> so, being recognized as such by 
 all on the ground of his works of faith. "He was the <I>friend</I> (in 
 an active sense), the <I>lover of God,</I> in reference to his works; 
 and (in a passive sense) <I>loved by God</I> in reference to his 
 justification by works. Both senses are united in

 (see on

 <A HREF="#Jas2_20">Jas 2:20</A>).

 Faith to justify must, from the first, include obedience in germ (to be 
 developed subsequently), though the former alone is the ground of 
 justification. The scion must be grafted on the stock that it may live; 
 it must bring forth fruit to prove that it does live.</P>

 assuredly what her other countrymen disbelieved, and this in the face

 numbers. In this belief she hid the spies at the risk of her life. 
 Hence

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:31">Heb 11:31</A>

 <I>believed</I> not." If an instance of obedience were wanting. Paul 
 and James would hardly have quoted a woman of previously bad character, 
 rather than the many moral and pious patriarchs. But as an example of 
 free grace justifying men through an <I>operative,</I> as opposed to a 
 mere verbal <I>faith,</I> none could be more suitable than a saved 
 "harlot." As Abraham was an instance of an illustrious man and the 
 father of the Jews, so Rahab is quoted as a woman, and one of abandoned 
 character, and a Gentile, showing that justifying faith has been 
 manifested in those of every class. The nature of the works alleged is 
 such as to prove that James uses them only as <I>evidences of 
 faith,</I> as contrasted with a mere verbal profession: not works of 
 charity and piety, but works the value of which consisted solely in 
 their being proofs of faith: they were faith expressed in act, 
 synonymous with <I>faith</I> itself.

 literal murder [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>] were meant, I do not think 
 it would occur so early in the series; nor had Christians then as yet 
 reached so open criminality. In the Spirit's application of the passage 
 to all ages, literal <I>killing</I> is included, flowing from the 
 desire to possess so David and Ahab. There is a climax: "Ye desire," 
 the individual lust for an object; "ye kill and envy," the feeling and 
 action of individuals against individuals; "ye fight and war," the 
 action of many against many.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>ye have not, because ye ask not</B>--God promises to those who pray, 
 not to those who fight. The petition of the lustful, murderous, and 
 contentious is not recognized by God as <I>prayer.</I> If ye prayed, 
 there would be no "wars and fightings." Thus this last clause is an 
 answer to the question,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:1">Jas 4:1</A>,
 
 "Whence come wars and fightings?"</P>

 "ask" (pray); compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:2">Jas 4:2</A>.

 James replies, It is not enough to ask for good things, but we must ask 
 with a good spirit and intention. "Ye ask amiss, that ye may consume 
 <I>it</I> (your object of prayer) upon (literally, 'in') your lusts 
 (literally, 'pleasures')"; not that ye may have the things you need for 
 the service of God. Contrast

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:5,Mt+6:31,32">Jas 1:5
 with Mt 6:31, 32</A>.

 If ye prayed aright, all your proper wants would be supplied; the 
 improper cravings which produce "wars and fightings" would then cease.
 Even believers' prayers are often best answered when their desires are 
 most opposed.</P>

 <B>spirit that dwelleth in us</B>--Other manuscripts read, "that God 
 hath made to dwell in us" (namely, at Pentecost). If so translated, 
 "Does the (Holy) Spirit that God hath placed in us lust to (towards) 
 envy" (namely, as ye do in your worldly "wars and fightings")? 
 Certainly not; ye are therefore walking in the flesh, not in the 
 Spirit, while ye thus <I>lust towards,</I> that is, <I>with envy</I> 
 against one another. The friendship of the world tends to breed 
 <I>envy;</I> the Spirit produces very different fruit. A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> attributes the epithet "with envy," in the 
 unwarrantable sense of <I>jealously,</I> to the Holy Spirit: "The 
 Spirit <I>jealously desires</I> us for His own." In <I>English 
 Version</I> the sense is, "the (natural) spirit that hath its dwelling 
 in us lusts with (literally, 'to,' or 'towards') envy." Ye lust, and 
 because ye have not what ye lust after

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:1,2">Jas 4:1, 2</A>),

 ye envy your neighbor who has, and so the <I>spirit of envy</I> leads 
 you on to "fight." James also here refers to

 virtually condemns evil-speaking and judging

 acts and words of others which do not please themselves, thus aiming at 
 the reputation of sanctity, put their own moroseness in the place of 
 the law, and claim to themselves a power of censuring above the law of 
 God, condemning what the law permits [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>]. 
 Such a one acts as though the law could not perform its own office of

 vengeance which men tacitly take no account of, as unchastity and 
 injustice [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]. Sins peculiarly offensive to 
 God are said to "cry" to Him. The rich ought to have given freely to 
 the poor; their not doing so was sin. A still greater sin was their not 
 paying their debts. Their greatest sin was not paying them to the poor, 
 whose wages is their all.

 impatience and harsh judgment, not uttered aloud or freely. Having 
 exhorted them to patience in bearing wrongs from the wicked, he now

 impatient at the latter, though much less grievous.

 sins be covered <I>before God,</I> namely, with Christ's atonement. He 
 effects this by making the convert partaker in the Christian covenant 
 for the remission of all sins. Though this hiding of sins was included 
 in the previous "shall save," James expresses it to mark in detail the 
 greatness of the blessing conferred on the penitent through the 
 converter's instrumentality, and to incite others to the same good 
 deed.</P>
