 M<FONT SIZE=-1>ALACHI</FONT> forms the transition link between the two 
 dispensations, the Old and the New, "the skirt and boundary of 
 Christianity" [T<FONT SIZE=-1>ERTULLIAN</FONT>], to which perhaps is 
 due the abrupt earnestness which characterizes his prophecies. His very 
 name is somewhat uncertain. Malachi is the name of an office, rather
 than a person, "My messenger," and as such is found in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1">Mal 3:1</A>.

 The <I>Septuagint</I> favors this view in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:1">Mal 1:1</A>;

 translate, not "by Malachi," but "by the hand of His messenger" 
 (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:13">Hag 1:13</A>).

 Malachi is the last inspired messenger of the Old Testament, announcing 
 the advent of the Great Messenger of the New Testament. The 
 <I>Chaldee</I> paraphrase identifies him with Ezra wrongly, as Ezra is 
 never called a prophet but a scribe, and Malachi never a scribe but a 
 prophet. Still it hence appears that Malachi was by some old 
 authorities not regarded as a proper name. The analogy of the headings 
 of other prophets, however, favors the common view that Malachi is a 
 proper name. As Haggai and Zechariah, the contemporary prophets, 
 supported Joshua and Zerubbabel in the building of the temple, so he at 
 a subsequent period supported the priest Ezra and the governor 
 Nehemiah. Like that ruler, he presupposes the temple to have been 
 already built

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:10,3:1-10">Mal 1:10; 3:1-10</A>).

 Both alike censure the abuses still unreformed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:5,15-22,23-30">Ne 13:5, 15-22, 23-30</A>),

 the profane and mercenary character of the priests, the people's
 marriages contracted with foreigners, the non-payment of the tithes, 
 and want of sympathy towards the poor on the part of the rich

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:7">Ne 6:7</A>)

 implies that Nehemiah was supported by prophets in his work of 
 reformation. The date thus will be about 420 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, 
 or later. Both the periods after the captivity (that of Haggai and 
 Zechariah, and that of Malachi) were marked by royal, priestly, and 
 prophetic men at the head of God's people. The former period was that 
 of the building of the temple; the latter, that of the restoration of 
 the people and rebuilding of the city. It is characteristic of the 
 people of God that the first period after the restoration was 
 exclusively devoted to the rebuilding of the temple; the political 
 restoration came secondarily. Only a colony of fifty thousand settled 
 with Joshua and Zerubbabel in Palestine

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:64">Ezr 2:64</A>).

 Even these became intermingled with the heathen around during the sixty 
 years passed over by Ezra in silence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+9:6-15,Ne+1:3">Ezr 9:6-15;
 Ne 1:3</A>). 

 Hence a second restoration was needed which should mould the national
 life into a Jewish form, re-establishing the holy law and the holy
 city--a work effected by Ezra and Nehemiah, with the aid of Malachi, in
 a period of about half a century, ending with the deaths of Malachi and
 Nehemiah in the last ten years of the fifth century <FONT
 SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>; that is, the "seven weeks"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:25">Da 9:25</A>)

 put in the beginning of the "seventy" by themselves, to mark the
 fundamental difference between them, the last period of Old Testament 
 revelation, and the period which followed without any revelation (the 
 sixty-two weeks), preceding the final week standing out in unrivalled 
 dignity by itself as the time of Messiah's appearing. The seventy weeks 
 thus begin with the seventh year of Artaxerxes who allowed Ezra to go 
 to Jerusalem, 457 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, in accordance with the 
 commandment which then went forth from God. Ezra the priest performed 
 the inner work of purifying the nation from heathenish elements and 
 reintroducing the law; while Nehemiah did the outer work of rebuilding 
 the city and restoring the national polity [A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>UBERLEN</FONT>].  V<FONT SIZE=-1>ITRINGA</FONT> makes the date 
 of Malachi's prophecies to be about the second return of Nehemiah from 
 Persia, not later than 424 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, the date of 
 Artaxerxes' death

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:6">Ne 13:6</A>).

 About this time Socrates was teaching the only approach to a pure 
 morality which corrupt Athens ever knew.  M<FONT SIZE=-1>OORE</FONT>

 to God's love, which so distinguished Israel above Edom

 (2) The priests are reproved for neglect and profanation

 (3) Mixed marriages, and the wrongs done to Jewish wives, are reproved

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:10-16">Mal 2:10-16</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Wherein hast thou loved us?</B>--In painful contrast to the tearful
 tenderness of God's love stands their insolent challenge. The root of
 their sin was insensibility to God's <I>love,</I> and to their own
 wickedness. Having had prosperity taken from them, they imply they have
 no tokens of God's love; they look at what God had taken, not at what
 God had left. God's love is often least acknowledged where it is most
 manifested. We must not infer God does not love us because He afflicts
 us. Men, instead of referring their sufferings to their proper cause,
 their own sin, impiously accuse God of indifference to their welfare
 [M<FONT SIZE=-1>OORE</FONT>]. Thus

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:1-4">Mal 1:1-4</A>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Was not Esau Jacob's brother?</B>--and so, as far as dignity went, as much

 altogether by gratuitous favor

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:13">Ro 9:13</A>).

 So God has passed by our
 elder brethren, the angels who kept not their first estate, and yet He
 has provided salvation for man. The perpetual rejection of the fallen
 angels, like the perpetual desolations of Edom, attests God's severity
 to the lost, and goodness to those gratuitously saved. The sovereign
 eternal purpose of God is the only ground on which He bestows on one
 favors withheld from another. There are difficulties in referring
 salvation to the election of God, there are greater in referring it to
 the election of man [M<FONT SIZE=-1>OORE</FONT>].

 rock-houses of Petra attest the fulfilment of the prophecy. It is still
 "the border of wickedness," being the resort of the marauding tribes of
 the desert. Judea's restoration, though delayed, is yet certain.

 Ye sanction the niggardly and blemished offerings of the people on the 
 altar, to gain favor with them.  Darius, and probably his successors, 
 had liberally supplied them with victims for sacrifice, yet they 
 presented none but the worst. A cheap religion, costing little, is 
 rejected by God, and so is worth nothing.  It costs more than it is 
 worth, for it is worth nothing, and so proves really dear. God despises

 This verse forms the transition to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1">Mal 3:1</A>,

 &c. The Jewish skeptics of that day said virtually, God delighteth in 
 evil-doers (inferring this from the prosperity of the surrounding 
 heathen, while they, the Jews, were comparatively not prosperous: 
 forgetting that their attendance to minor and external duties did not 
 make up for their neglect of the weightier duties of the law; for 
 example, the duty they owed their wives, just previously discussed); or 
 (if not) Where (is the proof that He is) the God of judgment? To this 
 the reply

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1">Mal 3:1</A>)

 is, "The Lord whom ye seek, and whom as messenger of the covenant (that 
 is, divine ratifier of God's covenant with Israel) ye delight in 
 (thinking He will restore Israel to its proper place as first of the 
 nations), shall suddenly come," not as a Restorer of Israel temporally, 
 but as a consuming <I>Judge</I> against Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:18,19,20">Am 5:18, 19, 20</A>).

 The "suddenly" implies the unpreparedness of the Jews, who, to the last 
 of the siege, were expecting a temporal deliverer, whereas a 
 destructive judgment was about to destroy them. So skepticism shall be 
 rife before Christ's second coming. He shall suddenly and unexpectedly 
 come then also as a consuming Judge to unbelievers

 predecessor

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:3-5">Isa 40:3-5</A>).

 Perhaps also, as H<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGSTENBERG</FONT> thinks, "messenger" 
 includes <I>the long line of prophets</I> headed by <I>Elijah</I> 
 (whence his name is put in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:5">Mal 4:5</A>

 as a representative name), and terminating in John, the last and 
 greatest of the prophets

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:9-11">Mt 11:9-11</A>).

 John as the representative prophet (the forerunner of Messiah the 
 representative God-man) gathered in himself all the scattered 
 lineaments of previous prophecy (hence Christ terms him "much more than 
 a prophet,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:26">Lu 7:26</A>),

 reproducing all its awful and yet inspiriting utterances: his coarse 
 garb, like that of the old prophets, being a visible exhortation to 
 repentance; the wilderness in which he preached symbolizing the 
 lifeless, barren state of the Jews at that time, politically and 
 spiritually; his topics sin, repentance, and salvation, presenting for 
 the last time the condensed epitome of all previous teachings of God by 
 His prophets; so that he is called pre-eminently God's "messenger." 
 Hence the oldest and true reading of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:2">Mr 1:2</A>

 is, "as it is written in <I>Isaiah</I> the prophet"; the difficulty of
 which is, How can the prophecy of Malachi be referred to Isaiah? The 
 explanation is: the passage in Malachi rests on that in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:3">Isa 40:3</A>,

 and therefore the <I>original source</I> of the prophecy is referred to 
 in order to mark this dependency and connection.

 must be one with the "Me," that is, He must be G<FONT

 of the Son and His oneness with the Father are thus proved, so the 
 distinctness of personality is proved by "I send" and He "shall come," 
 as distinguished from one another. He also comes to the temple as "His 
 temple": marking His divine lordship <I>over</I> it, as contrasted with 
 all creatures, who are but "servants <I>in</I>" it

 and to destroy Jerusalem and the theocracy after they had rejected Him. 
 His mission is here regarded as a whole from the first to the second 
 advent: the process of refining and separating the godly from the 
 ungodly beginning during Christ's stay on earth, going on ever since,

 He will <I>sit</I> down to the work, not perfunctorily, but with

 leading His people out of Egypt by the pillar of cloud and fire, has an 
 aspect of terror to His foes, of love to His friends. The same 
 separating process goes on in the world as in each Christian. When the 
 godly are completely separated from the ungodly, the world will end.

 continued to disregard Me. In trying to defraud God we only defraud 
 ourselves. The eagle who robbed the altar set fire to her nest from the 
 burning coal that adhered to the stolen flesh. So men who retain God's 
 money in their treasuries will find it a losing possession. No man ever 
 yet lost by serving God with a whole heart, nor gained by serving Him 
 with a half one. We may compromise with conscience for half the price, 
 but God will not endorse the compromise; and, like Ananias and 
 Sapphira, we shall lose not only what we thought we had purchased so 
 cheaply, but also the price we paid for it. If we would have God "open" 
 His treasury, we must open ours. One cause of the barrenness of the

 were to be in force until John

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:13">Mt 11:13</A>),

 no prophet intervening after Malachi; therefore they are told,
 "Remember the law," for in the absence of living prophets, they were 
 likely to forget it. The office of Christ's forerunner was to bring 
 them back to the law, which they had too much forgotten, and so "to 
 make ready a people prepared for the Lord" at His coming

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:17">Lu 1:17</A>).

 God withheld prophets for a time that men might seek after Christ with 
 the greater desire [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>]. The history of human 
 advancement is marked by periods of rest, and again progress. So in 
 Revelation: it is given for a time; then during its suspension men live 
 on the memories of the past. After Malachi there was a silence of four 
 hundred years; then a harbinger of light in the wilderness, ushering in 
 the brightest of all the lights that had been manifested, but 
 short-lived; then eighteen centuries during which we have been guided 
 by the light which shone in that last manifestation. The silence has 
 been longer than before, and will be succeeded by a more glorious and 
 awful revelation than ever. John the Baptist was to "restore" the 
 defaced image of "the law," so that the original might be recognized 
 when it appeared among men [H<FONT SIZE=-1>INDS</FONT>].  Just as 
 "Moses" and "Elias" are here connected with the Lord's coming, so at 
 the transfiguration they converse with Him, implying that the law and 
 prophets which had prepared His way were now fulfilled in Him.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the prophet</B>--emphatical; not "the Tishbite"; for it is in his official,
 not his personal capacity, that his coming is here predicted. In this
 sense, John the Baptist was <I>an</I> Elijah in spirit 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:16,17">Lu 1:16, 17</A>),
 
 but not <I>the literal</I> Elijah; whence when asked, "Art thou Elias?"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:21">Joh 1:21</A>),

 He answered, "I am not." "Art thou that prophet?" "No." This implies 
 that John, though knowing from the angel's announcement to his father 
 that he was referred to by 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:5">Mal 4:5</A>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:17">Lu 1:17</A>),

 whence he wore the costume of Elijah, yet knew by inspiration that he 
 did not exhaustively fulfil <I>all</I> that is included in this 
 prophecy: that there is a further fulfilment (compare <I>Note,</I> see 
 on

 <A HREF="#Mal3_1">Mal 3:1</A>). 
 
 As Moses in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:4">Mal 4:4</A>

 represents the law, so Elijah represents the prophets. The Jews always 
 understood it of the literal Elijah. Their saying is, "Messiah must be 
 anointed by Elijah." As there is another consummating advent of Messiah 
 Himself, so also of His forerunner Elijah; perhaps in person, as at the 
 transfiguration

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:3">Mt 17:3</A>;
 
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:11">Mt 17:11</A>).
 
 He in his appearance at the transfiguration in that body on which death
 had never passed is the forerunner of the saints who shall be found
 alive at the Lord's second coming.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:3">Re 11:3</A>

 may refer to the same witnesses as at the transfiguration, Moses and 
 Elijah;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:6">Re 11:6</A>
 
 identifies the latter (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:1,Jam+5:17">1Ki 17:1;
 Jas 5:17</A>).

 Even after the transfiguration Jesus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:11">Mt 17:11</A>)

 speaks of Elijah's coming "to restore all things" as still future, 
 though He adds that Elijah (in the person of John the Baptist) is come 
 already <I>in a sense</I> (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:21">Ac 3:21</A>).

 However, the future forerunner of Messiah at His second coming may be a 
 prophet or number of prophets clothed with Elijah's power, who, with 
 zealous upholders of "the law" clothed in the spirit of "Moses," may be 
 the forerunning witnesses alluded to here and in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:2-12">Re 11:2-12</A>.

 The words "before the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <I>dreadful</I> day of the Lord," 
 show that John cannot be exclusively meant; for he came before the day 
 of Christ's coming in grace, not before His coming in terror, of which 
 last the destruction of Jerusalem was the earnest

 <B>6. turn .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. heart of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fathers to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. children,</B> &c.--Explained
 by some, that John's preaching should restore harmony in families. But

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:16,17">Lu 1:16, 17</A>

 substitutes for "the heart of the children to the fathers," "the 
 disobedient to the wisdom of the just," implying that the 
 reconciliation to be effected was that between the unbelieving 
 disobedient children and the believing ancestors, Jacob, Levi, "Moses," 
 and "Elijah" (just mentioned) (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:2,2:4,6,3:3,4">Mal 1:2; 2:4, 6; 3:3, 4</A>).

 The threat here is that, if this restoration were not effected,
 Messiah's coming would prove "a curse" to the "earth," not a blessing. 
 It proved so to guilty Jerusalem and the "earth," that is, the 
 <I>land</I> of Judea when it rejected Messiah at His first advent, 
 though He brought blessings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:3">Ge 12:3</A>)

 to those who accepted Him 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:11-13">Joh 1:11-13</A>).

 Many were delivered from the common destruction of the nation through 
 John's preaching

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:29,11:5">Ro 9:29; 11:5</A>).

 It will prove so to the disobedient at His second advent, though He
 comes to be glorified in His saints

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:6-10">2Th 1:6-10</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>curse</B>--<I>Hebrew, Cherem,</I> "a ban"; the fearful term applied by the
 Jews to the extermination of the guilty Canaanites. Under this ban Judea
 has long lain. Similar is the awful curse on all of Gentile churches who
 love not the Lord Jesus now 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:22">1Co 16:22</A>).

 For if God spare not the natural branches, the Jews, much less will He 
 spare unbelieving professors of the Gentiles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:20,21">Ro 11:20, 21</A>).

 It is deeply suggestive that the last utterance from heaven for four 
 hundred years before Messiah was the awful word "curse." Messiah's 
 first word on the mount was "Blessed"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:3">Mt 5:3</A>).

 The law speaks wrath; the Gospel, blessing. Judea is now under the 
 "curse" because it rejects Messiah; when the spirit of Elijah, or a 
 literal Elijah, shall bring the Jewish children back to the Hope of 
 their "fathers," blessing shall be theirs, whereas the apostate "earth" 
 shall be "smitten with the curse" previous to the coming restoration of 
 all things
