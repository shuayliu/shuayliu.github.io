 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HIS</FONT> book is to the Gospels what the fruit is to the tree that bears
 it. In the Gospels we see the corn of wheat falling into the ground and
 dying: in the Acts we see it bringing forth much fruit 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:24">Joh 12:24</A>).
 
 There we see Christ purchasing the Church with His own blood: here we
 see the Church, so purchased, rising into actual existence; first among
 the Jews of Palestine, and next among the surrounding Gentiles, until
 it gains a footing in the great capital of the ancient world--sweeping
 majestically from Jerusalem to Rome. Nor is this book of less value as
 an Introduction to the Epistles which follow it, than as a Sequel to
 the Gospels which precede it. For without this history the Epistles of
 the New Testament--presupposing, as they do, the historical
 circumstances of the parties addressed, and deriving from these so much
 of their freshness, point, and force--would in no respect be what they
 now are, and would in a number of places be scarcely intelligible.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The genuineness, authenticity, and canonical authority of this book
 were never called in question within the ancient Church. It stands
 immediately after the Gospels, in the catalogues of the
 <I>Homologoumena,</I> or universally acknowledged books of the New Testament
 (see <I>Introduction</I> to our larger <I>Commentary,</I> Vol. V, pp. iv, v). It
 was rejected, indeed, by certain heretical sects in the second and
 third centuries--by the Ebionites, the Severians (see E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>,
 <I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 4.29), the Marcionites, and the Manicheans:
 but the totally uncritical character of their objections (see
 <I>Introduction</I> above referred to, pp. xiii, xiv) not only deprives them
 of all weight, but indirectly shows on what solid grounds the Christian
 Church had all along proceeded in recognizing this book.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In our day, however, its authenticity has, like that of all the
 leading books of the New Testament, been made the subject of keen and
 protracted controversy. D<FONT SIZE=-1>E</FONT>
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>ETTE</FONT>, while admitting Luke to be the author
 of the entire work, pronounces the earlier portion of it to have been
 drawn up from unreliable sources
 (<I>New-Testament Introduction,</I> 2<I>a,</I> 2<I>C</I>). But the Tubingen school,
 with B<FONT SIZE=-1>AUR</FONT> at their head, have gone much farther. As their fantastic
 theory of the post-Joannean date of the Gospels could not pretend even
 to a hearing so long as the authenticity of the Acts of the Apostles
 remained unshaken, they contend that the earlier portion of this work
 can be shown to be unworthy of credit, while the latter portion is in
 flat contradiction to the Epistle to the Galatians--which this school
 regard as unassailable--and bears internal evidence of being a designed
 distortion of facts for the purpose of setting up the catholic form
 which Paul gave to Christianity in opposition to the narrow Judaic but
 original form of it which Peter preached, and which after the death of
 the apostles was held exclusively by the sect of the Ebionites. It is
 painful to think that anyone should have spent so many years, and,
 aided by learned and acute disciples in different parts of the
 argument, should have expended so much learning, research, and
 ingenuity in attempting to build up a hypothesis regarding the
 origination of the leading books of the New Testament which outrages
 all the principles of sober criticism and legitimate evidence. As a
 school, this party at length broke up: its head, after living to find
 himself the sole defender of the theory as a whole, left this earthly
 scene complaining of desertion. While some of his associates have
 abandoned such heartless studies altogether for the more congenial
 pursuits of philosophy, others have modified their attacks on the
 historical truth of the New Testament records, retreating into
 positions into which it is not worth while to follow them, while others
 still have been gradually approximating to sound principles. The one
 compensation for all this mischief is the rich additions to the
 apologetical and critical literature of the books of the New Testament,
 and the earliest history of the Christian Church, which it has drawn
 from the pens of T<FONT SIZE=-1>HIERSCH</FONT>,
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>BRARD</FONT>, and many others. Any allusions
 which it may be necessary for us to make to the assertions of this
 school will be made in connection with the passages to which they
 relate--in Acts, First Corinthians, and Galatians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The manifest connection between this book and the third Gospel--of
 which it professes to be simply the continuation by the same
 author--and the striking similarity which marks the style of both
 productions, leave no room to doubt that the early Church was right in
 ascribing it with one consent to Luke. The difficulty which some
 fastidious critics have made about the sources of the earlier portion
 of the history has no solid ground. That the historian himself was an
 eye-witness of the earliest scenes--as H<FONT SIZE=-1>UG</FONT> concludes from the
 circumstantiality of the narrative--is altogether improbable: but there
 were hundreds of eye-witnesses of some of the scenes, and enough of all
 the rest, to give to the historian, partly by oral, partly by written
 testimony, all the details which he has embodied so graphically in his
 history; and it will appear, we trust, from the commentary, that De
 Wette's complaints of confusion, contradiction, and error in this
 portion are without foundation. The same critic, and one or two others,
 would ascribe to Timothy those later portions of the book in which the
 historian speaks in the first person plural--"we"; supposing him to
 have taken notes of all that passed under his own eye, which Luke
 embodied in his history just as they stood. It is impossible here to
 refute this gratuitous hypothesis in detail; but the reader will find
 it done by E<FONT SIZE=-1>BRARD</FONT> (<I>The Gospel History,</I> sect. 110, Clark's
 translation; sect. 127 of the original work,
 <I>Wissenschaftliche Kritik der Evangelische Geschichte,</I> 1850), and by
 D<FONT SIZE=-1>AVIDSON</FONT> (<I>Introduction to New Testament,</I> Vol. II, pp. 9-21).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The undesigned coincidences between this History and the Apostolic
 Epistles have been brought out and handled, as an argument for the 
 truth of the facts thus attested, with unrivalled felicity by P<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ALEY</FONT> in his <I>Hor&aelig; Paulin&aelig;,</I> to which 
 Mr.  B<FONT SIZE=-1>IRKS</FONT> has made a number of ingenious 
 additions in his <I>Hor&aelig; Apostolic&aelig;.</I> Exception has been 
 taken to some of these by J<FONT SIZE=-1>OWETT</FONT> (<I>St. Paul's 
 Epistles,</I> Vol. I, pp. 108 ff.), not without a measure of reason in 
 certain cases--for our day, at least--though even he admits that in 
 this line of evidence the work of P<FONT SIZE=-1>ALEY</FONT>, taken as 
 a whole, is unassailable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Much has been written about the object of this history. Certainly
 "the Acts of the Apostles" are but very partially recorded. But for
 this title the historian is not responsible. Between the two
 extremes--of supposing that the work has no plan at all, and that it is
 constructed on an elaborate and complex plan, we shall probably be as
 near the truth as is necessary if we take the design to be to record
 the diffusion of Christianity and the rise of the Christian Church,
 first among the Jews of Palestine, the seat of the ancient Faith, and
 next among the surrounding Gentiles, with Antioch for its headquarters,
 until, finally, it is seen waving over imperial Rome, foretokening its
 universal triumph. In this view of it, there is no difficulty in
 accounting for the almost exclusive place which it gives to the labors
 of Peter in the first instance, and the all but entire disappearance
 from the history both of him and of the rest of the Twelve after the
 great apostle of the Gentiles came upon the stage--like the lesser
 lights on the rise of the great luminary.</P>

 the other by His Spirit; the one the "beginning," the other the
 continuance of the same work; the one complete when He sat down at the
 right hand of the Majesty on high, the other to continue till His second
 appearing; the one recorded in "The Gospels," the <I>beginnings</I> only of
 the other related in this book of "The Acts." "Hence the grand history
 of what Jesus did and taught does not conclude with His departure to the
 Father; but Luke now begins it in a higher strain; for all the
 subsequent labors of the apostles are just an exhibition of
 <I>the ministry of the glorified Redeemer Himself</I> because they were

 Lu 24:44-49</A>. 

 It is worthy of notice that nowhere else are such communications of the
 risen Redeemer said to have been given "through the Holy Ghost." In 
 general, this might have been said of all He uttered and all He did in 
 His official character; for it was for this very end that God "gave not 
 the Spirit by measure unto Him"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:34">Joh 3:34</A>).

 But after His resurrection, as if to signify the new relation in which 
 He now stood to the Church, He signalized His first meeting with the 
 assembled disciples by <I>breathing</I> on them (immediately after 
 dispensing to them His <I>peace</I>) and saying, "<I>Receive ye the 
 Holy Ghost</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:22">Joh 20:22</A>)

 thus anticipating the donation of the Spirit from His hands (see on

 <A HREF="JFB43.htm#Joh20_21">Joh 20:21, 22</A>);

 and on the same principle His parting charges are here said to have
 been given "through the Holy Ghost," as if to mark that He was now all 
 redolent with the Spirit; that what had been husbanded, during His 
 suffering work, for His own necessary uses, had now been set free, was 
 already overflowing from Himself to His disciples, and needed but His 
 ascension and glorification to flow all forth. (See on

 "<I>the resurrection of the Lord Jesus</I>" was the great burden of
 apostolic preaching, so the subject is here filly introduced by an
 allusion to the primary evidence on which that great fact rests, the
 repeated and undeniable manifestations of Himself in the body to the
 assembled disciples, who, instead of being predisposed to believe it,
 had to be overpowered by the resistless evidence of their own senses,
 and were slow of yielding even to this

 Holy Man, whose life of high devotedness and lofty spirituality is 
 crowned with the assurance, that though He taste of death, He shall 
 rise again without seeing corruption, and be admitted to the bliss of 
 God's immediate presence.  Now as this was palpably untrue of David, it 
 could be meant only of One other, even of Him whom David was taught to 
 expect as the final Occupant of the throne of Israel. (Those, 
 therefore, and they are many, who take David himself to be the subject 
 of this Psalm, and the words quoted to refer to Christ only <I>in a 
 more eminent</I> sense, nullify the whole argument of the apostle). The 
 Psalm is then affirmed to have had its only proper fulfilment in J<FONT

 witnesses, while the glorious effusion of the Spirit by the hand of the 
 ascended One, setting an infallible seal upon all, was even then

 away of every one of you from his iniquities." With what divine skill
 does the apostle, founding on resistless facts, here drive home to the
 conscience of his auditors their guilt in crucifying the Lord of Glory;
 then soothe their awakened minds by assurances of forgiveness on turning
 to the Lord, and a glorious future as soon as this shall come to pass,

 model for imitation is furnished by the class here complained of, who,

 do the apostles here show themselves to be, in not only divesting
 themselves of the immediate superintendence of temporal affairs in the
 Christian community, but giving the choice of those who were to be
 entrusted with it to the disciples at large! (5) How little of formal
 organization did the apostles give to the Church at first, and when an
 emergency arose which demanded something more, how entirely was the
 remedy suggested by the reason of the thing! (6) Though the new
 office-bearers are not expressly called <I>Deacons</I> here, it is

 In this long defense Stephen takes a much wider range, and goes less
 directly into the point raised by his accusers, than we should have
 expected. His object seems to have been to show (1) that so far from
 disparaging, he deeply reverenced, and was intimately conversant with,
 the whole history of the ancient economy; and (2) that in resisting the
 erection of the Gospel kingdom they were but treading in their fathers'
 footsteps, the whole history of their nation being little else than one
 continued misapprehension of God's high designs towards fallen man and
 rebellion against them.</P>

 to all the other apostles together! Here he is, having perhaps already a
 seat in the Sanhedrim, some thirty years of age, in the thick of this
 tumultuous murder of a distinguished witness for Christ, not only
 "consenting unto his death"

 <B>59, 60. calling upon God and saying, Lord Jesus,</B> &c.--An unhappy
 supplement of our translators is the word "God" here; as if, while
 addressing the Son, he was really calling upon the Father. The sense is
 perfectly clear without any supplement at all--"calling upon [invoking]
 and saying, Lord Jesus"; Christ being the Person directly invoked and
 addressed by name (compare

 commitment of his spirit to Jesus, Paul afterwards followed his

 cannot but wonder that this, of all predictions of Messiah's sufferings

 eunuch was reading before Philip joined him. He could hardly miss to
 have heard at Jerusalem of the sufferings and death of Jesus, and of the
 existence of a continually increasing party who acknowledged Him to be
 the Messiah. But his question to Philip, whether the prophet in this
 passage meant himself or some other man, clearly shows that he had not

 <B>and he went on his way rejoicing</B>--He had found Christ, and the key
 to the Scriptures; his soul was set free, and his discipleship sealed;
 he had lost his teacher, but gained what was infinitely better: He felt
 himself a new man, and "his joy was full." Tradition says he was the
 first preacher of the Gospel in Ethiopia; and how, indeed, could he
 choose but "tell what the Lord had done for his soul?" Yet there is no
 certainty as to any historical connection between his labors and the
 introduction of Christianity into that country.</P>

 disciples of the Lord,</B> &c.--The emphatic "yet" is intended to note
 the remarkable fact, that up to this moment his blind persecuting rage
 against the disciples of the Lord burned as fiercely as ever. (In the
 teeth of this, N<FONT SIZE=-1>EANDER</FONT> and
 O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT> picture him deeply impressed with
 Stephen's joyful faith, remembering passages of the Old Testament
 confirmatory of the Messiahship of Jesus, and experiencing such a
 violent struggle as would inwardly prepare the way for the designs of
 God towards him. Is not dislike, if not unconscious disbelief, of
 <I>sudden conversion</I> at the bottom of this?) The word "slaughter" here
 points to cruelties not yet recorded, but the particulars of which are
 supplied by himself nearly thirty years afterwards: "And I persecuted
 this way <I>unto the death</I>"

 his name was soon changed into "Paul," we find him, in both his own
 narratives of the scene, after the lapse of so many years, retaining the
 original form, as not daring to alter, in the smallest detail, the
 overpowering words addressed to him.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>why persecutest thou me?</B>--No language can express the affecting
 character of this question, addressed from the right hand of the Majesty
 on high to an infuriated, persecuting mortal. (See

 The term "Lord" here is an indefinite term of respect for some unknown
 but august speaker. That Saul saw as well as <I>heard</I> this glorious
 Speaker, is expressly said by Ananias 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:17,22:14">Ac 9:17; 22:14</A>),
 
 by Barnabas

 and by himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:16">Ac 26:16</A>);

 and in claiming apostleship, he explicitly states that he had 
 "<I>seen</I> the Lord"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:1,15:8">1Co 9:1; 15:8</A>),

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>I am Jesus whom thou persecutest</B>--The "I" and "thou" here are
 touchingly emphatic in the original; while the term "J<FONT SIZE=-1>ESUS</FONT>"
 is purposely
 chosen, to convey to him the thrilling information that the hated name
 which he sought to hunt down--"<I>the Nazarene,</I>" as it is in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:8">Ac 22:8</A>

 --was now speaking to him from the skies, "crowned with glory and 
 honor" (see

 <B>It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks</B>--The metaphor of an
 ox, only driving the goad deeper by kicking against it, is a classic

 measures for crushing the Gospel, but the deeper wound which every such
 effort inflicted upon himself.</P>

 <B>6. And he, trembling and astonished, said, Lord, what wilt thou have
 me to do? And the Lord said</B>--(The most ancient manuscripts and
 versions of the New Testament lack all these words <I>here</I> [including
 the last clause of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:5">Ac 9:5</A>];

 and Ac 22:10</A>,

 from which they appear to have been inserted here). The question, "What 
 shall I do, Lord?" or, "Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?" indicates 
 a state of mind singularly interesting (see on

 <A HREF="#Ac2_37">Ac 2:37</A>). 

 Its elements seem to be these: (1) Resistless conviction that "Jesus
 whom he persecuted," now speaking to him, was "Christ the Lord." (See
 on

 <A HREF="JFB48.htm#Ga1_15">Ga 1:15, 16</A>).

 (2) As a consequence of this, that not only all his religious views,
 but his whole religious character, had been an entire mistake; that he 
 was up to that moment fundamentally and wholly wrong. (3) That though 
 his whole future was now a blank, he had absolute confidence in Him who 
 had so tenderly arrested him in his blind career, and was ready both to 
 take in all His teaching and to carry out all His directions. (For 
 more, see on

 <B>7. the men .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. stood speechless</B>--This may mean 
 merely that they remained so; but if the <I>standing</I> posture be 
 intended, we have only to suppose that though at first they "all fell
 to the earth"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:14">Ac 26:14</A>),

 But just as "the people that stood by <I>heard</I>" the voice that 
 saluted our Lord with recorded words of consolation and assurance, and 
 yet <I>heard not</I> the articulate words, but thought "it thundered" 
 or that some "angel spake to Him"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:28,29">Joh 12:28, 29</A>)

 --so these men heard the <I>voice</I> that spake to Saul, but heard not 
 the <I>articulate words.</I> Apparent discrepancies like these, in the 
 different narratives of the same scene in one and the same book of 
 Acts, furnish the strongest confirmation both of the facts themselves

 glory of that light"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:11">Ac 22:11</A>),

 he had involuntarily closed his eyes to protect them from the glare;
 and on opening them again he found his vision gone. "It is not said, 
 however, that he was <I>blind,</I> for it was no punishment" [B<FONT

 <B>9. And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor 
 drink</B>--that is, according to the <I>Hebrew</I> mode of computation: 
 he took no food during the remainder of that day, the entire day 
 following, and so much of the subsequent day as elapsed before the 
 visit of Ananias. Such a period of entire abstinence from food, in that 
 state of mental absorption and revolution into which he had been so 
 suddenly thrown, is in perfect harmony with known laws and numerous 
 facts. But what three days those must have been! "Only one other space 
 of three days' duration can be mentioned of equal importance in the 
 history of the world" [H<FONT SIZE=-1>OWSON</FONT>]. Since Jesus had 
 been revealed not only to his <I>eyes</I> but to his <I>soul</I> 
 (see on

 <A HREF="JFB48.htm#Ga1_15">Ga 1:15, 16</A>),

 the double conviction must have immediately flashed upon him, that his 
 whole reading of the Old Testament hitherto had been wrong, and that 
 the system of legal righteousness in which he had, up to that moment, 
 rested and prided himself was false and fatal.  What materials these 
 for spiritual exercise during those three days of total darkness, 
 fasting, and solitude! On the one hand, what self-condemnation, what 
 anguish, what death of legal hope, what difficulty in believing that in 
 such a case there could be hope at all; on the other hand, what 
 heartbreaking admiration of the grace that had "pulled him out of the 
 fire," what resistless conviction that there must be a purpose of love 
 in it, and what tender expectation of being yet honored, as a chosen 
 vessel, to declare what the Lord had done for his soul, and to spread 
 abroad the savor of that Name which he had so wickedly, though 
 ignorantly, sought to destroy--must have struggled in his breast during 
 those memorable days! Is it too much to say that all that profound 
 insight into the Old Testament, that comprehensive grasp of the 
 principles of the divine economy, that penetrating spirituality, that 
 vivid apprehension of man's lost state, and those glowing views of the 
 perfection and glory of the divine remedy, that beautiful ideal of the 
 loftiness and the lowliness of the Christian character, that large 
 philanthropy and burning zeal to spend and be spent through all his 
 future life for Christ, which distinguish the writings of this chiefest 
 of the apostles and greatest of men, were all quickened into life 
 during those three successive days?</P>

 <I>we learn from Paul himself that he "went into Arabia, and returned
 again unto Damascus," and that from the time of his first visit to the 
 close of his second, both of which appear to have been short, a period 
 of three years elapsed;</I> either three full years, or one full year 
 and part of two others.  (See on

 That such a blank should occur in the Acts, and be filled up in
 Galatians, is not more remarkable than that the flight of the Holy
 Family into Egypt, their stay there, and their return thence, recorded
 only by Matthew, should be so entirely passed over by Luke, that if we
 had only his Gospel, we should have supposed that they returned to
 Nazareth immediately after the presentation in the temple. (Indeed in
 one of his narratives,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:16,17">Ac 22:16, 17</A>,

 Paul himself takes no notice of this period). But <I>wherefore this 
 journey?</I> Perhaps (1) because he felt a period of repose and partial 
 seclusion to be needful to his spirit, after the violence of the change 
 and the excitement of his new occupation. (2) To prevent the rising 
 storm which was gathering against him from coming too soon to a head. 
 (3) To exercise his ministry in the Jewish synagogues, as opportunity 
 afforded. On his return, refreshed and strengthened in spirit, he
 immediately resumed his ministry, but soon to the imminent hazard of 
 his life.</P>

 Hellenistic Jews and eminent in their respective localities, they may 
 very well have been acquainted with each other before this [H<FONT

 apprehension for quitting Jerusalem so soon.  "While he was praying in

 this effect.  (See on

 he himself says of this journey, that he "came into the regions of
 Syria and Cilicia"; from which it is natural to infer that instead of
 sailing direct for Tarsus, he landed at Seleucia, travelled thence to
 Antioch, and penetrated from this northward into Cilicia, ending his
 journey at Tarsus. As this was his first visit to his native city since
 his conversion, so it is not certain that he ever was there again.  
 (See on

 We here enter on an entirely new phase of the Christian Church, the 
 "opening of the door of faith to the Gentiles"; in other words, the 
 recognition of Gentile, on terms of perfect equality with Jewish, 
 discipleship without the necessity of circumcision. Some beginnings 
 appear to have been already made in this direction (see on

 <A HREF="#Ac11_20">Ac 11:20, 21</A>);

 and Saul probably acted on this principle from the first, both in 
 Arabia and in Syria and Cilicia. But had he been the prime mover in the 
 admission of uncircumcised Gentiles into the Church, the Jewish party, 
 who were never friendly to him, would have acquired such strength as to 
 bring the Church to the verge of a disastrous schism. But on Peter, 
 "the apostle" specially "of the circumcision," was conferred the honor 
 of initiating this great movement, as before of the first admission of 
 Jewish believers.  (See on

 <A HREF="JFB40.htm#Mt16_19">Mt 16:19</A>). 

 After this, however, one who had already come upon the stage was to 
 eclipse this "chiefest of the apostles."</P>

 this was after the hasty despatch of Saul to Tarsus, no doubt by
 Barnabas himself among others, to escape the fury of the Jews at
 Jerusalem. And as Barnabas was the first to take the converted
 persecutor by the hand and procure his recognition as a disciple by the
 brethren at Jerusalem 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:27">Ac 9:27</A>),

 so he alone seems at that early period to have discerned in him those
 peculiar endowments by virtue of which he was afterwards to eclipse all
 others. Accordingly, instead of returning to Jerusalem, to which, no
 doubt, he sent accounts of his proceedings from time to time, finding
 that the mine in Antioch was rich in promise and required an additional
 and powerful hand to work, he leaves it for a time, takes a journey to
 Tarsus, "finds Saul" (seemingly implying--not that he lay hid [B<FONT

 preaching circuit--see on

 and returns with him to Antioch. Nor were his hopes disappointed. As 
 co-pastors, for the time being, of the Church there, they so labored 
 that the Gospel, even in that great and many-sided community, achieved 
 for itself a name which will live and be gloried in as long as this 
 world lasts, as the symbol of all that is most precious to the fallen 
 family of man:--"<I>The disciples were called</I> C<FONT

 A grievous loss this would be to the Church; for though nothing is 
 known of him beyond what we read in the Gospels, the place which he had 
 as one of the three whom the Lord admitted to His closest intimacy 
 would lead the Church to look up to him with a reverence and affection 
 which even their enemies would come to hear of. They could spring only

 wrist of their fight hand, and at the other to the wrist of a soldier's 
 left hand, leaving the right arm of the keeper free in case of any 
 attempt to escape. For greater security the prisoner was sometimes, as
 here, chained to two soldiers, one on each side. (See

 Ye think your prey secure, bloodthirsty priests and thou obsequious
 tyrant who, to "please the Jews," hast shut in this most eminent of the 
 servants of Christ within double gates, guarded by double sentinels, 
 while double keepers and double chains seem to defy all rescue! So 
 thought the chief priests, who "made the sepulchre of the Lord sure, 
 sealing the stone and setting a watch." But "He that sitteth in heaven 
 shall laugh at you." Meanwhile, "Peter is sleeping!" In a few hours he 
 expects a stingless death; "neither counts he his life dear unto him, 
 so that he may finish his course with joy and the ministry which he has 
 received of the Lord Jesus." In this frame of spirit he has dropped

 "believed not <I>for joy</I> and wondered" at the tidings of their 
 Lord's resurrection.  How often do we pray for what we can hardly 
 credit the bestowment of, when it comes in answer to our prayers! This, 
 however, argues not so much hard unbelief as that kind of it incident

 did these two foster brothers turn out--the one, abandoned to a 
 licentious life and stained with the blood of the most distinguished of 
 God's prophets, though not without his fits of reformation and seasons 
 of remorse; the other, a devoted disciple of the Lord Jesus and prophet

 seen in clear weather from the coast [C<FONT SIZE=-1>OLONEL</FONT>

 reasons may have induced them to turn in first to this island: (1) Its
 nearness to the mainland; (2) It was the native place of Barnabas, and
 since the time when Andrew found his brother Simon, and brought him to
 Jesus, and "Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus," family
 ties had not been without effect on the progress of the Gospel. (3) It
 could not be unnatural to suppose that the truth would be welcomed in
 Cyprus when brought by Barnabas and his kinsman Mark, to their own
 connections or friends. The Jews were numerous in Salamis. By sailing
 to that city, they were following the track of the synagogues; and
 though their mission was chiefly to the Gentiles, their surest course
 for reaching them was through the proselytes and Hellenizing Jews. (4)
 Some of the Cypriotes were already Christians. Indeed, no one place
 out of Palestine, except Antioch, had been so honorably associated with
 the work of successful evangelization" [H<FONT SIZE=-1>OWSON</FONT>].</P>

 on the eastern side, and not many hours' sail from Seleucia. At this
 busy mercantile port immense numbers of Jews were settled, which
 accounts for what is here said, that they had more than one synagogue,
 in which Barnabas and Saul preached, while other cities had one only.

 under the Roman Senate, and is never given in the New Testament to
 Pilate, Felix, or Festus, who were but <I>procurators,</I> or subordinate
 administrators of unsettled, imperial, military provinces. Now as
 Augustus reserved Cyprus for himself, its governor would in that case
 have been not a proconsul, but simply a procurator, had not the emperor
 afterwards restored it to the Senate, as a Roman historian [D<FONT SIZE=-1>IO</FONT>

 sailing in a northwest direction, is not much greater than from 
 Seleucia to Salamis on the east. Perga was the metropolis of Pamphylia, 
 on the river Cestrus, and about seven miles inland from Attalia.

 not gone with them to the work" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:38">Ac 15:38</A>),

 there can be no doubt that he had either wearied of it or been deterred

 <B>came to Antioch in Pisidia</B>--usually so called, to distinguish it
 from Antioch in Syria, from which they had started, though it actually
 lies in Phrygia, and almost due north from Perga. It was a long journey,
 and as it lay almost entirely through rugged mountain passes, while
 "rivers burst out at the base of huge cliffs, or dash down wildly
 through narrow ravines," it must have been a perilous one. The whole
 region was, and to this day is, infested by robbers, as ancient history
 and modern travels abundantly attest; and there can be but little doubt
 that to this very journey Paul many years after alludes, when he speaks
 amidst his "journeyings often," of his "<I>perils of rivers</I>"
 (as the word is),

 If this journey were taken in May--and earlier than that the passes 
 would have been blocked up with snow--it would account for their not 
 staying at Perga, whose hot streets are then deserted; "men, women, and 
 children, flocks, herds, camels, and asses, all ascending at the 
 beginning of the hot season from the plains to the cool basin-like

 contradict

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:1">1Ki 6:1</A>,

 various solutions have been proposed. Taking the words as they stand in 
 the <I>Greek,</I> thus, "after that, by the space of four hundred fifty 
 years, He gave judges," the meaning may be, that about four hundred 
 fifty years elapsed from the time of the covenant with Abraham 
 <I>until</I> the period of the judges; which is historically correct, 
 the word "about" showing that chronological exactness was not aimed at. 
 But taking the sense to be as in our version, that it was the period of 
 the judges itself which lasted about four hundred fifty years, this 
 statement also will appear historically correct, if we include in it 
 the interval of subjection to foreign powers which occurred during the 
 period of the judges, and understand it to describe the whole period 
 from the settlement of the tribes in Canaan to the establishment of 
 royalty. Thus, from the Exodus to the building of the temple were five 
 hundred ninety-two years [J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>,

 twenty-five years of Joshua's rule [J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:3">Isa 55:3</A>).

 The word rendered "mercies" is peculiar, denoting the <I>sanctity</I>
 of them, as comprehending the whole riches of the new covenant; while 
 the other word, "sure," points to the <I>certainty</I> with which they 
 would, through David's Seed, be at length all substantiated.  See on

 <A HREF="JFB43.htm#Joh1_14">Joh 1:14</A>.

 But how do these words prove the resurrection of Christ? "They 
 presuppose it; for since an eternal kingdom was promised to David, the 
 Ruler of this kingdom could not remain under the power of death. But to 
 strengthen the indefinite prediction by one more definite, the apostle 
 adduces

 God's own heart." This done, he "fell asleep, and was gathered to his
 fathers, and saw corruption." David, therefore (argues the apostle),

 justifies from nothing." (<I>Note.</I>--The deeper sense of justification,
 the <I>positive</I> side of it, is reserved for the Epistles, addressed to
 the justified themselves: and whereas it is the <I>resurrection</I> of

 Jews and proselytes, to whom the discourse had been addressed, entreated
 to have another hearing of such truths; those of them, that is, who had

 <B>21, 22. they returned .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, confirming
 the souls,</B> &c.--At Derbe, Paul was not far from the well-known pass
 which leads down from the central tableland to Cilicia and Tarsus. But
 his thoughts did not center in an earthly home. He revisited the places
 where he had been reviled and persecuted, but where he had left as sheep
 in the desert the disciples whom his Master had enabled him to gather.
 They needed building up and strengthening in the faith, comforting in
 the midst of their inevitable suffering, and fencing round by permanent
 institutions. Undaunted therefore by the dangers that awaited them, our
 missionaries return to them, using words of encouragement which none but
 the founders of a true religion would have ventured to address to their
 earliest converts, that "we can only enter into the kingdom of God by
 passing through much tribulation" [H<FONT SIZE=-1>OWSON</FONT>].</P>

 <B>23, 24. when they had ordained them elders</B>--literally, "chosen by show
 of hands." But as that would imply that this was done by the apostles'
 own hands, many render the word, as in our version, "ordained." Still,
 as there is no evidence in the New Testament that the word had then lost
 its proper meaning, as this is beyond doubt its meaning in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:19">2Co 8:19</A>,
 
 and as there is indisputable evidence that the concurrence of the people
 was required in all elections to sacred office in the earliest ages of
 the Church, it is perhaps better to understand the words to mean, "when
 they had made a choice of elders," that is, superintended such choice on
 the part of the disciples.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and had prayed with fasting</B>--literally, "fastings," thus setting them

 peaceful, though laborious life at Antioch, but that his true work was
 far off among the Gentiles." We notice here, for the first time, a trace
 of that tender solicitude for his converts, that earnest longing to see
 their faces, which appears in the letters which he wrote afterwards, as
 one of the most remarkable and attractive features of his character. He
 thought, doubtless, of the Pisidians and Lycaonians, as he thought
 afterwards at Athens and Corinth of the Thessalonians, from whom he had
 been lately "taken in presence, not in heart, night and day praying
 exceedingly that he might see their face and perfect that which was

 them. The allusion is to what is recorded in

 to the Lystrians that they were "men of like passions with them";

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:15">Ac 14:15</A>).

 But <I>who was to blame?</I> (1) That John Mark had either tired of the 
 work or shrunk from the dangers and fatigues that yet lay before them, 
 was undeniable; and Paul concluded that what he had done he might, and 
 probably would, do again. Was he wrong in this? (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:19">Pr 25:19</A>).

 But (2) To this Barnabas might reply that no rule was without 
 exception; that one failure, in a young Christian, was not enough to 
 condemn him for life; that if near relationship might be thought to 
 warp his judgment, it also gave him opportunities of knowing the man 
 better than others; and that as he was himself anxious to be allowed 
 another trial (and the result makes this next to certain), in order 
 that he might wipe out the effect of his former failure and show what 
 "hardness he could now endure as a good soldier of Jesus Christ," his 
 petition ought not to be rejected. Now, since John Mark <I>did</I> 
 retrieve his character in these respects, and a reconciliation took 
 place between Paul and him, so cordial that the apostle expresses more 
 than once the confidence he had in him and the value he set upon his 
 services

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:10,11,2Ti+4:11">Col 4:10, 11;
 2Ti 4:11</A>), 

 it may seem that events showed Barnabas to be in the right, and Paul
 too harsh and hasty in his judgment. But, in behalf of Paul, it may 
 well be answered, that not being able to see into the future he had 
 only the unfavorable past to judge by; that the gentleness of Barnabas

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:36,11:24">Ac 4:36; 11:24</A>)

 had already laid him open to imposition (see on

 <A HREF="JFB48.htm#Ga2_13">Ga 2:13</A>), 

 to which near relationship would in this case make him more liable; and 
 that in refusing to take John Mark on this missionary journey he was 
 not judging his Christian character nor pronouncing on his fitness for 
 future service, but merely providing in the meantime against being 
 again put to serious inconvenience and having their hands weakened by a 
 possible second desertion. On the whole, then, it seems clear that each 
 of these great servants of--Christ had something to say for himself, in 
 defense of the position which they respectively took up; that while 
 Barnabas was quite able to appreciate the grounds on which Paul 
 proceeded, Paul was not so competent to judge of the considerations 
 which Barnabas probably urged; that while Paul had but one object in 
 view, to see that the companion of their arduous work was one of 
 thoroughly congenial spirit and sufficient nerve, Barnabas, over and 
 above the same desire, might not unreasonably be afraid for the soul of 
 his nephew, lest the refusal to allow him to accompany them on their 
 journey might injure his Christian character and deprive the Church of 
 a true servant of Jesus Christ; and that while both sought only the 
 glory of their common Master, each looked at the question at issue, to 
 some extent, through the medium of his own temperament, which grace 
 sanctifies and refines, but does not destroy--<I>Paul,</I> through the 
 medium of absolute devotion to the cause and kingdom of Christ, which, 
 warm and womanly as his affections were, gave a tinge of lofty 
 sternness to his resolves where that seemed to be affected;
 <I>Barnabas,</I> through the medium of the same singleness of heart in
 Christ's service, though probably not in equal strength

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:13">Ga 2:13</A>),

 but also of a certain natural gentleness which, where a Christian
 relative was concerned, led him to attach more weight to what seemed 
 for his spiritual good than Paul could be supposed to do.  In these 
 circumstances, it seems quite possible that they might have amicably 
 "agreed to differ," each taking his own companion, as they actually 
 did. But the "paroxysm" (as the word is), the "exacerbation" which is 
 expressly given as the cause of their parting, shows but too plainly, 
 that human infirmity amidst the great labors of the Church at Antioch 
 at length sundered those who had sweetly and lovingly borne together 
 the heat and burden of the day during a protracted tour in the service 
 of Christ. "Therefore let no man glory in men"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:21">1Co 3:21</A>).

 As for John Mark, although through his uncle's warm advocacy of his 
 cause he was put in a condition to dissipate the cloud that hung over 
 him, how bitter to him must have ever afterwards been the reflection 
 that it was his culpable conduct which gave occasion to whatever was 
 sinful in the strife between Paul and Barnabas, and to a separation in 
 action, though no doubt with a mutual Christian regard, between those 
 who had till then wrought nobly together! How watchful does all this 
 teach Christians, and especially Christian ministers and missionaries, 
 to be against giving way to rash judgment and hot temper towards each 
 other, especially where on both sides the glory of Christ is the ground 
 of difference! How possible is it that in such cases both parties may, 
 on the question at issue, be more or less in the right! How difficult 
 is it even for the most faithful and devoted servants of Christ, 
 differing as they do in their natural temperament even under the 
 commanding influence of grace, to see even important questions 
 precisely in the same light! And if, with every disposition to yield 
 what is unimportant, they still feel it a duty each to stand to his own 
 point, how careful should they be to do it lovingly, each pursuing his 
 own course without disparagement of his Christian brother! And how 
 affectingly does the Lord overrule such difference of judgment and such 
 manifestations of human infirmity, by making them "turn out rather unto 
 the furtherance of the Gospel"; as in this case is eminently seen in 
 the two missionary parties instead of one, not travelling over the same 
 ground and carrying their dispute over all the regions of their former 
 loving labors, but dividing the field between them!

 churches</B>--"It is very likely that Paul and Barnabas made a 
 deliberate and amicable arrangement to divide the region of their first 
 mission between them; Paul taking the <I>continental,</I> and Barnabas 
 the <I>insular,</I> part of the proposed visitation. If Barnabas 
 visited Salamis and Paphos, and if Paul (travelling westward), after 
 passing through Derbe, Lystra, and Iconium, went as far as Antioch in 
 Pisidia, the whole circuit of the proposed visitation was actually 
 accomplished, for it does not appear that any converts had been made at 
 Perga and Attalia" [H<FONT SIZE=-1>OWSON</FONT>]. "This second 
 missionary tour appears to have proceeded at first solely from the 
 desire of visiting the churches already planted. In the end, however, 
 it took a much wider sweep, for it brought the apostle to Europe"

 Taking probably the same route as when despatched in haste from
 Jerusalem to Tarsus, he then went by land (see on

 <A NAME="Ac16_1"> </A>

 <B>1-5. Then came he to Derbe and Lystra; and, behold, a certain disciple
 was there</B>--that is, at Lystra (not Derbe, as some conclude from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:4">Ac 20:4</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>named Timotheus</B>--(See on

 <A HREF="#Ac14_20">Ac 14:20</A>). 

 As Paul styles him "his own son in the faith"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:2">1Ti 1:2</A>),

 he must have been gained to Christ at the apostle's first visit; and as 
 Paul says he "had fully known his persecutions which came on him at 
 Lystra"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:10,11">2Ti 3:10, 11</A>),

 he may have been in that group of disciples that surrounded the 
 apparently lifeless body of the apostle outside the walls of Lystra, 
 and that at a time of life when the mind receives its deepest 
 impressions from the spectacle of innocent suffering and undaunted 
 courage [H<FONT SIZE=-1>OWSON</FONT>]. His would be one of "the souls 
 of the disciples confirmed" at the apostle's second visit, "exhorted to 
 continue in the faith, and" warned "that we must through much 
 tribulation enter into the kingdom of God"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:21,22">Ac 14:21, 22</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the son of a certain .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Jewess</B>--"The unfeigned
 faith which dwelt first in his grandmother Lois" descended to "his 
 mother Eunice," and thence it passed to this youth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:5">2Ti 1:5</A>),

 who "from a child knew the Holy Scriptures"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:15">2Ti 3:15</A>).

 His gifts and destination to the ministry of Christ had already been
 attested

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:18,4:14">1Ti 1:18; 4:14</A>);

 and though some ten years after this Paul speaks of him as still young

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:12">1Ti 4:12</A>),

 "he was already well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra 
 and Iconium"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:2">Ac 16:2</A>),

 and consequently must have been well known through all that quarter.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but his father was a Greek</B>--Such mixed marriages, though little
 practiced, and disliked by the stricter Jews in Palestine, must have
 been very frequent among the Jews of the dispersion, especially in
 remote districts, where but few of the scattered people were settled
 [H<FONT SIZE=-1>OWSON</FONT>].</P>

 <B>3. Him would Paul have to go forth with him</B>--This is in harmony with
 all we read in the Acts and Epistles of Paul's affectionate and
 confiding disposition. He had no relative ties which were of service to
 him in his work; his companions were few and changing; and though Silas
 would supply the place of Barnabas, it was no weakness to yearn for the
 society of one who might become, what Mark once appeared to be, a
 <I>son</I> in the Gospel
 [H<FONT SIZE=-1>OWSON</FONT>]. And such he indeed proved to be, the
 most attached and serviceable of his associates

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:19-23,1Co+4:17,16:10,11,1Th+3:1-6">Php 2:19-23;
 1Co 4:17; 16:10, 11; 
 1Th 3:1-6</A>). 

 His double connection, with the Jews by the mother's side and the
 Gentiles by the father's, would strike the apostle as a peculiar 
 qualification for his own sphere of labor. "So far as appears, Timothy 
 is the first Gentile who after his conversion comes before us as a 
 regular missionary; for what is said of Titus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:3">Ga 2:3</A>)

 refers to a later period" 
 [W<FONT SIZE=-1>IES</FONT>]. 
 But before his departure, Paul

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>took and circumcised him</B>--a rite which every Israelite might perform.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>because of the Jews .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for they knew all that his
 father was a Greek</B>--This seems to imply that the father was no 
 proselyte. Against the wishes of a Gentile father no Jewish mother was, 
 as the Jews themselves say, permitted to circumcise her son. We thus 
 see why all the religion of Timothy is traced to the female side of the 
 family

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:5">2Ti 1:5</A>).

 "Had Timothy not been circumcised, a storm would have gathered round
 the apostle in his farther progress. His fixed line of procedure was to 
 act on the cities through the synagogues; and to preach the Gospel to 
 the Jew first and then to the Gentile. But such a course would have 
 been impossible had not Timothy been circumcised. He must necessarily 
 have been repelled by that people who endeavored once to murder Paul 
 because they imagined he had taken a Greek into the temple

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:29">Ac 21:29</A>).

 The very intercourse of social life would have been almost impossible, 
 for it was still "an abomination" for the circumcised to eat with the 
 uncircumcised" [H<FONT SIZE=-1>OWSON</FONT>]. In refusing to compel 
 Titus afterwards to be circumcised

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:3">Ga 2:3</A>)

 at the bidding of Judaizing Christians, as necessary to salvation, he 
 only vindicated "the truth of the Gospel"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:5">Ga 2:5</A>);

 in circumcising Timothy, "to the Jews he became as a Jew that he might 
 gain the Jews." Probably Timothy's ordination took place now

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:14,2Ti+1:6">1Ti 4:14;
 2Ti 1:6</A>); 

 and it was a service, apparently, of much solemnity--"before many
 witnesses"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:12">1Ti 6:12</A>).</P>

 Galatia</B>--proceeding in a northwesterly direction. At this time must
 have been formed "the churches of Galatia" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:2,1Co+16:1">Ga 1:2;

 founded, as we learn from the Epistle to the Galatians (particularly

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:19">Ga 4:19</A>),
 
 by the apostle Paul, and which were already in existence when he was on
 his <I>third</I> missionary journey, as we learn from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:23">Ac 18:23</A>,

 where it appears that he was no less successful in Phrygia. <I>Why</I>
 these proceedings, so interesting as we should suppose, are not here 
 detailed, it is not easy to say; for the various reasons suggested are 
 not very satisfactory: for example, that the historian had not joined 
 the party [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]; that he was in haste to bring 
 the apostle to Europe [O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT>]; that the main 
 stream of the Church's development was from Jerusalem to Rome, and the 
 apostle's labors in Phrygia and Galatia lay quite out of the line of 
 that direction [B<FONT SIZE=-1>AUMGARTEN</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost</B>--speaking by some prophet,

 they were forbidden to labor

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>they assayed</B>--or attempted

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>to go into</B>--or, towards.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Bithynia</B>--to the northeast.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but the Spirit</B>--speaking as before.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>suffered them not</B>--probably because, (1) Europe was ripe for the 
 labors of this missionary party; and (2) other instruments were to be 
 honored to establish the Gospel in the eastern regions of Asia Minor,
 especially the apostle Peter (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:1">1Pe 1:1</A>).

 By the end of the first century, as testified by 
 P<FONT SIZE=-1>LINY</FONT> 
 the governor, Bithynia was filled with Christians.  "This is the first
 time that the Holy Ghost is expressly spoken of as determining the 
 course they were to follow in their efforts to evangelize the nations, 
 and it was evidently designed to show that whereas hitherto the 
 diffusion of the Gospel had been carried on in unbroken course, 
 connected by natural points of junction, it was now to take a leap to 
 which it could not be impelled but by an immediate and independent 
 operation of the Spirit; and though primarily, this intimation of the 
 Spirit was only negative, and referred but to the immediate 
 neighborhood, we may certainly conclude that Paul took it for a sign 
 that a new epoch was now to commence in his apostolic labors" [B<FONT

 <B>8. came down to Troas</B>--a city on the northeast coast of the &AElig;gean Sea,

 scene of the great Trojan war.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>9, 10. a vision appeared to Paul in the night</B>--while awake, for it
 is not called a dream.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over 
 into Macedonia, and help us</B>--Stretching his eye across the 
 &AElig;gean Sea, from Troas on the northeast, to the Macedonian hills, 
 visible on the northwest, the apostle could hardly fail to think this 
 the destined scene of his future labors; and, if he retired to rest 
 with this thought, he would be thoroughly prepared for the remarkable 
 intimation of the divine will now to be given him. This visional 
 Macedonian discovered himself by what he said. But it was a cry not of 
 conscious <I>desire</I> for the Gospel, but of deep <I>need</I> of it 
 and unconscious <I>preparedness</I> to receive it, not only in that 
 region, but, we may well say, throughout all that western empire which 
 Macedonia might be said to represent. It was a virtual confession "that 
 the highest splendor of heathendom, which we must recognize in the arts 
 of Greece and in the polity and imperial power of Rome, had arrived at 
 the end of all its resources. God had left the Gentile peoples to walk
 in their own ways

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:2">Ac 14:2</A>).

 They had sought to gain salvation for themselves; but those who had 
 carried it farthest along the paths of natural development were now 
 pervaded by the feeling that all had indeed been vanity. This feeling 
 is the simple, pure result of all the history of heathendom. And 
 Israel, going along the way which God had marked out for him, had 
 likewise arrived at his end. At last he is in a condition to realize 
 his original vocation, by becoming the guide who is to lead the 
 Gentiles unto God, the only Author and Creator of man's redemption; and 
 Paul is in truth the very person in whom this vocation of Israel is now 
 a present divine reality, and to whom, by this nocturnal apparition of 
 the Macedonian, the preparedness of the heathen world to receive the 
 ministry of Israel towards the Gentiles is confirmed" [B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>AUMGARTEN</FONT>].  <I>This voice cries from heathendom still 
 to the Christian Church, and never does the Church undertake the work 
 of missions, nor any missionary go forth from it, in the right spirit, 
 save in obedience to this cry.</I></P>

 <B>10. And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go
 into Macedonia</B>--The "we," here first introduced, is a modest intimation
 that the historian himself had now joined the missionary party. (The
 modern objections to this are quite frivolous). Whether Paul's broken
 health had anything to do with this arrangement for having "the beloved
 physician" with him [W<FONT SIZE=-1>IES</FONT>], can never be known with certainty; but that
 he would deem himself honored in taking care of so precious a life,

 <B>that she attended to the things .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. spoken by Paul</B>--"showing that
 the inclination of the heart towards the truth originates not in the
 will of man. The first disposition to turn to the Gospel is a work of
 grace" [O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT>]. Observe here the place assigned to "giving
 attention" or "heed" to the truth--that species of attention which
 consists in having the whole mind engrossed with it, and in apprehending
 and drinking it in, in its vital and saving character.</P>

 <B>15. And when .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. baptized .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and her household</B>--probably without
 much delay. The mention of baptism here for the first time in connection
 with the labors of Paul, while it was doubtless performed on all his
 former converts, indicates a special importance in this first European
 baptism. Here also is the first mention of a Christian <I>household.</I>
 Whether it included children, also in that case baptized, is not
 explicitly stated; but the presumption, as in other cases of household
 baptism, is that it did. Yet the question of infant baptism must be
 determined on other grounds; and such incidental allusions form only
 part of the historical materials for ascertaining the practice of the
 Church.

 <B>she besought <I>us,</I> saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the
 Lord</B>--the Lord Jesus; that is, "By the faith on Him which ye have
 recognized in me by baptism." There is a beautiful modesty in the
 expression.

 occurred.

 There is some color of truth in all such accusations, in so far as the
 Gospel, and generally the fear of God, as a reigning principle of human 
 action, is in a godless world a thoroughly <I>revolutionary</I> 
 principle .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How far external commotion and change will in 
 any case attend the triumph of this principle depends on the breadth

 to observe, being Romans</B>--Here also there was a measure of truth; as
 the introduction of new gods was forbidden by the laws, and this might
 be thought to apply to any change of religion. But the whole charge was
 pure hypocrisy; for as these men would have let the missionaries preach
 what religion they pleased if they had not dried up the source of their
 gains, so they conceal the real cause of their rage under color of a
 zeal for religion, and law, and good order: so

 feet, which were stretched more or less apart according to the severity
 intended. (O<FONT SIZE=-1>RIGEN</FONT> at a later period, besides having his neck thrust into
 an iron collar, lay extended for many days with his feet apart in the
 rack). Though jailers were proverbially unfeeling, the manner in which

 done.</P>

 <B>25. And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises</B>--literally,
 "praying, were singing praises"; that is, while engaged in pouring out
 their hearts in prayer, had broken forth into singing, and were hymning
 loud their joy. As the word here employed is that used to denote the
 Paschal hymn sung by our Lord and His disciples after their last
 Passover 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:30">Mt 26:30</A>),
 
 and which we know to have consisted of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:1-118:29">Ps 113:1-118:29</A>,

 which was chanted at that festival, it is probable that it was portions 
 of the Psalms, so rich in such matter, which our joyous sufferers 
 chanted forth; nor could any be more seasonable and inspiring to them 
 than those very six Psalms, which every devout Jew would no doubt know 
 by heart. "<I>He giveth songs in the night</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+35:10">Job 35:10</A>).

 Though their bodies were still bleeding and tortured in the stocks, 
 their spirits, under "the expulsive power of a new affection," rose 
 above suffering, and made the prison wails resound with their song. "In 
 these midnight hymns, by the imprisoned witnesses for Jesus Christ, the 
 whole might of Roman injustice and violence against the Church is not 
 only set at naught, but converted into a foil to set forth more 
 completely the majesty and spiritual power of the Church, which as yet 
 the world knew nothing of. And if the sufferings of these two witnesses 
 of Christ are the beginning and the type of numberless martyrdoms which 
 were to flow upon the Church from the same source, in like manner the 
 unparalleled triumph of the Spirit over suffering was the beginning and 
 the pledge of a spiritual power which we afterwards see shining forth 
 so triumphantly and irresistibly in the many martyrs of Christ who were 
 given up as a prey to the same imperial might of Rome" [N<FONT

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and the prisoners heard them</B>--literally, "were listening to them,"
 that is, when the astounding events immediately to be related took
 place; not asleep, but wide awake and rapt (no doubt) in wonder at what
 they heard.</P>

 to the prayers and expectations of the sufferers that, for the truth's
 sake and the honor of their Lord, some interposition would take place.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>every one's bands</B>--that is, the bands of all the prisoners.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>were loosed</B>--not by the earthquake, of course, but by a miraculous
 energy accompanying it. By this and the joyous strains which they had
 heard from the sufferers, not to speak of the change wrought on the
 jailer, these prisoners could hardly fail to have their hearts in some
 measure opened to the truth; and this part of the narrative seems the
 result of information afterwards communicated by one or more of these
 men.</P>

 <B>28. But Paul cried with a loud voice</B>--the better to arrest the deed.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Do thyself no harm, for we are all here</B>--What divine calmness and
 self-possession! No elation at their miraculous liberation, or haste to
 take advantage of it; but one thought filled the apostle's mind at that
 moment--anxiety to save a fellow creature from sending himself into
 eternity, ignorant of the only way of life; and his presence of mind
 appears in the assurance which he so promptly gives to the desperate
 man, that his prisoners had none of them fled as he feared. But how, it
 has been asked by skeptical critics, could Paul in his inner prison know
 what the jailer was about to do? In many conceivable ways, without
 supposing any supernatural communication. Thus, if the jailer slept at
 the door of "the inner prison," which suddenly flew open when the
 earthquake shook the foundations of the building; if, too, as may easily
 be conceived, he uttered some cry of despair on seeing the doors open;
 and, if the clash of the steel, as the affrighted man drew it hastily
 from the scabbard, was audible but a few yards off, in the dead midnight
 stillness, increased by the awe inspired in the prisoners by the
 miracle--what difficulty is there in supposing that Paul, perceiving in
 a moment how matters stood, after crying out, stepped hastily to him,
 uttering the noble entreaty here recorded? Not less flat is the
 question, why the other liberated prisoners did not make their
 escape:--as if there were the smallest difficulty in understanding how,
 under the resistless conviction that there must be something
 supernatural in their instantaneous liberation without human hand, such
 wonder and awe should possess them as to take away for the time not only
 all desire of escape, but even all thought on the subject.</P>

 <B>29, 30. Then he called for a light, and sprang in .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and fell down
 before Paul and Silas, and brought them out and said</B>--How graphic this
 rapid succession of minute details, evidently from the parties
 themselves, the prisoners and the jailer, who would talk over every
 feature of the scene once and again, in which the hand of the Lord had
 been so marvellously seen.</P>

 <A NAME="Ac16_30"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>30. Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</B>--If this question should 
 seem in advance of any light which the jailer could be supposed to 
 possess, let it be considered (1) that the "trembling" which came over 
 him could not have arisen from any fear for the safety of his 
 prisoners, for they were all there; and if it had, he would rather have 
 proceeded to secure them again than leave them, to fall down before 
 Paul and Silas. For the same reason it is plain that his trembling had 
 nothing to do with any account he would have to render to the 
 magistrates. Only one explanation of it can be given--that he had 
 become all at once alarmed about his spiritual state, and that though, 
 a moment before, he was ready to plunge into eternity with the guilt of 
 self-murder on his head, without a thought of the sin he was committing 
 and its awful consequences, his unfitness to appear before God, and his 
 need of salvation, now flashed full upon his soul and drew from the 
 depths of his spirit the cry here recorded. If still it be asked how it 
 could take such definite shape, let it be considered (2) that the 
 jailer could hardly be ignorant of the nature of the charges on which 
 these men had been imprisoned, seeing they had been publicly whipped by 
 order of the magistrates, which would fill the whole town with the 
 facts of the case, including that strange cry of the demoniac from day 
 to-day--"These men are the servants of the most high God, which <I>show 
 unto us the way of salvation</I>"--words proclaiming not only the 
 divine commission of the preachers, but the news of salvation they were 
 sent to tell, the miraculous expulsion of the demon and the rage of her 
 masters. All this, indeed, would go for nothing with such a man, until 
 roused by the mighty earthquake which made the building to rock; then 
 despair seizing him at the sight of the open doors, the sword of 
 self-destruction was suddenly arrested by words from one of those 
 prisoners such as he would never imagine could be spoken in their 
 circumstances--words evidencing something divine about them. Then would 
 flash across him the light of a new discovery; "That was a true cry 
 which the Pythoness uttered, 'These men are the servants of the most 
 high God, which show unto us the way of salvation! That I now must 
 know, and from them, as divinely sent to me, must I learn that way of 
 salvation!'" Substantially, this is the cry of every awakened sinner, 
 though the degree of light and the depths of anxiety it expresses will 
 be different in each case.</P>

 <B>31-34. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved</B>--The
 brevity, simplicity, and directness of this reply are, in the
 circumstances, singularly beautiful. Enough at that moment to have his
 faith directed simply to the Saviour, with the assurance that this would
 bring to his soul the needed and sought salvation--the <I>how</I> being a
 matter for after teaching.

 him.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and to all that were in his house</B>--who from their own dwelling (under
 the same roof no doubt with the prison) had crowded round the apostles,
 aroused first by the earthquake. (From their addressing the Gospel
 message "to all that were in the house" it is not necessary to infer
 that it contained no children, but merely that as it contained adults
 besides the jailer himself, so to all of these, as alone of course fit
 to be addressed, they preached the word).</P>

 or fountain which was within or near the precincts of the prison
 [H<FONT SIZE=-1>OWSON</FONT>]. The mention of "the same hour of the night" seems to imply
 that they had to go forth into the open air, which, unseasonable as the
 hour was, they did. These bleeding wounds had never been thought of by
 the indifferent jailer. But now, when his whole heart was opened to his
 spiritual benefactors, he cannot rest until he has done all in his
 power for their bodily relief.

 filling his soul with joy. "This is the second house which, in the Roman
 city of Philippi, has been consecrated by faith in Jesus, and of which
 the inmates, by hospitable entertainment of the Gospel witnesses, have
 been sanctified to a new beginning of domestic life, pleasing and
 acceptable to God. The first result came to pass in consequence simply
 of the preaching of the Gospel; the second was the fruit of a testimony

 When the commotion ceased, reflection would soon convince them of the
 injustice they had done, even supposing the prisoners had been entitled
 to no special privileges; and if rumor reached them that the prisoners

 Thessalonians, probably a year after: "Even after we had suffered 
 before, and <I>were shamefully entreated</I> (or 'insulted') as ye know

 need hardly be pointed out. We shall trace him again when he rejoins
 Paul in the same neighborhood. His vocation as a physician may have

 How long he stayed at Berea we know not; but as we know that he longed 
 and expected soon to return to the Thessalonians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:17">1Th 2:17</A>),

 it is probable he remained some weeks at least, and only abandoned his 
 intention of revisiting Thessalonica at that time when the virulence of 
 his enemies there, stimulated by his success at Berea, brought them 
 down thither to counterwork him.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>to go as it were to the sea</B>--rather, perhaps, "in the direction of
 the sea." Probably he delayed fixing his next destination till he should
 reach the coast, and the providence of God should guide him to a vessel
 bound for the destined spot. Accordingly, it was only on arriving at
 Athens, that the convoy of Berean brethren, who had gone thus far with
 him, were sent back to bid Silas and Timothy follow him thither.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Silas and Timotheus abode there still</B>--"to build it up in its 
 holy faith, to be a comfort and support in its trials and persecutions, 
 and to give it such organization as might be necessary" [H<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OWSON</FONT>]. Connecting this with the apostle's leaving 
 Timothy and Luke at Philippi on his own departure (see on

 <A HREF="#Ac16_40">Ac 16:40</A>),

 we may conclude that this was his fixed plan for cherishing the first 
 beginning of the Gospel in European localities, and organizing the 
 converts. Timotheus must have soon followed the apostle to 
 Thessalonica, the bearer, probably, of one of the Philippian 
 "contributions to his necessity"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:15,16">Php 4:15, 16</A>),

 <B>15. Silas and Timotheus to come to him with all speed</B>--He probably
 wished their company and aid in addressing himself to so new and great a
 sphere as Athens. Accordingly it is added that he "waited for them"
 there, as if unwilling to do anything till they came. That they did
 come, there is no good reason to doubt (as some excellent critics do).
 For though Paul himself says to the Thessalonians that he "thought it
 good to be left at Athens alone" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:1">1Th 3:1</A>),

 he immediately adds that he "sent Timotheus to establish and comfort 
 them"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:2">Ac 17:2</A>);

 meaning, surely, that he despatched him from Athens back to 
 Thessalonica. He had indeed sent for him to Athens; but, probably, when 
 it appeared that little fruit was to be reaped there, while 
 Thessalonica was in too interesting a state to be left uncherished, he 
 seems to have thought it better to send him back again. (The other 
 explanations which have been suggested seem less satisfactory).

 court, says satirically that it was easier to find a god at Athens than
 a man. This "stirred the spirit" of the apostle. "The first impression
 which the masterpieces of man's taste for art left on the mind of St.
 Paul was a revolting one, since all this majesty and beauty had placed
 itself between man and his Creator, and bound him the faster to his
 gods, who were not God. Upon the first contact, therefore, which the
 Spirit of Christ came into with the sublimest creations of human art,
 the judgment of the Holy Ghost--through which they have all to pass--is
 set up as "the strait gate," and this must remain the correct standard

 called the Deity: and that a passionless conformity of the human will to
 this law, unmoved by all external circumstances and changes, is the
 perfection of virtue. While therefore the Stoical was in itself
 superior to the Epicurean system, both were alike hostile to the Gospel.

 conciliatory and commendatory introduction, founded on his own
 observation of the symbols of devotion with which their city was
 covered, and from which all Greek writers, as well as the apostle,
 inferred the exemplary religiousness of the Athenians. (The authorized
 translation would imply that only <I>too much</I> superstition was wrong,

 predecessor by about three centuries. But, as he hints, the same
 sentiment is to be found in other Greek poets. They meant it doubtless
 in a <I>pantheistic</I> sense; but the truth which it expresses the apostle
 turns to his own purpose--to teach a pure, personal, spiritual Theism.

 hardly doubt that the apostle would here point to those matchless
 monuments of the plastic art, in gold and silver and costliest stone,
 which lay so profusely beneath and around him. The more intelligent
 pagan Greeks no more pretended that these sculptured gods and goddesses
 were real deities, or even their actual likenesses, than Romanist
 Christians do their images; and Paul doubtless knew this; yet here we
 find him condemning all such efforts visibly to represent the invisible
 God. How shamefully inexcusable then are the Greek and Roman churches in
 paganizing the worship of the Christian Church by the encouragement of
 pictures and images in religious service! (In the eighth century, the
 second council of Nicea decreed that the image of God was as proper an

 Whether this couple were converted before Paul made their acquaintance, 
 commentators are much divided. They may have brought their Christianity 
 with them from Rome [O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT>], or Paul may have 
 been drawn to them merely by like occupation, and, lodging with them, 
 have been the instrument of their conversion [M<FONT

 and after travelling much, to have eventually settled at Ephesus. The 
 Christian friendship now first formed continued warm and unbroken, and 
 the highest testimony is once and again borne to them by the apostle.

 zeal and assiduity in preaching it, but some inward <I>pressure</I> which
 at this time he experienced in the work (to convey which more clearly
 was probably the origin of the common reading). What that pressure was
 we happen to know, with singular minuteness and vividness of
 description, from the apostle himself, in his first Epistles to the
 Corinthians and Thessalonians

 He had come away from Athens, as he remained there, in a depressed and
 anxious state of mind, having there met, for the first time, with 
 unwilling Gentile ears. He continued, apparently for some time, 
 laboring alone in the synagogue of Corinth, full of deep and anxious 
 solicitude for his Thessalonian converts. His early ministry at Corinth 
 was colored by these feelings. Himself deeply humbled, his power as a 
 preacher was more than ever felt to lie in demonstration of the Spirit. 
 At length Silas and Timotheus arrived with exhilarating tidings of the 
 faith and love of his Thessalonian children, and of their earnest 
 longing again to see their father in Christ; bringing with them also, 
 in token of their love and duty, a pecuniary contribution for the 
 supply of his wants. This seems to have so lifted him as to put new 
 life and vigor into his ministry. <I>He now wrote his</I> F<FONT

 <B>And Gallio cared for none of those things</B>--nothing loath, perhaps,
 to see these turbulent Jews, for whom probably he felt contempt,
 themselves getting what they hoped to inflict on another, and
 indifferent to whatever was beyond the range of his office and case. His
 brother eulogizes his loving and lovable manners. Religious
 indifference, under the influence of an easy and amiable temper,
 reappears from age to age.</P>

 difficulty or danger, in prosecution of which he cuts off his hair and 
 hastens to Jerusalem to offer the requisite sacrifice within the 
 prescribed thirty days [J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>, <I>Wars of the

 used of a journey to the metropolis; and thence he naturally "went

 feast, as he seems to have done nothing in Jerusalem beyond "saluting 
 the Church," and privately offering the sacrifice with which his vow

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>born at Alexandria</B>--the celebrated city of Egypt on the southeastern
 shore of the Mediterranean, called after its founder, Alexander the
 Great. Nowhere was there such a fusion of Greek, Jewish, and Oriental
 peculiarities, and an intelligent Jew educated in that city could
 hardly fail to manifest all these elements in his mental character.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>eloquent</B>--turning his Alexandrian culture to high account.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and mighty in the scriptures</B>--his eloquence enabling him to express
 clearly and enforce skilfully what, as a Jew, he had gathered from a
 diligent study of the Old Testament Scriptures.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>came to Ephesus</B>--on what errand is not known.</P>

 <A NAME="Ac18_25"> </A>

 <B>25. This man was instructed in the way of the Lord .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
 knowing only the baptism of John</B>--He was instructed, probably, by 
 some disciple of the Baptist, in the whole circle of John's teaching 
 concerning Jesus, but no more: he had yet to learn the new light which 
 the outpouring of the Spirit at Pentecost had thrown upon the
 Redeemer's death and resurrection; as appears from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:2,3">Ac 19:2, 3</A>.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>being fervent in the spirit</B>--His heart warm, and conscious, probably,
 of his gifts and attainments, he burned to impart to others the truth he
 had himself received.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he spake and taught diligently</B>--rather, "accurately" (it is the same
 word as is rendered "perfectly" in

 heard</B>--joying to observe the extent of Scripture knowledge and
 evangelical truth which he displayed, and the fervency, courage, and
 eloquence with which he preached the truth.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>they took him unto them</B>--privately.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly</B>--opening up
 those truths, to him as yet unknown, on which the Spirit had shed such
 glorious light. (In what appears to be the true reading of this verse,
 Priscilla is put before Aquila, as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:18">Ac 18:18</A>

 she being probably the more intelligent and devoted of the two). One 
 cannot but observe how providential it was that this couple should have 
 been left at Ephesus when Paul sailed thence for Syria; and no doubt it 
 was chiefly to pave the way for the better understanding of this
 episode that the fact is expressly mentioned by the historian in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:19">Ac 18:19</A>.

 We see here also an example of not only <I>lay</I> agency (as it is 
 called), but <I>female</I> agency of the highest kind and with the most 
 admirable fruit. Nor can one help admiring the humility and
 teachableness of so gifted a teacher in sitting at the feet of a
 Christian woman and her husband.</P>

 (see on

 was the capital; there to proclaim that Gospel which he now more fully 
 comprehended.

 Ephesus. But the desire of the Jews to whom Paul preached to retain him 
 among them for some time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:20">Ac 18:20</A>),

 and his promise to return to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:21">Ac 18:21</A>),

 seem to indicate some drawing towards the Gospel, which, no doubt, the 
 zealous private labors of Priscilla and Aquila would ripen into 
 discipleship.

 of "letters of recommendation" (as

 churches maintained active Christian fellowship with each other.

 Achaian brethren.

 show that <I>faith's being a production of God's grace in the heart</I> was
 so current and recognized a truth that it was taken for granted, as a
 necessary consequence of the general system of grace, rather than
 expressly insisted on. (It is against the natural order of the words to
 read them, as B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>,
 M<FONT SIZE=-1>EYER</FONT>, and others, do, "helped through grace those
 who believed").</P>

 "stoutly bore them down in argument," "vigorously argued them down," and
 the <I>tense</I> in that he <I>continued</I> to do it, or that this was the
 characteristic of his ministry.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>showing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ</B>--Rather, "that the
 Christ (or Messiah) was Jesus." This expression, when compared with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:25">Ac 18:25</A>,

 seems to imply a richer testimony than with his partial knowledge he
 was at first able to bear; and the power with which he bore down all 
 opposition in argument is that which made him such an acquisition to 
 the brethren. Thus his ministry would be as good as another visitation 
 to the Achaian churches by the apostle himself (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:6">1Co 3:6</A>)

 of preaching in preference to Paul's

 that the one did not of necessity carry the other along with it (see on

 Why this question was asked, we cannot tell; but it was probably in 
 consequence of something that passed between them from which the 
 apostle was led to suspect the imperfection of their light.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost</B>--This
 cannot be the meaning, since the personality and office of the Holy
 Ghost, in connection with Christ, formed an especial subject of the
 Baptist's teaching. Literally, the words are, "We did not even hear
 whether the Holy Ghost was (given)"; meaning, at the time of their
 baptism. That the word "given" is the right supplement, as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:39">Joh 7:39</A>,

 come after him</B>--that is, who should baptize with the Holy Ghost. The

 <I>new life.</I> As to all the facts, or at least the significancy, of this

 which induced him to make it his headquarters for so long a period. The
 unwearied and varied character of his labors here are best seen in his 
 own subsequent address to the elders of Ephesus

 long remembered at Ephesus, as a strong proof of honest conviction on 
 the part of the sorcerers and a striking triumph of Jesus Christ over 
 the powers of darkness. The workers of evil were put to scorn, like

 the Great, 356 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, was rebuilt with more 
 splendor than before. It was four hundred twenty-five feet long by two 
 hundred twenty broad, and the columns, one hundred twenty-seven in 
 number, were sixty feet in height, each of them the gift of a king, and 
 thirty-six of them enriched with ornament and color. It was constantly 
 receiving new decorations and additional buildings, statues, and 
 pictures by the most celebrated artists, and kindled unparalleled 
 admiration, enthusiasm, and superstition.  <I>Its very site is now a 
 matter of uncertainty.</I> The little wooden image of Diana was as 
 primitive and rude as its shrine was sumptuous; not like the 
 <I>Greek</I> Diana, in the form of an imposing huntress, but quite 
 Asiatic, in the form of a many-breasted female (emblematic of the 
 manifold ministrations of Nature to man), terminating in a shapeless 
 block. Like some other far-famed idols, it was believed to have fallen 
 from heaven

 Certain of these, it seems, were favorably inclined to the Gospel, at

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:12">2Co 2:12</A>;
 
 see on

 <A HREF="#Ac16_8">Ac 16:8</A>).

 (2) That while on his former visit he appears to have done no 
 missionary work there, he now went expressly "to preach Christ's 
 Gospel," and found "a door opened unto him of the Lord" there, which he 
 entered so effectually as to lay the foundation of a church there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:6,7">Ac 20:6, 7</A>).

 (3) That he would have remained longer there but for his uneasiness at 
 the non-arrival of Titus, whom he had despatched to Corinth to finish 
 the collection for the poor saints at Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:1,2,2Co+8:6">1Co 16:1, 2;
 2Co 8:6</A>), 

 but still more, that he might bring him word what effect his first
 Epistle to that church had produced.  (He had probably arranged that
 they should meet at Troas).  (4) That in this state of mind, afraid of
 something wrong, he "took leave" of the brethren at Troas, and went
 from thence into Macedonia.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was, no doubt, the city of P<FONT SIZE=-1>HILIPPI</FONT> that he
 came to (landing at Nicopolis, its seaport, see on

 <A HREF="#Ac16_11">Ac 16:11, 12</A>),
 
 as appears by comparing

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:9">2Co 11:9</A>,

 where "Macedonia" is named, with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:15">Php 4:15</A>,

 where it appears that Philippi is meant. Here he found the brethren,
 whom he had left on his former visit in circumstances of such deep 
 interest, a consolidated and thriving church, generous and warmly 
 attached to their father in Christ; under the superintendence, 
 probably, of our historian, "the beloved physician" (see on

 <A HREF="#Ac16_40">Ac 16:40</A>). 

 All that is said by our historian of this Macedonian visit is that "he 
 went over those parts and gave them much exhortation." (5) Titus not 
 having reached Philippi as soon as the apostle, "his flesh had no rest, 
 but he was troubled on every side: without were fightings, within were 
 fears"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:5">2Co 7:5</A>).

 (6) At length Titus arrived, to the joy of the apostle, the bearer of 
 better tidings from Corinth than he had dared to expect

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:6,7,13">2Co 7:6, 7, 13</A>),

 but checkered by painful intelligence of the efforts of a hostile party 
 to undermine his apostolic reputation there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:1-18">2Co 10:1-18</A>).

 (7) Under the mixed feelings which this produced, he wrote--from 
 Macedonia, and probably Philippi--<I>his</I> 
 S<FONT SIZE=-1>ECOND</FONT> 
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>PISTLE TO THE</FONT> 
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>ORINTHIANS</FONT> 
 (see

 <A HREF="JFB47.htm#Introduction">Introduction</A>

 to Second Corinthians); despatching Titus with it, and along with him 
 two other unnamed deputies, expressly chosen to take up and bring their 
 collection for the poor saints at Jerusalem, and to whom he bears the 
 beautiful testimony, that they were "the glory of Christ"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:22,23">2Co 8:22, 23</A>).

 (8) It must have been at this time that he penetrated as far as to the 
 confines of "Illyricum," lying along the shores of the Adriatic

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:19">Ro 15:19</A>).

 He would naturally wish that his second Letter to the Corinthians 
 should have some time to produce its proper effect ere he revisited 
 them, and this would appear a convenient opportunity for a northwestern 
 circuit, which would enable him to pay a passing visit to the churches 
 at Thessalonica and Berea, though of this we have no record. On his way 
 southward to Greece, he would preach the Gospel in the intermediate 
 regions of Epirus, Thessaly, and Boeotia (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:19">Ro 15:19</A>),

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:1">Ac 20:1</A>)

 meant the city of Philippi. Some rough work he anticipated on his

 though he had reason to expect satisfaction on the whole; and as we
 know there were other churches in Achaia besides that at Corinth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:1,11:10">2Co 1:1; 11:10</A>),

 he would have time enough to pay them all a brief visit during the
 three months of his stay there. This period was rendered further
 memorable by the despatch of <I>the</I> 
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>PISTLE TO THE</FONT> 
 R<FONT SIZE=-1>OMANS</FONT>, 
 written during his stay at Corinth and sent by "Ph&oelig;be, a servant
 [deaconess] of the Church at Cenchrea" (see on

 <A HREF="#Ac18_3">Ac 18:3</A>),

 a lady apparently of some standing and substance, who was going thither 
 on private business.  (See on

 to Romans).

 <B>And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into

 harbor of the city, for Palestine, on his route to Jerusalem, the
 <I>third</I> part of his plan 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:21">Ac 19:21</A>).

 and Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:29,30">Ac 9:29, 30</A>),

 he changed his plan and determined "to return" as he had come, "through 
 Macedonia." As he was never more to return to Corinth, so this route 
 would bring him, for the last time, face to face with the attached 
 disciples of <I>Berea, Thessalonica,</I> and <I>Philippi.</I></P>

 <B>Sopater of Berea</B>--The true reading, beyond doubt, is, "Sopater [the

 distinguish him from Sosipater (the same name in fuller form), mentioned
 in

 is said to be of "Macedonia," and this one "of Derbe," there is no

 contrary,

 (compare with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:1">3Jo 1</A>,

 where there is hardly any reason to doubt that the same Gaius is
 addressed) seems to show that though he spent an important part of his 
 Christian life away from his native Derbe, he had latterly retired to 
 some place not very far from it.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and Timotheus</B>--not probably of Derbe, as one might suppose from 
 this verse, but of Lystra (see on

 the mention of the one in the previous clause would recall the other on 
 the mention of his name.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus</B>--The latter was an Ephesian, and
 probably the former also. They seem to have put themselves, from this
 time forward, at the apostle's disposal, and to the very last been a
 great comfort to him

 From the mention of the places to which each of these companions
 belonged, and still more the order in which they occur, we are left to 
 conclude that they were deputies from their respective churches, 
 charged with taking up and bringing on the collection for the poor 
 saints at Jerusalem, first at Berea, next at Thessalonica, then at

 In sailing southward from Troas to Assos, one has to round Cape 
 Lecture, and keeping due east to run along the northern shore of the 
 Gulf of Adramyttium, on which it lies. This is a sail of nearly forty 
 miles; whereas by land, cutting right across, in a southeasterly 
 direction, from sea to sea, by that excellent Roman road which then 
 existed, the distance was scarcely more than half. The one way Paul 
 wished his companions to take, while he himself, longing perhaps to 
 enjoy a period of solitude, took the other, joining the ship, by 
 appointment, at Assos.</P>

 Ephesus was the chief city.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for he hasted, if .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. possible .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to be at Jerusalem the day of
 Pentecost</B>--as a suitable season for giving in the great collection
 from all the western churches, for keeping the feast, and clearing his
 apostolic position with the Church, then represented in large number at
 Jerusalem. The words imply that there was considerable ground to doubt
 if he would attain this object--for more than three of the seven weeks
 from Passover to Pentecost had already expired--and they are inserted
 evidently to explain why he did not once more visit Ephesus.</P>

 think that more time would be lost by sending thus far for the elders to
 come to him, than by going at once to Ephesus itself, when so near it.
 But if unfavorable winds and stormy weather had overtaken them, his
 object could not have been attained, and perhaps he was unwilling to run
 the risk of detention at Ephesus by the state of the church and other
 causes. Those here called "<I>elders</I>" or "presbyters," are in

 R<FONT SIZE=-1>EPENTANCE</FONT>, 
 as distinguished from <I>faith,</I> is that state of the "honest and
 good heart" which arises from a discovery of one's contrariety to the 
 righteous demands of the divine law. This is said to be "<I>toward 
 God,</I>" because seeing Him to be the party dishonored by sin, it 
 feels all its acknowledgments and compunctions to be properly due to 
 Him, as the great Lawgiver, and directs them to Him accordingly; 
 condemning, humbling itself, and grieving before Him, looking also to 
 Him as its only Hope of deliverance. F<FONT SIZE=-1>AITH</FONT> is said 
 to be "<I>toward our Lord Jesus Christ,</I>" because in that frame of 
 mind just described it eagerly credits the testimony of relief divinely 
 provided in Christ, gladly embraces the overtures of reconciliation in 
 Him, and directs all its expectations of salvation, from its first 
 stage to its last, to Him as the one appointed Medium of all grace from 
 God to a sinful world. Thus we have here a brief summary of all Gospel 
 preaching. And it is easy to see why repentance is here put before 
 faith; for the former must of necessity precede the latter. There is a 
 repentance subsequent to faith, the fruit of felt pardon and 
 restoration. It was this which drew the tears with which the Saviour's 
 feet were once so copiously moistened.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>overseers</B>--or, as the same word is <I>everywhere else</I> rendered in
 our version, "bishops." The <I>English Version</I> has hardly dealt fair in
 this case with the sacred text, in rendering the word "overseers,"
 whereas it ought here, as in all other places, to have been "bishops,"
 in order that the fact of elders and bishops having been originally and
 apostolically synonymous, might be apparent to the ordinary English
 reader, which now it is not
 [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]. The distinction between these
 offices cannot be certainly traced till the second century, nor was it
 established till late in that century.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>to feed the church of God</B>--or, "the Church of the Lord." Which of
 these two readings of the text is the true one, is a question which has
 divided the best critics. The evidence of manuscripts preponderates in
 favor of "<FONT SIZE=-1>THE</FONT> L<FONT SIZE=-1>ORD</FONT>"; some of the most ancient Versions, though not all,
 so read; and A<FONT SIZE=-1>THANASIUS</FONT>, the great champion of the supreme Divinity
 of Christ early in the fourth century, says the expression "Church of
 God" is unknown to the Scriptures. Which reading, then, does the
 <I>internal</I> evidence favor? As "Church of God" occurs nine times
 elsewhere in Paul's writings, and "Church of the Lord" nowhere, the
 probability, it is said, is that he used his wonted phraseology here
 also. But if he did, it is extremely difficult to see how so many early
 transcribers should have altered it into the quite unusual phrase,
 "Church of the Lord"; whereas, if the apostle did use this latter
 expression, and the historian wrote it so accordingly, it it easy to see
 how transcribers might, from being so accustomed to the usual phrase,
 write it "Church of God." On the whole, therefore, we accept the
 <I>second</I> reading as most probably the true one. But see what follows.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>which he hath purchased</B>--"made His own," "acquired."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>with his own blood</B>--"His own" is emphatic: "That glorified Lord who
 from the right hand of power in the heavens is gathering and ruling the
 Church, and by His Spirit, through human agency, hath set you over it,
 cannot be indifferent to its welfare in your hands, seeing He hath given
 for it His own most precious blood, thus making it His own by the
 dearest of all ties." The transcendent sacredness of the Church of
 Christ is thus made to rest on the dignity of its Lord and the
 consequent preciousness of that blood which He shed for it. And as the
 sacrificial atoning character of Christ's death is here plainly
 <I>expressed,</I> so His supreme dignity is <I>implied</I> as clearly by the
 second reading as it is <I>expressed</I> by the first. What a motive to
 <I>pastoral fidelity</I> is here furnished!</P>

 <B>29, 30. after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among

 external to themselves, the other bred in the bosom of their own 
 community; both were to be teachers, but the one, "grievous wolves,"

 simply sectarian "perverters" of the truth, with the view of drawing a
 party after them. Perhaps the one pointed to that subtle poison of 
 Oriental Gnosticism which we know to have very early infected the 
 Asiatic churches; the other to such Judaizing tendencies as we know to 
 have troubled nearly all the early churches. See the Epistles to the

 The apostle was full of anxiety about this visit to Jerusalem, from the
 numerous prophetic intimations of danger awaiting him, and having reason
 to expect the presence at this feast of the very parties from whose
 virulent rage he had once and again narrowly escaped with his life.
 Hence we find him asking the Roman Christians to wrestle with him in
 prayer, "for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the
 Spirit,
 <I>that he might be delivered from them that believed not in Judea,</I>" as
 well as "that his service which he had for Jerusalem (the great
 collection for the poor saints there) might be accepted of the saints"

 the manner in which he was habited or the seat he occupied, with other
 circumstances to us unknown, may account for such a speech. But if he
 was thrown off his guard by an insult which touched him to the quick,
 "what can surpass the grace with which he recovered his self-possession,

 Pharisaic section of the council in his favor; the doctrine of a
 resurrection being common to both, though they would totally differ in
 their <I>application</I> of it. This was, of course, quite warrantable, and

 a Jewess</B>--This beautiful but infamous woman was the third daughter 
 of Herod Agrippa I, who was eaten of worms (see on

 <A HREF="#Ac12_1">Ac 12:1</A>), 

 and a sister of Agrippa II, before whom Paul pleaded,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:1">Ac 26:1</A>,

 &c. She was "given in marriage to Azizus, king of the Emesenes, who had 
 consented to be circumcised for the sake of the alliance. But this 
 marriage was soon dissolved, after this manner: When Festus was 
 procurator of Judea, he saw her, and being captivated with her beauty, 
 persuaded her to desert her husband, transgress the laws of her 
 country, and marry himself" [J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>,

 Christ</B>--Perceiving from what he had heard on the trial that the new 
 sect which was creating such a stir was represented by its own 
 advocates as but a particular development of the Jewish faith, he 
 probably wished to gratify the curiosity of his Jewish wife, as well as 
 his own, by a more particular account of it from this distinguished 
 champion. And no doubt Paul would so far humor this desire as to 
 present to them the great leading features of the Gospel. But from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:25">Ac 24:25</A>

 it is evident that his discourse took an entirely practical turn,
 suited to the life which his two auditors were notoriously leading.</P>

 <B>and judgment to come</B>--when he would be called to an awful account
 for both.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Felix trembled</B>--and no wonder. For, on the testimony of
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>ACITUS</FONT>, the
 Roman Annalist [<I>Annals,</I> 9; 12.54], he ruled with a mixture of
 cruelty, lust, and servility, and relying on the influence of his
 brother Pallas at court, he thought himself at liberty to commit every
 sort of crime with impunity. How noble the fidelity and courage which
 dared to treat of such topics in such a presence, and what withering
 power must have been in those appeals which made even a Felix to
 tremble!

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient season I will
 call for thee</B>--Alas for Felix! This was his golden opportunity,
 but--<I>like multitudes still</I>--he missed it. Convenient seasons in
 abundance he found to call for Paul, but never again to "hear him
 concerning the faith in Christ," and writhe under the terrors of the
 wrath to come. Even in those moments of terror he had no thought of
 submission to the Cross or a change of life. The Word discerned the
 thoughts and intents of his heart, but that heart even then clung to its
 idols; even as Herod, who "did many things and heard John gladly," but
 in his best moments was enslaved to his lusts. How many Felixes have
 appeared from age to age!</P>

 <B>26. He hoped .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that money should have been given him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
 wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him</B>--Bribery
 in a judge was punishable by the Roman law, but the spirit of a slave
 (to use the words of T<FONT SIZE=-1>ACITUS</FONT>) was in all his acts, and his communing
 with Paul"--as if he cared for either him or his message--simply added
 hypocrisy to meanness. The position in life of Paul's Christian
 visitors might beget the hope of extracting something from them for the
 release of their champion; but the apostle would rather lie in prison
 than stoop to this!</P>

 <B>27. after two years</B>--What a trial to this burning missionary of Christ,
 to suffer such a tedious period of inaction! How mysterious it would
 seem! But this repose would be medicine to his spirit; he would not, and
 could not, be entirely inactive, so long as he was able by pen and
 message to communicate with the churches; and he would doubtless learn
 the salutary truth that even he was not essential to his Master's cause.
 That Luke wrote his Gospel during this period, under the apostle's
 superintendence, is the not unlikely conjecture of able critics.

 judgment (and see on

 with a mere promise of protection from him. But from going to Jerusalem

 case of life and death, was secured by an ancient law to every Roman
 citizen, and continued under the empire. Had Festus shown any
 disposition to pronounce final judgment, Paul, strong in the
 consciousness of his innocence and the justice of a Roman tribunal,
 would not have made this appeal. But when the only other alternative
 offered him was to give his own consent to be transferred to the great
 hotbed of plots against his life, and to a tribunal of unscrupulous and
 bloodthirsty ecclesiastics whose vociferous cries for his death had

 thought it now was, as twelve great branches of one ancient stem, in all
 places of their dispersion offering to the God of their fathers one
 unbroken worship, reposing on one great "promise" made of old unto their
 fathers, and sustained by one "hope" of "coming" to its fulfilment; the
 single point of difference between him and his countrymen, and the one
 cause of all their virulence against him, being, that his hope had found
 rest in One already come, while theirs still pointed to the future.

 <B>For which hope's sake, King Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews</B>--"I am

 resurrection of Jesus, which proclaimed Him to be the Christ, the Son of
 God; the only way of getting rid of it, therefore, was to pronounce it

 light to the (Jewish) people and to the Gentiles," he had only said what
 the prophets and Moses said should come.</P>

 with the sacred writings of his nation, reference to a resurrection and
 other doctrines to a Roman utterly unintelligible, and, above all, lofty
 religious earnestness, so strange to the cultivated, cold-hearted

 Agrippa's knowledge of the <I>facts</I> and faith in the <I>predictions</I>

 thinkest to make me with little persuasion (or small trouble) a
 Christian"--but I am not to be so easily turned. But the apostle's
 <I>reply</I> can scarcely suit any but the sense given in our authorized
 version, which is that adopted by C<FONT SIZE=-1>HRYSOSTOM</FONT> and some of the best
 scholars since. The objection on which so much stress is laid, that the
 word "Christian" was at that time only a term of contempt, has no force
 except on the other side; for taking it in that view, the sense is,
 "Thou wilt soon have me one of that despised sect."</P>

 be found at a Lycian port.  But even still it is not unusual to stand

 were toiling at the pumps, Paul was wrestling in prayer, not for himself
 only and the cause in which he was going a prisoner to Rome, but with
 true magnanimity of soul for all his shipmates; and God heard him,
 "giving him" (remarkable expression!) all that sailed with him. "When
 the cheerless day came he gathered the sailors (and passengers) around
 him on the deck of the laboring vessel, and raising his voice above the
 storm" [H<FONT SIZE=-1>OWSON</FONT>],
 reported the divine communication he had received;
 adding with a noble simplicity, "<I>for I believe God</I> that it shall be
 even as it was told me," and encouraging all on board to "be of good
 cheer" in the same confidence. What a contrast to this is the speech of
 C&aelig;sar in similar circumstances to his pilot, bidding him keep up his
 spirit because he carried C&aelig;sar and C&aelig;sar's fortune!

 sailed in it, and that they "must be cast on a certain island"--one
 would conclude a visional representation of a total wreck, a mass of
 human beings struggling with the angry elements, and one and all of
 those whose figures and countenances had daily met his eye on deck,
 standing on some unknown island shore. From what follows, it would seem
 that Paul from this time was regarded with a deference akin to awe.</P>

 cast the anchor, as now, from the <I>bow:</I> but ancient ships, built with

 case of need they could anchor either way. And when the fear was, as
 here, that they might fall on the rocks <I>to leeward,</I> and the intention
 was to run the ship ashore as soon as daylight enabled them to fix upon
 a safe spot, the very best thing they could do was to anchor by the

 what would minister to their comfort during the voyage, as showed the 
 value they set upon the presence and labors of the apostle among them,

 permanent effects of this three months' stay of the greatest of the 
 apostles were left at Malta, we cannot certainly say. But though little 
 dependence is to be placed upon the tradition that Publius became

 the voyage

 "south wind," in about twenty-six hours. The Alexandrian corn ships
 enjoyed a privilege peculiar to themselves, of not being obliged to
 strike their topsail on landing. By this they were easily recognized as
 they hove in sight by the crowds that we find gathered on the shore on

 may have proceeded partly from a wish to receive instructions from Rome
 and make arrangements for his journey thither, partly from a wish to
 gratify Paul, as he seems studiously and increasingly to have done to
 the last. One can hardly doubt that he was influenced by both
 considerations. However this may be, the apostle had thus an opportunity
 of spending a Sabbath with the Christians of the place, all the more
 refreshing from his long privation in this respect, and as a seasoning
 for the unknown future that lay before him at the metropolis.

 going on to the more distant place.

 <B>16. when we came to Rome</B>--the renowned capital of the ancient world,
 situated on the Tiber.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the 
 guard</B>--the <I>Pr&aelig;torian Prefect,</I> to whose custody, as 
 commander of the Pr&aelig;torian guard, the highest military authority
 in the city, were committed all who were to come before the emperor for 
 trial. Ordinarily there were two such prefects; but from <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 51 to 62, one distinguished general--<I>Burrus
 Aframus,</I> who had been Nero's tutor--held that office; and as our 
 historian speaks of "<I>the</I> captain," as if there were but one, it 
 is thought that this fixes the apostle's arrival at Rome to be not 
 later than the year 62 [W<FONT SIZE=-1>IES</FONT>].  But even though 
 there had been two when Paul arrived, he would be committed only to one 
 of them, who would be "<I>the</I> captain" who got charge of him. (At 
 most, therefore, this can furnish no more than confirmation to the 
 chronological evidence otherwise obtained).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a</B>--"the"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>soldier that kept him</B>--"guarded" him.  (See on

 <A HREF="#Ac12_6">Ac 12:6</A>). 

 This privilege was allowed in the case of the better class of 
 prisoners, not accused of any flagrant offense, on finding 
 security--which in Paul's case would not be difficult among the 
 Christians. The extension of this privilege to the apostle may have 
 been due to the terms in which Festus wrote about him; but far more 
 probably it was owing to the high terms in which Julius spoke of him, 
 and his express intercession in his behalf.  It was overruled, however, 
 for giving the fullest scope to the labors of the apostle compatible 
 with confinement at all. As the soldiers who kept him were relieved 
 periodically, he would thus make the personal acquaintance of a great 
 number of the Pr&aelig;torian guard; and if he had to appear before the 
 Prefect from time to time, the truth might thus penetrate to those who 
 surrounded the emperor, as we learn, from

 banished from the capital by Claudius, the Jews enjoyed the full 
 benefit of the toleration which distinguished the first period of 
 Nero's reign, and were at this time in considerable numbers, wealth, 
 and influence settled at Rome. We have seen that long before this a 
 flourishing Christian Church existed at Rome, to which Paul wrote his 
 Epistle (see on

 <A HREF="#Ac20_3">Ac 20:3</A>), 

 and the first members of which were probably Jewish converts and 
 proselytes.  (See

 Israel is bound up with this case of mine." From the touching allusions
 which the apostle makes to his chains, before Agrippa first, and here
 before the leading members of the Jewish community at Rome, at his first
 interview with them, one would gather that his great soul felt keenly
 his being in such a condition; and it is to this keenness of feeling,
 under the control of Christian principle, that we owe the noble use
 which he made of it in these two cases.</P>

 beginnings of the Christian Church in its march from east to west, 
 among the Jews first, whose center was Jerusalem; next among the 
 Gentiles, with Antioch for its headquarters; finally, its banner is 
 seen waving over imperial Rome, foretokening its universal triumphs. 
 That distinguished apostle whose conversion, labors, and sufferings for 
 "the faith which once he destroyed" occupy more than half of this 
 History, it leaves a prisoner, unheard, so far as appears, for two 
 years. His accusers, whose presence was indispensable, would have to 
 await the return of spring before starting for the capital, and might 
 not reach it for many months; nor, even when there, would they be so
 sanguine of success--after Felix, Festus, and Agrippa had all
 pronounced him innocent--as to be impatient of delay. And if witnesses
 were required to prove the charge advanced by Tertullus, that he was "a
 mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the [Roman] world"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:5">Ac 24:5</A>),

 they must have seen that unless considerable time was allowed them the
 case would certainly break down. If to this be added the capricious 
 delays which the emperor himself might interpose, and the practice of 
 Nero to hear but one charge at a time, it will not seem strange that 
 the historian should have no proceedings in the case to record for two 
 years. Begun, probably, before the apostle's arrival, its progress at 
 Rome under his own eye would furnish exalted employment, and beguile 
 many a tedious hour of his two years' imprisonment. Had the case come 
 on for hearing during this period, much more if it had been disposed 
 of, it is hardly conceivable that the History should have closed as it 
 does. But if, at the end of this period, the Narrative only wanted the 
 decision of the case, while hope deferred was making the heart sick

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+13:12">Pr 13:12</A>),
 
 and if, under the guidance of that Spirit whose seal was on it all, it
 seemed of more consequence to put the Church at once in possession of
 this History than to keep it back indefinitely for the sake of what
 might come to be otherwise known, we cannot wonder that it should be
 wound up as it is in its two concluding verses. All that we know of the
 apostle's proceedings and history beyond this must be gathered from the
 <I>Epistles of the Imprisonment</I>--Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians,
 and Philemon--written during this period, and the <I>Pastoral Epistles</I>--to
 Timothy and Titus, which, in our judgment, are of subsequent date. From
 the former class of Epistles we learn the following particulars: (1)
 That the trying restraint laid upon the apostle's labors by his
 imprisonment had only turned his influence into a new channel; the
 Gospel having in consequence penetrated even into the palace, and
 pervaded the city, while the preachers of Christ were emboldened; and
 though the Judaizing portion of them, observing his success among the
 Gentiles, had been led to inculcate with fresh zeal their own narrower
 Gospel, even this had done much good by extending the truth common to
 both (See on

 <A HREF="JFB50.htm#Php1_12">Php 1:12-18</A>;

 <A HREF="JFB50.htm#Php4_22">Php 4:22</A>);

 (2) That as in addition to all his other labors, "the care of all the 
 churches pressed upon him from day to-day"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:28">2Co 11:28</A>),

 so with these churches he kept up an active correspondence by means of
 letters and messages, and on such errands he lacked not faithful and 
 beloved brethren enough ready to be employed--<I>Luke; Timotheus; 
 Tychicus;</I> (John) <I>Mark; Demas; Aristarchus; Epaphras; Onesimus; 
 Jesus,</I> called Justus; and, for a short time, <I>Epaphroditus</I> 
 (See on

 <A HREF="JFB51.htm#Col4_9">Col 4:9-12</A>;

 <A HREF="JFB50.htm#Introduction">Introduction</A> 
 
 to Philippians, and

 <A HREF="JFB57.htm#Introduction">Introduction</A> 
 
 to Philemon).

 That the apostle suffered martyrdom under Nero at Rome has never been 
 doubted. But that the appeal which brought him to Rome issued in his 
 liberation, that he was at large for some years thereafter and took 
 some wide missionary circuits, and that he was again arrested, carried 
 to Rome, and then executed--was the undisputed belief of the early
 Church, as expressed by 
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>HRYSOSTOM</FONT>, 
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT>, 
 and 
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>, 
 in the fourth century, up to 
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT> 
 R<FONT SIZE=-1>OME</FONT>, 
 the "fellow laborer" of the apostle himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:3">Php 4:3</A>),

 in the first century. The strongest possible confirmation of this is 
 found in the Pastoral Epistles, which bear marks throughout of a more 
 advanced state of the Church, and more matured forms of error, than can 
 well have existed at any period before the appeal which brought the 
 apostle to Rome; which refer to movements of himself and Timothy that 
 cannot without some straining (as we think) be made to fit into any 
 prior period; and which are couched in a manifestly riper style than 
 any of his other Epistles.  (See

 <A HREF="JFB54.htm#Introduction">Introduction</A> 
 
 to First Timothy,

 <A HREF="JFB55.htm#Introduction">Introduction</A> 
 
 to Second Timothy

 <A HREF="JFB56.htm#Introduction">Introduction</A>

 to Titus and <I>Notes</I>). All this has been called in question by
 modern critics of great research and acuteness

 D<FONT SIZE=-1>E</FONT>
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>ETTE</FONT>,
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>IESELER</FONT>,
 D<FONT SIZE=-1>AVIDSON</FONT>,
 and others].  But those who maintain the ancient view are of equal
 authority and more numerous, while the weight of argument appears to us 
 to be decidedly on their side.</P>
