 J<FONT SIZE=-1>OEL</FONT> (meaning "one to whom Jehovah is God," that is, worshipper of
 Jehovah) seems to have belonged to Judah, as no reference occurs to
 Israel; whereas he speaks of Jerusalem, the temple, the priests, and
 the ceremonies, as if he were intimately familiar with them (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:14,2:1,15,32,3:1,2,6,16,17,20,21">Joe 1:14; 2:1, 15, 32;
 3:1, 2, 6, 16, 17, 20, 21</A>). 

 His predictions were probably delivered in the early days of Joash 
 870-865 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>; for no reference is made in them to 
 the Babylonian, Assyrian, or even the Syrian invasion; and the only 
 enemies mentioned are the Philistines, Ph&oelig;nicians, Edomites, and
 Egyptians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:4,19">Joe 3:4, 19</A>).

 Had he lived after Joash, he would doubtless have mentioned the Syrians 
 among the enemies whom he enumerates since they took Jerusalem and 
 carried off immense spoil to Damascus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:23,24">2Ch 24:23, 24</A>).

 No idolatry is mentioned; and the temple services, the priesthood, and
 other institutions of the theocracy, are represented as flourishing.
 This all answers to the state of things under the high priesthood of
 Jehoiada, through whom Joash had been placed on the throne and who
 lived in the early years of Joash

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:17,18,12:2-16,2Ch+24:4-14">2Ki 11:17, 18; 12:2-16;
 2Ch 24:4-14</A>).

 He was the son of Pethuel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The first chapter describes the desolation caused by an inroad of
 locusts--one of the instruments of divine judgment mentioned by Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:38,39">De 28:38, 39</A>)
 
 and by Solomon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:37">1Ki 8:37</A>).
 
 The second chapter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:1-11">Joe 2:1-11</A>):

 the appearance of them, under images of a hostile army suggesting that 
 the locusts were symbols and forerunners of a more terrible scourge, 
 namely, foreign enemies who would consume all before them. (The absence 
 of mention of <I>personal</I> injury to the inhabitants is not a just 
 objection to the figurative interpretation; for the figure is 
 consistent throughout in attributing to the locusts only injury to 
 <I>vegetation,</I> thereby injuring indirectly man and beast).

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:12-17">Joe 2:12-17</A>:

 exhortation to repentance, the result of which will be: God will 
 deliver His people, the former and latter rains shall return to 
 fertilize their desolated lands, and these shall be the pledge of the 
 spiritual outpouring of grace beginning with Judah, and thence 
 extending to "all flesh."

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:18-3:21">Joe 2:18-3:21</A>:

 God's judgments on Judah's enemies, whereas Judah shall be established 
 for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Joel's style is pre-eminently pure. It is characterized by smoothness
 and fluency in the rhythms, roundness in the sentences, and regularity
 in the parallelisms. With the strength of Micah it combines the
 tenderness of Jeremiah, the vividness of Nahum, and the sublimity of
 Isaiah. As a specimen of his style take the second chapter wherein the
 terrible aspect of the locusts, their rapidity, irresistible progress,
 noisy din, and instinct-taught power of marshalling their forces for
 their career of devastation, are painted with graphic reality.</P>

 <A NAME="Joe1_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4.</B> This verse states the subject on which he afterwards expands. Four
 species or stages of locusts, rather than four different insects, are
 meant (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:22">Le 11:22</A>).

 Literally, (1) the <I>gnawing</I> locust; (2) the <I>swarming</I> 
 locust; (3) the <I>licking</I> locust; (4) the <I>consuming</I> locust; 
 forming a climax to the most destructive kind. The last is often three 
 inches long, and the two antenn&aelig;, each an inch long. The two 
 hinder of its six feet are larger than the rest, adapting it for 
 leaping. The first "kind" is that of the locust, having just emerged 
 from the egg in spring, and without wings. The second is when at the 
 end of spring, still in their first skin, the locusts put forth little 
 ones without legs or wings. The third, when after their third casting 
 of the old skin, they get small wings, which enable them to leap the 
 better, but not to fly. Being unable to go away till their wings are 
 matured, they devour all before them, grass, shrubs, and bark of trees: 
 translated "rough caterpillars"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:27">Jer 51:27</A>).

 The fourth kind, the matured winged locusts (see on

 <A HREF="JFB34.htm#Na3_16">Na 3:16</A>). 
 
 In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:25">Joe 2:25</A>

 they are enumerated in the reverse order, where the restoration of the 
 devastations caused by them is promised. The Hebrews make the first 
 species refer to Assyria and Babylon; the second species, to 
 Medo-Persia; the third, to Greco-Macedonia and Antiochus Epiphanes; the 
 fourth, to the Romans. Though the primary reference be to literal 
 locusts, the Holy Spirit doubtless had in view the successive empires 
 which assailed Judea, each worse than its predecessor, Rome being the 
 climax.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>5. Awake</B>--out of your ordinary state of drunken stupor, to realize the
 cutting off from you of your favorite drink. Even the drunkards (from a
 <I>Hebrew</I> root, "any strong drink") shall be forced to "howl," though
 usually laughing in the midst of the greatest national calamities, so
 palpably and universally shall the calamity affect all.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>wine .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. new wine</B>--"New" or "fresh wine," in <I>Hebrew,</I> is the
 unfermented, and therefore unintoxicating, <I>sweet juice</I> extracted by
 pressure from grapes or other fruit, as <I>pomegranates</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:2">So 8:2</A>).

 to mark not only their <I>numbers,</I> but also their <I>savage 
 hostility;</I> and also to prepare the mind of the hearer for the 
 transition to the figurative locusts in the second chapter, namely, the 
 "nation" or <I>Gentile</I> foe coming against Judea (compare

 "flesh," but the unbloody offering made of flour, oil, and frankincense.
 As it and the drink offering or libation <I>poured out</I> accompanied
 every sacrificial <I>flesh</I> offering, the latter is included, though not
 specified, as being also "cut off," owing to there being no food left
 for man or beast.

 the open, unenclosed country; "land," the rich <I>red</I> soil (from a
 root "to be red") fit for cultivation. Thus, "a man of the field," in
 <I>Hebrew,</I> is a "hunter"; a "man of the ground" or "land," an
 "agriculturist"

 <B>new wine</B>--from a <I>Hebrew</I> root implying that it <I>takes 
 possession</I> of the brain, so that a man is not master of himself. So 
 the <I>Arabic</I> term is from a root "to hold captive." It is already 
 fermented, and so intoxicating, unlike the <I>sweet fresh wine,</I> in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:5">Joe 1:5</A>,

 called also "new wine," though a different <I>Hebrew</I> word. It and

 and "oil" are obtained

 <B>former rain .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the rain .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the former
 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the latter rain</B>--The autumnal, or "former rain," 
 from the middle of October to the middle of December, is put first, as 
 Joel prophesies in summer when the locusts' invasion took place, and 
 therefore looks to the time of early sowing in autumn, when the 
 autumnal rain was indispensably required. Next, "the rain," 
 <I>generically,</I> literally, "the showering" or "heavy rain." Next, 
 the two species of the latter, "the former and the latter rain" (in 
 March and April). The repetition of the "former rain" implies that He 
 will give it not merely for the exigence of that particular season when 
 Joel spake, but also for the future in the regular course of nature, 
 the autumn and the spring rain; the former being put first, in the 
 order of nature, as being required for the sowing in autumn, as the 
 latter is required in spring for maturing the young crop. The 
 <I>Margin,</I> "a teacher of righteousness," is wrong. For the same 
 <I>Hebrew</I> word is translated "former rain" in the next sentence, 
 and cannot therefore be differently translated here. Besides, Joel 
 begins with the inferior and temporal blessings, and not till

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:28">Joe 2:28</A>

 proceeds to the higher and spiritual ones, of which the former are the 
 pledge.

 <B>moderately</B>--rather, "in due measure," as much as the land requires;
 literally, "according to right"; neither too much nor too little, either
 of which extremes would hurt the crop (compare

 As the Jews have been the seedmen of the elect Church gathered out of
 Jews and Gentiles, the first Gospel preachers being Jews from 
 Jerusalem, so they shall be the harvest men of the coming world-wide

 The "dreams" are attributed to the "old men," as more in accordance

 the Old Testament

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:6">Nu 12:6</A>),
 
 "prophecy, dreams, and visions," are here made the symbol of the full

 "Prophesying" in the New Testament is applied to all speaking under the
 enlightenment of the Holy Spirit, and not merely to foretelling events.

 Thus when the Jews received Him not in His coming of grace, He came in
 judgment on Jerusalem. Physical prodigies, massacres, and conflagrations
 preceded its destruction

 other, for they all prophesied only "in part." What was obscure to one 
 was revealed to the other; what is briefly described by one is more 
 fully so by another. Daniel calls Antichrist a king, and dwells on his 
 worldly conquests; John looks more to his spiritual tyranny, for which 
 reason he adds a second beast, wearing the semblance of spirituality.
