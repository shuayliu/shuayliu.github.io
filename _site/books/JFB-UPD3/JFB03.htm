 <B>1. the Lord .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. spake .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. out of the 
 tabernacle</B>--The laws that are contained in the previous record were
 delivered either to the people publicly from Sinai, or to Moses 
 privately, on the summit of that mountain; but on the completion of the 
 tabernacle, the remainder of the law was announced to the Hebrew leader 
 by an audible voice from the divine glory, which surmounted the mercy 
 seat.</P>

 <A NAME="Le1_2"> </A>

 <B>2. Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them</B>--If the 
 subject of communication were of a temporal nature, the Levites were 
 excluded; but if it were a spiritual matter, all the tribes were 
 comprehended under this name

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:12">De 27:12</A>).

 <B>If any man of you bring an offering unto the Lord</B>--The 
 directions given here relate solely to voluntary or freewill 
 offerings--those rendered over and above such, as being of standing and 
 universal obligation, could not be dispensed with or commuted for any 
 other kind of offering

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:38,Le+23:37,Nu+28:3,11-27">Ex 29:38;

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>bring your offering of the cattle,</B> &c.--that is, those animals 
 that were not only tame, innocent and gentle, but useful and adapted 
 for food. This rule excluded horses, dogs, swine, camels, and asses, 
 which were used in sacrifice by some heathen nations, beasts and birds 
 of prey, as also hares and deers.</P>

 <A NAME="Le1_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. a burnt sacrifice</B>--so called from its being wholly consumed
 on the altar; no part of it was eaten either by the priests or the 
 offerer. It was designed to propitiate the anger of God incurred by 
 original sin, or by particular transgressions; and its entire 
 combustion indicated the self-dedication of the offerer--his whole 
 nature--his body and soul--as necessary to form a sacrifice acceptable
 to God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:1,Php+1:20">Ro 12:1;
 Php 1:20</A>).

 This was the most ancient as well as the most conspicuous mode of
 sacrifice.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>a male without blemish</B>--No animal was allowed to be offered that 
 had any deformity or defect. Among the Egyptians, a minute inspection 
 was made by the priest; and the bullock having been declared perfect, a 
 certificate to that effect being fastened to its horns with wax, was 
 sealed with his ring, and no other might be substituted. A similar 
 process of examining the condition of the beasts brought as offerings, 
 seems to have been adopted by the priests in Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:27">Joh 6:27</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>at the door of the tabernacle</B>--where stood the altar of burnt 
 offering

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+40:6">Ex 40:6</A>).
 
 Every other place was forbidden, under the highest penalty

 <A NAME="Le1_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4. shall put his hand upon the head</B>--This was a significant act 
 which implied not only that the offerer devoted the animal to God, but 
 that he confessed his consciousness of sin and prayed that his guilt 
 and its punishment might be transferred to the victim.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and it shall be</B>--rather, "that it may be an acceptable 
 atonement."</P>

 <A NAME="Le1_5"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>5. he shall kill the bullock</B>--The animal should be killed by the 
 offerer, not by the priest, for it was not his duty in case of 
 voluntary sacrifices; in later times, however, the office was generally 
 performed by Levites.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>before the Lord</B>--on the spot where the hands had been laid upon 
 the animal's head, on the north side of the altar.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>sprinkle the blood</B>--This was to be done by the priests. The 
 blood being considered the life, the effusion of it was the essential 
 part of the sacrifice; and the sprinkling of it--the application of the 
 atonement--made the person and services of the offerer acceptable to 
 God. The skin having been stripped off, and the carcass cut up, the 
 various pieces were disposed on the altar in the manner best calculated 
 to facilitate their being consumed by the fire.</P>

 purity, and the holy <I>walk,</I> that became acceptable worshippers.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>a sweet savour unto the Lord</B>--is an expression of the offerer's 
 piety, but especially as a sacrificial type of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>10-13. if his offering be of the flocks</B>--Those who could not 
 afford the expense of a bullock might offer a ram or a he-goat, and the 
 same ceremonies were to be observed in the act of offering.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>14-17. if the burnt sacrifice .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. be of fowls</B>--The 
 gentle nature and cleanly habits of the dove led to its selection, 
 while all other fowls were rejected, either for the fierceness of their 
 disposition or the grossness of their taste; and in this case, there 
 being from the smallness of the animal no blood for waste, the priest 
 was directed to prepare it <I>at</I> the altar and sprinkle the blood. 
 This was the offering appointed for the poor. The fowls were always 
 offered in pairs, and the reason why Moses ordered two turtledoves or 
 two young pigeons, was not merely to suit the convenience of the 
 offerer, but according as the latter was in season; for pigeons are 
 sometimes quite hard and unfit for eating, at which time turtledoves 
 are very good in Egypt and Palestine. The turtledoves are not 
 restricted to any age because they are always good when they appear in 
 those countries, being birds of passage; but the age of the pigeons is 
 particularly marked that they might not be offered to God at times when 
 they are rejected by men [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ARMER</FONT>].  It is obvious, 
 from the varying scale of these voluntary sacrifices, that the 
 disposition of the offerer was the thing looked to--not the costliness 
 of his offering.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>1. when any will offer a meat offering</B>--or gift--distinguishing 
 a bloodless from a bloody sacrifice. The word "meat," however, is 
 improper, as its meaning as now used is different from that attached at 
 the date of our English translation. It was then applied not to 
 "flesh," but "food," generally, and here it is applied to the flour of 
 wheat. The meat offerings were intended as a thankful acknowledgment 
 for the bounty of Providence; and hence, although meat offerings 
 accompanied some of the appointed sacrifices, those here described 
 being voluntary oblations, were offered alone.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>pour oil upon it</B>--Oil was used as butter is with us; 
 symbolically it meant the influences of the Spirit, of which oil was 
 the emblem, as incense was of prayer.</P>

 <A NAME="Le2_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. shall burn the memorial</B>--rather, "for a memorial"; that is, a 
 part of it.</P>

 <A NAME="Le2_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his 
 sons'</B>--The circumstance of a portion of it being appropriated to 
 the use of the priests distinguishes this from a burnt offering. They 
 alone were to partake of it within the sacred precincts, as among "the 
 most holy things."</P>

 <A NAME="Le2_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4. if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the 
 oven</B>--generally a circular hole excavated in the floor, from one to 
 five feet deep, the sides of which are covered with hardened plaster, 
 on which cakes are baked of the form and thickness of pancakes.  (See 
 on

 <A HREF="JFB01.htm#Ge18_6">Ge 18:6</A>).

 The shape of Eastern ovens varies considerably according to the nomadic
 or settled habits of the people.</P>

 <A NAME="Le2_5"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>5. baken in a pan</B>--a thin plate, generally of copper or iron, 
 placed on a slow fire, similar to what the country people in Scotland 
 called a "girdle" for baking oatmeal cakes.</P>

 <A NAME="Le2_6"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>6. part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon</B>--Pouring oil on bread 
 is a common practice among Eastern people, who are fond of broken bread 
 dipped in oil, butter, and milk. Oil only was used in the meat 
 offerings, and probably for a symbolic reason. It is evident that these 
 meat offerings were previously prepared by the offerer, and when 
 brought, the priest was to take it from his hands and burn a portion on 
 the altar.</P>

 <B>11. ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the 
 Lord</B>--Nothing sweet or sour was to be offered. In the warm climates 
 of the East leavened bread soon spoils, and hence it was regarded as 
 the emblem of hypocrisy or corruption. Some, however, think that the 
 prohibition was that leaven and honey were used in the idolatrous rites 
 of the heathen.</P>

 <A NAME="Le2_12"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>12. the oblation of the first-fruits</B>--voluntary offerings made 
 by individuals out of their increase, and leaven and honey might be 
 used with these

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:17,Nu+15:20">Le 23:17;
 Nu 15:20</A>).

 Though presented at the altar, they were not consumed, but assigned by
 God for the use of the priests.</P>

 <A NAME="Le2_13"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>13. every .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. meat offering shalt thou season with 
 salt</B>--The same reasons which led to the prohibition of leaven, 
 recommended the use of salt--if the one soon putrefies, the other 
 possesses a strongly preservative property, and hence it became an 
 emblem of incorruption and purity, as well as of a perpetual 
 covenant--a perfect reconciliation and lasting friendship. No 
 injunction in the whole law was more sacredly observed than this 
 application of salt; for besides other uses of it that will be noticed 
 elsewhere, it had a typical meaning referred to by our Lord concerning 
 the effect of the Gospel on those who embrace it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:49,50">Mr 9:49, 50</A>);

 as when plentifully applied it preserves meat from spoiling, so will
 the Gospel keep men from being corrupted by sin. And as salt was 
 indispensable to render sacrifices acceptable to God, so the Gospel, 
 brought home to the hearts of men by the Holy Ghost, is indispensably 
 requisite to their offering up of themselves as living sacrifices

 <A NAME="Le2_14"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>14. a meat offering of thy first-fruits</B>--From the mention of 
 "green ears," this seems to have been a voluntary offering before the 
 harvest--the ears being prepared in the favorite way of Eastern people, 
 by parching them at the fire, and then beating them out for use. It was 
 designed to be an early tribute of pious thankfulness for the earth's 
 increase, and it was offered according to the usual directions.</P>

 <B>1. if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering</B>--"Peace" 
 being used in Scripture to denote prosperity and happiness generally, a 
 peace offering was a voluntary tribute of gratitude for health or other 
 benefits. In this view it was eucharistic, being a token of 
 thanksgiving for benefits already received, or it was sometimes votive, 
 presented in prayer for benefits wished for in the future.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>of the herd</B>--This kind of offering being of a festive character, 
 either male or female, if without blemish, might be used, as both of 
 them were equally good for food, and, if the circumstances of the 
 offerer allowed it, it might be a calf.</P>

 <A NAME="Le3_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering</B>--Having
 performed this significant act, he killed it before the door of the
 tabernacle, and the priests sprinkled the blood round about upon the
 altar.</P>

 <A NAME="Le3_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering</B>--The 
 peace offering differed from the oblations formerly mentioned in this 
 respect: while the burnt offering was wholly consumed on the altar, and 
 the freewill offering was partly consumed and partly assigned to the 
 priests; in this offering the fat alone was burnt; only a small part 
 was allotted to the priests while the rest was granted to the offerer 
 and his friends, thus forming a sacred feast of which the Lord, His 
 priests, and people conjointly partook, and which was symbolical of the 
 spiritual feast, the sacred communion which, through Christ, the great 
 peace offering, believers enjoy. (See further on

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:5-8,22:21">Le 19:5-8; 22:21</A>).

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4-11. the two kidneys .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of the flock .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
 the whole rump</B>--There is, in Eastern countries, a species of sheep 
 the tails of which are not less than four feet and a half in length. 
 These tails are of a substance between fat and marrow. A sheep of this 
 kind weighs sixty or seventy English pounds weight, of which the tail 
 usually weighs fifteen pounds and upwards. This species is by far the 
 most numerous in Arabia, Syria, and Palestine, and, forming probably a 
 large portion in the flocks of the Israelites, it seems to have been 
 the kind that usually bled on the Jewish altars. The extraordinary size 
 and deliciousness of their tails give additional importance to this 
 law. To command by an express law the tail of a certain sheep to be 
 offered in sacrifice to God, might well surprise us; but the wonder 
 ceases, when we are told of those broad-tailed Eastern sheep, and of 
 the extreme delicacy of that part which was so particularly specified 
 in the statute [P<FONT SIZE=-1>AXTON</FONT>].</P>

 them, might be used. The prohibition of blood rested on a different 
 foundation, being intended to preserve their reverence for the Messiah, 
 who was to shed His blood as an stoning sacrifice for the sins of the 
 world [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ROWN</FONT>].</P>

 considered, in a certain sense, as committed "through ignorance," 
 error, or misapprehension of one's true interests. The sins, however,

 transgression of any part of the divine law, therefore, whether done 
 unconsciously or heedlessly, was a very serious offense, both as

 prescribed for the burnt offerings, he was to take it into the holy 
 place and sprinkle the atoning blood seven times before the veil, and 
 tip with the crimson fluid the horns of the golden altar of incense, on 
 his way to the court of the priests,--a solemn ceremonial appointed 
 only for very grave and heinous offenses, and which betokened that his 
 sin, though done in ignorance, had vitiated all his services; nor could 
 any official duty he engaged in be beneficial either to himself or the 
 people, unless it were atoned for by blood.</P>

 <B>13-21. if the whole congregation of Israel sin through 
 ignorance</B>--In consequence of some culpable neglect or 
 misapprehension of the law, the people might contract national guilt, 
 and then national expiation was necessary. The same sacrifice was to be 
 offered as in the former case, but with this difference in the 
 ceremonial, that the elders or heads of the tribes, as representing the 
 people and being the principal aggressors in misleading the 
 congregation, laid their hands on the head of the victim. The priest 
 then took the blood into the holy place, where, after dipping his 
 finger in it seven times, he sprinkled the drops seven times before the 
 veil. This done, he returned to the court of the priests, and ascending 
 the altar, put some portion upon its horns; then he poured it out at 
 the foot of the altar. The fat was the only part of the animal which 
 was offered on the altar; for the carcass, with its appurtenances and 
 offals, was carried without the camp, into the place where the ashes 
 were deposited, and there consumed with fire.</P>

 this law.  The trespass of such a civil functionary being less serious 
 in its character and consequences than that either of the high priest 
 or the congregation, a sin offering of inferior value was required--"a 
 kid of the goats"; and neither was the blood carried into the 
 sanctuary, but applied only to the altar of burnt offering; nor was the 
 carcass taken without the camp; it was eaten by the 
 priests-in-waiting.</P>

 In these two latter instances, the blood of the sin offering was
 applied to the altar of burnt offering--the place where bloody 
 sacrifices were appointed to be immolated. But the transgression of a 
 high priest, or of the whole congregation, entailing a general taint on 
 the ritual of the tabernacle, and vitiating its services, required a 
 further expiation; and therefore, in these cases, the blood of the sin 
 offering was applied to the altar of incense

 conscience suspects, though the understanding be in doubt whether 
 criminality or sin has been committed. The Jewish rabbis give, as an 
 example, the case of a person who, knowing that "the fat of the 
 inwards" is not to be eaten, religiously abstained from the use of it; 
 but should a dish happen to have been at table in which he had reason 
 to suspect some portion of that meat was intermingled, and he had,

 law, the record of which should have been joined with the previous 
 chapter, was given concerning things stolen, fraudulently gotten, or 
 wrongfully kept. The offender was enjoined to make restitution of the 
 articles to the rightful owner, along with a fifth part out of his own 
 possessions.  But it was not enough thus to repair the injury done to a 
 neighbor and to society; he was required to bring a trespass offering, 
 as a token of sorrow and penitence for having hurt the cause of 
 religion and of God.  That trespass offering was a ram without blemish, 
 which was to be made on the altar of burnt offerings, and the flesh 
 belonged to the priests.  This penalty was equivalent to a mitigated 
 fine; but being associated with a sacred duty, the form in which the 
 fine was inflicted served the important purpose of rousing attention to 
 the claims and reviving a sense of responsibility to God.</P>

 smoke." The daily service consisted of two lambs, one offered in the 
 morning at sunrise, the other in the evening, when the day began to 
 decline. Both of them were consumed on the altar by means of a slow 
 fire, before which the pieces of the sacrifice were so placed that they 
 fed it all night. At all events, the observance of this daily sacrifice 
 on the altar of burnt offering was a daily expression of national 
 repentance and faith.  The fire that consumed these sacrifices had been

 it but the members of a priestly family--and not even they, if under 
 any ceremonial defilement. The flesh on all occasions was boiled or 
 sodden, with the exception of the paschal lamb, which was roasted

 imbibe some of the liquid particles, it was to be broken; if a metallic

 reverse--because the flesh of the sin offering having been boiled in 
 them, those vessels were now too sacred for ordinary use. The design of

 butcher-meat is generally eaten the day it is killed, and it is rarely

 <B>3-5. gather thou all the congregation together,</B> &c.--It was 
 manifestly expedient for the Israelitish people to be satisfied that 
 Aaron's appointment to the high dignity of the priesthood was not a 
 personal intrusion, nor a family arrangement between him and Moses; and 
 nothing, therefore, could be a more prudent or necessary measure, for 
 impressing a profound conviction of the divine origin and authority of 
 the priestly institution, than to summon a general assembly of the 
 people, and in their presence perform the solemn ceremonies of 
 inauguration, which had been prescribed by divine authority.</P>

 they were subjected to entire ablution, though on ordinary occasions 
 they were required, before entering on their duties, only to wash their

 <B>7-9. he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the

 gorgeous tiara of the high priest, was intended, doubtless, in the 
 first instance, to produce in the minds of the people a high respect 
 for the ministers of religion; and in the next, from the predominant 
 use of linen, to inculcate upon Aaron and his sons the duty of 
 maintaining unspotted righteousness in their characters and lives.</P>

 undergo a week's probation in the court of the tabernacle before they 
 obtained permission to enter into the interior of the sacred building.  
 During the whole of that period the same sacrificial rites were 
 observed as on the first day, and they were expressly admonished that 
 the smallest breach of any of the appointed observances would lead to 
 the certain forfeiture of their lives

 <B>1-7. Moses called .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Take thee a young calf for a sin 
 offering</B>--The directions in these sacred things were still given by 
 Moses, the circumstances being extraordinary. But he was only the 
 medium of communicating the divine will to the newly made priests. The 
 first of their official acts was the sacrifice of another sin offering 
 to atone for the defects of the inauguration services; and yet that 
 sacrifice did not consist of a bullock--the sacrifice appointed for 
 some particular transgression, but of a calf, perhaps not without a 
 significant reference to Aaron's sin in the golden calf

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:22-24">Ex 32:22-24</A>].

 Then followed a burnt offering, expressive of their voluntary and
 entire self-devotement to the divine service. The newly consecrated 
 priests having done this on their own account, they were called to 
 offer a sin offering and burnt offering for the people, ending the 
 ceremonial by a peace offering, which was a sacred feast. This 
 injunction, "to make atonement for himself and for the people" 
 (<I>Septuagint,</I> "for thy family"), at the commencement of his 
 sacred functions, furnishes a striking evidence of the divine origin of 
 the Jewish system of worship. In all false or corrupt forms of 
 religion, the studied policy has been to inspire the people with an 
 idea of the sanctity of the priesthood as in point of purity and favor 
 with the Divinity far above the level of other men. But among the 
 Hebrews the priests were required to offer for the expiation of their 
 own sins as well as the humblest of the people. This imperfection of 
 Aaron's priesthood, however, does not extend to the gospel 
 dispensation: for our great High Priest, who has entered for us into 
 "the true tabernacle," "knew no sin"

 slain the victims with his own hands, as well as gone through all the

 therefore, instead of eating any part of their own sin offering, as 
 they were at liberty to do in the case of the people's offering, they 
 had to carry the whole carcasses "<I>without</I> the camp and burn them

 that chosen dwelling-place. The moment the solemn though welcome 
 spectacle was seen, a simultaneous shout of joy and gratitude burst 
 from the assembled congregation, and in the attitude of profoundest 
 reverence they worshipped "a present Deity."</P>

 <B>1. the sons of Aaron,</B> &c.--If this incident occurred at the 
 solemn period of the consecrating and dedicating the altar, these young 
 men assumed an office which had been committed to Moses; or if it were 
 some time after, it was an encroachment on duties which devolved on 
 their father alone as the high priest. But the offense was of a far 
 more aggravated nature than such a mere informality would imply. It 
 consisted not only in their venturing unauthorized to perform the 
 incense service--the highest and most solemn of the priestly 
 offices--not only in their engaging together in a work which was the 
 duty only of one, but in their presuming to intrude into the holy of 
 holies, to which access was denied to all but the high priest alone. In 
 this respect, "they offered strange fire before the Lord"; they were 
 guilty of a presumptuous and unwarranted intrusion into a sacred office 
 which did not belong to them. But their offense was more aggravated 
 still; for instead of taking the fire which was put into their censers 
 from the brazen altar, they seem to have been content with common fire 
 and thus perpetrated an act which, considering the descent of the 
 miraculous fire they had so recently witnessed and the solemn 
 obligation under which they were laid to make use of that which was 
 specially appropriated to the service of the altars, they betrayed a 
 carelessness, an irreverence, a want of faith, most surprising and 
 lamentable. A precedent of such evil tendency was dangerous, and it was 
 imperatively necessary, therefore, as well for the priests themselves 
 as for the sacred things, that a marked expression of the divine 
 displeasure should be given for doing that which "God commanded them 
 not."</P>

 that neither their bodies nor their robes were consumed. The
 expression, "from the Lord," indicates that this fire issued from the
 most holy place. In the destruction of these two young priests by the
 infliction of an awful judgment, the wisdom of God observed the same
 course, in repressing the first instance of contempt for sacred things,
 as he did at the commencement of the Christian dispensation

 resignation to what he saw was "the righteous judgment of God"

 <B>16-20. Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, 
 behold, it was burnt</B>--In a sacrifice presented, as that had been, 
 on behalf of the people, it was the duty of the priests, as typically 
 representing them and bearing their sins, to have eaten the flesh after 
 the blood had been sprinkled upon the altar. Instead of using it, 
 however, for a sacred feast, they had burnt it without the camp; and 
 Moses, who discovered this departure from the prescribed ritual, 
 probably from a dread of some further chastisements, challenged, not 
 Aaron, whose heart was too much lacerated to bear a new cause of 
 distress but his two surviving sons in the priesthood for the great 
 irregularity. Their father, however, who heard the charge and by whose 
 directions the error had been committed, hastened to give the 
 explanation. The import of his apology is, that all the duty pertaining 
 to the presentation of the offering had been duly and sacredly 
 performed, except the festive part of the observance, which privately 
 devolved upon the priest and his family. And that this had been 
 omitted, either because his heart was too dejected to join in the 
 celebration of a cheerful feast, or that he supposed, from the 
 appalling judgments that had been inflicted, that all the services of 
 that occasion were so vitiated that he did not complete them. Aaron was 
 decidedly in the wrong. By the express command of God, the sin offering 
 was to be eaten in the holy place; and no fanciful view of expediency 
 or propriety ought to have led him to dispense at discretion with a 
 positive statute. The law of God was clear and, where that is the case, 
 it is sin to deviate a hair's breadth from the path of duty.  But Moses 
 sympathized with his deeply afflicted brother and, having pointed out 
 the error, said no more.</P>

 <B>1, 2. the Lord spake unto Moses and to Aaron</B>--These laws, being 
 addressed to both the civil and ecclesiastical rulers in Israel, may 
 serve to indicate the twofold view that is to be taken of them.  
 Undoubtedly the first and strongest reason for instituting a 
 distinction among meats was to discourage the Israelites from spreading 
 into other countries, and from general intercourse with the world--to 
 prevent them acquiring familiarity with the inhabitants of the 
 countries bordering on Canaan, so as to fall into their idolatries or 
 be contaminated with their vices: in short, to keep them a distinct and 
 peculiar people. To this purpose, no difference of creed, no system of 
 polity, no diversity of language or manner, was so subservient as a 
 distinction of meats founded on religion; and hence the Jews, who were 
 taught by education to abhor many articles of food freely partaken of 
 by other people, never, even during periods of great degeneracy, could 
 amalgamate with the nations among which they were dispersed. But 
 although this was the principal foundation of these laws, dietetic 
 reasons also had weight; for there is no doubt that the flesh of many 
 of the animals here ranked as unclean, is everywhere, but especially in 
 warm climates, less wholesome and adapted for food than those which 
 were allowed to be eaten. These laws, therefore, being subservient to 
 sanitary as well as religious ends, were addressed both to Moses and 
 Aaron.</P>

 <B>3-7. Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is cloven-footed, and cheweth 
 the cud</B>--Ruminating animals by the peculiar structure of their 
 stomachs digest their food more fully than others. It is found that in 
 the act of chewing the cud, a large portion of the poisonous properties 
 of noxious plants eaten by them, passes off by the salivary glands. 
 This power of secreting the poisonous effects of vegetables, is said to 
 be particularly remarkable in cows and goats, whose mouths are often 
 sore, and sometimes bleed, in consequence. Their flesh is therefore in 
 a better state for food, as it contains more of the nutritious juices, 
 is more easily digested in the human stomach, and is consequently more 
 easily assimilated. Animals which do not chew the cud, convert their 
 food less perfectly; their flesh is therefore unwholesome, from the 
 gross animal juices with which they abound, and is apt to produce 
 scorbutic and scrofulous disorders. But the animals that may be eaten 
 are those which "part the hoof as well as chew the cud," and this is 
 another means of freeing the flesh of the animal from noxious 
 substances. "In the case of animals with parted hoofs, when feeding in 
 unfavorable situations a prodigious amount of f&oelig;tid matter is
 discharged, and passes off between the toes; while animals with 
 undivided hoofs, feeding on the same ground, become severely affected 
 in the legs, from the poisonous plants among the pasture" [W<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>HITLAW</FONT>, <I>Code of Health</I>]. All experience attests 
 this, and accordingly the use of ruminating animals (that is, those 
 which both chew the cud and part the hoof) has always obtained in most 
 countries though it was observed most carefully by the people who were 
 favored with the promulgation of God's law.</P>

 Ishmael.</P>

 on its back; its feet are bare, its nails flat and round, except those

 <B>2. When a man shall have in the skin,</B> &c.--The fact of the 
 following rules for distinguishing the plague of leprosy being 
 incorporated with the Hebrew code of laws, proves the existence of the 
 odious disease among that people. But a short time, little more than a 
 year (if so long a period had elapsed since the exodus) when symptoms 
 of leprosy seem extensively to have appeared among them; and as they 
 could not be very liable to such a cutaneous disorder amid their active 
 journeyings and in the dry open air of Arabia, the seeds of the 
 disorder must have been laid in Egypt, where it has always been 
 endemic. There is every reason to believe that this was the case: that 
 the leprosy was not a family complaint, hereditary among the Hebrews, 
 but that they got it from intercourse with the Egyptians and from the 
 unfavorable circumstances of their condition in the house of bondage. 
 The great excitement and irritability of the skin in the hot and sandy 
 regions of the East produce a far greater predisposition to leprosy of 
 all kinds than in cooler temperatures; and cracks or blotches, 
 inflammations or even contusions of the skin, very often lead to these 
 in Arabia and Palestine, to some extent, but particularly in Egypt. 
 Besides, the subjugated and distressed state of the Hebrews in the 
 latter country, and the nature of their employment, must have rendered 
 them very liable to this as well as to various other blemishes and 
 misaffections of the skin; in the production of which there are no 
 causes more active or powerful than a depressed state of body and mind, 
 hard labor under a burning sun, the body constantly covered with the 
 excoriating dust of brick fields, and an impoverished diet--to all of 
 which the Israelites were exposed while under the Egyptian bondage. It 
 appears that, in consequence of these hardships, there was, even after 
 they had left Egypt, a general predisposition among the Hebrews to the 
 contagious forms of leprosy--so that it often occurred as a consequence 
 of various other affections of the skin. And hence all cutaneous 
 blemishes or blains--especially such as had a tendency to terminate in 
 leprosy--were watched with a jealous eye from the first [G<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OOD</FONT>, <I>Study of Medicine</I>].  A swelling, a pimple, 
 or bright spot on the skin, created a strong ground of suspicion of a 
 man's being attacked by the dreaded disease.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest,</B> &c.--Like the 
 Egyptian priests, the Levites united the character of physician with 
 that of the sacred office; and on the appearance of any suspicious 
 eruptions on the skin, the person having these was brought before the 
 priest--not, however, to receive medical treatment, though it is not 
 improbable that some purifying remedies might be prescribed, but to be 
 examined with a view to those sanitary precautions which it belonged to 
 legislation to adopt.</P>

 <A NAME="Le13_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3-6. the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the 
 flesh,</B> &c.--The leprosy, as covering the person with a white, scaly 
 scurf, has always been accounted an offensive blemish rather than a 
 serious malady in the East, unless when it assumed its less common and 
 malignant forms. When a Hebrew priest, after a careful inspection, 
 discovered under the cutaneous blemish the distinctive signs of 
 contagious leprosy, the person was immediately pronounced unclean, and 
 is supposed to have been sent out of the camp to a lazaretto provided 
 for that purpose. If the symptoms appeared to be doubtful, he ordered 
 the person to be kept in domestic confinement for seven days, when he 
 was subjected to a second examination; and if during the previous week 
 the eruption had subsided or appeared to be harmless, he was instantly 
 discharged. But if the eruption continued unabated and still doubtful, 
 he was put under surveillance another week; at the end of which the 
 character of the disorder never failed to manifest itself, and he was 
 either doomed to perpetual exclusion from society or allowed to go at 
 large. A person who had thus been detained on suspicion, when at length 
 set at liberty, was obliged to "wash his clothes," as having been 
 tainted by ceremonial pollution; and the purification through which he 
 was required to go was, in the spirit of the Mosaic dispensation, 
 symbolical of that inward purity it was instituted to promote.</P>

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:6">Le 13:6</A>]

 --that is, the obscure or dusky leprosy, in which the natural color of
 the hair (which in Egypt and Palestine is black) is not changed, as is 
 repeatedly said in the sacred code, nor is there any depression in the 
 dusky spot, while the patches, instead of keeping stationary to their 
 first size, are perpetually enlarging their boundary. The patient 
 laboring under this form was pronounced unclean by the Hebrew priest or 
 physician, and hereby sentenced to a separation from his family and 
 friends--a decisive proof of its being contagious.</P>

 <B>9-37. if the rising be white</B>--This <FONT SIZE=-1>BRIGHT 
 WHITE</FONT> leprosy is the most malignant and inveterate of all the 
 varieties the disease exhibits, and it was marked by the following 
 distinctive signs: A glossy white and spreading scale, upon an elevated 
 base, the elevation depressed in the middle, but without a change of 
 color; the black hair on the patches participating in the whiteness, 
 and the scaly patches themselves perpetually enlarging their boundary. 
 Several of these characteristics, taken separately, belong to other 
 blemishes of the skin as well; so that none of them was to be taken 
 alone, and it was only when the whole of them concurred that the Jewish 
 priest, in his capacity of physician, was to pronounce the disease a 
 malignant leprosy. If it spread over the entire frame without producing 
 any ulceration, it lost its contagious power by degrees; or, in other 
 words, it ran through its course and exhausted itself. In that case, 
 there being no longer any fear of further evil, either to the 
 individual himself or to the community, the patient was declared clean 
 by the priest, while the dry scales were yet upon him, and restored to 
 society. If, on the contrary, the patches ulcerated and quick or 
 fungous flesh sprang up in them, the purulent matter of which, if 
 brought into contact with the skin of other persons, would be taken 
 into the constitution by means of absorbent vessels, the priest was at 
 once to pronounce it an inveterate leprosy.  A temporary confinement 
 was them declared to be totally unnecessary, and he was regarded as 
 unclean for life [D<FONT SIZE=-1>R.</FONT> G<FONT SIZE=-1>OOD</FONT>].
 Other skin affections, which had a tendency to terminate in leprosy, 
 though they were not decided symptoms when alone, were: "a boil"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:18-23">Le 13:18-23</A>);

 <B>38, 39. If a man .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or a woman have in the skin of 
 their flesh bright spots</B>--This modification of the leprosy is 
 distinguished by a dull white color, and it is entirely a cutaneous 
 disorder, never injuring the constitution. It is described as not 
 penetrating below the skin of the flesh and as not rendering necessary 
 an exclusion from society. It is evident, then, that this common form 
 of leprosy is not contagious; otherwise Moses would have prescribed as 
 strict a quarantine in this as in the other cases. And hereby we see 
 the great superiority of the Mosaic law (which so accurately 
 distinguished the characteristics of the leprosy and preserved to 
 society the services of those who were laboring under the uncontagious 
 forms of the disease) over the customs and regulations of Eastern 
 countries in the present day, where all lepers are indiscriminately 
 proscribed and are avoided as unfit for free intercourse with their 
 fellow men.</P>

 "the putting a covering upon the upper lip," that means either wearing 
 a moustache, as the Hebrews used to shave the upper lip [C<FONT

 <B>47-59. The garment .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. leprosy 
 is in</B>--It is well known that infectious diseases, such as scarlet 
 fever, measles, the plague, are latently imbibed and carried by the 
 clothes. But the language of this passage clearly indicates a disease 
 to which clothes themselves were subject, and which was followed by 
 effects on them analogous to those which malignant leprosy produces on 
 the human body--for similar regulations were made for the rigid 
 inspection of suspected garments by a priest as for the examination of 
 a leprous person. It has long been conjectured and recently ascertained 
 by the use of a lens, that the leprous condition of swine is produced 
 by myriads of minute insects engendered in their skin; and regarding 
 all leprosy as of the same nature, it is thought that this affords a 
 sufficient reason for the injunction in the Mosaic law to destroy the 
 clothes in which the disease, after careful observation, seemed to 
 manifest itself. Clothes are sometimes seen contaminated by this 
 disease in the West Indies and the southern parts of America [W<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>HITLAW</FONT>, <I>Code of Health</I>]; and it may be presumed 
 that, as the Hebrews were living in the desert where they had not the 
 convenience of frequent changes and washing, the clothes they wore and 
 the skin mats on which they lay, would be apt to breed infectious 
 vermin, which, being settled in the stuff, would imperceptibly gnaw it 
 and leave stains similar to those described by Moses. It is well known 
 that the wool of sheep dying of disease, if it had not been shorn from 
 the animal while living, and also skins, if not thoroughly prepared by 
 scouring, are liable to the effects described in this passage. The 
 stains are described as of a greenish or reddish color, according, 
 perhaps, to the color or nature of the ingredients used in preparing 
 them; for acids convert blue vegetable colors into red and alkalis 
 change then into green [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ROWN</FONT>].  It appears, then, 
 that the leprosy, though sometimes inflicted as a miraculous judgment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:10,2Ki+5:27">Nu 12:10;
 2Ki 5:27</A>)

 was a natural disease, which is known in Eastern countries still; while
 the rules prescribed by the Hebrew legislator for distinguishing the 
 true character and varieties of the disease and which are far superior 
 to the method of treatment now followed in those regions, show the 
 divine wisdom by which he was guided. Doubtless the origin of the 
 disease is owing to some latent causes in nature; and perhaps a more 
 extended acquaintance with the arch&aelig;ology of Egypt and the 
 natural history of the adjacent countries, may confirm the opinion that 
 leprosy results from noxious insects or a putrid fermentation. But 
 whatever the origin or cause of the disease, the laws enacted by divine 
 authority regarding it, while they pointed in the first instance to 
 sanitary ends, were at the same time intended, by stimulating to 
 carefulness against ceremonial defilement, to foster a spirit of 
 religious fear and inward purity.</P>

 <B>2, 3. law of the leper in the day of his cleansing</B>--Though quite 
 convalescent, a leper was not allowed to return to society immediately 
 and at his own will. The malignant character of his disease rendered 
 the greatest precautions necessary to his re-admission among the 
 people. One of the priests most skilled in the diagnostics of disease 
 [G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT>], being deputed to attend such outcasts, 
 the restored leper appeared before this official, and when after 
 examination a certificate of health was given, the ceremonies here 
 described were forthwith observed outside the camp.</P>

 <A NAME="Le14_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4. two birds</B>--literally, "sparrows." The <I>Septuagint,</I> 
 however, renders the expression "little birds"; and it is evident that 
 it is to be taken in this generic sense from their being specified as 
 "clean"--a condition which would have been altogether superfluous to 
 mention in reference to sparrows. In all the offerings prescribed in 
 the law, Moses ordered only common and accessible birds; and hence we 
 may presume that he points here to such birds as sparrows or pigeons, 
 as in the desert it might have been very difficult to procure wild 
 birds alive.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>cedar-wood, and scarlet, and hyssop</B>--The cedar here meant was 
 certainly not the famous tree of Lebanon, and it is generally supposed 
 to have been the juniper, as several varieties of that shrub are found 
 growing abundantly in the clefts and crevices of the Sinaitic 
 mountains. A stick of this shrub was bound to a bunch of hyssop by a 
 scarlet ribbon, and the living bird was to be so attached to it, that 
 when they dipped the branches in the water, the tail of the bird might 
 also be moistened, but not the head nor the wings, that it might not be 
 impeded in its flight when let loose.</P>

 <A NAME="Le14_5"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>5-9. the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed 
 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  over running water</B>--As the blood of a single bird 
 would not have been sufficient to immerse the body of another bird, it 
 was mingled with spring water to increase the quantity necessary for 
 the appointed sprinklings, which were to be repeated <I>seven 
 times,</I> denoting a complete purification. (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:10,Ps+51:2,Mt+8:4,Lu+5:14">2Ki 5:10;
 Ps 51:2; 
 Mt 8:4; 
 Lu 5:14</A>).

 The living bird being then set free, in token of the leper's release
 from quarantine, the priest pronounced him clean; and this official 
 declaration was made with all solemnity, in order that the mind of the 
 leper might be duly impressed with a sense of the divine goodness, and 
 that others might be satisfied they might safely hold intercourse with 
 him. Several other purifications had to be gone through during a series 
 of seven days, and the whole process had to be repeated on the seventh, 
 ere he was allowed to re-enter the camp. The circumstance of a priest 
 being employed seems to imply that instruction suitable to the newly 
 recovered leper would be given, and that the symbolical ceremonies used 
 in the process of cleansing leprosy would be explained. How far they 
 were then understood we cannot tell. But we can trace some instructive 
 analogies between the leprosy and the disease of sin, and between the 
 rites observed in the process of cleansing leprosy and the provisions 
 of the Gospel. The chief of these analogies is that as it was only when 
 a leper exhibited a certain change of state that orders were given by 
 the priest for a sacrifice, so a sinner must be in the exercise of 
 faith and penitence ere the benefits of the gospel remedy can be 
 enjoyed by him. The slain bird and the bird let loose are supposed to 
 typify, the one the death, and the other the resurrection of Christ; 
 while the sprinklings on him that had been leprous typified the 
 requirements which led a believer to cleanse himself from all 
 filthiness of the flesh and spirit, and to perfect his holiness in the 
 fear of the Lord.</P>

 <B>10-20. on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, 
 and one ewe-lamb of the first year without blemish</B>--The 
 purification of the leper was not completed till at the end of seven 
 days, after the ceremonial of the birds

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:4-7">Le 14:4-7</A>]

 and during which, though permitted to come into the camp, he had to
 tarry abroad out of his tent

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:8">Le 14:8</A>],

 from which he came daily to appear at the door of the tabernacle with
 the offerings required. He was presented before the Lord by the priest 
 that made him clean. And hence it has always been reckoned among pious 
 people the first duty of a patient newly restored from a long and 
 dangerous sickness to repair to the church to offer his thanksgiving, 
 where his body and soul, in order to be an acceptable offering, must be 
 presented by our great Priest, whose blood alone makes any clean. The 
 offering was to consist of two lambs, the one was to be a sin offering, 
 and an ephah of fine flour (two pints equals one-tenth), and one log 
 (half pint) of oil

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+2:1">Le 2:1</A>).

 One of the lambs was for a trespass offering, which was necessary from
 the inherent sin of his nature or from his defilement of the camp by 
 his leprosy previous to his expulsion; and it is remarkable that the 
 blood of the trespass offering was applied exactly in the same 
 particular manner to the extremities of the restored leper, as that of 
 the ram in the consecration of the priests

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:23">Le 8:23</A>].

 The parts sprinkled with this blood were then anointed with oil--a
 ceremony which is supposed to have borne this spiritual import: that 
 while the blood was a token of forgiveness, the oil was an emblem of 
 healing--as the blood of Christ justifies, the influence of the Spirit 
 sanctifies. Of the other two lambs the one was to be a sin offering and 
 the other a burnt offering, which had also the character of a thank 
 offering for God's mercy in his restoration. And this was considered to 
 make atonement "for him"; that is, it removed that ceremonial pollution 
 which had excluded him from the enjoyment of religious ordinances, just 
 as the atonement of Christ restores all who are cleansed through faith 
 in His sacrifice to the privileges of the children of God.</P>

 <B>34-48. leprosy in a house</B>--This law was prospective, not to come 
 into operation till the settlement of the Israelites in Canaan. The 
 words, "I put the leprosy," has led many to think that this plague was 
 a judicial infliction from heaven for the sins of the owner; while 
 others do not regard it in this light, it being common in Scripture to 
 represent God as doing that which He only permits in His providence to 
 be done. Assuming it to have been a natural disease, a new difficulty 
 arises as to whether we are to consider that the house had become 
 infected by the contagion of leprous occupiers; or that the leprosy was 
 in the house itself. It is evident that the latter was the true state 
 of the case, from the furniture being removed out of it on the first 
 suspicion of disease on the walls. Some have supposed that the name of 
 leprosy was analogically applied to it by the Hebrews, as we speak of 
 cancer in trees when they exhibit corrosive effects similar to what the 
 disease so named produces on the human body; while others have 
 pronounced it a mural efflorescence or species of mildew on the wall 
 apt to be produced in very damp situations, and which was followed by 
 effects so injurious to health as well as to the stability of a house, 
 particularly in warm countries, as to demand the attention of a 
 legislator. Moses enjoined the priests to follow the same course and 
 during the same period of time for ascertaining the true character of 
 this disease as in human leprosy. If found leprous, the infected parts 
 were to be removed. If afterwards there appeared a risk of the 
 contagion spreading, the house was to be destroyed altogether and the 
 materials removed to a distance. The stones were probably rough, unhewn 
 stones, built up without cement in the manner now frequently used in 
 fences and plastered over, or else laid in mortar. The oldest examples 
 of architecture are of this character. The very same thing has to be 
 done still with houses infected with mural salt. The stones covered 
 with the nitrous incrustation must be removed, and if the infected wall 
 is suffered to remain, it must be plastered all over anew.</P>

 <B>48-57. the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the 
 plague is healed</B>--The precautions here described show that there is 
 great danger in warm countries from the house leprosy, which was likely 
 to be increased by the smallness and rude architecture of the houses in 
 the early ages of the Israelitish history. As a house could not 
 contract any impurity in the sight of God, the "atonement" which the 
 priest was to make for it must either have a reference to the sins of 
 its occupants or to the ceremonial process appointed for its 
 purification, the very same as that observed for a leprous person. This 
 solemn declaration that it was "clean," as well as the offering made on 
 the occasion, was admirably calculated to make known the fact, to 
 remove apprehension from the public mind, as well as relieve the owner 
 from the aching suspicion of dwelling in an infected house.</P>

 as His family, His servants and priests, dwelling in the camp as in a 
 holy place, consecrated by His presence and His tabernacle, He required 
 of them complete purity, and did not allow them to come before Him when 
 defiled, even by involuntary or secret impurities, as a want of respect 
 due to His majesty. And when we bear in mind that God was training a 
 people to live in His presence in some measure as priests devoted to 
 His service, we shall not consider these rules for the maintenance of 
 personal purity either too stringent or too minute

 <B>1. after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered 
 before the Lord, and died</B>--It is thought by some that this chapter 
 has been transposed out of its right place in the sacred record, which 
 was immediately after the narrative of the deaths of Nadab and Abihu

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:1-20">Le 10:1-20</A>].

 That appalling catastrophe must have filled Aaron with painful
 apprehensions lest the guilt of these two sons might be entailed on his 
 house, or that other members of his family might share the same fate by 
 some irregularities or defects in the discharge of their sacred 
 functions. And, therefore, this law was established, by the due 
 observance of whose requirements the Aaronic order would be securely 
 maintained and accepted in the priesthood.</P>

 <A NAME="Le16_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into 
 the holy place within the veil,</B> &c.--Common priests went every day 
 into the part of the sanctuary <I>without</I> the veil to burn incense 
 on the golden altar. But none except the high priest was allowed to 
 enter <I>within</I> the veil, and that only once a year with the 
 greatest care and solemnity. This arrangement was evidently designed to 
 inspire a reverence for the most holy place, and the precaution was 
 necessary at a time when the presence of God was indicated by sensible 
 symbols, the impression of which might have been diminished or lost by 
 daily and familiar observation.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>I will appear in the cloud</B>--that is, the smoke of the incense 
 which the high priest burnt on his yearly entrance into the most holy 
 place: and this was the cloud which at that time covered the mercy 
 seat.</P>

 <A NAME="Le16_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3, 4. Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place</B>--As the duties 
 of the great day of atonement led to the nearest and most solemn 
 approach to God, the directions as to the proper course to be followed 
 were minute and special.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>with a young bullock .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and a ram</B>--These victims he 
 brought alive, but they were not offered in sacrifice till he had gone 
 through the ceremonies described between

 He was not to attire himself on that occasion in the splendid robes
 that were proper to his sacred office, but in a plain dress of linen, 
 like the common Levites, for, as he was then to make atonement for his 
 own sins, as well as for those of the people, he was to appear in the 
 humble character of a suppliant.  That plain dress was more in harmony 
 with a season of humiliation (as well as lighter and more convenient 
 for the duties which on that occasion he had singly to perform) than 
 the gorgeous robes of the pontificate. It showed that when all appeared 
 as sinners, the highest and lowest were then on a level, and that there 
 is no distinction of persons with God

 <B>5-10. shall take of the congregation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. two kids of the 
 goats .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  and one ram</B>--The sacrifices were to be 
 offered by the high priest, respectively for himself and the other 
 priests, as well as for the people. The bullock

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:3">Le 16:3</A>)

 and the goats were for sin offerings and the rams for burnt offerings.
 The goats, though used in different ways, constituted only one 
 offering. They were both presented before the Lord, and the disposal of 
 them determined by lot, which Jewish writers have thus described: The 
 priest, placing one of the goats on his right hand and the other on his 
 left, took his station by the altar, and cast into an urn two pieces of 
 gold exactly similar, inscribed, the one with the words "for the Lord," 
 and the other for "Azazel" (the scapegoat).  After having well shaken 
 them together, he put both his hands into the box and took up a lot in 
 each: that in his right hand he put on the head of the goat which stood 
 on his right, and that in his left he dropped on the other. In this 
 manner the fate of each was decided.</P>

 <B>11-19. Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering which is 
 for himself,</B> &c.--The first part of the service was designed to 
 solemnize his own mind, as well as the minds of the people, by offering 
 the sacrifices for their sins. The sin offerings being slain had the 
 sins of the offerer judicially transferred to them by the imputation of 
 his hands on their head

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:4,15,24,29,33">Le 4:4, 15, 24, 29, 33</A>);

 and thus the young bullock, which was to make atonement for himself and
 the other priests (called "his house,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:19">Ps 135:19</A>),

 was killed by the hands of the high priest. While the blood of the
 victim was being received into a vessel, taking a censer of live coals 
 in his right hand and a platter of sweet incense in his left, he, amid 
 the solemn attention and the anxious prayers of the assembled 
 multitude, crossed the porch and the holy place, opened the outer veil 
 which led into the holy of holies and then the inner veil. Standing 
 before the ark, he deposited the censer of coals on the floor, emptied 
 the plate of incense into his hand, poured it on the burning coals; and 
 the apartment was filled with fragrant smoke, intended, according to 
 Jewish writers, to prevent any presumptuous gazer prying too curiously 
 into the form of the mercy seat, which was the Lord's throne. The high 
 priest having done this, perfumed the sanctuary, returned to the door, 
 took the blood of the slain bullock, and, carrying it into the holy of 
 holies, sprinkled it with his finger once upon the mercy seat 
 "eastward"--that is, on the side next to himself; and seven times 
 "before the mercy seat"--that is, on the front of the ark. Leaving the 
 coals and the incense burning, he went out a second time, to sacrifice 
 at the altar of burnt offering the goat which had been assigned as a 
 sin offering for the people; and carrying its blood into the holy of 
 holies, he made similar sprinklings as he had done before with the 
 blood of the bullock. While the high priest was thus engaged in the 
 most holy place, none of the ordinary priests were allowed to remain 
 within the precincts of the tabernacle.  The sanctuary or holy place 
 and the altar of burnt offering were in like manner sprinkled seven 
 times with the blood of the bullock and the goat. The object of this 
 solemn ceremonial was to impress the minds of the Israelites with the 
 conviction that the whole tabernacle was stained by the sins of a 
 guilty people, that by their sins they had forfeited the privileges of 
 the divine presence and worship, and that an atonement had to be made 
 as the condition of God's remaining with them. The sins and 
 shortcomings of the past year having polluted the sacred edifice, the 
 expiation required to be annually renewed. The exclusion of the priests 
 indicated their unworthiness and the impurities of their service. The 
 mingled blood of the two victims being sprinkled on the horns of the 
 altar indicated that the priests and the people equally needed an 
 atonement for their sins. But the sanctuary being thus ceremonially 
 purified, and the people of Israel reconciled by the blood of the 
 consecrated victim, the Lord continued to dwell in the midst of them, 
 and to honor them with His gracious presence.</P>

 <B>20-22. he shall bring the live goat</B>--Having already been 
 presented before the Lord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:10">Le 16:10</A>),

 it was now brought forward to the high priest, who, placing his hands
 upon its head, and "having confessed over it all the iniquities of the 
 people of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins," 
 transferred them by this act to the goat as their substitute. It was 
 then delivered into the hands of a person, who was appointed to lead 
 him away into a distant, solitary, and desert place, where in early 
 times he was let go, to escape for his life; but in the time of Christ, 
 he was carried to a high rock twelve miles from Jerusalem, and there, 
 being thrust over the precipice, he was killed. Commentators have 
 differed widely in their opinions about the character and purpose of 
 this part of the ceremonial; some considering the word "Azazel," with 
 the <I>Septuagint</I> and our translators, to mean, "the scapegoat"; 
 others, "a lofty, precipitous rock"

 [B<FONT SIZE=-1>OCHART</FONT>]; 
 
 others, "a thing separated to God"

 [E<FONT SIZE=-1>WALD</FONT>,

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HOLUCK</FONT>];

 while others think it designates Satan

 [G<FONT SIZE=-1>ESENIUS</FONT>,

 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGSTENBERG</FONT>].

 This last view is grounded on the idea of both goats forming one and
 the same sacrifice of atonement, and it is supported by

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:1-10">Zec 3:1-10</A>,

 which presents a striking commentary on this passage. Whether there was
 in this peculiar ceremony any reference to an Egyptian superstition
 about Typhon, the spirit of evil, inhabiting the wilderness, and the 
 design was to ridicule it by sending a cursed animal into his gloomy 
 dominions, it is impossible to say. The subject is involved in much 
 obscurity. But in any view there seems to be a typical reference to 
 Christ who bore away our sins

 <B>23-28. Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and 
 shall put off the linen garments</B>--On the dismissal of the 
 scapegoat, the high priest prepared for the important parts of the 
 service which still remained; and for the performance of these he laid 
 aside his plain linen clothes, and, having bathed himself in water, he 
 assumed his pontifical dress. Thus gorgeously attired, he went to 
 present the burnt offerings which were prescribed for himself and the 
 people, consisting of the two rams which had been brought with the sin 
 offerings, but reserved till now. The fat was ordered to be burnt upon 
 the altar; the rest of the carcasses to be cut down and given to some 
 priestly attendants to burn without the camp, in conformity with the 
 general law for the sin offerings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:8-12,8:14-17">Le 4:8-12; 8:14-17</A>).

 The persons employed in burning them, as well as the conductor of the
 scapegoat, were obliged to wash their clothes and bathe their flesh in 
 water before they were allowed to return into the camp.</P>

 <B>29-34. this shall be a statute for ever unto you, that in the

 expiation for all the sins, irreverences, and impurities of all classes 
 in Israel during the previous year, was to be observed as a solemn 
 fast, in which "they were to afflict their souls"; it was reckoned a 
 sabbath, kept as a season of "holy convocation," or, assembling for 
 religious purposes.  All persons who performed any labor were subject 
 to the penalty of death

 as containing special allusion to the observances of the day, was
 publicly read. The rehearsal of these passages appointing the solemn 
 ceremonial was very appropriate, and the details of the successive 
 parts of it (above all the spectacle of the public departure of the 
 scapegoat under the care of its leader) must have produced salutary 
 impressions both of sin and of duty that would not be soon effaced.</P>

 <B>3, 4. What man .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. killeth an ox</B>--The Israelites, 
 like other people living in the desert, would not make much use of 
 animal food; and when they did kill a lamb or a kid for food, it would 
 almost always be, as in Abraham's entertainment of the angels

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:7">Ge 18:7</A>],

 an occasion of a feast, to be eaten in company. This was what was done
 with the peace offerings, and accordingly it is here enacted, that the 
 same course shall be followed in slaughtering the animals as in the 
 case of those offerings, namely, that they should be killed publicly, 
 and after being devoted to God, partaken of by the offerers. This law, 
 it is obvious, could only be observable in the wilderness while the 
 people were encamped within an accessible distance from the tabernacle.  
 The reason for it is to be found in the strong addictedness of the 
 Israelites to idolatry at the time of their departure from Egypt; and 
 as it would have been easy for any by killing an animal to sacrifice 
 privately to a favorite object of worship, a strict prohibition was 
 made against their slaughtering at home.  (See on

 by some commentators to refer to the Egyptians, so that the verse will

 they (the Egyptians) offer in the open field." The law is thought to

 the worship of the hirei-footed kind, such as Pan, Faunus, and Saturn, 
 whose recognized symbol was a goat. This was a form of idolatry 
 enthusiastically practised by the Egyptians, particularly in the nome 
 or province of Mendes. Pan was supposed especially to preside over 
 mountainous and desert regions, and it was while they were in the 
 wilderness that the Israelites seem to have been powerfully influenced 
 by a feeling to propitiate this idol. Moreover, the ceremonies observed 
 in this idolatrous worship were extremely licentious and obscene, and 
 the gross impurity of the rites gives great point and significance to 
 the expression of Moses, "they have gone a-whoring."</P>

 <B>8, 9. Whatsoever man .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. offereth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And 
 bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle</B>--Before the 
 promulgation of the law, men worshipped wherever they pleased or 
 pitched their tents. But after that event the rites of religion could 
 be acceptably performed only at the appointed place of worship. This 
 restriction with respect to place was necessary as a preventive of 
 idolatry; for it prohibited the Israelites, when at a distance, from 
 repairing to the altars of the heathen, which were commonly in groves 
 or fields.</P>

 <B>10. I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and

 Re 6:16; 
 Eze 38:18</A>).

 The manner in which God's face would be set against such an offender
 was, that if the crime were public and known, he was condemned to 
 death; if it were secret, vengeance would overtake him.  (See on

 <A HREF="JFB01.htm#Ge9_4">Ge 9:4</A>).

 But the practice against which the law is here pointed was an
 idolatrous rite. The Zabians, or worshippers of the heavenly host, were 
 accustomed, in sacrificing animals, to pour out the blood and eat a 
 part of the flesh at <I>the place</I> where the blood was poured out 
 (and sometimes the blood itself) believing that by means of it, 
 friendship, brotherhood, and familiarity were contracted between the 
 worshippers and the deities. They, moreover, supposed that the blood 
 was very beneficial in obtaining for them a vision of the demon during 
 their sleep, and a revelation of future events. The prohibition against 
 eating blood, viewed in the light of this historic commentary and 
 unconnected with the peculiar terms in which it is expressed, seems to 
 have been levelled against idolatrous practices, as is still further 
 evident from

 some laws that were widely different from the social customs that
 obtained both in Egypt and Canaan; for the enormities, which the laws
 enumerated in this chapter were intended to put down, were freely
 practised or publicly sanctioned in both of those countries; and,
 indeed, the extermination of the ancient Canaanites is described as
 owing to the abominations with which they had polluted the land.</P>

 <B>5. Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a

 the Israelites on condition of their obedience to the divine law; and 
 this promise was remarkably verified at particular eras of their 
 history, when pure and undefiled religion prevailed among them, in the 
 public prosperity and domestic happiness enjoyed by them as a people.  
 Obedience to the divine law always, indeed, ensures temporal 
 advantages; and this, doubtless, was the primary meaning of the words, 
 "which if a man do, he shall live in them." But that they had a higher 
 reference to spiritual life is evident from the application made of 
 them by our Lord

 <B>6. None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to 
 him</B>--Very great laxity prevailed amongst the Egyptians in their 
 sentiments and practice about the conjugal relation, as they not only 
 openly sanctioned marriages between brothers and sisters, but even 
 between parents and children. Such incestuous alliances Moses wisely 
 prohibited, and his laws form the basis upon which the marriage 
 regulations of this and other Christian nations are chiefly founded.  
 This verse contains a general summary of all the particular 
 prohibitions; and the forbidden intercourse is pointed out by the 
 phrase, "to approach to." In the specified prohibitions that follow, 
 all of which are included in this general summary, the prohibited 
 familiarity is indicated by the phrases, to "uncover the nakedness"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:12-17">Le 18:12-17</A>],
 
 to "take"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:17,18">Le 18:17, 18</A>],
 
 and to "lie with"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:22,23">Le 18:22, 23</A>].

 The phrase in this sixth verse, therefore, has the same identical
 meaning with each of the other three, and the marriages in reference to 
 which it is used are those of consanguinity or too close affinity, 
 amounting to incestuous connections.</P>

 <B>18.  Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex 
 her</B>--The original is rendered in the <I>Margin,</I> "neither shalt 
 thou take one wife to another to vex her," and two different and 
 opposite interpretations have been put upon this passage. The marginal 
 construction involves an express prohibition of polygamy; and, indeed, 
 there can be no doubt that the practice of having more wives than one 
 is directly contrary to the divine will. It was prohibited by the 
 original law of marriage, and no evidence of its lawfulness under the 
 Levitical code can be discovered, although Moses--from "the hardness of 
 their hearts"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:8,Mk+10:5">Mt 19:8;
 Mr 10:5</A>]

 --tolerated it in the people of a rude and early age.  The second
 interpretation forms the ground upon which the "vexed question" has 
 been raised in our times respecting the lawfulness of marriage with a 
 deceased wife's sister. Whatever arguments may be used to prove the 
 unlawfulness or inexpediency of such a matrimonial relation, the 
 passage under consideration cannot, on a sound basis of criticism, be 
 enlisted in the service; for the crimes with which it is here 
 associated warrant the conclusion that it points not to marriage with a 
 deceased wife's sister, but with a sister in the wife's lifetime, a 
 practice common among the ancient Egyptians, Chaldeans, and others.</P>

 <B>21. thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to 
 Molech,</B> &c.--Molech, or Moloch, which signifies "king," was the 
 idol of the Ammonites. His statue was of brass, and rested on a 
 pedestal or throne of the same metal. His head, resembling that of a 
 calf, was adorned with a crown, and his arms were extended in the
 attitude of embracing those who approached him. His devotees dedicated 
 their children to him; and when this was to be done, they heated the 
 statue to a high pitch of intensity by a fire within, and then the 
 infants were either shaken over the flames, or passed through the 
 ignited arms, by way of lustration to ensure the favor of the pretended 
 deity. The fire-worshippers asserted that all children who did not 
 undergo this purifying process would die in infancy; and the influence 
 of this Zabian superstition was still so extensively prevalent in the 
 days of Moses, that the divine lawgiver judged it necessary to prohibit 
 it by an express statute.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God</B>--by giving it to 
 false or pretended divinities; or, perhaps, from this precept standing 
 in close connection with the worship of Molech, the meaning rather is, 
 Do not, by devoting your children to him, give foreigners occasion to 
 blaspheme the name of your God as a cruel and sanguinary deity, who 
 demands the sacrifice of human victims, and who encourages cruelty in 
 his votaries.</P>

 together with some criminal enormities of an aggravated and unnatural
 character. In such prohibitions it was necessary for the instruction of 
 a people low in the scale of moral perception, that the enumeration 
 should be very specific as well as minute; and then, on completing it, 
 the divine lawgiver announces his own views of these crimes, without 
 any exception or modification, in the remarkable terms employed in this 
 verse.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before 
 you,</B> &c.--Ancient history gives many appalling proofs that the 
 enormous vices described in this chapter were very prevalent, nay, were 
 regularly practised from religious motives in the temples of Egypt and 
 the groves of Canaan; and it was these gigantic social disorders that 
 occasioned the expulsion, of which the Israelites were, in the hands of 
 a righteous and retributive Providence, the appointed instruments

 <B>25. therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it; and the land

 and incorrigible sinners, were to be exterminated; and this 
 extermination was manifestly a judicial punishment inflicted by a ruler 
 whose laws had been grossly and perseveringly outraged. But before a 
 law can be disobeyed, it must have been previously in existence; and 
 hence a law, prohibiting all the horrid crimes enumerated above--a law 
 obligatory upon the Canaanites as well as other nations--was already 
 known and in force before the Levitical law of incest was promulgated. 
 Some general Iaw, then, prohibiting these crimes must have been 
 published to mankind at a very early period of the world's history; and 
 that law must either have been the moral law, originally written on the 
 human heart, or a law on the institution of marriage revealed to Adam 
 and known to the Canaanites and others by tradition or otherwise.</P>

 the incestuous alliances and unnatural crimes prohibited in this 
 chapter were forbidden to all men by a law expressed or understood from 
 the beginning of the world, or at least from the era of the flood, 
 since God threatens to condemn and punish, in a manner so sternly 
 severe, these atrocities in the practice of the Canaanites and their

 Israel</B>--Many of the laws enumerated in this chapter had been 
 previously announced.  As they were, however, of a general application, 
 not suited to particular classes, but to the nation at large, so Moses 
 seems, according to divine instructions, to have rehearsed them, 
 perhaps on different occasions and to successive divisions of the 
 people, till "all the congregation of the children of Israel" were 
 taught to know them. The will of God in the Old as well as the New

 to be eaten on the day of their presentation; and if a freewill 
 offering, although it might be eaten on the second day, yet if any 
 remained of it till the third day, it was to be burnt, or deep 
 criminality was incurred by the person who then ventured to partake of 
 it. The reason of this strict prohibition seems to have been to prevent 
 any mysterious virtue being superstitiously attached to meat offered on 
 the altar.</P>

 <B>9, 10. And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not 
 wholly reap the corners of thy field</B>--The right of the poor in 
 Israel to glean after reapers, as well as to the unreaped corners of 
 the field, was secured by a positive statute; and this, in addition to 
 other enactments connected with the ceremonial law, formed a beneficial 
 provision for their support. At the same time, proprietors were not 
 obliged to admit them into the field until the grain had been carried 
 off the field; and they seem also to have been left at liberty to 
 choose the poor whom they deemed the most deserving or needful

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:2,8">Ru 2:2, 8</A>).

 This was the earliest law for the benefit of the poor that we read of
 in the code of any people; and it combined in admirable union the

 by calm and kindly reason, to bring him to a sense of his fault.

 Lord in a beautiful parable

 <B>thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed</B>--This also was 
 directed against an idolatrous practice, namely, that of the ancient 
 Zabians, or fire-worshippers, who sowed different seeds, accompanying 
 the act with magical rites and invocations; and commentators have 
 generally thought the design of this and the preceding law was to put 
 an end to the unnatural lusts and foolish superstitions which were 
 prevalent among the heathen. But the reason of the prohibition was 
 probably deeper: for those who have studied the diseases of land and 
 vegetables tell us, that the practice of mingling seeds is injurious 
 both to flowers and to grains. "If the various genera of the natural 
 order Gramine&aelig;, which includes the grains and the grasses, should 
 be sown in the same field, and flower at the same time, so that the 
 pollen of the two flowers mix, a spurious seed will be the consequence, 
 called by the farmers <I>chess.</I> It is always inferior and unlike 
 either of the two grains that produced it, in size, flavor, and 
 nutritious principles. Independently of contributing to disease the 
 soil, they never fail to produce the same in animals and men that feed 
 on them" [W<FONT SIZE=-1>HITLAW</FONT>].

 <B>neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon
 thee</B>--Although this precept, like the other two with which it is
 associated, was in all probability designed to root out some
 superstition, it seems to have had a further meaning. The law, it is to
 be observed, did not prohibit the Israelites wearing many different
 kinds of cloths together, but only the two specified; and the
 observations and researches of modern science have proved that "wool,
 when combined with linen, increases its power of passing off the
 electricity from the body. In hot climates, it brings on malignant
 fevers and exhausts the strength; and when passing off from the body,
 it meets with the heated air, inflames and excoriates like a blister"

 trees bear in their earliest years, but to pluck off the blossoms: and 
 for this reason, that they will thus thrive the better, and bear more 
 abundantly afterwards. The very expression, 'to regard them as
 uncircumcised,' suggests the propriety of pinching them off; I do not

 common way of foretelling good or bad fortune. Such absurd but

 <B>27. Ye shall not round the corners of your heads,</B> &c.--It seems
 probable that this fashion had been learned by the Israelites in Egypt,
 for the ancient Egyptians had their dark locks cropped short or shaved
 with great nicety, so that what remained on the crown appeared in the
 form of a circle surrounding the head, while the beard was dressed into
 a square form. This kind of coiffure had a highly idolatrous meaning;
 and it was adopted, with some slight variations, by almost all
 idolaters in ancient times. 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:25,26,25:23">Jer 9:25, 26; 25:23</A>,

 where "in the utmost corners" means having the corners of their hair
 cut.) Frequently a lock or tuft of hair was left on the hinder part of 
 the head, the rest being cut round in the form of a ring, as the Turks, 
 Chinese, and Hindus do at the present day.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>neither shalt thou mar,</B> &c.--The Egyptians used to cut or shave 
 off their whiskers, as may be seen in the coffins of mummies, and the 
 representations of divinities on the monuments. But the Hebrews, in 
 order to separate them from the neighboring nations, or perhaps to put 
 a stop to some existing superstition, were forbidden to imitate this 
 practice. It may appear surprising that Moses should condescend to such 
 minuti&aelig; as that of regulating the fashion of the hair and the 
 beard--matters which do not usually occupy the attention of a 
 legislator--and which appear widely remote from the province either of 
 government or of a religion. A strong presumption, therefore, arises

 practices of the Egyptians.</P>

 was deemed a becoming mark of respect for the dead, as well as a sort 
 of propitiatory offering to the deities who presided over death and the 
 grave. The Jews learned this custom in Egypt, and though weaned from 
 it, relapsed in a later and degenerate age into this old superstition

 is probable that a strong propensity to adopt such marks in honor of

 they were insuperable obstacles to a return. (See allusions to the

 cubits, they were stripped almost naked, and received some stupefying 
 draught, during which the witnesses prepared, by laying aside their 
 outer garments, to carry into execution the capital sentence which the 
 law bound them to do. The criminal, being placed on the edge of the 
 precipice, was then pushed backwards, so that he fell down the 
 perpendicular height on the stone lying below: if not killed by the

 <B>7-19. Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy</B>--The minute
 specification of the incestuous and unnatural crimes here enumerated
 shows their sad prevalence amongst the idolatrous nations around, and
 the extreme proneness of the Israelites to follow the customs of their

 the offender was "to be put to death" without describing the mode,
 stoning is meant. The only instance of another form of capital
 punishment occurs in

 lay, entailing ceremonial defilement

 all mourners were debarred from the tabernacle for a week; and as the
 exclusion of a priest during that period would have been attended with 
 great inconvenience, the whole order were enjoined to abstain from all 
 approaches to the dead, except at the funerals of relatives, to whom 
 affection or necessity might call them to perform the last offices. 
 Those exceptional cases, which are specified, were strictly confined to 
 the members of their own family, within the nearest degrees of

 But the priests were to be laid under a special injunction, not only
 that they might exhibit examples of piety in the moderation of their 
 grief, but also by the restraint of their passions, be the better 
 qualified to administer the consolations of religion to others, and

 which was granted to the common priests, was denied to him; for his
 absence from the sanctuary for the removal of any contracted defilement 
 could not have been dispensed with, neither could he have acted as 
 intercessor for the people, unless ceremonially clean. Moreover, the 
 high dignity of his office demanded a corresponding superiority in 
 personal holiness, and stringent rules were prescribed for the purpose 
 of upholding the suitable dignity of his station and family. The same 
 rules are extended to the families of Christian ministers

 malformation of body in the ministers of religion, which disturbs the 
 associations or excites ridicule, tends to detract from the weight and 
 authority of the sacred office. Priests laboring under any personal 
 defect were not allowed to officiate in the public service; they might 
 be employed in some inferior duties about the sanctuary but could not 
 perform any sacred office. In all these regulations for preserving the 
 unsullied purity of the sacred character and office, there was a 
 typical reference to the priesthood of Christ

 <B>2. Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves 
 from the holy things</B>--"To separate" means, in the language of the 
 Mosaic ritual, "to abstain"; and therefore the import of this 
 injunction is that the priests should abstain from eating that part of 
 the sacrifices which, though belonging to their order, was to be 
 partaken of only by such of them as were free from legal impurities.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow 
 unto me,</B> &c.--that is, let them not, by their want of due 
 reverence, give occasion to profane my holy name. A careless or

 <B>3. Whosoever he be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that goeth unto the holy 
 things</B>--The multitude of minute restrictions to which the priests, 
 from accidental defilement, were subjected, by keeping them constantly 
 on their guard lest they should be unfit for the sacred service, tended 
 to preserve in full exercise the feeling of awe and submission to the 
 authority of God. The ideas of sin and duty were awakened in their 
 breasts by every case to which either an interdict or an injunction was 
 applied. But why enact an express statute for priests disqualified by 
 the leprosy or polluting touch of a carcass

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+22:4">Le 22:4</A>],

 when a general law was already in force which excluded from society all
 persons in that condition? Because priests might be apt, from 
 familiarity, to trifle with religion, and in committing irregularities 
 or sins, to shelter themselves under the cloak of the sacred office. 
 This law, therefore, was passed, specifying the chief forms of 
 temporary defilement which excluded from the sanctuary, that priests
 might not deem themselves entitled to greater license than the rest of 
 the people; and that so far from being in any degree exempted from the 
 sanctions of the law, they were under greater obligations, by their 
 priestly station, to observe it in its strict letter and its smallest 
 enactments.</P>

 <A NAME="Le22_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4-6. wash his flesh with water</B>--Any Israelite who had contracted 
 a defilement of such a nature as debarred him from the enjoyment of his 
 wonted privileges, and had been legally cleansed from the disqualifying 
 impurity, was bound to indicate his state of recovery by the immersion 
 of his whole person in water. Although all ceremonial impurity formed a 
 ground of exclusion, there were degrees of impurity which entailed a 
 longer or shorter period of excommunication, and for the removal of 
 which different rites required to be observed according to the trivial 
 or the malignant nature of the case. A person who came inadvertently 
 into contact with an unclean animal was rendered unclean for a 
 specified period; and then, at the expiry of that term, he washed, in 
 token of his recovered purity. But a leper was unclean so long as he 
 remained subject to that disease, and on his convalescence, he also 
 washed, not to cleanse himself, for the water was ineffectual for that 
 purpose, but to signify that he was clean. Not a single case is 
 recorded of a leper being restored to communion by the use of water; it 
 served only as an outward and visible sign that such a restoration was
 to be made. The Book of Leviticus abounds with examples which show that 
 in all the ceremonial washings, as uncleanness meant loss of 
 privileges, so baptism with water indicated a restoration to those
 privileges. There was no exemption; for as the unclean Israelite was 
 exiled from the congregation, so the unclean priest was disqualified 
 from executing his sacred functions in the sanctuary; and in the case 
 of both, the same observance was required--a formal intimation of their 
 being readmitted to forfeited privileges was intimated by the appointed 
 rite of baptism. If any one neglected or refused to perform the 
 washing, he disobeyed a positive precept, and he remained in his 
 uncleanness; he forbore to avail himself of this privilege, and was 
 therefore said to be "cut off" from the presence of the Lord.</P>

 was restricted to the exclusive use of his own family. A temporary 
 guest or a hired servant was not at liberty to eat of them; but an 
 exception was made in favor of a bought or homeborn slave, because such 
 was a stated member of his household. On the same principle, his own 
 daughter, who married a husband not a priest, could not eat of them. 
 However, if a widow and childless, she was reinstated in the privileges 
 of her father's house as before her marriage. But if she had become a 
 mother, as her children had no right to the privileges of the 
 priesthood, she was under a necessity of finding support for them 
 elsewhere than under her father's roof.</P>

 meaning then is that the whole people would incur guilt through the 
 fault of the priests, if they should defile the sacred offerings, which 
 they would have done had they presented them while under any defilement 
 [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>]. According to others, "the children of 
 Israel" is the nominative in the sentence; which thus signifies, the 
 children of Israel shall not profane or defile their offerings, by 
 touching them or reserving any part of them, lest they incur the guilt 
 of eating what is divinely appointed to the priests alone [C<FONT

 <B>a male without blemish</B>--This law 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+1:3">Le 1:3</A>)

 is founded on a sense of natural propriety, which required the greatest
 care to be taken in the selection of animals for sacrifice. The reason 
 for this extreme caution is found in the fact that sacrifices are 
 either an expression of praise to God for His goodness, or else they 
 are the designed means of conciliating or retaining His favor. No 
 victim that was not perfect in its kind could be deemed a fitting 
 instrument for such purposes if we assume that the significance of 
 sacrifices is derived entirely from their relation to Jehovah. 
 Sacrifices may be likened to gifts made to a king by his subjects, and 
 hence the reasonableness of God's strong remonstrance with the 
 worldly-minded Jews

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:8">Mal 1:8</A>).

 If the tabernacle, and subsequently the temple, were considered the
 palace of the great King, then the sacrifices would answer to presents 
 as offered to a monarch on various occasions by his subjects; and in 
 this light they would be the appropriate expressions of their feelings 
 towards their sovereign. When a subject wished to do honor to his 
 sovereign, to acknowledge allegiance, to appease his anger, to 
 supplicate forgiveness, or to intercede for another, he brought a 
 present; and all the ideas involved in sacrifices correspond to these 
 sentiments--those of gratitude, of worship, of prayer, of confession 
 and atonement [B<FONT SIZE=-1>IB.</FONT> S<FONT SIZE=-1>AC.</FONT>].</P>

 while in summer the harvest and vintage gave busy employment in the 
 fields. Besides, another reason for the choice of those seasons 
 probably was to counteract the influence of Egyptian associations and 
 habits. And God appointed more sacred festivals for the Israelites in 
 the month of September than the people of Egypt had in honor of their 
 idols. These institutions, however, were for the most part prospective,

 The institution of the passover was intended to be a perpetual memorial
 of the circumstances attending the redemption of the Israelites, while 
 it had a typical reference to a greater redemption to be effected for 
 God's spiritual people. On the first and last days of this feast, the

 devoted to "holy convocation"--special seasons of social devotion. In 
 addition to the ordinary sacrifices of every day, there were to be 
 "offerings by fire" on the altar (see

 <B>10. ye shall bring a sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto
 the priest</B>--A sheaf, literally, an omer, of the first-fruits of the
 barley harvest. The barley being sooner ripe than the other grains, the
 reaping of it formed the commencement of the general harvest season.
 The offering described in this passage was made on the sixteenth of the
 first month, the day following the first Passover Sabbath, which was on
 the fifteenth (corresponding to the beginning of our April); but it was
 reaped after sunset on the previous evening by persons deputed to go
 with sickles and obtain samples from different fields. These, being
 laid together in a sheaf or loose bundle, were brought to the court of
 the temple, where the grain was winnowed, parched, and bruised in a
 mortar. Then, after some incense had been sprinkled on it, the priest
 waved the sheaf aloft before the Lord towards the four different points
 of the compass, took a part of it and threw it into the fire of the
 altar--all the rest being reserved to himself. It was a proper and
 beautiful act, expressive of dependence on the God of nature and
 providence--common among all people, but more especially becoming the
 Israelites, who owed their land itself as well as all it produced to
 the divine bounty. The offering of the wave-sheaf sanctified the whole
 harvest

 flour, the quantity contained in them being somewhat more than ten

 commencement, the two loaves solemnized the termination of the harvest

 The loaves used at the Passover were unleavened; those presented at
 Pentecost were leavened--a difference which is thus accounted for, that 
 the one was a memorial of the bread hastily prepared at their 
 departure, while the other was a tribute of gratitude to God for their 
 daily food, which was leavened.</P>

 <B>34-44. the feast of tabernacles, for seven days unto the 
 Lord</B>--This festival, which was instituted in grateful commemoration 
 of the Israelites having securely dwelt in booths or tabernacles in the 
 wilderness, was the third of the three great annual festivals, and, 
 like the other two, it lasted a week. It began on the fifteenth day of 
 the month, corresponding to the end of our September and beginning of 
 October, which was observed as a Sabbath; and it could be celebrated 
 only at the place of the sanctuary, offerings being made on the altar 
 every day of its continuance. The Jews were commanded during the whole 
 period of the festival to dwell in booths, which were erected on the 
 flat roofs of houses, in the streets or fields; and the trees made use 
 of are by some stated to be the citron, the palm, the myrtle, and the 
 willow, while others maintain the people were allowed to take any trees 
 they could obtain that were distinguished for verdure and fragrance.  
 While the solid branches were reserved for the construction of the 
 booths, the lighter branches were carried by men, who marched in 
 triumphal procession, singing psalms and crying "Hosanna!" which 
 signifies, "Save, we beseech thee!"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+118:15,25,26">Ps 118:15, 25, 26</A>).

 It was a season of great rejoicing. But the ceremony of drawing water
 from the pool, which was done on the last day, seems to have been the 
 introduction of a later period

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:37">Joh 7:37</A>).

 That last day was the eighth, and, on account of the scene at Siloam,
 was called "the great day of the feast." The feast of ingathering, when 
 the vintage was over, was celebrated also on that day

 vented his rage in some horrid form of impiety. It was a common
 practice among the Egyptians to curse their idols when disappointed in

 youth thought the greatest insult to his opponent was to blaspheme the 
 object of his religious reverence. He spoke disrespectfully of One who 
 sustained the double character of the King as well as the God of the 
 Hebrew people; as the offense was a new one, he was put in ward till

 questioned on what year, after the occupation of Canaan, the sabbatic
 year began to be observed. Some think it was the seventh year after
 their entrance. But others, considering that as the first six years
 were spent in the conquest and division of the land

 agriculture, maintain that the observance did not commence till the
 fourteenth year.

 <B>the land keep a sabbath unto the Lord</B>--This was a very peculiar
 arrangement. Not only all agricultural processes were to be intermitted
 every seventh year, but the cultivators had no right to the soil. It
 lay entirely fallow, and its spontaneous produce was the common
 property of the poor and the stranger, the cattle and game. This year
 of rest was to invigorate the productive powers of the land, as the
 weekly Sabbath was a refreshment to men and cattle. It commenced
 immediately after the feast of ingathering, and it was calculated to
 teach the people, in a remarkable manner, the reality of the presence

 horn or trumpet, began on the tenth day of the seventh month, or the
 great day of atonement, when, by order of the public authorities, the
 sound of trumpets proclaimed the beginning of the universal redemption.
 All prisoners and captives obtained their liberties, slaves were
 declared free, and debtors were absolved. The land, as on the sabbatic
 year, was neither sowed nor reaped, but allowed to enjoy with its
 inhabitants a sabbath of repose; and its natural produce was the common
 property of all. Moreover, every inheritance throughout the land of

 excluded, was a provision of great wisdom for preserving families and

 food which would otherwise have resulted from the suspension of all 
 labor during the sabbatic year. The sixth year was to yield a 
 miraculous supply for three continuous years. And the remark is

 might effect a temporary sale. But they possessed the right of

 liberty to make exchanges among themselves; and a priest might sell his 
 house, garden, and right of pasture to another priest, but not to an 
 Israelite of another tribe

 Israelite might be compelled, through misfortune, not only to mortgage 
 his inheritance, but himself. In the event of his being reduced to this 
 distress, he was to be treated not as a slave, but a hired servant 
 whose engagement was temporary, and who might, through the friendly aid 
 of a relative, be redeemed at any time before the Jubilee. The ransom 
 money was determined on a most equitable principle. Taking account of 
 the number of years from the proposal to redeem and the Jubilee, of the 
 current wages of labor for that time, and multiplying the remaining 
 years by that sum, the amount was to be paid to the master for his 
 redemption.  But if no such friendly interposition was made for a 
 Hebrew slave, he continued in servitude till the year of Jubilee, when, 
 as a matter of course, he regained his liberty, as well as his 
 inheritance. Viewed in the various aspects in which it is presented in 
 this chapter, the Jubilee was an admirable institution, and subservient 
 in an eminent degree to uphold the interests of religion, social order, 
 and freedom among the Israelites.</P>

 all times and in all places, been accustomed to present votive 
 offerings, either from gratitude for benefits received, or in the event 
 of deliverance from apprehended evil. And Moses was empowered, by 
 divine authority, to prescribe the conditions of this voluntary duty.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the persons shall be for the Lord,</B> &c.--better rendered
 thus:--"According to thy estimation, the persons shall be for the

 divine service, in some inferior or servile kind of work about the
 sanctuary 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:1">1Sa 3:1</A>).

 In the event of any change, the persons so devoted had the privilege in
 their power of redeeming themselves; and this chapter specifies the 
 amount of the redemption money, which the priest had the discretionary 
 power of reducing, as circumstances might seem to require. Those of 
 mature age, between twenty and sixty, being capable of the greatest 
 service, were rated highest; young people, from five till twenty, less, 
 because not so serviceable; infants, though devotable by their parents 
 before birth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:11">1Sa 1:11</A>),

 could not be offered nor redeemed till a month after birth; old people

 employed in common purposes nor exchanged for an equivalent--it must be 
 sacrificed--or if, through some discovered blemish, it was unsuitable 
 for the altar, it might be sold, and the money applied for the sacred 
 service. If an unclean beast--such as an ass or camel, for instance, 
 had been vowed, it was to be appropriated to the use of the priest at 
 the estimated value, or it might be redeemed by the person vowing on

 owner, but remained attached in perpetuity to the sanctuary. The reason
