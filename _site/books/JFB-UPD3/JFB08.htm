 <B>6, 7. Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return
 from the country of Moab</B>--The aged widow, longing to enjoy the
 privileges of Israel, resolved to return to her native land as soon as
 she was assured that the famine had ceased, and made the necessary
 arrangements with her daughters-in-law.</P>

 afterwards expressly sanctioned by the law of Moses

 which required a younger son to marry the widow of his deceased
 brother.</P>

 <B>12, 13. Turn again, my daughters, go your way</B>--That Naomi should
 dissuade her daughters-in-law so strongly from accompanying her to the
 land of Israel may appear strange. But it was the wisest and most
 prudent course for her to adopt: first, because they might be
 influenced by hopes which could not be realized; second, because they
 might be led, under temporary excitement, to take a step they might
 afterwards regret; and, third, because the sincerity and strength of
 their conversion to the true religion, which she had taught them, would
 be thoroughly tested.</P>

 only not in a condition to provide you with other husbands, but so
 reduced in circumstances that I cannot think of your being subjected to
 privations with me. The arguments of Naomi prevailed with Orpah, who
 returned to her people and her gods. But Ruth clave unto her; and even
 in the pages of Sterne, that great master of pathos, there is nothing
 which so calls forth the sensibilities of the reader as the simple
 effusion he has borrowed from Scripture--of Ruth to her mother-in-law

 <B>4. Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and said unto the reapers, The Lord be
 with you</B>--This pious salutation between the master and his laborers
 strongly indicates the state of religious feeling among the rural
 population of Israel at that time, as well as the artless, happy, and
 unsuspecting simplicity which characterized the manners of the people.
 The same patriarchal style of speaking is still preserved in the East.</P>

 <B>7. she said .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Let me glean and gather after the reapers among the
 sheaves</B>--Various modes of reaping are practised in the East. Where
 the crop is thin and short, it is plucked up by the roots. Sometimes it
 is cut with the sickle. Whether reaped in the one way or the other, the
 grain is cast into sheaves loosely thrown together, to be subjected to
 the process of threshing, which takes place, for the most part,
 immediately after the reaping. Field labors were begun early in the
 morning--before the day became oppressively hot.

 <B>8, 9. said Boaz unto Ruth, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bide here fast by my maidens</B>--The
 reaping was performed by women while the assortment of sheaves was the
 duty of men-servants. The same division of harvest labor obtains in
 Syria still. Boaz not only granted to Ruth the full privilege of
 gleaning after his reapers, but provided for her personal comfort.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>9. go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have
 drawn</B>--Gleaners were sometimes allowed, by kind and charitable masters,
 to partake of the refreshments provided for the reapers. The vessels
 alluded to were skin bottles, filled with water--and the bread was
 soaked in vinegar 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:14">Ru 2:14</A>);

 a kind of poor, weak wine, sometimes mingled with a little olive
 oil--very cooling, as would be required in harvest-time. This grateful 
 refection is still used in the harvest-field.</P>

 <B>14. he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed,
 and left</B>--some of the new grain, roasted on the spot, and fit for
 use after being rubbed in the hands--a favorite viand in the East. He
 gave her so much, that after satisfying her own wants, she had some

 in the East glean with much success; for a great quantity of corn is
 scattered in the reaping, as well as in their manner of carrying it. One
 may judge, then, of the large quantity which Ruth would gather in
 consequence of the liberal orders given to the servants. These
 extraordinary marks of favor were not only given from a kindly
 disposition, but from regard to her good character and devoted
 attachment to her venerable relative.</P>

 was a very near kinsman, one other individual only having the
 precedence.</P>

 invitation of Boaz, lest, if she were seen straying into other fields,
 she might not only run the risk of rude treatment, but displease him by
 seeming indifferent to his kind liberality. Moreover, the observant
 mind of the old matron had already discerned, in all Boaz' attentions to
 Ruth, the germs of a stronger affection, which she wished to increase.</P>

 <B>2. he winnoweth barley to-night in the threshing-floor</B>--The winnowing
 process is performed by throwing up the grain, after being trodden
 down, against the wind with a shovel. The threshing-floor, which was
 commonly on the harvest-field, was carefully leveled with a large
 cylindric roller and consolidated with chalk, that weeds might not
 spring up, and that it might not chop with drought. The farmer usually
 remained all night in harvest-time on the threshing-floor, not only for
 the protection of his valuable grain, but for the winnowing. That
 operation was performed in the evening to catch the breezes which blow
 after the close of a hot day, and which continue for the most part of
 the night. This duty at so important a season the master undertakes
 himself; and, accordingly, in the simplicity of ancient manners, Boaz,
 a person of considerable wealth and high rank, laid himself down to
 sleep on the barn floor, at the end of the heap of barley he had been
 winnowing.</P>

 <B>4. go in, and uncover his feet and lay thee down</B>--Singular as these
 directions may appear to us, there was no impropriety in them,
 according to the simplicity of rural manners in Beth-lehem. In ordinary
 circumstances these would have seemed indecorous to the world; but in
 the case of Ruth, it was a method, doubtless conformable to prevailing
 usage, of reminding Boaz of the duty which devolved on him as the
 kinsman of her deceased husband. Boaz probably slept upon a mat or
 skin; Ruth lay crosswise at his feet--a position in which Eastern
 servants frequently sleep in the same chamber or tent with their
 master; and if they want a covering, custom allows them that benefit
 from part of the covering on their master's bed. Resting, as the
 Orientals do at night, in the same clothes they wear during the day,
 there was no indelicacy in a stranger, or even a woman, putting the
 extremity of this cover over her.</P>

 handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman</B>--She had already drawn part of
 the mantle over her; and she asked him now to do it, that the act might
 become his own. To spread a skirt over one is, in the East, a symbolical
 action denoting protection. To this day in many parts of the East, to
 say of anyone that he put his skirt over a woman, is synonymous with
 saying that he married her; and at all the marriages of the modern Jews
 and Hindus, one part of the ceremony is for the bridegroom to put a
 silken or cotton cloak around his bride.</P>

 unenclosed by walls; the place where, in ancient times, and in many
 Eastern towns still, all business transactions are made, and where,
 therefore, the kinsman was most likely to be found. No preliminaries
 were necessary in summoning one before the public assemblage; no
 writings and no delay were required. In a short conversation the matter
 was stated and arranged--probably in the morning as people went out, or

 Both Naomi and Ruth had an interest in the land during their lives; but
 Naomi alone was mentioned, not only because she directed all the 
 negotiations, but because the introduction of Ruth's name would awaken

 <B>6. The kinsman said, I cannot redeem it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;., lest I mar mine own
 inheritance</B>--This consequence would follow, either, first, from his
 having a son by Ruth, who, though heir to the property, would not bear
 his name; his name would be extinguished in that of her former husband;
 or, secondly, from its having to be subdivided among his other
 children, which he had probably by a previous marriage. This right,
 therefore, was renounced and assigned in favor of Boaz, in the way of
 whose marriage with Ruth the only existing obstacle was now removed.</P>

 disdain. But, as in this case, there was no refusal, the usual ignominy
 was spared; and the plucking off the shoe, the only ceremony observed,
 was a pledge of the transaction being completed.</P>

 <B>9. Boaz said unto the elders, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have
 bought all that was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of
 Naomi</B>--Although the widow of Chilion was still living, no regard was
 paid to her in the disposal of her husband's property. From her
 remaining in Moab, she was considered to have either been married
 again, or to have renounced all right to an inheritance with the family
 of Elimelech.</P>

 <B>11. all the people and the elders, said, We are witnesses</B>--A multitude,
 doubtless from curiosity or interest, were present on the occasion.
 There was no signing of deeds; yet was the transfer made, and complete
 security given, by the public manner in which the whole matter was
 carried on and concluded.

 <B>18-22. these are the generations of Pharez</B>--that is, his descendants.
 This appendix shows that the special object contemplated by the
 inspired author of this little book was to preserve the memory of an
 interesting domestic episode, and to trace the genealogy of David.
 There was an interval of three hundred eighty years between Salmon and
 David. It is evident that whole generations are omitted; the leading
 personages only are named, and grandfathers are said, in Scripture
 language, to beget their grandchildren, without specifying the
 intermediate links.</P>
