 hid in the depths of eternal ages; and so the phrase is used in

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>God</B>--the name of the Supreme Being, signifying in <I>Hebrew,</I>
 "Strong," "Mighty." It is expressive of omnipotent power; and by its
 use here in the <I>plural</I> form, is obscurely taught at the opening
 of the Bible, a doctrine clearly revealed in other parts of it, namely,
 that though God is one, there is a plurality of persons in the
 Godhead--Father, Son, and Spirit, who were engaged in the creative work

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:27,Joh+1:3,10,Eph+3:9,Heb+1:2,Job+26:13">Pr 8:27;

 <B>created</B>--not formed from any pre-existing materials, but made
 out of nothing.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the heaven and the earth</B>--the universe. This first verse is a
 general introduction to the inspired volume, declaring the great and
 important truth that all things had a beginning; that nothing
 throughout the wide extent of nature existed from eternity, originated
 by chance, or from the skill of any inferior agent; but that the whole
 universe was produced by the creative power of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:24,Ro+11:36">Ac 17:24;

 <B>2. the earth was without form and void</B>--or in "confusion and
 emptiness," as the words are rendered in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:11">Isa 34:11</A>.

 This globe, at some undescribed period, having been convulsed and
 broken up, was a dark and watery waste for ages perhaps, till out of
 this chaotic state, the present fabric of the world was made to arise.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the Spirit of God moved</B>--literally, continued brooding over it, 
 as a fowl does, when hatching eggs. The immediate agency of the Spirit, 
 by working on the dead and discordant elements, combined, arranged, and 
 ripened them into a state adapted for being the scene of a new 
 creation.  The account of this new creation properly begins at the end 
 of this second verse; and the details of the process are described in 
 the natural way an onlooker would have done, who beheld the changes 
 that successively took place.</P>

 <B>3. God said</B>--This phrase, which occurs so repeatedly in the 
 account means: willed, decreed, appointed; and the determining will of 
 God was followed in every instance by an immediate result. Whether the 
 sun was created at the same time with, or long before, the earth, the 
 dense accumulation of fogs and vapors which enveloped the chaos had 
 covered the globe with a settled gloom. But by the command of God, 
 light was rendered visible; the thick murky clouds were dispersed, 
 broken, or rarefied, and light diffused over the expanse of waters. The 
 effect is described in the name "day," which in <I>Hebrew</I> signifies 
 "warmth," "heat"; while the name "night" signifies a "rolling up," as 
 night wraps all things in a shady mantle.</P>

 <A NAME="Ge1_4"> </A>

 the earth round its axis.</P>

 name given to the atmosphere from its appearing to an observer to be 
 the <I>vault</I> of heaven, supporting the weight of the <I>watery 
 clouds.</I> By the creation of an atmosphere, the lighter parts of the 
 waters which overspread the earth's surface were drawn up and suspended 
 in the visible heavens, while the larger and heavier mass remained 
 below. The air was thus "in the midst of the waters," that is, 
 separated them; and this being the apparent use of it, is the only one 
 mentioned, although the atmosphere serves other uses, as a medium of 
 life and light.</P>

 <B>9. let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one
 place</B>--The world was to be rendered a terraqueous globe, and this
 was effected by a volcanic convulsion on its surface, the upheaving of
 some parts, the sinking of others, and the formation of vast hollows,
 into which the waters impetuously rushed, as is graphically described

 [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ITCHCOCK</FONT>]. Thus a large part of the earth was
 left "dry land," and thus were formed oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers
 which, though each having its own bed, or channel, are all connected
 with the sea

 verdure, and it is noticeable that the trees, plants, and grasses--the
 three great divisions of the vegetable kingdom here mentioned--were not
 called into existence in the same way as the light and the air; they
 were made to grow, and they grew as they do still out of the
 ground--not, however, by the slow process of vegetation, but through
 the divine power, without rain, dew, or any process of labor--sprouting
 up and flourishing in a single day.</P>

 <B>14. let there be lights in the firmament</B>--The atmosphere being
 completely purified, the sun, moon, and stars were for the first time
 unveiled in all their glory in the cloudless sky; and they are
 described as "in the firmament" which to the eye they appear to be,
 though we know they are really at vast distances from it.</P>

 as commencing at sunset--the moon, which would be seen first in the
 horizon, would appear "a great light," compared with the little
 twinkling stars; while its pale benign radiance would be eclipsed by
 the dazzling splendor of the sun; when his resplendent orb rose in the
 morning and gradually attained its meridian blaze of glory, it would
 appear "the greater light" that ruled the day. Both these lights may be
 said to be "made" on the fourth day--not created, indeed, for it is a
 different word that is here used, but constituted, appointed to the
 important and necessary office of serving as luminaries to the world,
 and regulating by their motions and their influence the progress and
 divisions of time.</P>

 peculiar importance of the work to be done, the formation of a
 creature, who was to be God's representative, clothed with authority
 and rule as visible head and monarch of the world.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>In our image, after our likeness</B>--This was a peculiar
 distinction, the value attached to which appears in the words being
 twice mentioned.  And in what did this image of God consist? Not in the
 erect form or features of man, not in his intellect, for the devil and
 his angels are, in this respect, far superior; not in his immortality,
 for he has not, like God, a past as well as a future eternity of being;
 but in the moral dispositions of his soul, commonly called <I>original
 righteousness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:29">Ec 7:29</A>).

 As the new creation is only a restoration of this image, the history of
 the one throws light on the other; and we are informed that it is
 renewed after the image of God in knowledge, righteousness, and true
 holiness

 <B>28. Be fruitful,</B> &c.--The human race in every country and age
 has been the offspring of the first pair. Amid all the varieties found
 among men, some black, some copper-colored, others white, the
 researches of modern science lead to a conclusion, fully accordant with
 the sacred history, that they are all of one species and of one family

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:26">Ac 17:26</A>).

 What power in the word of God! "He spake and it was done.  He commanded
 and all things stood fast"

 thou made them all"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:24">Ps 104:24</A>].

 We admire that wisdom, not only in the regular progress of creation,
 but in its perfect adaptation to the end. God is represented as pausing
 at every stage to look at His work. No wonder He contemplated it with
 complacency. Every object was in its right place, every vegetable
 process going on in season, every animal in its structure and instincts
 suited to its mode of life and its use in the economy of the world. He
 saw everything that He had made answering the plan which His eternal
 wisdom had conceived; and, "Behold it was very good"

 of higher creatures

 in the earliest ages. It is a wise and beneficent law, affording that
 regular interval of rest which the physical nature of man and the
 animals employed in his service requires, and the neglect of which
 brings both to premature decay. Moreover, it secures an appointed
 season for religious worship, and if it was necessary in a state of

 proclaim the eternal power and Godhead by the things which are made,

 <B>1. the serpent</B>--The fall of man was effected by the seductions
 of a serpent. That it was a real serpent is evident from the plain and
 artless style of the history and from the many allusions made to it in
 the New Testament. But the material serpent was the instrument or tool
 of a higher agent, Satan or the devil, to whom the sacred writers apply
 from this incident the reproachful name of "the dragon, that old
 serpent"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:2">Re 20:2</A>].

 Though Moses makes no mention of this wicked spirit--giving only the
 history of the visible world--yet in the fuller discoveries of the
 Gospel, it is distinctly intimated that Satan was the author of the
 plot

 But these reptiles were at first, probably, far superior in beauty as
 well as in sagacity to what they are in their present state.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>He said</B>--There being in the pure bosoms of the first pair no 
 principle of evil to work upon, a solicitation to sin could come only 
 from "without," as in the analogous case of Jesus Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:3">Mt 4:3</A>);

 and as the tempter could not assume the human form, there being only
 Adam and Eve in the world, the agency of an inferior creature had to be
 employed. The dragon-serpent [B<FONT SIZE=-1>OCHART</FONT>] seemed the
 fittest for the vile purpose; and the devil was allowed by Him who
 permitted the trial, to bring articulate sounds from its mouth.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>unto the woman</B>--the object of attack, from his knowledge of her
 frailty, of her having been but a short time in the world, her limited
 experience of the animal tribes, and, above all, her being alone,
 unfortified by the presence and counsels of her husband. Though sinless
 and holy, she was a free agent, liable to be tempted and seduced.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>yea, hath God said?</B>--Is it true that He has restricted you in
 using the fruits of this delightful place? This is not like one so good
 and kind. Surely there is some mistake. He insinuated a doubt as to her
 sense of the divine will and appeared as an angel of light

 either of the prohibition or the penalty. But there is reason to think
 that she had already received an injurious impression; for in using the
 words "lest ye die," instead of "ye shall surely die"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:17">Ge 2:17</A>],

 from Eve, who, fired with a generous desire for knowledge, thought only
 of rising to the rank and privileges of her angelic visitants.</P>

 had become liable to all the miseries of this life and to the pains of
 hell for ever. What a mournful chapter this is in the history of man!
 It gives the only true account of the origin of all the physical and
 moral evils that are in the world; upholds the moral character of God;
 shows that man, made upright, fell from not being able to resist a

 The purport of the divine rebuke to Cain was this, "Why art thou angry,

 sinless) a thank offering would have been accepted as a token of thy
 dependence as a creature. But as thou doest not well (that is, art a

 have met with acceptance and retained the honors of thy birthright."

 descendants. Ten are enumerated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:5-32">Ge 5:5-32</A>)

 in direct succession whose lives far exceed the ordinary limits with
 which we are familiar--the shortest being three hundred sixty-five,

 It is useless to inquire whether and what secondary causes may have
 contributed to this protracted longevity--vigorous constitutions, the
 nature of their diet, the temperature and salubrity of the climate; or,
 finally--as this list comprises only the true worshippers of
 God--whether their great age might be owing to the better government of
 their passions and the quiet, even tenor of their lives. Since we
 cannot obtain satisfactory evidence on these points, it is wise to
 resolve the fact into the sovereign will of God. We can, however, trace
 some of the important uses to which, in the early economy of
 Providence, it was subservient.  It was the chief means of reserving a
 knowledge of God, of the great truths of religion, as well as the
 influence of genuine piety. So that, as their knowledge was obtained by
 tradition, they would be in a condition to preserve it in the greatest
 purity.</P>

 The mountain which tradition points to as the one on which the ark 
 rested is now called Ara Dagh, the "finger mountain." Its summit

 the agency of God guiding all the movements of this bird for the
 instruction of Noah, and reviving the hopes of his household.

 much of it as would afford him a prospect of the earth around. Yet for
 about two months he never stirred from his appointed abode till he had
 received the express permission of God. We should watch the leading of
 Providence to direct us in every step of the journey of life.</P>

 failure in utterance, occasioning a difference in dialect which was
 intelligible only to those of the same tribe. Thus easily by God their
 purpose was defeated, and they were compelled to the dispersion they
 had combined to prevent. It is only from the Scriptures we learn the
 true origin of the different nations and languages of the world. By one
 miracle of tongues men were dispersed and gradually fell from true
 religion. By another, national barriers were broken down--that all men
 might be brought back to the family of God.</P>

 earth was to be blessed

 was for centuries to inhabit as a peculiar people; the seeds of divine
 knowledge were to be sown there for the benefit of all mankind; and
 considered in its geographical situation, it was chosen in divine
 wisdom as the fittest of all lands to serve as the cradle of a divine
 revelation designed for the whole world.

 Abram must have arrived. They were a race of shepherd-kings, in close

 discredit on its name, and he rightly judged that such unhappy effects
 would be produced if two persons whom nature and grace had so closely

 with the aid of three allies, invaded the territories of the refractory

 ground favored his army

 when two or more parties join in a compact, they either observe
 precisely the same rites as Abram did, or, where they do not, they
 invoke the lamp as their witness. According to these ideas, which have
 been from time immemorial engraven on the minds of Eastern people, the
 Lord Himself condescended to enter into covenant with Abram. The
 patriarch did not pass between the sacrifice and the reason was that in
 this transaction he was bound to nothing. He asked a sign, and God was
 pleased to give him a sign, by which, according to Eastern ideas, He
 bound Himself. In like manner God has entered into covenant with us;
 and in the glory of the only-begotten Son, who passed through between
 God and us, all who believe have, like Abram, a sign or pledge in the
 gift of the Spirit, whereby they may know that they shall inherit the
 heavenly Canaan.</P>

 <B>3. Sarai .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gave her to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Abram to be his
 wife</B>--"Wife" is here used to describe an inferior, though not
 degrading, relation, in countries where polygamy prevails. In the case
 of these female slaves, who are the personal property of his lady,
 being purchased before her marriage or given as a special present to
 her, no one can become the husband's secondary wife without her
 mistress consent or permission.  This usage seems to have prevailed in
 patriarchal times; and Hagar, Sarai's slave, of whom she had the entire
 right of disposing, was given by her mistress' spontaneous offer, to be
 the secondary wife of Abram, in the hope of obtaining the
 long-looked-for heir. It was a wrong step--indicating a want of simple
 reliance on God--and Sarai was the first to reap the bitter fruits of
 her device.</P>

 of temper, or blows, as the original may bear, took place till at

 strife, resolved to escape from what had become to her in reality, as
 well as in name, a house of bondage.</P>

 pointed out by tradition, lay on the side of the caravan road, in the
 midst of Shur, a sandy desert on the west of Arabia-Petr&aelig;a, to
 the extent of a hundred fifty miles, between Palestine and Egypt. By
 taking that direction, she seems to have intended to return to her
 relatives in that country. Nothing but pride, passion, and sullen
 obstinacy, could have driven any solitary person to brave the dangers
 of such an inhospitable wild; and she would have died, had not the
 timely appearance and words of the angel recalled her to reflection and
 duty.</P>

 on account of his hasty and blameable marriage with Hagar.

 <B>5. but thy name shall be Abraham</B>--In Eastern countries a change
 of name is an advertisement of some new circumstance in the history,
 rank, or religion of the individual who bears it. The change is made
 variously, by the old name being entirely dropped for the new, or by
 conjoining the new with the old; or sometimes only a few letters are
 inserted, so that the altered form may express the difference in the
 owner's state or prospects. It is surprising how soon a new name is
 known and its import spread through the country. In dealing with
 Abraham and Sarai, God was pleased to adapt His procedure to the ideas
 and customs of the country and age. Instead of Abram, "a high father,"
 he was to be called Abraham, "father of a multitude of nations" (see

 Here it is promised as an "everlasting possession," and was, therefore,

 The terms of the covenant were these: on the one hand Abraham and his
 seed were to observe the right of circumcision; and on the other, God
 promised, in the event of such observance, to give them Canaan for a
 perpetual possession, to be a God to him and his posterity, and that in
 him and his seed all nations should be blessed.</P>

 <B>he ran to meet them</B>--When the visitor is an ordinary person, the
 host merely rises; but if of superior rank, the custom is to advance a
 little towards the stranger, and after a very low bow, turn and lead
 him to the tent, putting an arm round his waist, or tapping him on the
 shoulder as they go, to assure him of welcome.</P>

 required for family use, and always by the women, commonly the wife. It
 is a short process.  Flour mixed with water is made into dough, and
 being rolled out into cakes, it is placed on the earthen floor,
 previously heated by a fire.  The fire being removed, the cakes are
 laid on the ground, and being covered over with hot embers, are soon
 baked, and eaten the moment they are taken off.</P>

 never provided, except for visitors of a superior rank when a kid or
 lamb is killed. A calf is still a higher stretch of hospitality, and it
 would probably be cooked as is usually done when haste is
 required--either by roasting it whole or by cutting it up into small
 pieces and broiling them on skewers over the fire. It is always eaten
 along with boiled corn swimming in butter or melted fat, into which
 every morsel of meat, laid upon a piece of bread, is dipped, before
 being conveyed by the fingers to the mouth.</P>

 he has a number of servants, deems it a necessary act of politeness to

 did this before he was aware of the real character of his visitors.</P>

 now sure of the cities being preserved

 the cave, he joins "the field and the cave"; and though he offered them 
 both as free gifts, he, of course, expected some costly presents in 
 return, without which, he would not have been satisfied. The patriarch, 
 knowing this, wished to make a purchase and asked the terms.</P>

 <B>1. And Abraham was old .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. take a wife</B>--His anxiety 
 to see his son married was natural to his position as a pastoral chief 
 interested in preserving the honor of his tribe, and still more as a 
 patriarch who had regard to the divine promise of a numerous 
 posterity.</P>

 <B>2. said unto his eldest servant</B>--Abraham being too old, and as 
 the heir of the promise not being at liberty to make even a temporary 
 visit to his native land, was obliged to intrust this delicate mission 
 to Eliezer, whom, although putting entire confidence in him, he on this
 occasion bound by a solemn oath. A pastoral chief in the present day
 would follow the same course if he could not go himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. thou shalt not take a wife,</B> &c.--Among pastoral tribes the 
 matrimonial arrangements are made by the parents, and a youth must 
 marry, not among strangers, but in his own tribe--custom giving him a 
 claim, which is seldom or never resisted, to the hand of his first 
 cousin. But Abraham had a far higher motive--a fear lest, if his son 
 married into a Canaanitish family, he might be gradually led away from 
 the true God.</P>

 spare camels in case of emergency.

 wishes to obtain information, stations himself at one of the wells in 
 the neighborhood of a town, and he is sure to learn all the news of the

 forced Isaac with his family and flocks to migrate into the land of the 
 Philistines, where he was exposed to personal danger, as his father had 
 been on account of his wife's beauty; but through the seasonable
 interposition of Providence, he was preserved

 and by his plentiful returns he increased so rapidly in wealth and

 his growing power, or regret for the bad usage they had given him, the
 king and two of his courtiers paid a visit to the tent of Isaac

 His timid and passive temper had submitted to the annoyances of his
 rude neighbors; but now that they wish to renew the covenant, he 
 evinces deep feeling at their conduct, and astonishment at their

 that devout patriarch himself would be equally opposed to such a union 
 on the part of his children; and we may easily imagine how much his 
 pious heart was wounded, and the family peace destroyed, when his 
 favorite but wayward son brought no less than two idolatrous wives 
 among them--an additional proof that Esau neither desired the blessing 
 nor dreaded the curse of God. These wives never gained the affections 
 of his parents, and this estrangement was overruled by God for keeping 
 the chosen family aloof from the dangers of heathen influence.</P>

 other. But a moment's reflection convinced the aged patriarch that the 
 transfer of the blessing was "of the Lord," and now irrevocable. The 
 importunities of Esau, however, overpowered him; and as the prophetic 
 afflatus was upon the patriarch, he added what was probably as pleasing

 <B>12. he dreamed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and behold a ladder</B>--Some writers
 are of opinion that it was not a literal ladder that is meant, as it is
 impossible to conceive any imagery stranger and more unnatural than
 that of a ladder, whose base was on earth, while its top reached
 heaven, without having any thing on which to rest its upper extremity.
 They suppose that the little heap of stones, on which his head reclined
 for a pillow, being the miniature model of the object that appeared to
 his imagination, the latter was a gigantic mountain pile, whose sides,
 indented in the rock, gave it the appearance of a scaling ladder. There
 can be no doubt that this use of the original term was common among the
 early Hebrews; as J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>, describing the town of 
 Ptolemais (Acre), says it was bounded by a mountain, which, from its 
 projecting sides, was called "the ladder," and the stairs that led down 
 to the city are, in the original, termed a ladder

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:15">Ne 3:15</A>) 

 though they were only a flight of steps cut in the side of the rock.
 But whether the image presented to the mental eye of Jacob were a 
 common ladder, or such a mountain pile as has been described, the 
 design of this vision was to afford comfort, encouragement, and 
 confidence to the lonely fugitive, both in his present circumstances 
 and as to his future prospects. His thoughts during the day must have 
 been painful--he would be his own self-accuser that he had brought 
 exile and privation upon himself--and above all, that though he had 
 obtained the forgiveness of his father, he had much reason to fear lest 
 God might have forsaken him. Solitude affords time for reflection; and 
 it was now that God began to bring Jacob under a course of religious 
 instruction and training. To dispel his fears and allay the inward 
 tumult of his mind, nothing was better fitted than the vision of the 
 gigantic ladder, which reached from himself to heaven, and on which the 
 angels were continually ascending and descending from God Himself on 
 their benevolent errands

 stone might have been as a future memorial to mark the spot; and this 
 practice is still common in the East, in memory of a religious vow or 
 engagement.  But the pouring oil upon it was a consecration.  
 Accordingly he gave it a new name, Beth-el, "the house of God"

 Arabia, owing to the shifting sands and in other places, owing to the 
 strong evaporation, the mouth of a well is generally covered, 
 especially when it is private property. Over many is laid a broad, 
 thick, flat stone, with a round hole cut in the middle, forming the 
 mouth of the cistern.  This hole is covered with a heavy stone which it 
 would require two or three men to roll away. Such was the description 
 of the well at Haran.</P>

 reposing there with flocks and who all belonged to Haran, that his 
 relatives in Haran were well and that one of the family was shortly 
 expected, he enquired why they were idling the best part of the day 
 there instead of watering their flocks and sending them back to

 order to prevent the consequences of too frequent exposure in places 
 where water is scarce, the well is not only covered, but it is 
 customary to have all the flocks collected round it before the covering 
 is removed in presence of the owner or one of his representatives; and 
 it was for this reason that those who were reposing at the well of 
 Haran with the three flocks were waiting the arrival of Rachel.</P>

 tend the flocks, going out at sunrise and continuing to watch their 
 fleecy charges till sunset. Watering them, which is done twice a day, 
 is a work of time and labor, and Jacob rendered no small service in 
 volunteering his aid to the young shepherdess. The interview was 
 affecting, the reception welcome, and Jacob forgot all his toils in the 
 society of his Mesopotamian relatives. Can we doubt that he returned 
 thanks to God for His goodness by the way?</P>

 consulted, and the match is effected by the suitor either bestowing 
 costly presents on the family, or by giving cattle to the value the 
 father sets upon his daughter, or else by giving personal services for 
 a specified period. The last was the course necessity imposed on Jacob; 
 and there for seven years he submitted to the drudgery of a hired 
 shepherd, with the view of obtaining Rachel. The time went rapidly 
 away; for even severe and difficult duties become light when love is 
 the spring of action.</P>

 <B>21. Jacob said, Give me my wife</B>--At the expiry of the stipulated 
 term the marriage festivities were held. But an infamous fraud was 
 practised on Jacob, and on his showing a righteous indignation, the 
 usage of the country was pleaded in excuse. No plea of kindred should 
 ever be allowed to come in opposition to the claim of justice. But this 
 is often overlooked by the selfish mind of man, and fashion or custom 
 rules instead of the will of God. This was what Laban did, as he said, 
 "It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the 
 first-born." But, then, if that were the prevailing custom of society 
 at Haran, he should have apprized his nephew of it at an early period 
 in an honorable manner. This, however, is too much the way with the 
 people of the East still. The duty of marrying an elder daughter before 
 a younger, the tricks which parents take to get off an elder daughter 
 that is plain or deformed and in which they are favored by the long 
 bridal veil that entirely conceals her features all the wedding day, 
 and the prolongation for a week of the marriage festivities among the 
 greater sheiks, are accordant with the habits of the people in Arabia 
 and Armenia in the present day.</P>

 A bitter and intense rivalry existed between them, all the more from 
 their close relationship as sisters; and although they occupied 
 separate apartments, with their families, as is the uniform custom 
 where a plurality of wives obtains, and the husband and father spends a

 establish an independence for his family, he probably, from knowing 
 that Esau was out of the way, announced his intention of returning to 
 Canaan

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:14">Heb 13:14</A>).

 In this resolution the faith of Jacob was remarkable, for as yet he had

 was averse to a separation, not from warmth of affection either for 
 Jacob or his daughters, but from the damage his own interests would 
 sustain. He had found, from long observation, that the blessing of 
 heaven rested on Jacob, and that his stock had wonderfully increased 
 under Jacob's management. This was a remarkable testimony that good men 
 are blessings to the places where they reside. Men of the world are 
 often blessed with temporal benefits on account of their pious 
 relatives, though they have not always, like Laban, the wisdom to 
 discern, or the grace to acknowledge it.</P>

 of that description from the flock, and to be content with what might 
 appear at the next lambing time. The proposal <I>seemed</I> so much in 
 favor of Laban, that he at once agreed to it. But Jacob has been 
 accused of taking advantage of his uncle, and though it is difficult to 
 exculpate him from practising some degree of dissimulation, he was only 
 availing himself of the results of his great skill and experience in 
 the breeding of cattle. But it is evident from the next chapter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:5-13">Ge 31:5-13</A>)

 of speech. The insinuations against Jacob's fidelity by Laban's sons, 
 and the sullen reserve, the churlish conduct, of Laban himself, had 
 made Jacob's situation, in his uncle's establishment, most trying and 
 painful. It is always one of the vexations attendant on worldly 
 prosperity, that it excites the envy of others

 having resolved on immediate departure, he might communicate his 
 intentions. Rachel and Leah only were called, for the other two wives, 
 being secondary and still in a state of servitude, were not entitled to 
 be taken into account. Jacob acted the part of a dutiful husband in 
 telling them his plans; for husbands that love their wives should

 news reach Laban than he set out in pursuit, and he being not 
 encumbered, advanced rapidly; whereas Jacob, with a young family and 
 numerous flocks, had to march slowly, so that he overtook the fugitives 
 after seven days' journey as they lay encamped on the brow of mount 
 Gilead, an extensive range of hills forming the eastern boundary of 
 Canaan.  Being accompanied by a number of his people, he might have 
 used violence had he not been divinely warned in a dream to give no 
 interruption to his nephew's journey. How striking and sudden a change! 
 For several days he had been full of rage, and was now in eager 
 anticipation that his vengeance would be fully wreaked, when lo! his 
 hands are tied by invisible power

 His reproaches were of a different kind. His first charge was for 
 depriving him of the satisfaction of giving Jacob and his family the 
 usual salutations at parting. In the East it is customary, when any are 
 setting out to a great distance, for their relatives and friends to 
 accompany them a considerable way with music and valedictory songs. 
 Considering the past conduct of Laban, his complaint on this ground was 
 hypocritical cant. But his second charge was a grave one--the carrying 
 off his gods--<I>Hebrew,</I> "teraphim," small images of human figures, 
 used not as idols or objects of worship, but as talismans, for 
 superstitious purposes.</P>

 their common ancestors; but Jacob, knowing that idolatry had crept in 
 among that branch of the family, swore by the "fear of his father 
 Isaac." They who have one God should have one heart: they who are

 When and in what circumstances he had emigrated thither, whether the
 separation arose out of the undutiful conduct and idolatrous habits of 
 his wives, which had made them unwelcome in the tent of his parents, or 
 whether his roving disposition had sought a country from his love of 
 adventure and the chase, he was living in a state of power and 
 affluence, and this settlement on the outer borders of Canaan, though 
 made of his own free will, was overruled by Providence to pave the way 
 for Jacob's return to the promised land.</P>

 his respectful obeisance. Acts of civility tend to disarm opposition

 covenant relation to his family, just as we ought to put our hopes of 
 acceptance with God in Christ. It pleads the special promise made to 
 him of a safe return; and after a most humble and affecting confession 
 of unworthiness, it breathes an earnest desire for deliverance from the 
 impending danger.  It was the prayer of a kind husband, an affectionate 
 father, a firm believer in the promises.</P>

 approached with presents, and the respect expressed is estimated by the 
 quality and amount of the gift. The present of Jacob consisted of five 
 hundred fifty head of cattle, of different kinds, such as would be most 
 prized by Esau. It was a most magnificent present, skilfully arranged 
 and proportioned. The milch camels alone were of immense value; for the

 and the opinion that is most supported is that he was "the angel of the 
 covenant," who, in a visible form, appeared to animate the mind and 
 sympathize with the distress of his pious servant. It has been a 
 subject of much discussion whether the incident described was an actual 
 conflict or a visionary scene. Many think that as the narrative makes 
 no mention in express terms either of sleep, or dream, or vision, it 
 was a real transaction; while others, considering the bodily exhaustion 
 of Jacob, his great mental anxiety, the kind of aid he supplicated, as 
 well as the analogy of former manifestations with which he was 
 favored--such as the ladder--have concluded that it was a vision 
 [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>, H<FONT SIZE=-1>ESSENBERG</FONT>, H<FONT

 sinking spirit of the patriarch and to arm him with confidence in God, 
 while anticipating the dreaded scenes of the morrow.  To us it is

 on whom the protection of the daughters devolves--they are the

 consisted in having the sign of the covenant. Circumcision was the 
 external rite by which persons were admitted members of the ancient 
 Church. But that outward rite could not make the Shechemites true 
 Israelites; and yet it does not appear that Jacob's sons required 
 anything more. Nothing is said of their teaching the people to worship 
 the true God, but only of their insisting on their being circumcised; 
 and it is evident that they did not seek to convert Shechem, but only 
 made a show of religion--a cloak to cover their diabolical design. 
 Hypocrisy and deceit, in all cases vicious, are infinitely more so when 
 accompanied with a show of religion; and here the sons of Jacob, under 
 the pretense of conscientious scruples, conceal a scheme of treachery 
 as cruel and diabolical as was, perhaps, ever perpetrated.</P>

 <B>30. Jacob said .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ye have troubled me</B>--This 
 atrocious outrage perpetrated on the defenseless citizens and their 
 families made the cup of Jacob's affliction overflow. We may wonder 
 that, in speaking of it to his sons, he did not represent it as a 
 heinous sin, an atrocious violation of the laws of God and man, but 
 dwelt solely on the present consequences. It was probably because that 
 was the only view likely to rouse the cold-blooded apathy, the hardened 
 consciences of those ruffian sons. Nothing but the restraining power of 
 God saved him and his family from the united vengeance of the people
 (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:5">Ge 35:5</A>).

 All his sons had not been engaged in the massacre. Joseph was a boy, 
 Benjamin not yet born, and the other eight not concerned in it. Simeon 
 and Levi alone, with their retainers, had been the guilty actors in the 
 bloody tragedy. But the Canaanites would not be discriminating in their 
 vengeance; and if <I>all</I> the Shechemites were put to death for the 
 offense of their chief's son, what wonder if the natives should extend 
 their hatred to all the family of Jacob; and who probably equalled, in 
 number, the inhabitants of that village.</P>

 <B>1. God said unto Jacob, Arise,</B> &c.--This command was given 
 seasonably in point of time and tenderly in respect of language. The 
 disgraceful and perilous events that had recently taken place in the 
 patriarch's family must have produced in him a strong desire to remove 
 without delay from the vicinity of Shechem. Borne down by an 
 overwhelming sense of the criminality of his two sons--of the offense 
 they had given to God and the dishonor they had brought on the true 
 faith; distracted, too, with anxiety about the probable consequences 
 which their outrage might bring upon himself and family, should the 
 Canaanite people combine to extirpate such a band of robbers and 
 murderers; he must have felt this call as affording a great relief to 
 his afflicted feelings.  At the same time it conveyed a tender rebuke.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>go up to Beth-el</B>--Beth-el was about thirty miles south of 
 Shechem and was an ascent from a low to a highland country. There, he 
 would not only be released from the painful associations of the latter 
 place but be established on a spot that would revive the most 
 delightful and sublime recollections. The pleasure of revisiting it, 
 however, was not altogether unalloyed.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>make there an altar unto God, that appeared</B>--It too frequently 
 happens that early impressions are effaced through lapse of time, that 
 promises made in seasons of distress, are forgotten; or, if remembered 
 on the return of health and prosperity, there is not the same alacrity 
 and sense of obligation felt to fulfil them. Jacob was lying under that 
 charge. He had fallen into spiritual indolence. It was now eight or ten 
 years since his return to Canaan. He had effected a comfortable 
 settlement and had acknowledged the divine mercies, by which that 
 return and settlement had been signally distinguished (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:19">Ge 33:19</A>). 
 
 But for some unrecorded reason, his early vow at Beth-el

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+28:20-22">Ge 28:20-22</A>], 

 in a great crisis of his life, remained unperformed. The Lord appeared 
 now to remind him of his neglected duty, in terms, however, so mild, as 
 awakened less the memory of his fault, than of the kindness of his 
 heavenly Guardian; and how much Jacob felt the touching nature of the 
 appeal to that memorable scene at Beth-el, appears in the immediate 
 preparations he made to <I>arise</I> and <I>go up</I> thither

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:13">Ps 66:13</A>).</P>

 <A NAME="Ge35_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. Then Jacob said unto his household .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Put away the 
 strange gods that are among you</B>--<I>Hebrew,</I> "gods of the 
 stranger," of foreign nations. Jacob had brought, in his service, a 
 number of Mesopotamian retainers, who were addicted to superstitious 
 practices; and there is some reason to fear that the same high 
 testimony as to the religious superintendence of his household could 
 not have been borne of him as was done of Abraham

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:19">Ge 18:19</A>). 

 He might have been too negligent hitherto in winking at these evils in 
 his servants; or, perhaps, it was not till his arrival in Canaan, that
 he had learnt, for the first time, that one nearer and dearer to him 
 was secretly infected with the same corruption

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:34">Ge 31:34</A>). 

 Be that as it may, he resolved on an immediate and thorough reformation
 of his household; and in commanding them to put away the strange gods,
 he added,

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>be clean, and change your garments</B>--as if some defilement, from 
 contact with idolatry, should still remain about them. In the law of 
 Moses, many ceremonial purifications were ordained and observed by 
 persons who had contracted certain defilements, and without the 
 observance of which, they were reckoned unclean and unfit to join in 
 the social worship of God. These bodily purifications were purely 
 figurative; and as sacrifices were offered before the law, so also were 
 external purifications, as appears from the words of Jacob; hence it 
 would seem that types and symbols were used from the fall of man, 
 representing and teaching the two great doctrines of revealed 
 truth--namely, the atonement of Christ and the sanctification of our 
 nature.</P>

 <A NAME="Ge35_3"> </A>

 <A NAME="Ge35_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4. they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and 
 earrings</B>--Strange gods, the "seraphim" (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:30">Ge 31:30</A>), 

 as well, perhaps, as other idols acquired among the Shechemite 
 spoil--earrings of various forms, sizes, and materials, which are 
 universally worn in the East, and, then as now, connected with 
 incantation and idolatry (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:13">Ho 2:13</A>). 

 The decided tone which Jacob now assumed was the probable cause of the 
 alacrity with which those favorite objects of superstition were
 surrendered.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Jacob hid them under the oak</B>--or terebinth--a towering tree, 
 which, like all others of the kind, was a striking object in the 
 scenery of Palestine; and beneath which, at Shechem, the patriarch had 
 pitched his tent. He hid the images and amulets, delivered to him by 
 his Mesopotamian dependents, at the root of this tree. The oak being 
 deemed a consecrated tree, to bury them at its root was to deposit them 
 in a place where no bold hand would venture to disturb the ground; and 
 hence it was called from this circumstance--"the plain of 
 Meonenim"--that is, "the oak of enchantments"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:37">Jud 9:37</A>);

 and from the great stone which Joshua set up--"the oak of the pillar"

 <A NAME="Ge35_5"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>5. the terror of God was upon the cities</B>--There was every reason 
 to apprehend that a storm of indignation would burst from all quarters 
 upon Jacob's family, and that the Canaanite tribes would have formed 
 one united plan of revenge. But a supernatural panic seized them; and 
 thus, for the sake of the "heir of the promise," the protecting shield 
 of Providence was specially held over his family.</P>

 <A NAME="Ge35_6"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>6. So Jacob came to Luz .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that is, Beth-el</B>--It is 
 probable that this place was unoccupied ground when Jacob first went to 
 it; and that after that period [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>], the 
 Canaanites built a town, to which they gave the name of Luz

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+28:19">Ge 28:19</A>], 

 from the profusion of almond trees that grew around. The name of 
 Beth-el, which would, of course, be confined to Jacob and his family, 
 did not supersede the original one, till long after. It is now 
 identified with the modern Beitin and lies on the western slope of the 
 mountain on which Abraham built his altar

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>8. Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died</B>--This event seems to have 
 taken place before the solemnities were commenced. Deborah 
 (<I>Hebrew,</I> a "bee"), supposing her to have been fifty years on 
 coming to Canaan, had attained the great age of a hundred eighty. When 
 she was removed from Isaac's household to Jacob's, is unknown. But it 
 probably was on his return from Mesopotamia; and she would have been of 
 invaluable service to his young family. Old nurses, like her, were not 
 only honored, but loved as mothers; and, accordingly, her death was the 
 occasion of great lamentation. She was buried under <I>the</I> 
 oak--hence called "the terebinth of tears" (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:14">1Ki 13:14</A>). 

 God was pleased to make a new appearance to him after the solemn rites 
 of devotion were over. By this manifestation of His presence, God 
 testified His acceptance of Jacob's sacrifice and renewed the promise 
 of the blessings guaranteed to Abraham and Isaac

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:11,12">Ge 35:11, 12</A>];

 and the patriarch observed the ceremony with which he had formerly 
 consecrated the place, comprising a sacramental cup, along with the oil 
 that he poured on the pillar, and reimposing the memorable name

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:14">Ge 35:14</A>]. 

 The whole scene was in accordance with the character of the patriarchal
 dispensation, in which the great truths of religion were exhibited to 
 the senses, and "the world's grey fathers" taught in a manner suited to 
 the weakness of an infantile condition.</P>

 much enjoyment was experienced at Beth-el, and that in the religious 
 observances solemnized, as well as in the vivid recollections of the 
 glorious vision seen there, the affections of the patriarch were 
 powerfully animated and that he left the place a better and more 
 devoted servant of God. When the solemnities were over, Jacob, with his 
 family, pursued a route directly southward, and they reached Ephrath, 
 when they were plunged into mourning by the death of Rachel, who sank 
 in childbirth, leaving a posthumous son

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:18">Ge 35:18</A>].

 till fifteen years after Joseph's disappearance. Feeble and blind 
 though he was, he lived to a very advanced age; and it is a pleasing 
 evidence of the permanent reconciliation between Esau and Jacob that 
 they met at Mamre to perform the funeral rites of their common 
 father.</P>

 being seventeen years old was a shepherd over the flock"--he a lad, 
 with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah. Oversight or superintendence is 
 evidently implied. This post of chief shepherd in the party might be 
 assigned him either from his being the son of a principal wife or from 
 his own superior qualities of character; and if invested with this 
 office, he acted not as a gossiping telltale, but as a "faithful

 The passion for various colors still reigns among the Arabs and other 
 people of the East, who are fond of dressing their children in this 
 gaudy attire. But since the art of interweaving various patterns was 
 introduced, "the coats of colors" are different now from what they seem 
 to have been in patriarchal times, and bear a close resemblance to the 
 varieties of tartan.</P>

 salutation; and the withholding of it is an unmistakable sign of
 dislike or secret hostility. The habitual refusal of Joseph's brethren,
 therefore, to meet him with "the <I>salaam,</I>" showed how
 ill-disposed they were towards him. It is very natural in parents to
 love the youngest, and feel partial to those who excel in talents or
 amiableness. But in a family constituted as Jacob's--many children by 
 different mothers--he showed great and criminal indiscretion.</P>

 Canaan, blest with extraordinary abundance of water. Therefore did the 
 sons of Jacob go from Hebron to this place, though it must have cost 
 them near twenty hours' travelling--that is, at the shepherd rate, a 
 little more than fifty miles. But the herbage there was so rich and 
 nutritious that they thought it well worth the pains of so long a

 accepting the mission with alacrity, left the vale of Hebron, sought 
 them at Shechem, heard of them from a man in "the field" (the wide and 
 richly cultivated plain of Esdraelon), and found that they had left

 detested as a species of blasphemy, and in this light Joseph was 
 regarded by his brethren as an artful pretender. They already began to 
 form a plot for Joseph's assassination, from which he was rescued only 
 by the address of Reuben, who suggested that he should rather be cast 
 into one of the wells, which are, and probably were, completely dried

 unnatural assailants! A vivid picture of his state of agony and despair 
 was afterwards drawn by themselves (compare

 those hardened profligates! Their common share in this conspiracy is 
 not the only dismal feature in the story. The rapidity, the almost 
 instantaneous manner in which the proposal was followed by their joint 
 resolution, and the cool indifference, or rather the fiendish 
 satisfaction, with which they sat down to regale themselves, is 
 astonishing. It is impossible that mere envy at his dreams, his gaudy 
 dress, or the doting partiality of their common father, could have 
 goaded them on to such a pitch of frenzied resentment or confirmed them 
 in such consummate wickedness. Their hatred to Joseph must have had a 
 far deeper seat. It must have been produced by dislike to his piety and 
 other excellencies, which made his character and conduct a constant 
 censure upon theirs, and on account of which they found that they could 
 never be at ease till they had rid themselves of his hated presence.  
 This was the true solution of the mystery, just as it was in the case 
 of Cain

 <B>they lifted up their eyes, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and, behold, a company of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:36">Ge 37:36</A>), 

 being a travelling caravan composed of a mixed association of Arabians. 
 Those tribes of Northern Arabia had already addicted themselves to 
 commerce, and long did they enjoy a monopoly, the carrying trade being 
 entirely in their hands.  Their approach could easily be seen; for, as 
 their road, after crossing the ford from the trans-jordanic district, 
 led along the south side of the mountains of Gilboa, a party seated on 
 the plain of Dothan could trace them and their string of camels in the 
 distance as they proceeded through the broad and gently sloping valley 
 that intervenes. Trading in the produce of Arabia and India, they were 
 in the regular course of traffic on their way to Egypt: and the chief 
 articles of commerce in which this clan dealt were

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>spicery</B> from India, that is, a species of resinous gum, called
 <I>storax,</I>

 <B>balm</B>--"balm of Gilead," the juice of the balsam tree, a native
 of Arabia-Felix, and

 <B>myrrh</B>--an Arabic gum of a strong, fragrant smell. For these
 articles there must have been an enormous demand in Egypt as they were
 constantly used in the process of embalming.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>26-28. Judah said, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What profit is it if we slay our 
 brother?</B>--The sight of these travelling merchants gave a sudden 
 turn to the views of the conspirators; for having no wish to commit a 
 greater degree of crime than was necessary for the accomplishment of 
 their end, they readily approved of Judah's suggestion to dispose of 
 their obnoxious brother as a slave. The proposal, of course, was 
 founded on their knowledge that the Arabian merchants trafficked in 
 slaves; and there is the clearest evidence furnished by the monuments 
 of Egypt that the traders who were in the habit of bringing slaves from 
 the countries through which they passed, found a ready market in the 
 cities of the Nile.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>they .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold 
 him</B>--Acting impulsively on Judah's advice, they had their poor 
 victim ready by the time the merchants reached them; and money being no 
 part of their object, they sold him for

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>twenty pieces of silver</B>--The money was probably in rings or 
 pieces (shekels), and silver is always mentioned in the records of that 
 early age before gold, on account of its rarity. The whole sum, if in 
 shekel weight, did not exceed &pound;3.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>they brought Joseph into Egypt</B>--There were two routes to Egypt: 
 the one was overland by Hebron, where Jacob dwelt, and by taking which, 
 the fate of his hapless son would likely have reached the paternal 
 ears; the other was directly westward across the country from Dothan to 
 the maritime coast, and in this, the safest and most expeditious way, 
 the merchants carried Joseph to Egypt. Thus did an overruling 
 Providence lead this murderous conclave of brothers, as well as the 
 slave merchants both following their own free courses--to be parties in 
 an act by which He was to work out, in a marvellous manner, the great 
 purposes of His wisdom and goodness towards His ancient Church and 
 people.</P>

 designedly taken a circuitous route, with a view of secretly rescuing 
 the poor lad from a lingering death by starvation. His intentions were 
 excellent, and his feelings no doubt painfully lacerated when he 
 discovered what had been done in his absence. But the thing was of God,

 a necessary consequence of the atrocious crime they had perpetrated.  
 What a wonder that their cruel sneer, "thy son's coat," and their 
 forced efforts to comfort him, did not awaken suspicion! But extreme 
 grief, like every other passion, is blind, and Jacob, great as his 
 affliction was, did allow himself to indulge his sorrow more than

 <B>1. Potiphar</B>--This name, Potiphar, signifies one "devoted to the
 sun," the local deity of On or Heliopolis, a circumstance which fixes
 the place of his residence in the Delta, the district of Egypt
 bordering on Canaan.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>officer</B>--literally, "prince of the Pharoah"--that is, in the
 service of government.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>captain of the guard</B>--The import of the original term has been 
 variously interpreted, some considering it means "chief cook," others, 
 "chief inspector of plantations"; but that which seems best founded is 
 "chief of the executioners," the same as the captain of the watch, the 
 <I>zabut</I> of modern Egypt [W<FONT SIZE=-1>ILKINSON</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>bought him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of the Ishmaelites</B>--The age, 
 appearance, and intelligence of the Hebrew slave would soon cause him 
 to be picked up in the market. But the unseen, unfelt influence of the 
 great Disposer drew the attention of Potiphar towards him, in order 
 that in the house of one so closely connected with the court, he might 
 receive that previous training which was necessary for the high office 
 he was destined to fill, and in the school of adversity learn the 
 lessons of practical wisdom that were to be of greatest utility and 
 importance in his future career. Thus it is that when God has any 
 important work to be done, He always prepares fitting agents to 
 accomplish it.</P>

 <A NAME="Ge39_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. he was in the house of his master</B>--Those slaves who had been 
 war captives were generally sent to labor in the field and subjected to 
 hard treatment under the "stick" of taskmasters. But those who were 
 bought with money were employed in domestic purposes, were kindly 
 treated, and enjoyed as much liberty as the same class does in modern 
 Egypt.</P>

 <A NAME="Ge39_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. his master saw that the Lord was with him</B>--Though changed in 
 condition, Joseph was not changed in spirit; though stripped of the 
 gaudy coat that had adorned his person, he had not lost the moral 
 graces that distinguished his character; though separated from his 
 father on earth, he still lived in communion with his Father in heaven; 
 though in the house of an idolater, he continued a worshipper of the 
 true God.</P>

 <A NAME="Ge39_4"> </A>

 <A NAME="Ge39_5"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>5. the Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake,</B> 
 &c.--It might be--it probably was--that a special, a miraculous 
 blessing was poured out on a youth who so faithfully and zealously 
 served God amid all the disadvantages of his place. But it may be 
 useful to remark that such a blessing usually follows in the ordinary 
 course of things; and the most worldly, unprincipled masters always 
 admire and respect religion in a servant when they see that profession 
 supported by conscientious principle and a consistent life.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>made him overseer in his house</B>--We do not know in what capacity 
 Joseph entered into the service of Potiphar; but the observant eye of 
 his master soon discovered his superior qualities and made him his 
 chief, his confidential servant (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:7,Col+3:23">Eph 6:7;
 Col 3:23</A>).

 The advancement of domestic slaves is not uncommon, and it is 
 considered a great disgrace not to raise one who has been a year or two 
 in the family. But this extraordinary advancement of Joseph was the 
 doing of the Lord, though on the part of Potiphar it was the 
 consequence of observing the astonishing prosperity that attended him 
 in all that he did.</P>

 <A NAME="Ge39_7"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>7. his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph</B>--Egyptian women 
 were not kept in the same secluded manner as females are in most 
 Oriental countries now. They were treated in a manner more worthy of a 
 civilized people--in fact, enjoyed much freedom both at home and 
 abroad. Hence Potiphar's wife had constant opportunity of meeting 
 Joseph. But the ancient women of Egypt were very loose in their morals. 
 Intrigues and intemperance were vices very prevalent among them, as
 the monuments too plainly attest [W<FONT SIZE=-1>ILKINSON</FONT>]. 
 Potiphar's wife was probably not worse than many of the same rank, and 
 her infamous advances made to Joseph arose from her superiority of 
 station.</P>

 of the house, and on his return to her lord.

 <B>20. Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison</B>--the 
 roundhouse, from the form of its construction, usually attached to the 
 dwelling of such an officer as Potiphar. It was partly a subterranean 
 dungeon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:14">Ge 41:14</A>), 

 though the brick-built walls rose considerably above the surface of the 
 ground, and were surmounted by a vaulted roof somewhat in the form of 
 an inverted bowl. Into such a dungeon Potiphar, in the first ebullition 
 of rage, threw Joseph and ordered him to be subjected further to as 
 great harshness of treatment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:18">Ps 105:18</A>)

 as he dared; for the power of masters over their slaves was very 
 properly restrained by law, and the murder of a slave was a capital 
 crime.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>a place where the king's prisoners were bound</B>--Though prisons 
 seem to have been an inseparable appendage of the palaces, this was not 
 a common jail--it was the receptacle of state criminals; and, 
 therefore, it may be presumed that more than ordinary strictness and 
 vigilance were exercised over the prisoners. In general, however, the 
 Egyptian, like other Oriental prisons, were used solely for the 
 purposes of detention. Accused persons were cast into them until the 
 charges against them could be investigated; and though the jailer was 
 responsible for the appearance of those placed under his custody, yet, 
 provided they were produced when called, he was never interrogated as 
 to the way in which he had kept them.</P>

 <A NAME="Ge39_21"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>21-23. The Lord .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gave him favour in the sight of the 
 keeper of the prison,</B> &c.--It is highly probable, from the 
 situation of this prison

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+40:3">Ge 40:3</A>), 

 that the keeper might have been previously acquainted with Joseph and 
 have had access to know his innocence of the crime laid to his charge, 
 as well as with all the high integrity of his character. That may 
 partly account for his showing so much kindness and confidence to his 
 prisoner. But there was a higher influence at work; for "the Lord was 
 with Joseph, and that which he did, the Lord made it to prosper."</P>

 who, it would seem, was by this time satisfied of the perfect innocence 
 of the young Hebrew; though, probably, to prevent the exposure of his 
 family, he deemed it prudent to detain him in confinement (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:5">Ps 37:5</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>They continued a season in ward</B>--literally, "days," how long, is

 Observing them one day extremely depressed, he inquired the cause of 
 their melancholy; and being informed it was owing to a dream they had

 attended by his butler, who gave him a cooling draught. On all 
 occasions, the kings of ancient Egypt were required to practice 
 temperance in the use of wine [W<FONT SIZE=-1>ILKINSON</FONT>]; but in 
 this scene, it is a prepared beverage he is drinking, probably the 
 sherbet of the present day. Everything was done in the king's 
 presence--the cup was washed, the juice of the grapes pressed into it; 
 and it was then handed to him--not grasped; but lightly resting on the
 tips of the fingers.</P>

 announcement, he earnestly bespoke the officer's influence for his own

 <B>white</B>--literally, "full of holes"; that is, wicker baskets. The 
 meats were carried to table upon the head in three baskets, one piled 
 upon the other; and in the uppermost, the bakemeats. And in crossing 
 the open courts, from the kitchen to the dining rooms, the removal of 
 the viands by a vulture, eagle, ibis, or other rapacious bird, was a 
 frequent occurrence in the palaces of Egypt, as it is an everyday 
 incident in the hot countries of the East still. The risk from these 
 carnivorous birds was the greater in the cities of Egypt, where being 
 held sacred, it was unlawful to destroy them; and they swarmed in such 
 numbers as to be a great annoyance to the people.</P>

 criminal was decapitated and then his headless body gibbeted on a tree 
 by the highway till it was gradually devoured by the ravenous

 Doubtless, he felt it painful to communicate such dismal tidings to the 
 baker; but he could not help announcing what God had revealed to him;

 years are reckoned from the beginning of Joseph's imprisonment, or from 
 the events described in the preceding chapter--most likely the latter.  
 What a long time for Joseph to experience the sickness of hope 
 deferred! But the time of his enlargement came when he had sufficiently 
 learned the lessons of God designed for him; and the plans of 
 Providence were matured.

 <B>Pharaoh dreamed</B>--"Pharaoh," from an Egyptian word <I>Phre,</I> 
 signifying the "sun," was the official title of the kings of that 
 country. The prince, who occupied the throne of Egypt, was Aphophis, 
 one of the Memphite kings, whose capital was On or Heliopolis, and who 
 is universally acknowledged to have been a patriot king. Between the 
 arrival of Abraham and the appearance of Joseph in that country, 
 somewhat more than two centuries had elapsed. Kings sleep and dream, as 
 well as their subjects. And this Pharaoh had two dreams in one night so 
 singular and so similar, so distinct and so apparently significant, so 
 coherent and vividly impressed on his memory, that his spirit was 
 troubled.</P>

 to define the exact distinction between "magicians" and "wise men"; but 
 they formed different branches of a numerous body, who laid claim to 
 supernatural skill in occult arts and sciences, in revealing mysteries, 
 explaining portents, and, above all, interpreting dreams. Long practice 
 had rendered them expert in devising a plausible way of getting out of 
 every difficulty and framing an answer suitable to the occasion. But 
 the dreams of Pharaoh baffled their united skill. Unlike their Assyrian 
 brethren

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:4">Da 2:4</A>), 

 they did not pretend to know the meaning of the symbols contained in 
 them, and the providence of God had determined that they should all be 
 nonplussed in the exercise of their boasted powers, in order that the 
 inspired wisdom of Joseph might appear the more remarkable.</P>

 <B>9-13. then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do 
 remember my faults</B>--This public acknowledgment of the merits of the 
 young Hebrew would, tardy though it was, have reflected credit on the 
 butler had it not been obviously made to ingratiate himself with his 
 royal master. It is right to confess our faults against God, and 
 against our fellow men when that confession is made in the spirit of 
 godly sorrow and penitence. But this man was not much impressed with a 
 sense of the fault he had committed against Joseph; he never thought of 
 God, to whose goodness he was indebted for the prophetic announcement 
 of his release, and in acknowledging his former fault against the king, 
 he was practising the courtly art of pleasing his master.</P>

 no human power nor policy could detain Joseph in prison. During his 
 protracted confinement, he might have often been distressed with 
 perplexing doubts; but the mystery of Providence was about to be 
 cleared up, and all his sorrows forgotten in the course of honor and 
 public usefulness in which his services were to be employed.

 <B>shaved himself</B>--The Egyptians were the only Oriental nation that 
 liked a smooth chin. All slaves and foreigners who were reduced to that 
 condition, were obliged, on their arrival in that country, to conform 
 to the cleanly habits of the natives, by shaving their beards and 
 heads, the latter of which were covered with a close cap. Thus

 out the genuine piety of Joseph; disclaiming all merit, he ascribed 
 whatever gifts or sagacity he possessed to the divine source of all 
 wisdom, and he declared his own inability to penetrate futurity; but, 
 at the same time, he expressed his confident persuasion that God would 
 reveal what was necessary to be known.</P>

 being wholly dependent on the Nile, the scene is laid on the banks of 
 that river; and oxen being in the ancient hieroglyphics symbolical of

 slaves have often risen to be its rulers. But the special providence of
 God had determined to make Joseph governor of Egypt; and the way was
 paved for it by the deep and universal conviction produced in the minds
 both of the king and his councillors, that a divine spirit animated his
 mind and had given him such extraordinary knowledge.

 In looking at this profusion of honors heaped suddenly upon Joseph, it 
 cannot be doubted that he would humbly yet thankfully acknowledge the 
 hand of a special Providence in conducting him through all his 
 checkered course to almost royal power; and we, who know more than 
 Joseph did, cannot only see that his advancement was subservient to the 
 most important purposes relative to the Church of God, but learn the

 their failure would produce the same disastrous effects in Canaan as in 
 Egypt. Numerous caravans of its people, therefore, poured over the 
 sandy desert of Suez, with their beasts of burden, for the purchase of 
 corn; and among others, "the sons of Israel" were compelled to 
 undertake a journey from which painful associations made them strongly

 while he had been expecting them. They had but one face; he had ten
 persons to judge by.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly</B>--It would be 
 an injustice to Joseph's character to suppose that this stern manner 
 was prompted by any vindictive feelings--he never indulged any 
 resentment against others who had injured him. But he spoke in the 
 authoritative tone of the governor in order to elicit some 
 much-longed-for information respecting the state of his father's 
 family, as well as to bring his brethren, by their own humiliation and

 The animals have to be killed as well as prepared at home. The heat of

 inexhaustible supply of vegetables, was provided for the repasts, to

 served, "bread" being a term inclusive of all victuals. The table was a 
 small stool, most probably the usual round form, "since persons might 
 even then be seated according to their rank or seniority, and the 
 modern Egyptian table is not without its post of honor and a fixed 
 gradation of place" [W<FONT SIZE=-1>ILKINSON</FONT>]. Two or at most 
 three persons were seated at one table. But the host being the highest

 honor--either by giving a choice piece from his own hand, or ordering 
 it to be taken to the stranger. The degree of respect shown consists in 
 the quantity, and while the ordinary rule of distinction is a double 
 mess, it must have appeared a very distinguished mark of favor bestowed 
 on Benjamin to have no less than five times any of his brethren.

 <B>1. And Joseph commanded the steward</B>--The design of putting the 
 cup into the sack of Benjamin was obviously to bring that young man 
 into a situation of difficulty or danger, in order thereby to discover 
 how far the brotherly feelings of the rest would be roused to 
 sympathize with his distress and stimulate their exertions in procuring 
 his deliverance. But for what purpose was the money restored? It was 
 done, in the first instance, from kindly feelings to his father; but 
 another and further design seems to have been the prevention of any 
 injurious impressions as to the character of Benjamin. The discovery of 
 the cup in <I>his</I> possession, if there had been nothing else to 
 judge by, might have fastened a painful suspicion of guilt on the 
 youngest brother; but the sight of the money in each man's sack would 
 lead all to the same conclusion, that Benjamin was just as innocent as 
 themselves, although the additional circumstance of the cup being found 
 in his sack would bring him into greater trouble and danger.</P>

 unto his steward</B>--They were brought to a sudden halt by the 
 stunning intelligence that an article of rare value was missing from 
 the governor's house. It was a silver cup; so strong suspicions were 
 entertained against them that a special messenger was despatched to 
 search them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>5. Is not this it in which my lord drinketh</B>--not only kept for 
 the governor's personal use, but whereby he divines. Divination by 
 cups, to ascertain the course of futurity, was one of the prevalent 
 superstitions of ancient Egypt, as it is of Eastern countries still.  
 It is not likely that Joseph, a pious believer in the true God, would 
 have addicted himself to this superstitious practice. But he might have 
 availed himself of that popular notion to carry out the successful 
 execution of his stratagem for the last decisive trial of his
 brethren.</P>

 <B>6, 7. he overtook them, and he spake .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. these 
 words</B>--The steward's words must have come upon them like a 
 thunderbolt, and one of their most predominant feelings must have been 
 the humiliating and galling sense of being made so often objects of 
 suspicion. Protesting their innocence, they invited a search. The 
 challenge was accepted

 <B>16-34. Judah said, What shall we say?</B>--This address needs no 
 comment--consisting at first of short, broken sentences, as if, under 
 the overwhelming force of the speaker's emotions, his utterance were 
 choked, it becomes more free and copious by the effort of speaking, as 
 he proceeds. Every word finds its way to the heart; and it may well be 
 imagined that Benjamin, who stood there speechless like a victim about 
 to be laid on the altar, when he heard the magnanimous offer of Judah 
 to submit to slavery for his ransom, would be bound by a lifelong 
 gratitude to his generous brother, a tie that seems to have become 
 hereditary in his tribe. Joseph's behavior must not be viewed from any 
 single point, or in separate parts, but as a whole--a well-thought, 
 deep-laid, closely connected plan; and though some features of it do 
 certainly exhibit an appearance of harshness, yet the pervading 
 principle of his conduct was real, genuine, brotherly kindness. Read in 
 this light, the narrative of the proceedings describes the continuous, 
 though secret, pursuit of one end; and Joseph exhibits, in his 
 management of the scheme, a very high order of intellect, a warm and 
 susceptible heart, united to a judgment that exerted a complete control 
 over his feelings--a happy invention in devising means towards the 
 attainment of his ends and an inflexible adherence to the course, 
 however painful, which prudence required.</P>

 <B>1. Then Joseph could not refrain himself</B>--The severity of the 
 inflexible magistrate here gives way to the natural feelings of the man 
 and the brother. However well he had disciplined his mind, he felt it 
 impossible to resist the artless eloquence of Judah. He saw a 
 satisfactory proof, in the return of <I>all</I> his brethren on such an 
 occasion, that they were affectionately united to one another; he had 
 heard enough to convince him that time, reflection, or grace had made a 
 happy improvement on their characters; and he would probably have 
 proceeded in a calm and leisurely manner to reveal himself as prudence 
 might have dictated. But when he heard the heroic self-sacrifice of 
 Judah

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+44:33">Ge 44:33</A>] 

 and realized all the affection of that proposal--a proposal for which
 he was totally unprepared--he was completely unmanned; he felt himself
 forced to bring this painful trial to an end.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he cried, Cause every man to go out from me</B>--In ordering the 
 departure of witnesses of this last scene, he acted as a warm-hearted 
 and real friend to his brothers--his conduct was dictated by motives of 
 the highest prudence--that of preventing their early iniquities from 
 becoming known either to the members of his household, or among the 
 people of Egypt.</P>

 that now rose in his breast as well as that of his brethren--and chased 
 each other in rapid succession--were many and violent. He was agitated 
 by sympathy and joy; they were astonished, confounded, terrified; and 
 betrayed their terror, by shrinking as far as they could from his 
 presence. So "troubled" were they, that he had to repeat his 
 announcement of himself; and what kind, affectionate terms he did use.  
 He spoke of their having sold him--not to wound their feelings, but to 
 convince them of his identity; and then, to reassure their minds, he 
 traced the agency of an overruling Providence, in his exile and present 
 honor

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:5-7">Ge 35:5-7</A>].

 <B>1. Israel took his journey with all that he had</B>--that is, his 
 household; for in compliance with Pharaoh's recommendation, he left his 
 heavy furniture behind. In contemplating a step so important as that of 
 leaving Canaan, which at his time of life he might never revisit, so 
 pious a patriarch would ask the guidance and counsel of God. With all 
 his anxiety to see Joseph, he would rather have died in Canaan without 
 that highest of earthly gratifications than leave it without the 
 consciousness of carrying the divine blessing along with him.

 <B>came to Beer-sheba</B>--That place, which was in his direct route to 
 Egypt, had been a favorite encampment of Abraham

 covenant and an assurance of its blessings. Moreover, here is an answer 
 on the chief subject of Jacob's prayer and a removal of any doubt as to 
 the course he was meditating. At first the prospect of paying a 
 personal visit to Joseph had been viewed with unmingled joy. But, on 
 calmer consideration, many difficulties appeared to lie in the way. He 
 may have remembered the prophecy to Abraham that his posterity was to 
 be afflicted in Egypt and also that his father had been expressly told 
 <I>not</I> to go

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:13,26:2">Ge 15:13; 26:2</A>];

 he may have feared the contamination of idolatry to his family and 
 their forgetfulness of the land of promise. These doubts were removed 
 by the answer of the oracle, and an assurance given him of great and 
 increasing prosperity.</P>

 <A NAME="Ge46_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. I will there make of thee a great nation</B>--How truly this 
 promise was fulfilled, appears in the fact that the seventy souls who 
 went down into Egypt increased

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+1:5-7">Ex 1:5-7</A>],

 in the space of two hundred fifteen years, to one hundred eighty 
 thousand.</P>

 <A NAME="Ge46_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4. I will also surely bring thee up again</B>--As Jacob could not
 expect to live till the former promise was realized, he must have seen 
 that the latter was to be accomplished only to his posterity. To 
 himself it was literally verified in the removal of his remains to 
 Canaan; but, in the large and liberal sense of the words, it was made 
 good only on the establishment of Israel in the land of promise.

 The patriarch describes him as attacked by envy, revenge, temptation, 
 ingratitude; yet still, by the grace of God, he triumphed over all 
 opposition, so that he became the sustainer of Israel; and then he 
 proceeds to shower blessings of every kind upon the head of this

 <B>1. Joseph fell upon his father's face,</B> &c.--On him, as the 
 principal member of the family, devolved the duty of closing the eyes 
 of his venerable parent (compare

 <B>2. Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his 
 father,</B> &c.--In ancient Egypt the embalmers were a class by 
 themselves. The process of embalmment consisted in infusing a great 
 quantity of resinous substances into the cavities of the body, after 
 the intestines had been removed, and then a regulated degree of heat 
 was applied to dry up the humors, as well as decompose the tarry 
 materials which had been previously introduced. Thirty days were 
 alloted for the completion of this process; forty more were spent in 
 anointing it with spices; the body, tanned from this operation, being 
 then washed, was wrapped in numerous folds of linen cloth--the joinings 
 of which were fastened with gum, and then it was deposited in a wooden 
 chest made in the form of a human figure.</P>

 <B>4, 5. Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh,</B> &c.--Care was 
 taken to let it be known that the family sepulchre was provided before 
 leaving Canaan and that an oath bound his family to convey the remains 
 thither.  Besides, Joseph deemed it right to apply for a special leave 
 of absence; and being unfit, as a mourner, to appear in the royal 
 presence, he made the request through the medium of others.</P>

 <B>10. they came to the threshing-floor of Atad,</B> &c.--"Atad" may be 
 taken as a common noun, signifying "the plain of the thorn bushes." It 
 was on the border between Egypt and Canaan; and as the last opportunity 
 of indulging grief was always the most violent, the Egyptians made a 
 prolonged halt at this spot, while the family of Jacob probably 
 proceeded by themselves to the place of sepulture.</P>

 pious character, as well as appeared an eminent type of the
 Saviour.</P>

 assurance of the promises, by "the commandment concerning his bones"
