<h1>INSTITUTES OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION</h1>
<h2>By John Calvin</h2>
<h3>A New Translation
by
Henry Beveridge, Esq.</h3>

<div>The Institution of The Christian Religion, written in Latin, by master John
Calvin, and translated into English according to the authors last
edition.<br></div>
<div>Seen and allowed according to the order appointed in the Queries maiesties
injunctions.<br></div>
<div><font size="7">PREFACE TO THE ELECTRONIC EDITION.</font><br></div>
<div>In an attempt to assist you in your efforts, this electronic publication
has been updated to include a new series of footnotes in addition to the notes
from the original Beveridge Translation. These footnotes were written by Robert
J. Dunzweiler, Professor of Systematic Theology, Biblical Theology Seminary,
Hatfield Pennsylvania. In both systems the footnotes are indicated by
superscript numbers. To distinguish the two systems from each other, Professor
Dunzweiler&#8217;s notes are all proceeded by a capital D. We hope you like this
new addition and that it will aid you in your studies.<br></div>
<div><font size="7">INTRODUCTION</font><br></div>
<div><font size="5"><i>BY</i> THE REV. JOHN MURRAY, M.A., TH.M.</font><br></div>
<div><font size="8">T</font>HE publication in English of another edition of the
<i>opus magnum</i> of Christian theology is an event fraught with much
encouragement. Notwithstanding the decadence so patent in our present-day world
and particularly in the realm of Christian thought and life, the publishers have
confidence that there is sufficient interest to warrant such an undertaking. If
this faith is justified we have reason for thanksgiving to God. For what would
be a better harbinger of another Reformation than widespread recourse to the
earnest and sober study of the Word of God which would be evinced by the
readiness carefully to peruse <i>The Institutes of the Christian
Religion</i>.<br></div>
<div>Dr. B. B. Warfield in his admirable article, &#8220;On the Literary History
of the <i>Institutes</i>,&#8221; has condensed for us the appraisal accorded
Calvin&#8217;s work by the critics who have been most competent to judge. Among
these tributes none expresses more adequately, and none with comparable
terseness, the appraisal which is Calvin&#8217;s due than that of the learned
Joseph Scaliger, &#8220;Solus inter theologos Calvinus.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>It would be a presumptuous undertaking to try to set forth all the reasons
why Calvin holds that position of eminence in the history of Christian theology.
By the grace and in the overruling providence of God there was the convergence
of multiple factors, and all of these it would be impossible to trace in their
various interrelations and interactions. One of these, however, calls for
special mention. Calvin was an exegete and biblical theologian of the first
rank. No other one factor comparably served to equip Calvin for the successful
prosecution of his greatest work which in 1559 received its definitive
edition.<br></div>
<div>The attitude to Scripture entertained by Calvin and the principles which
guided him in its exposition are nowhere stated with more simplicity and fervor
than in the Epistle Dedicatory to his first commentary, the commentary on the
epistle to the Romans. &#8220;Such veneration,&#8221; he says, &#8220;we ought
indeed to entertain for the Word of God, that we ought not to pervert it in the
least degree by varying expositions; for its majesty is diminished, I know not
how much, especially when not expounded with great discretion and with great
sobriety. And if it be deemed a great wickedness to contaminate any thing that
is dedicated to God, he surely cannot be endured, who, with impure, or even with
unprepared hands, will handle that very thing, which of all things is the most
sacred on earth. It is therefore an audacity, closely allied to a sacrilege,
rashly to turn Scripture in any way we please, and to indulge our fancies as in
sport; which has been done by many in former times&#8221; (English Translation,
Grand Rapids, 1947, p. 27).<br></div>
<div>It was Calvin preeminently who set the pattern for the exercise of that
sobriety which guards the science of exegesis against those distortions and
perversions to which allegorizing methods are ever prone to subject the
interpretation and application of Scripture. The debt we owe to Calvin in
establishing sound canons of interpretation and in thus directing the future
course of exegetical study is incalculable. It is only to be lamented that too
frequently the preaching of Protestant and even Reformed communions has not been
sufficiently grounded in the hermeneutical principles which Calvin so nobly
exemplified.<br></div>
<div>One feature of Calvin&#8217;s exegetical work is his concern for the
analogy of Scripture. He is always careful to take account of the unity and
harmony of Scripture teaching. His expositions are not therefore afflicted with
the vice of expounding particular passages without respect to the teaching of
Scripture elsewhere and without respect to the system of truth set forth in the
Word of God. His exegesis, in a word, is theologically oriented. It is this
quality that lies close to that which was <i>par excellence</i> his
genius.<br></div>
<div>However highly we assess Calvin&#8217;s exegetical talent and product, his
eminence as an exegete must not be allowed to overshadow what was, after all,
his greatest gift. He was <i>par excellence</i> a theologian. It was his
systematizing genius preeminently that equipped him for the prosecution and
completion of his masterpiece.<br></div>
<div>When we say that he was <i>par excellence</i> a theologian we must
dissociate from our use of this word every notion that is suggestive of the
purely speculative. No one has ever fulminated with more passion and eloquence
against &#8220;vacuous and meteoric speculation&#8221; than has Calvin. And no
one has ever been more keenly conscious that the theologian&#8217;s task was the
humble and, at the same time, truly noble one of being a disciple of the
Scripture. &#8220;No man,&#8221; he declares, &#8220;can have the least
knowledge of true and sound, doctrine, without having been a disciple of the
Scripture. Hence originates all true wisdom, when we embrace with reverence the
testimony which God hath been pleased therein to deliver concerning himself. For
obedience is the source, not only of an absolutely perfect and complete faith,
but of all right knowledge of God&#8221; (<i>Inst.</i> 1, 6, 2). In the words of
William Cunningham: &#8220;In theology there is, of course, no room for
originality properly so called, for its whole materials are contained in the
actual statements of God&#8217;s word; and he is the greatest and best
theologian who has most accurately apprehended the meaning of the statements of
Scripture-who, by comparing and combining them, has most fully and correctly
brought out the whole mind of God on all the topics on which the Scriptures give
us information-who classifies and digests the truths of Scripture in the way
best fitted to commend them to the apprehension and acceptance of men-and who
can most clearly and forcibly bring out their scriptural evidence, and most
skillfully and effectively defend them against the assaults of adversaries . . .
Calvin was far above the weakness of aiming at the invention of novelties in
theology, or of wishing to be regarded as the discoverer of new opinions&#8221;
(<i>The Reformers and the Theology of the Reformation</i>, Edinburgh, 1866, p.
296). As we bring even elementary understanding to bear upon our reading of the
<i>Institutes</i> we shall immediately discover the profound sense of the
majesty of God, veneration for the Word of God, and the jealous care for
faithful exposition and systematization which were marked features of the
author. And because of this we shall find the <i>Institutes</i> to be suffused
with the warmth of godly fear. The <i>Institutes</i> is not only the classic of
Christian theology; it is also a model of Christian devotion. For what Calvin
sought to foster was that &#8220;pure and genuine religion&#8221; which consists
in &#8220;faith united with the serious fear of God, such fear as may embrace
voluntary reverence and draw along with it legitimate worship such as is
prescribed in the law&#8221; (<i>Inst.</i> 1, 2, 2).<br></div>
<div>The present edition is from the translation made by Henry Beveridge in 1845
for the Calvin Translation Society. The reader may be assured that the
translation faithfully reflects the teaching of Calvin but must also bear in
mind that no translation can perfectly convey the thought of the original. It
may also be added that a more adequate translation of Calvin&#8217;s
<i>Institutes</i> into English is a real <i>desideratum</i>. In fulfilling this
need the translator or translators would perform the greatest service if the
work of translation were supplemented by footnotes in which at crucial points,
where translation is difficult or most accurate translation impossible, the
Latin text would be reproduced and comment made on its more exact import.
Furthermore, footnotes which would supply the reader with references to other
places in Calvin&#8217;s writings where he deals with the same subject would be
an invaluable help to students of Calvin and to the cause of truth. Admittedly
such work requires linguistic skill of the highest order, thorough knowledge of
Calvin&#8217;s writings, and deep sympathy with his theology. It would also
involve prodigious labour. We may hope that the seed being sown by the present
venture may bear fruit some day in such a harvest.<br></div>

<div>Whereas some men have thought and reported it to be [very great negligence
in us for that we have so long kept back from you this,] being so profitable a
work for you, namely before the master J[ohnne] Dawes had translated it and
delivered it into our hands more than a twelvemonth past: you shall understand
for our excuse in that behalf, that we could not well imprint it sooner. For we
have been by diverse necessary causes constrained with our earnest entreatance
to procure an other frede or oures to translate it whole again. This
translation, we trust, you shall well allow. For it hath not only been
faithfully done by the translator himself, but also hath been wholly perused by
such men, whose ingement and credit all the godly learned in England well know I
estheme. But since it is now come forth, we pray you accept it, and see it. If
any faults have passed us by oversight, we beseech you let us have your
patience, as you have had our diligence.<br></div>
<div>The Institution of Christian Religion, written in Latin by M. John Calvin,

<div><font size="5">T[HOMAS] N[ORTON], THE TRANSLATOR TO THE
READER.</font><br></div>
<div>Good reader, here is now offered you, the fourth time printed in English,
M. Calvin&#8217;s book of the Institution of Christian Religion; a book of great
labour to the author, and of great profit to the Church of God. M. Calvin first
wrote it when he was a young man, a book of small volume, and since that season
he has at sundry times published it with new increases, still protesting at
every edition himself to be one of those qui scribendo proficiunt, et
proficiendo scribunt, which with their writing do grow in profiting, and with
their profiting do proceed in writing. At length having, in many [of] his other
works, traveled about exposition of sundry books of the Scriptures, and in the
same finding occasion to discourse of sundry common-places and matters of
doctrine, which being handled according to the occasions of the text that were
offered him, and not in any other method, were not so ready for the
reader&#8217;s use, he therefore entered into this purpose to enlarge this book
of Institutions, and therein to treat of all those titles and commonplaces
largely, with this intent, that whensoever any occasion fell in his other books
to treat of any such cause, he would not newly amplify his books of commentaries
and expositions therewith, but refer his reader wholly to this storehouse and
treasure of that sort of divine learning. As age and weakness grew upon him, so
he hastened his labour; and, according to his petition to God, he in manner
ended his life with his work, for he lived not long after.<br></div>
<div>So great a jewel was meet to be made most beneficial, that is to say,
applied to most common use. Therefore, in the very beginning of the
Queen&#8217;s Majesty&#8217;s most blessed reign, I translated it out of Latin
into English for the commodity of the Church of Christ, at the special request
of my dear friends of worthy memory, Reginald Wolfe and Edward Whitchurch, the
one her Majesty&#8217;s printer for the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin tongues, the
other her Highness&#8217; printer of the books of Common Prayer. I performed my
work in the house of my said friend, Edward Whitchurch, a man well known of
upright heart and dealing, an ancient zealous gospeller, as plain and true a
friend as ever I knew living, and as desirous to do anything to common good,
especially by the advancement of true religion.<br></div>
<div>At my said first edition of this book, I considered how the author thereof
had of long time purposely laboured to write the same most exactly, and to pack
great plenty of matter in small room of words; yea, and those so circumspectly
and precisely ordered, to avoid the cavillations of such as for enmity to the
truth therein contained would gladly seek and abuse all advantages which might
be found by any oversight in penning of it, that the sentences were thereby
become so full as nothing might well be added without idle superfluity, and
again so highly pared, that nothing could be diminished without taking away some
necessary substance of matter therein expressed. This manner of writing, beside
the peculiar terms of arts and figures, and the difficulty of the matters
themselves, being throughout interlaced with the school men&#8217;s
controversies, made a great hardness in the author&#8217;s own book, in that
tongue wherein otherwise he is both plentiful and easy, insomuch that it
sufficeth not to read him once, unless you can be content to read in vain. This
consideration encumbered me with great doubtfulness for the whole order and
frame of my translation. If I should follow the words, I saw that of necessity
the hardness in the translation must needs be greater than was in the tongue
wherein it was originally written. If I should leave the course of words, and
grant myself liberty after the natural manner of my own tongue, to say that in
English which I conceived to be his meaning in Latin, I plainly perceived how
hardly I might escape error, and on the other side, in this matter of faith and
religion, how perilous it was to err. For I durst not presume to warrant myself
to have his meaning without his words. And they that wet what it is to translate
well and faithfully, especially in matters of religion, do know that not the
only grammatical construction of words sufficeth, but the very building and
order to observe all advantages of vehemence or grace, by placing or accent of
words, maketh much to the true setting forth of a writer&#8217;s mind.<br></div>
<div>In the end, I rested upon this determination, to follow the words so near
as the phrase of the English tongue would suffer me. Which purpose I so
performed, that if the English book were printed in such paper and letter as the
Latin is, it should not exceed the Latin in quantity. Whereby, beside all other
commodities that a faithful translation of so good a work may bring, this one
benefit is moreover provided for such as are desirous to attain some knowledge
of the Latin tongue (which is, at this time, to be wished in many of those men
for whose profession this book most fitly serveth), that they shall not find any
more English than shall suffice to construe the Latin withal, except in such few
places where the great difference of the phrases of the languages enforced me:
so that, comparing the one with the other, they shall both profit in good
matter, and furnish themselves with understanding of that speech, wherein the
greatest treasures of knowledge are disclosed. <br></div>
<div>In the doing hereof, I did not only trust mine own wit or ability, but
examined my whole doing from sentence to sentence throughout the whole book with
conference and overlooking of such learned men, as my translation being allowed
by their Judgment, I did both satisfy mine own conscience that I had done truly,
and their approving of it might be a good warrant to the reader that nothing
should herein be delivered him but sound, unmingled, and uncorrupted doctrine,
even in such sort as the author himself had first framed it. All that I wrote,
the grave, learned, and virtuous man, M. David Whitehead (whom I name with
honourable remembrance), did, among others, compare with the Latin, examining
every sentence throughout the whole book. Beside all this, I privately required
many, and generally all men with whom I ever had any talk of this matter, that
if they found anything either not truly translated, or not plainly Englished,
they would inform me thereof, promising either to satisfy them or to amend it.
Since which time, I have not been advertised by any man of anything which they
would require to be altered. Neither had I myself, by reason of my profession,
being otherwise occupied, any leisure to peruse it. And that is the cause, why
not only at the second and third time, but also at this impression, you have no
change at all in the work, but altogether as it was before.<br></div>
<div>Indeed, I perceived many men well-minded and studious of this book, to
require a table for their ease and furtherance. Their honest desire I have
fulfilled in the second edition, and have added thereto a plentiful table, which
is also here inserted, which I have translated out of the Latin, wherein the
principal matters discoursed in this book are named by their due titles in order
of alphabet, and under every title is set forth a brief sum of the whole
doctrine taught in this book concerning the matter belonging to that title or
common-place; and therewith is added the book, chapter, and section or division
of the chapter, where the same doctrine is more largely expressed and proved.
And for the readier finding thereof, I have caused the number of the chapters to
be set upon every leaf in the book, and quoted the sections also by their due
numbers with the usual figures of algorism. And now at this last publishing, my
friends, by whose charge it is now newly imprinted in a Roman letter and smaller
volume, with divers other Tables which, since my second edition, were gathered
by M. Marlorate, to be translated and here added for your benefit.<br></div>
<div>Moreover, whereas in the first edition the evil manner of my scribbling
hand, the interlining of my copy, and some other causes well known among workmen
of that faculty, made very many faults to pass the printer, I have, in the
second impression, caused the book to be composed by the printed copy, and
corrected by the written; whereby it must needs be that it was much more truly
done than the other was, as I myself do know above three hundred faults amended.
And now at this last printing, the composing after a printed copy bringeth some
ease, and the diligence used about the correction having been right faithfully
looked unto, it cannot be but much more truly set forth. This also is performed,
that the volume being smaller, with a letter fair and legible, it is of more
easy price, that it may be of more common use, and so to more large
communicating of so great a treasure to those that desire Christian knowledge
for instruction of their faith, and guiding of their duties. Thus, on the
printer&#8217;s behalf and mine, your ease and commodity (good readers) provided
for. Now resteth your own diligence, for your own profit, in studying
it.<br></div>
<div>To spend many words in commending the work itself were needless; yet thus
much I think, I may both not unruly and not vainly say, that though many great
learned men have written books of common-places of our religion, as Melancthon,
Sarcerius, and others, whose works are very good and profitable to the Church of
God, yet by the consenting Judgment of those that understand the same, there is
none to be compared to this work of Calvin, both for his substantial sufficiency
of doctrine, the sound declaration of truth in articles of our religion, the
large and learned confirmation of the same, and the most deep and strong
confutation of all old and new heresies; so that (the Holy Scriptures excepted)
this is one of the most profitable books for all students of Christian divinity.
Wherein (good readers), as I am glad for the glory of God, and for your benefit,
that you may have this profit of my travel, so I beseech you let me have this
use of your gentleness, that my doings may be construed to such good end as I
have meant them; and that if any thing mislike you by reason of hardness, or any
other cause that may seem to be my default, you will not forthwith condemn the
work, but read it after; in which doing you will find (as many have confessed to
me that they have found by experience) that those things which at the first
reading shall displease you for hardness, shall be found so easy as so hard
matter would suffer, and, for the most part, more easy than some other phrase
which should with greater looseness and smoother sliding away deceive your
understanding. I confess, indeed, it is not finely and pleasantly written, nor
carrieth with it such delightful grace of speech as some great wise men have
bestowed upon some foolisher things, yet it containeth sound truth set forth
with faithful plainness, without wrong done to the author&#8217;s meaning; and
so, if you accept and use it, you shall not fail to have great profit thereby,
and I shall think my labour very well employed.<br></div>

<div><font size="5">JOHN CALVIN PRAYS PEACE AND SALVATION IN
CHRIST.</font><sup><a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup><br></div>
<div>SIRE,-When I first engaged in this work, nothing was farther from my
thoughts than to write what should afterwards be presented to your Majesty. My
intention was only to furnish a kind of rudiments, by which those who feel some
interest in religion might be trained to true godliness. And I toiled at the
task chiefly for the sake of my countrymen the French, multitudes of whom I
perceived to be hungering and thirsting after Christ, while very few seemed to
have been duly imbued with even a slender knowledge of him. That this was the
object which I had in view is apparent from the work itself, which is written in
a simple and elementary form adapted for instruction.<br></div>
<div>But when I perceived that the fury of certain bad men had risen to such a
height in your realm, that there was no place in it for sound doctrine, I
thought it might be of service if I were in the same work both to give
instruction to my countrymen, and also lay before your Majesty a Confession,
from which you may learn what the doctrine is that so inflames the rage of those
madmen who are this day, with fire and sword, troubling your kingdom. For I fear
not to declare, that what I have here given may be regarded as a summary of the
very doctrine which, they vociferate, ought to be punished with confiscation,
exile, imprisonment, and flames, as well as exterminated by land and
sea.<br></div>
<div>I am aware, indeed, how, in order to render our cause as hateful to your
Majesty as possible, they have filled your ears and mind with atrocious
insinuations; but you will be pleased, of your clemency, to reflect, that
neither in word nor deed could there be any innocence, were it sufficient merely
to accuse. When any one, with the view of exciting prejudice, observes that this
doctrine, of which I am endeavouring to give your Majesty an account, has been
condemned by the suffrages of all the estates, and was long ago stabbed again
and again by partial sentences of courts of law, he undoubtedly says nothing
more than that it has sometimes been violently oppressed by the power and
faction of adversaries, and sometimes fraudulently and insidiously overwhelmed
by lies, cavils, and calumny. While a cause is unheard, it is violence to pass
sanguinary sentences against it; it is fraud to charge it, contrary to its
deserts, with sedition and mischief.<br></div>
<div>That no one may suppose we are unjust in thus complaining, you yourself,
most illustrious Sovereign, can bear us witness with what lying calumnies it is
daily traduced in your presence, as aiming at nothing else than to wrest the
sceptres of kings out of their hands, to overturn all tribunals and seats of
justice, to subvert all order and government, to disturb the peace and quiet of
society, to abolish all laws, destroy the distinctions of rank and property,
and, in short, turn all things upside down. And yet, that which yon hear is but
the smallest portion of what is said; for among the common people are
disseminated certain horrible insinuations-insinuations which, if well founded,
would justify the whole world in condemning the doctrine with its authors to a
thousand fires and gibbets. Who can wonder that the popular hatred is inflamed
against it, when credit is given to those most iniquitous accusations? See, why
all ranks unite with one accord in condemning our persons and our
doctrine!<br></div>
<div>Carried away by this feeling, those who sit in judgment merely give
utterance to the prejudices which they have imbibed at home, and think they have
duly performed their part if they do not order punishment to be inflicted on any
one until convicted, either on his own confession, or on legal evidence. But of
what crime convicted? &#8220;Of that condemned doctrine,&#8221; is the answer.
But with what justice condemned? The very essence of the defence was, not to
abjure the doctrine itself, but to maintain its truth. On this subject, however,
not a whisper is allowed!<br></div>
<div>Justice, then, most invincible Sovereign, entitles me to demand that you
will undertake a thorough investigation of this cause, which has hitherto been
tossed about in any kind of way, and handled in the most irregular manner,
without any order of law, and with passionate heat rather than judicial
gravity.<br></div>
<div>Let it not be imagined that I am here framing my own private defence, with
the view of obtaining a safe return to my native land. Though I cherish towards
it the feelings which become me as a man, still, as matters now are, I can be
absent from it without regret. The cause which I plead is the common cause of
all the godly, and therefore the very cause of Christ-a cause which, throughout
your realm, now lies, as it were, in despair, torn and trampled upon in all
kinds of ways, and that more through the tyranny of certain Pharisees than any
sanction from yourself. But it matters not to inquire how the thing is done; the
fact that it is done cannot be denied. For so far have the wicked prevailed,
that the truth of Christ, if not utterly routed and dispersed, lurks as if it
were ignobly buried; while the poor Church, either wasted by cruel slaughter or
driven into exile, or intimidated and terror-struck, scarcely ventures to
breathe. Still her enemies press on with their wonted rage and fury over the
ruins which they have made, strenuously assaulting the wall, which is already
giving way. Meanwhile, no man comes forth to offer his protection against such
furies. Any who would be thought most favourable to the truth, merely talk of
pardoning the error and imprudence of ignorant men For so those modest
personages<sup><a name="fnB3" href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> speak; giving the name
of <i>error and imprudence</i> to that which they know to
be<sup><a name="fnB4" href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> the infallible truth of God, and
of <i>ignorant men</i> to those whose intellect they see that Christ has not
despised, seeing he has deigned to intrust them with the mysteries of his
heavenly wisdom.<sup><a name="fnB5" href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> Thus all are
ashamed of the Gospel.<br></div>
<div>Your duty, most serene Prince, is, not to shut either your ears or mind
against a cause involving such mighty interests as these: how the glory of God
is to be maintained on the earth inviolate, how the truth of God is to preserve
its dignity, how the kingdom of Christ is to continue amongst us compact and
secure. The cause is worthy of your ear, worthy of your investigation, worthy of
your throne.<br></div>
<div>The characteristic of a true sovereign is, to acknowledge that, in the
administration of his kingdom, he is a minister of God. He who does not make his
reign subservient to the divine glory, acts the part not of a king, but a
robber. He, moreover, deceives himself who anticipates long prosperity to any
kingdom which is not ruled by the sceptre of God, that is, by his divine word.
For the heavenly oracle is infallible which has declared, that &#8220;where
there is no vision the people perish&#8221; (Prov. 29:18).<br></div>
<div>Let not a contemptuous idea of our insignificance dissuade you from the
investigation of this cause. We, indeed, are perfectly conscious how poor and
abject we are: in the presence of God we are miserable sinners, and in the sight
of men most despised-we are (if you will) the mere dregs and off-scoutings of
the world, or worse, if worse can be named: so that before God there remains
nothing of which we can glory save only his mercy, by which, without any merit
of our own, we are admitted to the hope of eternal
salvation:<sup><a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> and before men not even
this much remains,<sup><a name="fnB7" href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup> since we can
glory only in our infirmity, a thing which, in the estimation of men, it is the
greatest ignominy even tacitly<sup><a name="fnB8" href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup> to
confess. But our doctrine must stand sublime above all the glory of the world,
and invincible by all its power, because it is not ours, but that of the living
God and his Anointed, whom the Father has appointed King, that he may rule from
sea to sea, and from the rivers even to the ends of the earth; and so rule as to
smite the whole earth and its strength of iron and brass, its splendour of gold
and silver, with the mere rod of his mouth, and break them in pieces like a
potter&#8217;s vessel; according to the magnificent predictions of the prophets
respecting his kingdom (Dan. 2:34; Isaiah 11:4; Psalm 2:9).<br></div>
<div>Our adversaries, indeed, clamorously maintain that our appeal to the word
of God is a mere pretext,-that we are, in fact, its worst corrupters. How far
this is not only malicious calumny, but also shameless effrontery, you will be
able to decide, of your own knowledge, by reading our Confession. Here, however,
it may be necessary to make some observations which may dispose, or at least
assist, you to read and study it with attention.<br></div>
<div>When Paul declared that all prophecy ought to be according to the analogy
of faith (Rom. 12:6), he laid down the surest rule for determining the meaning
of Scripture. Let our doctrine be tested by this rule and our victory is secure.
For what accords better and more aptly with faith than to acknowledge ourselves
divested of all virtue that we may be clothed by God, devoid of all goodness
that we may be filled by Him, the slaves of sin that he may give us freedom,
blind that he may enlighten, lame that he may cure, and feeble that he may
sustain us; to strip ourselves of all ground of glorying that he alone may shine
forth glorious, and we be glorified in him? When these things, and others to the
same effect, are said by us, they interpose, and querulously complain, that in
this way we overturn some blind light of nature, fancied preparatives, free
will, and works meritorious of eternal salvation, with their own supererogations
also;<sup><a name="fnB9" href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup> because they cannot bear that
the entire praise and glory of all goodness, virtue, justice, and wisdom, should
remain with God. But we read not of any having been blamed for drinking too much
of the fountain of living water; on the contrary, those are severely reprimanded
who &#8220;have hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no
water&#8221; (Jer. 2:13). Again, what more agreeable to faith than to feel
assured that God is a propitious Father when Christ is acknowledged as a brother
and propitiator, than confidently to expect all prosperity and gladness from
Him, whose ineffable love towards us was such that He &#8220;spared not his own
Son, but delivered him up for us all&#8221; (Rom. 8:32), than to rest in the
sure hope of salvation and eternal life whenever Christ, in whom such treasures
are hid, is conceived to have been given by the Father? Here they attack us, and
loudly maintain that this sure confidence is not free from arrogance and
presumption. But as nothing is to be presumed of ourselves, so all things are to
be presumed of God; nor are we stript of vain-glory for any other reason than
that we may learn to glory in the Lord. Why go farther? Take but a cursory view,
most valiant King, of all the parts of our cause, and count us of all wicked men
the most iniquitous, if you do not discover plainly, that &#8220;therefore we
both labour and suffer reproach because we trust in the living God&#8221; (1
Tim. 4:10); because we believe it to be &#8220;life eternal&#8221; to know
&#8220;the only true God, and Jesus Christ,&#8221; whom he has sent (John 17:3).
For this hope some of us are in bonds, some beaten with rods, some made a
gazing-stock, some proscribed, some most cruelly tortured, some obliged to flee;
we are all pressed with straits, loaded with dire execrations, lacerated by
slanders, and treated with the greatest indignity.<br></div>
<div>Look now to our adversaries (I mean the priesthood, at whose beck and
pleasure others ply their enmity against us), and consider with me for a little
by what zeal they are actuated. The true religion which is delivered in the
Scriptures, and which all ought to hold, they readily permit both themselves and
others to be ignorant of, to neglect and despise; and they deem it of little
moment what each man believes concerning God and Christ, or disbelieves,
provided he submits to the judgment of the Church with what they
call<sup>1<a name="fnB10" href="#fn10">[0]</a></sup> implicit faith; nor are
they greatly concerned though they should see the glow of God dishonoured by
open blasphemies, provided not a finger is raised against the primacy of the
Apostolic See and the authority of holy mother
Church.<sup>1<a name="fnB11" href="#fn11">[1]</a></sup> Why, then, do they war
for the mass, purgatory, pilgrimage, and similar follies, with such fierceness
and acerbity, that though they cannot prove one of them from the word of God,
they deny godliness can be safe without faith in these things-faith drawn out,
if I may so express it, to its utmost stretch? Why? just because their belly is
their God, and their kitchen their religion; and they believe, that if these
were away they would not only not be Christians, but not even men. For although
some wallow in luxury, and others feed on slender crusts, still they all live by
the same pot, which without that fuel might not only cool, but altogether
freeze. He, accordingly, who is most anxious about his stomach, proves the
fiercest champion of his faith. In short, the object on which all to a man are
bent, is to keep their kingdom safe or their belly filled; not one gives even
the smallest sign of sincere zeal.<br></div>
<div>Nevertheless, they cease not to assail our doctrine, and to accuse and
defame it in what terms they may, in order to render it either hated or
suspected. They call it new, and of recent birth; they carp at it as doubtful
and uncertain; they bid us tell by what miracles it has been confirmed; they ask
if it be fair to receive it against the consent of so many holy Fathers and the
most ancient custom; they urge us to confess either that it is schismatical in
giving battle to the Church, or that the Church must have been without life
during the many centuries in which nothing of the kind was heard. Lastly, they
say there is little need of argument, for its quality may be known by its
fruits, namely, the large number of sects, the many seditious disturbances, and
the great licentiousness which it has produced. No doubt, it is a very easy
matter for them, in presence of an ignorant and credulous multitude, to insult
over an undefended cause; but were an opportunity of mutual discussion afforded,
that acrimony which they now pour out upon us in frothy torrents, with as much
license as impunity,<sup>1<a name="fnB12" href="#fn12">[2]</a></sup> would
assuredly boil dry.<br></div>
<div>1. First, in calling it new, they are exceedingly injurious to God, whose
sacred word deserved not to be charged with novelty. To them, indeed, I very
little doubt it is new, as Christ is new, and the Gospel new; but those who are
acquainted with the old saying of Paul, that Christ Jesus &#8220;died for our
sins, and rose again for our justification&#8221; (Rom. 4:25), will not detect
any novelty in us. That it long lay buried and unknown is the guilty consequence
of man&#8217;s impiety; but now when, by the kindness of God, it is restored to
us, it ought to resume its antiquity just as the returning citizen resumes his
rights.<br></div>
<div>2. It is owing to the same ignorance that they hold it to be doubtful and
uncertain; for this is the very thing of which the Lord complains by his
prophet, &#8220;The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master&#8217;s crib;
but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider&#8221; (Isaiah 1:3). But
however they may sport with its uncertainty, had they to seal their own doctrine
with their blood, and at the expense of life, it would be seen what value they
put upon it. Very different is our confidence-a confidence which is not appalled
by the terrors of death, and therefore not even by the judgment-seat of
God.<br></div>
<div>3. In demanding miracles from us, they act dishonestly; for we have not
coined some new gospel, but retain the very one the truth of which is confirmed
by all the miracles which Christ and the apostles ever wrought. But they have a
peculiarity which we have not-they can confirm their faith by constant miracles
down to the present day! Way rather, they allege miracles which might produce
wavering in minds otherwise well disposed; they are so frivolous and ridiculous,
so vain and false. But were they even exceedingly wonderful, they could have no
effect against the truth of God, whose name ought to be hallowed always, and
everywhere, whether by miracles, or by the natural course of events. The
deception would perhaps be more specious if Scripture did not admonish us of the
legitimate end and use of miracles. Mark tells us (Mark 16:20) that the signs
which followed the preaching of the apostles were wrought in confirmation of it;
so Luke also relates that the Lord &#8220;gave testimony to the word of his
grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done&#8221; by the hands of the
apostles (Acts 14:3). Very much to the same effect are those words of the
apostle, that salvation by a preached gospel was confirmed, &#8220;The Lord
bearing witness with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles&#8221; (Heb.
2:4). Those things which we are told are seals of the gospel, shall we pervert
to the subversion of the gospel? What was destined only to confirm the truth,
shall we misapply to the confirmation of lies? The proper course, therefore, is,
in the first instance, to ascertain and examine the doctrine which is said by
the Evangelist to precede; then after it has been proved, but not till then, it
may receive confirmation from miracles. But the mark of sound doctrine given by
our Saviour himself is its tendency to promote the glory not of men, but of God
(John 7:18; 8:50). Our Saviour having declared this to be test of doctrine, we
are in error if we regard as miraculous, works which are used for any other
purpose than to magnify the name of
God.<sup>1<a name="fnB13" href="#fn13">[3]</a></sup> And it becomes us to
remember that Satan has his miracles, which, although they are tricks rather
than true wonders, are still such as to delude the ignorant and unwary.
Magicians and enchanters have always been famous for miracles, and miracles of
an astonishing description have given support to idolatry: these, however, do
not make us converts to the superstitions either of magicians or idolaters. In
old times, too, the Donatists used their power of working miracles as a
battering-ram, with which they shook the simplicity of the common people. We now
give to our opponents the answer which Augustine then gave to the Donatists (in
Joan. Tract. 23), &#8220;The Lord put us on our guard against those
wonder-workers, when he foretold that false prophets would arise, who, by lying
signs and divers wonders, would, if it were possible, deceive the very
elect&#8221; (Mt. 24:24). Paul, too, gave warning that the reign of antichrist
would be &#8220;withall power, and signs, and lying wonders&#8221; (2 Thess.
2:9).<br></div>
<div>But our opponents tell us that their miracles are wrought not by idols, not
by sorcerers, not by false prophets, but by saints: as if we did not know it to
be one of Satan&#8217;s wiles to transform himself &#8220;into an angel of
light&#8221; (2 Cor. 11:14). The Egyptians, in whose neighbourhood Jeremiah was
buried, anciently sacrificed and paid other divine honours to him (Hieron. in
Praef. Jerem). Did they not make an idolatrous abuse of the holy prophet of God?
and yet, in recompense for so venerating his tomb, they
thought<sup>1<a name="fnB14" href="#fn14">[4]</a></sup> that they were cured of
the bite of serpents. What, then, shall we say but that it has been, and always
will be, a most just punishment of God, to send on those who do not receive the
truth in the love of it, &#8220;strong delusion, that they should believe a
lie&#8221;? (2 Thess. 2:11). We, then, have no lack of miracles, sure miracles,
that cannot be gainsaid; but those to which our opponents lay claim are mere
delusions of Satan, inasmuch as they draw off the people from the true worship
of God to vanity.<br></div>
<div>4. It is a calumny to represent us as opposed to the Fathers (I mean the
ancient writers of a purer age), as if the Fathers were supporters of their
impiety. Were the contest to be decided by such authority (to speak in the most
moderate terms), the better part of the victory would be
ours.<sup>1<a name="fnB15" href="#fn15">[5]</a></sup> While there is much that
is admirable and wise in the writings of those Fathers, and while in some things
it has fared with them as with ordinary men; these pious sons, forsooth, with
the peculiar acuteness of intellect, and judgment, and soul, which belongs to
them, adore only their slips and errors, while those things which are well said
they either overlook, or disguise, or corrupt; so that it may be truly said
their only care has been to gather dross among gold. Then, with dishonest
clamour, they assail us as enemies and despisers of the Fathers. So far are we
from despising them, that if this were the proper place, it would give us no
trouble to support the greater part of the doctrines which we now hold by their
suffrages. Still, in studying their writings, we have endeavoured to remember (1
Cor. 3:21-23; see also Augustin. Ep. 28), that all things are ours, to serve,
not lord it over us, but that we axe Christ&#8217;s only, and must obey him in
all things without exception. He who does not draw this distinction will not
have any fixed principles in religion; for those holy men were ignorant of many
things, are often opposed to each other, and are sometimes at variance with
themselves.<br></div>
<div>It is not without cause (remark our opponents) we are thus warned by
Solomon, &#8220;Remove not the ancient landmarks which thy fathers have
set&#8221; (Prov. 22:28). But the same rule applies not to the measuring of
fields and the obedience of faith. The rule applicable to the latter is,
&#8220;Forget also thine own people, and thy father&#8217;s house&#8221; (Ps.
45:10). But if they are so fond of allegory, why do they not understand the
apostles, rather than any other class of Fathers, to be meant by those whose
landmarks it is unlawful to remove? This is the interpretation of Jerome, whose
words they have quoted in their canons. But as regards those to whom they apply
the passage, if they wish the landmarks to be fixed, why do they, whenever it
suits their purpose, so freely overleap them?<br></div>
<div>Among the Fathers there were two, the one of whom
said,<sup>1<a name="fnB16" href="#fn16">[6]</a></sup> &#8220;Our God neither
eats nor drinks, and therefore has no need of chalices and salvers;&#8221; and
the other,<sup>1<a name="fnB17" href="#fn17">[7]</a></sup> &#8220;Sacred rites
do not require gold, and things which are not bought with gold, please not by
gold.&#8221; They step beyond the boundary, therefore, when in sacred matters
they are so much delighted with gold, driver, ivory, marble, gems, and silks,
that unless everything is overlaid with costly show, or rather insane
luxury<sup>1<a name="fnB18" href="#fn18">[8]</a></sup>, they think God is not
duly worshipped.<br></div>
<div>It was a Father who said,<sup>1<a name="fnB19" href="#fn19">[9]</a></sup>
&#8220;He ate flesh freely on the day on which others abstained from it, because
he was a Christian.&#8221; They overleap the boundaries, therefore, when they
doom to perdition every soul that, during Lent, shall have tasted
flesh.<br></div>
<div>There were two Fathers, the one of whom
said,<sup>2<a name="fnB20" href="#fn20">[0]</a></sup> &#8220;A monk not
labouring with his own hands is no better than a violent man and a
robber;&#8221; and the other,<sup>2<a name="fnB21" href="#fn21">[1]</a></sup>
&#8220;Monks, however assiduous they may be in study, meditation, and prayer,
must not live by others.&#8221; This boundary, too, they transgressed, when they
placed lazy gormandising monks in dens and stews, to gorge themselves on other
men&#8217;s substance.<br></div>
<div>It was a Father who said,<sup>2<a name="fnB22" href="#fn22">[2]</a></sup>
&#8220;It is a horrid abomination to see in Christian temples a painted image
either of Christ or of any saint.&#8221; Nor was this pronounced by the voice
era single individual; but an Ecclesiastical Council also
decreed,<sup>2<a name="fnB23" href="#fn23">[3]</a></sup> &#8220;Let nought that
is worshipped be depicted on
walls.&#8221;<sup>2<a name="fnB24" href="#fn24">[4]</a></sup> Very far are they
from keeping within these boundaries when they leave not a corner without
images.<br></div>
<div>Another Father counselled,<sup>2<a name="fnB25" href="#fn25">[5]</a></sup>
&#8220;That after performing the office of humanity to the dead in their burial,
we should leave them at rest.&#8221; These limits they burst through when they
keep up a perpetual anxiety about the dead.<br></div>
<div>It is a Father who
testifies,<sup>2<a name="fnB26" href="#fn26">[6]</a></sup> &#8220;That the
substance of bread and wine in the Eucharist does not cease but remains, just as
the nature and substance of man remains united to the Godhead in the Lord Jesus
Christ.&#8221; This boundary they pass in pretending that, as soon as the words
of our Lord are pronounced, the substance of bread and wine ceases, and is
transubstantiated into body and blood.<br></div>
<div>They were Fathers, who, as they exhibited only one Eucharist to the whole
Church,<sup>2<a name="fnB27" href="#fn27">[7]</a></sup> and kept back from it
the profane and flagitious; so they, in the severest terms, censured all
those<sup>2<a name="fnB28" href="#fn28">[8]</a></sup> who, being present, did
not communicate How far have they removed these landmarks, in filling not
churches only, but also private houses, with their masses, admitting all and
sundry to be present, each the more willingly the more largely he pays, however
wicked and impure he may be,-not inviting any one to faith in Christ and
faithful communion in the sacraments, but rather vending their own work for the
grace and merits of
Christ!<sup>2<a name="fnB29" href="#fn29">[9]</a></sup><br></div>
<div>There were two Fathers, the one of whom decided that those were to be
excluded altogether from partaking of Christ&#8217;s sacred
supper,<sup>3<a name="fnB30" href="#fn30">[0]</a></sup> who, contented with
communion in one kind, abstained from the other; while the other Father strongly
contends<sup>3<a name="fnB31" href="#fn31">[1]</a></sup> that the blood of the
Lord ought not to be denied to the Christian people, who, in confessing him, are
enjoined to shed their own blood. These landmarks, also, they removed, when, by
an unalterable law, they ordered the very thing which the former Father punished
with excommunication, and the latter condemned for a valid reason.<br></div>
<div>It was a Father who pronounced it
rashness,<sup>3<a name="fnB32" href="#fn32">[2]</a></sup> in an obscure
question, to decide in either way without clear and evident authority from
Scripture. They forgot this landmark when they enacted so many constitutions, so
many canons, and so many dogmatical decisions, without sanction from the word of
God.<br></div>
<div>It was a Father who reproved Montanus, among other
heresies,<sup>3<a name="fnB33" href="#fn33">[3]</a></sup> for being the first
who imposed laws of fasting. They have gone far beyond this landmark also in
enjoining fasting under the strictest laws.<br></div>
<div>It was a Father who denie  that the ministers of the Church should be
interdicted from marrying, and pronounced married life to be a state of
chastity; and there were other Fathers who assented to his decision. These
boundaries they overstepped in rigidly binding their priests to
celibacy.<br></div>
<div>It was a Father who thought<sup>3<a name="fnB34" href="#fn34">[5]</a></sup>
that Christ only should be listened to, from its being said, &#8220;hear
him;&#8221; and that regard is due not to what others before us have said or
done, but only to what Christ, the head of all, has commanded. This landmark
they neither observe themselves nor allow to be observed by others, while they
subject themselves and others to any master whatever, rather than
Christ.<br></div>
<div>There is a Father who
contends<sup>3<a name="fnB35" href="#fn35">[6]</a></sup> that the Church ought
not to prefer herself to Christ, who always judges truly, whereas ecclesiastical
judges, who are but men, are generally deceived. Having burst through this
barrier also, they hesitate not to suspend the whole authority of Scripture on
the judgment of the
Church.<sup>3<a name="fnB36" href="#fn36">[7]</a></sup><br></div>
<div>All the Fathers with one heart execrated, and with one mouth protested
against, contaminating the word of God with the subtleties sophists, and
involving it in the brawls of dialecticians. Do they keep within these limits
when the sole occupation of their lives is to entwine and entangle the
simplicity of Scripture with endless disputes, and worse than sophistical
jargon? So much so, that were the Fathers to rise from their graves, and listen
to the brawling art which bears the name of speculative theology, there is
nothing they would suppose it less to be than a discussion of a religious
nature.<br></div>
<div>But my discourse would far exceed its just limits were I to show, in
detail, how petulantly those men shake off the yoke of the Fathers, while they
wish to be thought their most obedient sons. Months, nay, years would fail me;
and yet so deplorable and desperate is their effrontery, that they presume to
chastise us for overstepping the ancient landmarks!<br></div>
<div>5. Then, again, it is to no purpose they call us to the bar of custom. To
make everything yield to custom would be to do the greatest injustice. Were the
judgments of mankind correct, custom would be regulated by the good. But it is
often far otherwise in point of fact; for, whatever the many are seen to do,
forthwith obtains the force of custom. But human affairs have scarcely ever been
so happily constituted as that the better course pleased the greater number.
Hence the private vices of the multitude have generally resulted in public
error, or rather that common consent in vice which these worthy men would have
to be law. Any one with eyes may perceive that it is not one flood of evils
which has deluged us; that many fatal plagues have invaded the globe; that all
things rush headlong; so that either the affairs of men must be altogether
despaired of, or we must not only resist, but boldly attack prevailing evils.
The cure is prevented by no other cause than the length of time during which we
have been accustomed to the disease. But be it so that public error must have a
place in human society, still, in the kingdom of God, we must look and listen
only to his eternal truth, against which no series of years, no custom, no
conspiracy, can plead prescription. Thus Isaiah formerly taught the people of
God, &#8220;Say ye not, A confederacy, to all to whom this people shall say, A
confederacy;&#8221; i.e. do not unite with the people in an impious consent;
&#8220;neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. Sanctify the Lord of hosts
himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread&#8221; (Is. 8:12).
Now, therefore, let them, if they will, object to us both past ages and present
examples; if we sanctify the Lord of hosts, we shall not be greatly afraid.
Though many ages should have consented to like ungodliness, He is strong who
taketh vengeance to the third and fourth generation; or the whole world should
league together in the same iniquity. He taught experimentally what the end is
of those who sin with the multitude, when He destroyed the whole human race with
a flood, saving Noah with his little family, who, by putting his faith in Him
alone, &#8220;condemned the world&#8221; (Heb. 11:7). In short, depraved custom
is just a kind of general pestilence in which men perish not the less that they
fall in a crowd. It were well, moreover, to ponder the observation of
Cyprian,<sup>3<a name="fnB37" href="#fn37">[9]</a></sup> that those who sin in
ignorance, though they cannot be entirely exculpated, seem, however, to be, in
some sense, excusable; whereas those who obstinately reject the truth, when
presented to them by the kindness of God, have no defence to
offer.<sup>4<a name="fnB38" href="#fn38">[0]</a></sup><br></div>
<div>6. Their dilemma does not push us so violently as to oblige us to confess,
either that the Church was a considerable time without life, or that we have now
a quarrel with the Church. The Church of Christ assuredly has lived, and will
live, as long as Christ shall reign at the right hand of the Father. By his hand
it is sustained, by his protection defended, by his mighty power preserved in
safety. For what he once undertook he will undoubtedly perform, he will be with
iris people always, &#8220;even to the end of the world&#8221; (Mt. 28:20). With
the Church we wage no war, since, with one consent, in common with the whole
body of the faithful, we worship and adore one God, and Christ Jesus the Lord,
as all the pious have always adored him. But they themselves err not a little
from the truth in not recognising any church but that which they behold with the
bodily eye, and in endeavouring to circumscribe it by limits, within which it
cannot be confined.<br></div>
<div>The hinges on which the controversy turns are these: first, in their
contending that the form of the Church is always visible and apparent; and,
secondly, in their placing this form in the see of the Church of Rome and its
hierarchy. We, on the contrary, maintain, both that the Church may exist without
any apparent form, and, moreover, that the form is not ascertained by that
external splendour which they foolishly admire, but by a very different mark,
namely, by the pure preaching of the word of God, and the due administration of
the sacraments. They make an outcry whenever the Church cannot be pointed to
with the finger. But how oft was it the fate of the Church among the Jews to be
so defaced that no comeliness appeared? What do we suppose to have been the
splendid form when Elijah complained that he was left alone? (1 Kings 19:14).
How long after the advent of Christ did it lie hid without form? How often since
has it been so oppressed by wars, seditions, and heresies, that it was nowhere
seen in splendour? Had they lived at that time, would they have believed there
was any Church? But Elijah learned that there remained seven thousand men who
had not bowed the knee to Baal; nor ought we to doubt that Christ has always
reigned on earth ever since he ascended to heaven. Had the faithful at that time
required some discernible form, must they not have forthwith given way to
despondency? And, indeed, Hilary accounted it a very great fault in his day,
that men were so possessed with a foolish admiration of Episcopal dignity as not
to perceive the deadly hydra lurking under that mask. His words are (Cont.
Auxentium), &#8220;One advice I give: Beware of Antichrist; for, unhappily, a
love of walls has seized you; unhappily, the Church of God which you venerate
exists in houses and buildings; unhappily, under these you find the name of
peace. Is it doubtful that in these Antichrist will have his seat? Safer to me
are mountains, and woods, and lakes, and dungeons, and whirlpools; since in
these prophets, dwelling or immersed, did prophesy.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>And what is it at the present day that the world venerates in its horned
bishops, unless that it imagines those who are seen presiding over celebrated
cities to be holy prelates of religion? Away, then, with this absurd mode of
judging!<sup>4<a name="fnB39" href="#fn39">[1]</a></sup> Let us rather
reverently admit, that as God alone knows who are his, so he may sometimes
withdraw the external manifestation of his Church from the view of men. This, I
allow, is a fearful punishment which God sends on the earth; but if the
wickedness of men so deserves, why do we strive to oppose the just vengeance of
God?<sup>4<a name="fnB40" href="#fn40">[2]</a></sup> It was thus that God, in
past ages, punished the ingratitude of men; for after they had refused to obey
his truth, and had extinguished his light, he allowed them, when blinded by
sense, both to be deluded by lying vanities and plunged in thick darkness, so
that no face of a true Church appeared. Meanwhile, however, though his own
people were dispersed and concealed amidst errors and darkness, he saved them
from destruction. No wonder; for he knew how to preserve them even in the
confusion of Babylon and the flame of the fiery furnace.<br></div>
<div>But as to the wish that the form of the Church should be ascertained by
some kind of vain pomp, how perilous it is I will briefly indicate, rather than
explain, that I may not exceed all bounds. What they say is, that the
Pontiff,<sup>4<a name="fnB41" href="#fn41">[3]</a></sup> who holds the apostolic
see, and the priests who are anointed and consecrated by
him,<sup>4<a name="fnB42" href="#fn42">[4]</a></sup> provided they have the
insignia of fillets and mitres, represent the Church, and ought to be considered
as in the place of the Church, and therefore cannot err. Why so? because they
are pastors of the Church, and consecrated to the Lord. And were not Aaron and
other prefects of Israel pastors? But Aaron and his sons, though already set
apart to the priesthood, erred notwithstanding when they made the calf (Exod.
32:4). Why, according to this view, should not the four hundred prophets who
lied to Ahab represent the Church? (1 Kings 22:11, &amp;c.). The Church,
however, stood on the side of Micaiah. He was alone, indeed, and despised, but
from his mouth the truth proceeded. Did not the prophets also exhibit both the
name and face of the Church, when, with one accord, they rose up against
Jeremiah, and with menaces boasted of it as a thing impossible that the law
should perish from the priest, or counsel from the wise, or the word from the
prophet? (Jer. 18:18). In opposition to the whole body of the prophets, Jeremiah
is sent alone to declare from the Lord (Jer. 4:9), that a time would come when
the law would perish from the priest, counsel from the wise, and the word from
the prophet. Was not like splendour displayed in that council when the chief
priests, scribes, and Pharisees assembled to consult how they might put Jesus to
death? Let them go, then, and cling to the external mask, while they make Christ
and all the prophets of God schismatics, and, on the other hand, make
Satan&#8217;s ministers the organs of the Holy Spirit!<br></div>
<div>But if they are sincere, let them answer me in good faith,-in what place,
and among whom, do they think the Church resided, after the Council of Basle
degraded and deposed Eugenius from the popedom, and substituted Amadeus in his
place? Do their utmost, they cannot deny that that Council was legitimate as far
as regards external forms, and was summoned not only by one Pontiff, but by two.
Eugenius, with the whole herd of cardinals and bishops who had joined him in
plotting the dissolution of the Council, was there condemned of contumacy,
rebellion, and schism. Afterwards, however, aided by the favour of princes, he
got back his popedom safe. The election of Amadeus, duly made by the authority
of a general holy synod, went to smoke; only he himself was appeased with a
cardinal&#8217;s cap, like a piece of offal thrown to a barking dog. Out of the
lap of these rebellious and contumacious schismatics proceeded all future popes,
cardinals, bishops, abbots, and presbyters. Here they are caught, and cannot
escape. For, on which party will they bestow the name of Church? Will they deny
it to have been a general Council, though it lacked nothing as regards external
majesty, having been solemnly called by two bulls, consecrated by the legate of
the Roman See as its president, constituted regularly in all respects, and
continuing in possession of all its honours to the last? Will they admit that
Eugenius, and his whole train, through whom they have all been consecrated, were
schismatical? Let them, then, either define the form of the Church differently,
or, however numerous they are, we will hold them all to be schismatics in having
knowingly and willingly received ordination from heretics. But had it never been
discovered before that the Church is not tied to external pomp, we are furnished
with a lengthened proof in their own conduct, in proudly vending themselves to
the world under the specious title of Church, notwithstanding that they are the
deadly pests of the Church. I speak not of their manners and of those tragical
atrocities with which their whole life teems, since it is said that they are
Pharisees who should be heard, not imitated. By devoting some portion of your
leisure to our writings, you will see, not obscurely, that their doctrine-the
very doctrine to which they say it is owing that they are the Church-is a deadly
murderer of souls, the firebrand, ruin, and destruction of the Church.<br></div>
<div>7. Lastly, they are far from candid when they invidiously number up the
disturbances, tumults, and disputes, which the preaching of our doctrine has
brought in its train, and the fruits which, in many instances, it now produces;
for the doctrine itself is undeservedly charged with evils which ought to be
ascribed to the malice of Satan. It is one of the characteristics of the divine
word, that whenever it appears, Satan ceases to slumber and sleep. This is the
surest and most unerring test for distinguishing it from false doctrines which
readily betray themselves, while they are received by all with willing ears, and
welcomed by an applauding world. Accordingly, for several ages, during which all
things were immersed in profound darkness, almost all mankin  were mere jest and
sport to the god of this world, who, like any Sardanapalus, idled and luxuriated
undisturbed. For what else could he do but laugh and sport while in tranquil and
undisputed possession of his kingdom? But when light beaming from above somewhat
dissipated the darkness-when the strong man arose and aimed a blow at his
kingdom-then, indeed, he began to shake off his wonted torpor, and rush to arms.
And first he stirred up the hands of men, that by them he might violently
suppress the dawning truth; but when this availed him not, he turned to snares,
exciting dissensions and disputes about doctrine by means of his Catabaptists,
and other portentous miscreants, that he might thus obscure, and, at length,
extinguish the truth. And now be persists in assailing it with both engines,
endeavouring to pluck up the true seed by the violent hand of man, and striving,
as much as in him lies, to choke it with his tares, that it may not grow and
bear knit. But it will be in vain, if we listen to the admonition of the Lord,
who long ago disclosed his wiles, that we might not be taken unawares, and armed
us with full protection against all his machinations. But how malignant to throw
upon the word of God itself the blame either of the seditions which wicked men
and rebels, or of the sects which impostors stir up against it! The example,
however, is not new. Elijah was interrogated whether it were not he that
troubled Israel. Christ was seditious, according to the Jews; and the apostles
were charged with the crime of popular commotion. What else do those who, in the
present day, impute to us all the disturbances, tumults, and contentions which
break out against us? Elijah, however, has taught us our answer (1 Kings 18:17,
18). It is not we who disseminate errors or stir up tumults, but they who resist
the mighty power of God.<br></div>
<div>But while this single answer is sufficient to rebut the rash charges of
these men, it is necessary, on the other hand, to consult for the weakness of
those who take the alarm at such scandals, and not unfrequently waver in
perplexity. But that they may not fall away in this perplexity, and forfeit
their good degree, let them know that the apostles in their day experienced the
very things which now befall us. There were then unlearned and unstable men who,
as Peter tells us (2 Pet. 3:16), wrested the inspired writings of Paul to their
own destruction. There were despisers of God, who, when they heard that sin
abounded in order that grace might more abound, immediately inferred, &#8220;We
will continue in sin that grace may abound&#8221; (Rom. 6:1); when they heard
that believers were not under the law, but under grace, forthwith sung out,
&#8220;We will sin because we are not under the law, but under grace&#8221;
(Rom. 6:15). There were some who charged the apostle with being the minister of
sin. Many false prophets entered in privily to pull down the churches which he
had reared. Some preached the gospel through envy and strife, not sincerely
(Phil. 1:15)-maliciously even-thinking to add affliction to his bonds. Elsewhere
the gospel made little progress. All sought their own, not the things which were
Jesus Christ&#8217;s. Others went back like the dog to his vomit, or the sow
that was washed to her wallowing in the mire. Great numbers perverted their
spiritual freedom to carnal licentiousness. False brethren crept in to the
imminent danger of the faithful. Among the brethren themselves various quarrels
arose. What, then, were the apostles to do? Were they either to dissemble for
the time, or rather lay aside and abandon that gospel which they saw to be the
seed-bed of so many strifes, the source of so many perils, the occasion of so
many scandals? In straits of this kind, they remembered that &#8220;Christ was a
stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence,&#8221; &#8220;set up for the fall and
rising again of many,&#8221; and &#8220;for a sign to be spoken against&#8221;
(Luke 2:34); and, armed with this assurance, they proceeded boldly through all
perils from tumults and scandals. It becomes us to be supported by the same
consideration, since Paul declares that it is a neverfailing characteristic of
the gospel to be a &#8220;savour of death unto death in them that perish&#8221;
(2 Cor. 2:16), although rather destined to us for the purpose of being a savour
of life unto life, and the power of God for the salvation of believers. This we
should certainly experience it to be, did we not by our ingratitude corrupt this
unspeakable gift of God, and turn to our destruction what ought to be our only
saving defence.<sup>4<a name="fnB43" href="#fn43">[6]</a></sup><br></div>
<div>But to return, Sire.<sup>4<a name="fnB44" href="#fn44">[7]</a></sup> Be not
moved by the absurd insinuations with which our adversaries are striving to
frighten you into the belief that nothing else is wished and aimed at by this
new gospel (for so they term it), than opportunity for sedition and impunity for
all kinds of vice. Our Go  is not the author of division, but of peace; and the
Son of God, who came to destroy the works of the devil, is not the minister of
sin. We, too, are undeservedly charged with desires of a kind for which we have
never given even the smallest suspicion. We, forsooth, meditate the subversion
of kingdoms; we, whose voice was never heard in faction, and whose life, while
passed under you, is known to have been always quiet and simple; even now, when
exiled from our home, we nevertheless cease not to pray for all prosperity to
your person and your kingdom. We, forsooth, are aiming after an unchecked
indulgence in vice, in whose manners, though there is much to be blamed, there
is nothing which deserves such an imputation; nor (thank God) have we profited
so little in the gospel that our life may not be to these slanderers an example
of chastity, kindness, pity, temperance, patience, moderation, or any other
virtue. It is plain, indeed, that we fear God sincerely, and worship him in
truth, since, whether by life or by death, we desire his name to be hallowed;
and hatred herself has been forced to bear testimony to the innocence and civil
integrity of some of our people on whom death was inflicted for the very thing
which deserved the highest praise. But if any, under pretext of the gospel,
excite tumults (none such have as yet been detected in your realm), if any use
the liberty of the grace of God as a cloak for licentiousness (I know of numbers
who do), there are laws and legal punishments by which they may be punished up
to the measure of their deserts-only, in the mean time, let not the gospel of
God be evil spoken of because of the iniquities of evil men.<br></div>
<div>Sire,<sup>4<a name="fnB45" href="#fn45">[9]</a></sup> That you may not lend
too credulous an ear to the accusations of our enemies, their virulent injustice
has been set before you at sufficient length; I fear even more than sufficient,
since this preface has grown almost to the bulk of a full apology. My object,
however, was not to frame a defence, but only with a view to the hearing of our
cause, to mollify your mind, now indeed turned away and estranged from us-I add,
even inflamed against us-but whose good will, we are confident, we should
regain, would you but once, with calmness and composure, read this our
Confession, which we desire your Majesty to accept instead of a defence. But if
the whispers of the malevolent so possess your ear, that the accused are to have
no opportunity of pleading their cause; if those vindictive furies, with your
connivance, are always to rage with bonds, scourgings, tortures, maimings, and
burnings, we, indeed, like sheep doomed to slaughter, shall be reduced to every
extremity; yet so that, in our patience, we will possess our souls, and wait for
the strong hand of the Lord, which, doubtless, will appear in its own time, and
show itself armed, both to rescue the poor from affliction, and also take
vengeance on the despisers, who are now exulting so
securely.<sup>5<a name="fnB46" href="#fn46">[0]</a></sup><br></div>

<div>BASLE, 1st August 1536.<br></div>
<div><font size="7">THE EPISTLE TO THE READER</font><br></div>
<div>[PREFIXED TO THE SECOND EDITION, PUBLISHED AT STRASBURG IN 1539.]<br></div>
<div>_________<br></div>
<div>In the First Edition of this work, having no expectation of the success
which God has, in his goodness, been pleased to give it, I had, for the greater
part, performed my office perfunctorily, as is usual in trivial undertakings.
But when I perceived that almost all the godly had received it with a favour
which I had never dared to wish, far less to hope for, being sincerely conscious
that I had received much more than I deserved, I thought I should be very
ungrateful if I did not endeavour, at least according to my humble ability, to
respond to the great kindness which had been expressed towards me, and which
spontaneously urged me to diligence. I therefore ask no other favour from the
studious for my new work than that which they have already bestowed upon me
beyond my merits. I feel so much obliged, that I shall be satisfied if I am
thought not to have made a bad return for the gratitude I owe. This return I
would have made much earlier, had not the Lord, for almost two whole years,
exercised me in an extraordinary manner. But it is soon enough if well enough. I
shall think it has appeared in good season when I perceive that it produces some
fruit to the Church of God. I may add, that my object in this work was to
prepare and train students of theology for the study of the Sacred Volume, so
that they might both have an easy introduction to it, and be able to proceed in
it, with unfaltering step, seeing I have endeavoured to give such a summary of
religion in all its parts, and have digested it into such an order as may make
it not difficult for any one, who is rightly acquainted with it, to ascertain
both what he ought principally to look for in Scripture, and also to what head
he ought to refer whatever is contained in it. Having thus, as it were, paved
the way, I shall not feel it necessary, in any Commentaries on Scripture which I
may afterwards publish, to enter into long discussions of doctrines or dilate on
common places, and will, therefore, always compress them. In this way the pious
reader will be saved much trouble and weariness, provided he comes furnished
with a knowledge of the present work as an essential prerequisite. As my
Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans will give a specimen of this plan, I
would much rather let it speak for itself than declare it in words. Farewell,
dear reader, and if you derive any fruit from my labours, give me the benefit of
your prayers to the Lord.<br></div>
<div>STRASBOURG, 1<i>st August</i> 1539.<br></div>
<div><font size="7">SUBJECT OF THE PRESENT WORK</font><br></div>
<div>[PREFIXED TO THE FRENCH EDITION, PUBLISHED AT GENEVA IN 1545.]<br></div>
<div>_________<br></div>
<div>In order that my Readers may be the better able to profit by the present
work, I am desirous briefly to point out the advantage which they may derive
from it. For by so doing I will show them the end at which they ought to aim,
and to which they ought to give their attention in reading it.<br></div>
<div>Although the Holy Scriptures contain a perfect doctrine, to which nothing
can be added-our Lord having been pleased therein to unfold the infinite
treasures of his wisdom-still every person, not intimately acquainted with them,
stands in need of some guidance and direction, as to what he ought to look for
in them, that he may not wander up and down, but pursue a certain path, and so
attain the end to which the Holy Spirit invites him.<br></div>
<div>Hence it is the duty of those who have received from God more light than
others to assist the simple in this matter, and, as it were, lend them their
hand to guide and assist them in finding the sum of what God has been pleased to
teach us in his word. Now, this cannot be better done in writing than by
treating in succession of the principal matters which are comprised in Christian
philosophy. For he who understands these will be prepared to make more progress
in the school of God in one day than any other person in three months, inasmuch
as he, in a great measure, knows to what he should refer each sentence, and has
a rule by which to test whatever is presented to him.<br></div>
<div>Seeing, then, how necessary it was in this manner to aid those who desire
to be instructed in the doctrine of salvation, I have endeavoured, according to
the ability which God has given me, to employ myself in so doing, and with this
view have composed the present book. And first I wrote it in Latin, that it
might be serviceable to all studious persons, of what nation soever they might
be; afterwards, desiring to communicate any fruit which might be in it to my
French countrymen, I translated it into our own tongue. I dare not bear too
strong a testimony in its favour, and declare how profitable the reading of it
will be, lest I should seem to prize my own work too highly. However I may
promise this much, that it will be a kind of key opening up to all the children
of God a right and ready access to the understanding of the sacred volume.
Wherefore, should our Lord give me henceforth means and opportunity of composing
some Commentaries, I will use the greatest possible brevity, as there will be no
occasion to make long digressions, seeing that I have in a manner deduced at
length all the articles which pertain to Christianity.<br></div>
<div>And since we are bound to acknowledge that all truth and sound doctrine
proceed from God, I will venture boldly to declare what I think of this work,
acknowledging it to be God&#8217;s work rather than mine. To him, indeed, the
praise due to it must be ascribed. My opinion of the work then is this: I exhort
all, who reverence the word of the Lord, to read it, and diligently imprint it
on their memory, if they would, in the first place, have a summary of Christian
doctrine, and, in the second place, an introduction to the profitable reading
both of the Old and New Testament. When they shall have done so, they will know
by experience that I have not wished to impose upon them with words. Should any
one be unable to comprehend all that is contained in it, he must not, however,
give it up in despair; but continue always to read on, hoping that one passage
will give him a more familiar exposition of another. Above all things, I would
recommend that recourse be had to Scripture in considering the proofs which I
adduce from it.<br></div>
<div><font size="7">EPISTLE TO THE READER.</font><br></div>
<div>[PREFIXED TO THE LAST EDITION, REVISED BY THE AUTHOR.]<br></div>
<div>_________<br></div>
<div>In the First Edition of this work, having not the least expectation of the
success which God, in his boundless goodness, has been pleased to give it, I
had, for the greater part, performed my task in a perfunctory manner (as is
usual in trivial undertakings); but when I understood that it had been received,
by almost all the pious with a favour which I had never dared to ask, far less
to hope for, the more I was sincerely conscious that the reception was beyond my
deserts, the greater I thought my ingratitude would be, if, to the very kind
wishes which had been expressed towards me, and which seemed of their own accord
to invite me to diligence, I did not endeavour to respond, at least according to
my humble ability. This I attempted not only in the Second Edition, but in every
subsequent one the work has received some improvement. But though I do not
regret the labour previously expended, I never felt satisfied until the work was
arranged in the order in which it now appears. Now I trust it will approve
itself to the Judgment of all my readers. As a clear proof of the diligence with
which I have laboured to perform this service to the Church of God, I may be
permitted to mention, that last winter, when I thought I was dying of quartan
ague, the more the disorder increased, the less I spared myself, in order that I
might leave this book behind me, and thus make some return to the pious for
their kind urgency. I could have wished to give it sooner, but it is soon enough
if good enough. I shall think it has appeared in good time when I see it more
productive of benefit than formerly to the Church of God. This is my only
wish.<br></div>
<div>And truly it would fare ill with me if, not contented with the approbation
of God alone, I were unable to despise the foolish and perverse censures of
ignorant as well as the malicious and unjust censures of ungodly men. For
although, by the blessing of God, my most ardent desire has been to advance his
kingdoms and promote the public good,-although I feel perfectly conscious, and
take God and his angels to witness, that ever since I began to discharge the
office of teacher in the Church, my only object has been to do good to the
Church, by maintaining the pure doctrine of godliness, yet I believe there never
was a man more assailed, stung, and torn by calumny [as well by the declared
enemies of the truth of God, as by many worthless persons who have crept into
his Church-as well by monks who have brought forth their frocks from their
cloisters to spread infection wherever they come, as by other miscreants not
better than they<sup>5<a name="fnB47" href="#fn47">[1]</a></sup>]. After this
letter to the reader was in the press, I had undoubted information that, at
Augsburg, where the Imperial Diet was held, a rumour of my defection to the
papacy was circulated, and entertained in the courts of the princes more readily
than might have been expected.<sup>5<a name="fnB48" href="#fn48">[2]</a></sup>
This, forsooth, is the return made me by those who certainly are not unaware of
numerous proofs of my constancy-proofs which, while they rebut the foul charge,
ought to have defended me against it, with all humane and impartial judges. But
the devil, with all his crew, is mistaken if he imagines that, by assailing me
with vile falsehoods, he can either cool my zeal, or diminish my exertions. I
trust that God, in his infinite goodness, will enable me to persevere with
unruffled patience in the course of his holy vocation. Of this I give the pious
reader a new proof in the present edition.<br></div>
<div>I may further observe, that my object in this work has been, so to prepare
and train candidates for the sacred office, for the study of the sacred volume,
that they may both have an easy introduction to it, and be able to prosecute it
with unfaltering step; for, if I mistake not, I have given a summary of religion
in all its parts, and digested it in an order which will make it easy for any
one, who rightly comprehends it, to ascertain both what he ought chiefly to look
for in Scripture, and also to what head he ought to refer whatever is contained
in it. Having thus, as it were, paved the way, as it will be unnecessary, in any
Commentaries on Scripture which I may afterwards publish, to enter into long
discussions of doctrinal points, and enlarge on commonplaces, I will compress
them into narrow compass. In this way much trouble and fatigue will be spared to
the pious reader, provided he comes prepared with a knowledge of the present
work as an indispensable prerequisite. The system here followed being set forth
as in a mirror in all my Commentaries, I think it better to let it speak for
itself than to give any verbal explanation of it.<br></div>

with your prayers to our heavenly Father.<br></div>

<a name="Heading177"></a><font face="Arial" size="7"><b><i>METHOD AND
ARRANGEMENT,</i></b></font><font face="Arial"><b><i>OR SUBJECT OF THE WHOLE
WORK.</i></b></font></h2>
<div>[FROM AN EPITOME OF THE INSTITUTIONS, BY GASPAR OLEVIAN.]<br></div>
<div>_________<br></div>
<div>The subject handled by the author of these Christian Institutes is twofold:
the former, the knowledge of God, which leads to a blessed immortality; and the
latter (which is subordinate to the former), the knowledge of ourselves. With
this view the author simply adopts the arrangement of the Apostles&#8217; Creed,
as that with which all Christians are most familiar. For as the Creed consists
of four parts, the first relating to God the Father, the second to the Son, the
third to the Holy Spirit, and the fourth to the Church, so the author, in
fulfilment of his task, divides his Institutes into four parts, corresponding to
those of the Creed. Each of these parts it will now be proper to explain
separately.<br></div>
<div>I. The first article of the Apostles&#8217; Creed is concerning <i>God the
Father</i>, the creation, preservation, and government of the universe, as
implied in his omnipotence. Accordingly, the First Book of the Institutes treats
of the knowledge of God, considered as the Creator, Preserver, and Governor of
the world, and of every thing contained in it. It shows both wherein the true
knowledge of the Creator consists, and what the end of this knowledge is, chap.
1 and 2; that it is not learned at school, but that every one is self-taught it
from the womb, chap. 3. Such, however, is man&#8217;s depravity, that he stifles
and corrupts this knowledge, partly by ignorance, partly by wicked design; and
hence does not by means of it either glorify God as he ought, or attain to
happiness, chap. 4. This inward knowledge is aided from without, namely by the
creatures in which, as in a mirror, the perfections of God may be contemplated.
But man does not properly avail himself of this assistance, and hence to those
to whom God is pleased to make himself more intimately known for salvation, he
communicates his written word. This leads to a consideration of the Holy
Scriptures, in which God has revealed that not the Father only, but along with
the Father, the Son, and Holy Spirit, is that Creator of heaven and earth, whom,
in consequence of our innate depravity we were unable, either from innate
natural knowledge, or the beautiful mirror of the world, to know so as to
glorify. Here the author treats of the manifestation of God in Scripture; and in
connection with it, of the one divine essence in three persons. But, lest man
should lay the blame of his voluntary blindness on God, the author shows in what
state man was created at first, introducing dissertations on the image of God,
free will, and original righteousness. The subject of Creation being thus
disposed of, the preservation and government of the world is considered in the
three last chapters, which contain a very full discussion of the doctrine of
Divine Providence.<br></div>
<div>II. As man, by sinning, forfeited the privileges conferred on him at his
creation, recourse must be had to Christ. Accordingly, the next article in the
Creed is, <i>And in Jesus Christ his only Son, &amp;c.</i> In like manner, the
Second Book of the Institutes treats of the knowledge of God considered as a
Redeemer in Christ, And showing man his falls conducts him to Christ the
Mediator. Here the subject of original sin is considered, and it is shown that
man has no means within himself, by which he can escape from guilt, and the
impending curse: that, on the contrary, until he is reconciled and renewed,
every thing that proceeds from him is of the nature of sin. This subject is
considered as far as the 6th chapter. Man being thus utterly undone in himself,
and incapable of working out his own cure by thinking a good thought, or doing
what is acceptable to God, must seek redemption without himself-viz. in Christ.
The end for which the Law was given, was not to secure worshipers for itself,
but to conduct them unto Christ. This leads to an exposition of the Moral Law.
Christ was known to the Jews under the Law as the author of salvation, but is
more fully revealed under the Gospel in which he was manifested to the world.
Hence arises the doctrine concerning the similarity and difference of the two
Testaments, the Old and the New, the Law and the Gospel. These topics occupy as
far as the 12th chapter. It is next shown that, in order to secure a complete
salvation, it was necessary that the eternal Son of God should become man, and
assume a true human nature. It is also shown in what way these two natures
constitute one person. In order to purchase a full salvation by his own merits,
and effectually apply it, Christ was appointed to the offices of Prophet,
Priest, and King. The mode in which Christ performs these offices is considered,
and also whether in point of fact he did accomplish the work of redemption. Here
an exposition is given of the articles relating to Christ&#8217;s death,
resurrection, and ascension into heaven. In conclusion, it is proved that Christ
is rightly and properly said to have merited divine grace and salvation for
us.<br></div>
<div>III. So long as Christ is separated from us we have no benefit from him. We
must be ingrafted in him like branches in the vine. Hence the Creed, after
treating of Christ, proceeds in its third article, <i>I believe in the Holy
Spirit</i>,-the Holy Spirit being the bond of union between us and Christ. In
like manner, the Third Book of the Institutes treats of the Holy Spirit which
unites us to Christ, and, in connection with it, of faith, by which we embrace
Christ with a double benefit-viz. that of gratuitous righteousness which he
imputes to us, and regeneration, which he begins in us by giving us repentance.
In order to show the worthlessness of a faith which is not accompanied with a
desire of repentance, the author, before proceeding to a full discussion of
justification, treats at length from chapter 3-10 of repentance, and the
constant study of it-repentance, which Christ, when apprehended by faith, begets
in us by his Spirit. Chapter 11 treats of the primary and peculiar benefit of
Christ when united to us by the Holy Spirit-viz. justification. This subject is
continued to the 20th chapter, which treats of prayer, the hand, as it were, to
receive the blessings which faith knows to be treasured up for it with God,
according to the word of promise. But, as the Holy Spirit, who creates and
preserves our faith, does not unite all men to Christ, who is the sole author of
salvation, chapter 21 treats of the eternal election of God, to which it is
owing that we, in whom he foresaw no good which he had not previously bestowed,
are given to Christ, and united to him by the effectual calling of the Gospel.
This subject is continued to the 25th chapter, which treats of complete
regeneration and felicity, namely, the final resurrection to which we must raise
our eyes, seeing that, in regard to fruition, the happiness of the godly is only
begun in this world.<br></div>
<div>IV. Since the Holy Spirit does not ingraft all men into Christ, or endue
them with faith, and those whom he does so endue he does not ordinarily endue
without means, but uses for that purpose the preaching of the Gospel and the
dispensation of the Sacraments, together with the administration of all kinds of
discipline, the Creed contains the following article, <i>I believe in the Holy
Catholic Church</i>, namely, that Church which, when lying in eternal death, the
Father, by gratuitous election, freely reconciled to himself in Christ, and
endued with the Holy Spirit, that, being ingrafted into Christ, it might have
communion with him as its proper head; whence flow perpetual remission of sins,
and full restoration to eternal life. Accordingly the Church is treated of in
the first fourteen chapters of the Fourth Book, which thereafter treats of the
means which the Holy Spirit employs in calling us effectually from spiritual
death, and preserving the Church, in other words, Baptism and the Lord&#8217;s
Supper. These means are, as it were, the royal sceptre of Christ, by which,
through the efficacy of his Spirit, he commences his spiritual reign in the
Church, advances it from day to day, and after this life, without the use of
means, finally perfects it. This subject is continued to the 20th
chapter.<br></div>
<div>And because civil governments are, in this life, the hospitable
entertainers (<i>hospitia</i>) of the Church (though civil government is
distinct from the spiritual kingdom of Christ), the author shows how great
blessings they are, blessings which the Church is bound gratefully to
acknowledge, until we are called away from this tabernacle to the heavenly
inheritance, where God will be all in all.<br></div>
<div>Such is the arrangement of the Institutes which may be thus summed up: Man
being at first created upright, but afterwards being not partially but totally
ruined, finds his entire salvation out of himself in Christ, to whom being
united by the Holy Spirit freely given without any foresight of future works, he
thereby obtains a double blessing-viz. full imputation of righteousness, which
goes along with us even to the grave, and the commencement of sanctification,
which daily advances till at length it is perfected in the day of regeneration
or resurrection of the body, and this, in order that the great mercy of God may
be celebrated in the heavenly mansions, throughout eternity.<br></div>

<div><font size="7">BOOK FIRST.</font> OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD THE
CREATOR<br></div>
<div><font size="5">ARGUMENT.</font><br></div>
<div>The First Book treats of the knowledge of God the Creator. But as it is in
the creation of man that the divine perfections are best displayed, so man also
is made the subject of discourse. Thus the whole book divides itself into two
principal heads-the former relating to the knowledge of God, and the latter to
the knowledge of man. In the first chapter, these are considered jointly; and in
each of the following chapters, separately: occasionally, however, intermingled
with other matters which refer to one or other of the heads; <i>e.g.</i>, the
discussions concerning Scripture and images, falling under the former head, and
the other three concerning the creation of the world, the holy angels and
devils, falling under the latter. The last point discussed-viz. the method of
the divine government, relates to both.<br></div>
<div>With regard to the former head-viz. the knowledge of God, it is shown, in
the first place, what the kind of knowledge is which God requires, Chap. 2. And,
in the second place (Chap. 3-9), where this knowledge must be sought, namely,
not in man; because, although naturally implanted in the human mind, it is
stifled, partly by ignorance, partly by evil intent, Chap. 3 and 4; not in the
frame of the world: because, although it shines most clearly there, we are so
stupid that these manifestations, however perspicuous, pass away without any
beneficial result, Chap. 5; but in Scripture (Chap. 6), which is treated of,
Chap. 7-9. In the third place, it is shown what the character of God is, Chap.
10. In the fourth place, how impious it is to give a visible form to God (here
images, the worship of them, and its origin, are considered), Chap. 11. In the
fifth place, it is shown that God is to be solely and wholly worshipped, Chap.
12. Lastly, Chap. 13 treats of the unity of the divine essence, and the
distinction of three persons.<br></div>
<div>With regard to the latter head-viz. the knowledge of man, first, Chap. 14
treats of the creation of the world, and of good and bad angels (these all
having reference to man). And then Chap. 15, taking up the subject of man
himself, examines his nature and his powers.<br></div>
<div>The better to illustrate the nature both of God and man, the three
remaining Chapters-viz. 16-18, proceed to treat of the general government of the
world, and particularly of human actions, in opposition to fortune and fate,
explaining both the doctrine and its use. In conclusion, it is shown, that
though God employs the instrumentality of the wicked, he is pure from sin and
from taint of every kind.<br></div>

<div><font size="5">THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD AND OF OURSELVES MUTUALLY CONNECTED.
-NATURE OF THE CONNECTION.</font><br></div>
<div><i>Sections.</i><br></div>
<div>1.	 The sum of true wisdom-viz. the knowledge of God and of ourselves.
Effects of the latter.<br></div>
<div>2.	 Effects of the knowledge of God, in humbling our pride, unveiling our
hypocrisy, demonstrating the absolute perfections of God, and our own utter
helplessness.<br></div>
<div>3.	 Effects of the knowledge of God illustrated by the examples, 1. of holy
patriarchs; 2. of holy angels; 3. of the sun and moon.<br></div>
<div>1. OUR wisdom, in so far as it ought to be deemed true and solid Wisdom,
consists almost entirely of two parts: the knowledge of God and of ourselves.
But as these are connected together by many ties, it is not easy to determine
which of the two precedes and gives birth to the other. For, in the first place,
no man can survey himself without forthwith turning his thoughts towards the God
in whom he lives and moves; because it is perfectly obvious, that the endowments
which we possess cannot possibly be from ourselves; nay, that our very being is
nothing else than subsistence in God alone. In the second place, those blessings
which unceasingly distil to us from heaven, are like streams conducting us to
the fountain. Here, again, the infinitude of good which resides in God becomes
more apparent from our poverty. In particular, the miserable ruin into which the
revolt of the first man has plunged us, compels us to turn our eyes upwards; not
only that while hungry and famishing we may thence ask what we want, but being
aroused by fear may learn humility. For as there exists in man something like a
world of misery, and ever since we were stript of the divine attire our naked
shame discloses an immense series of disgraceful properties every man, being
stung by the consciousness of his own unhappiness, in this way necessarily
obtains at least some knowledge of God. Thus, our feeling of ignorance, vanity,
want, weakness, in short, depravity and corruption, reminds us (see Calvin on
John 4:10), that in the Lord, and none but He, dwell the true light of wisdom,
solid virtue, exuberant goodness. We are accordingly urged by our own evil
things to consider the good things of God; and, indeed, we cannot aspire to Him
in earnest until we have begun to be displeased with ourselves. For what man is
not disposed to rest in himself? Who, in fact, does not thus rest, so long as he
is unknown to himself; that is, so long as he is contented with his own
endowments, and unconscious or unmindful of his misery? Every person, therefore,
on coming to the knowledge of himself, is not only urged to seek God, but is
also led as by the hand to find him.<sup> </sup><br></div>
<div>2. On the other hand, it is evident that man never attains to a true
self-knowledge until he have previously contemplated the face of God, and come
down after such contemplation to look into himself. For (such is our innate
pride) we always seem to ourselves just, and upright, and wise, and holy, until
we are convinced, by clear evidence, of our injustice, vileness, folly, and
impurity. Convinced, however, we are not, if we look to ourselves only, and not
to the Lord also<sup> </sup>-He being the only standard by the application of
which this conviction can be produced. For, since we are all naturally prone to
hypocrisy, any empty semblance of righteousness is quite enough to satisfy us
instead of righteousness itself. And since nothing appears within us or around
us that is not tainted with very great impurity, so long as we keep our mind
within the confines of human pollution, anything which is in some small degree
less defiled delights us as if it were most pure just as an eye, to which
nothing but black had been previously presented, deems an object of a whitish,
or even of a brownish hue, to be perfectly white. Nay, the bodily sense may
furnish a still stronger illustration of the extent to which we are deluded in
estimating the powers of the mind. If, at mid-day, we either look down to the
ground, or on the surrounding objects which lie open to our view, we think
ourselves endued with a very strong and piercing eyesight; but when we look up
to the sun, and gaze at it unveiled, the sight which did excellently well for
the earth is instantly so dazzled and confounded by the refulgence, as to oblige
us to confess that our acuteness in discerning terrestrial objects is mere
dimness when applied to the sun. Thus too, it happens in estimating our
spiritual qualities. So long as we do not look beyond the earth, we are quite
pleased with our own righteousness, wisdom, and virtue; we address ourselves in
the most flattering terms, and seem only less than demigods. But should we once
begin to raise our thoughts to God, and reflect what kind of Being he is, and
how absolute the perfection of that righteousness, and wisdom, and virtue, to
which, as a standard, we are bound to be conformed, what formerly delighted us
by its false show of righteousness will become polluted with the greatest
iniquity; what strangely imposed upon us under the name of wisdom will disgust
by its extreme folly; and what presented the appearance of virtuous energy will
be condemned as the most miserable impotence. So far are those qualities in us,
which seem most perfect, from corresponding to the divine purity.<br></div>
<div>3. Hence that dread and amazement with which as Scripture uniformly
relates, holy men were struck and overwhelmed whenever they beheld the presence
of God. When we see those who previously stood firm and secure so quaking with
terror, that the fear of death takes hold of them, nay, they are, in a manner,
swallowed up and annihilated, the inference to be drawn is that men are never
duly touched and impressed with a conviction of their insignificance, until they
have contrasted themselves with the majesty of God. Frequent examples of this
consternation occur both in the Book of Judges and the Prophetical
Writings;<sup>5<a name="fnB49" href="#fn49">[3]</a></sup> so much so, that it
was a common expression among the people of God, &#8220;We shall die, for we
have seen the Lord.&#8221; Hence the Book of Job, also, in humbling men under a
conviction of their folly, feebleness, and pollution, always derives its chief
argument from descriptions of the Divine wisdom, virtue, and purity. Nor without
cause: for we see Abraham the readier to acknowledge himself but dust and ashes
the nearer he approaches to behold the glory of the Lord, and Elijah unable to
wait with unveiled face for His approach; so dreadful is the sight. And what can
man do, man who is but rottenness and a worm, when even the Cherubim themselves
must veil their faces in very terror? To this, undoubtedly, the Prophet Isaiah
refers, when he says (Isaiah 24:23), &#8220;The moon shall be confounded, and
the sun ashamed, when the Lord of Hosts shall reign;&#8221; <i>i.e.</i>, when he
shall exhibit his refulgence, and give a nearer view of it, the brightest
objects will, in comparison, be covered with darkness.<br></div>
<div>But though the knowledge of God and the knowledge of ourselves are bound
together by a mutual tie, due arrangement requires that we treat of the former
in the first place, and then descend to the latter.<br></div>

<a name="Heading307"></a><font face="Arial" size="6"><b><i>CHAPTER
2.</i></b></font></h2>
<div><font size="5">WHAT IT IS TO KNOW GOD,-TENDENCY OF THIS
KNOWLEDGE.</font><br></div>
<div><i>Sections.</i><br></div>
<div>1.	 The knowledge of God the Creator defined. The substance of this
knowledge, and the use to be made of it.<br></div>
<div>2.	 Further illustration of the use, together with a necessary reproof of
vain curiosity, and refutation of the Epicureans. The character of God as it
appears to the pious mind, contrasted with the absurd views of the Epicureans.
Religion defined.<br></div>
<div>1. BY the knowledge of God, I understand that by which we not only conceive
that there is some God, but also apprehend what it is for our interest, and
conducive to his glory, what, in short, it is befitting to know concerning
him.<sup> </sup> For, properly speaking, we cannot say that God is known where
there is no religion or piety. I am not now referring to that species of
knowledge by which men, in themselves lost and under curse, apprehend God as a
Redeemer in Christ the Mediator. I speak only of that simple and primitive
knowledge, to which the mere course of nature would have conducted us, had Adam
stood upright. For although no man will now, in the present ruin of the human
race, perceive God to be either a father, or the author of salvation, or
propitious in any respect, until Christ interpose to make our peace; still it is
one thing to perceive that God our Maker supports us by his power, rules us by
his providence, fosters us by his goodness, and visits us with all kinds of
blessings, and another thing to embrace the grace of reconciliation offered to
us in Christ. Since, then, the Lord first appears, as well in the creation of
the world as in the general doctrine of Scripture, simply as a Creator, and
afterwards as a Redeemer in Christ,-a twofold knowledge of him hence arises: of
these the former is now to be considered, the latter will afterwards follow in
its order.<sup> </sup> But although our mind cannot conceive of God, without
rendering some worship to him, it will not, however, be sufficient simply to
hold that he is the only being whom all ought to worship and adore, unless we
are also persuaded that he is the fountain of all goodness, and that we must
seek everything in him, and in none but him. My meaning is: we must be persuaded
not only that as he once formed the world, so he sustains it by his boundless
power, governs it by his wisdom, preserves it by his goodness, in particular,
rules the human race with justice and Judgment, bears with them in mercy,
shields them by his protection; but also that not a particle of light, or
wisdom, or justice, or power, or rectitude, or genuine truth, will anywhere be
found, which does not flow from him, and of which he is not the cause; in this
way we must learn to expect and ask all things from him, and thankfully ascribe
to him whatever we receive. For this sense of the divine perfections is the
proper master to teach us piety, out of which religion springs. By piety I mean
that union of reverence and love to God which the knowledge of his benefits
inspires. For, until men feel that they owe everything to God, that they are
cherished by his paternal care, and that he is the author of all their
blessings, so that nought is to be looked for away from him, they will never
submit to him in voluntary obedience; nay, unless they place their entire
happiness in him, they will never yield up their whole selves to him in truth
and sincerity.<br></div>
<div>2. Those, therefore, who, in considering this question, propose to inquire
what the essence of God is, only delude us with frigid speculations,-it being
much more our interest to know what kind of being God is, and what things are
agreeable to his nature.<sup> </sup> For, of what use is it to join Epicures in
acknowledging some God who has cast off the care of the world, and only delights
himself in ease? What avails it, in short, to know a God with whom we have
nothing to do? The effect of our knowledge rather ought to be, <i>first</i>, to
teach us reverence and fear; and, <i>secondly</i>, to induce us, under its
guidance and teaching, to ask every good thing from him, and, when it is
received, ascribe it to him. For how can the idea of God enter your mind without
instantly giving rise to the thought, that since you are his workmanship, you
are bound, by the very law of creation, to submit to his authority?-that your
life is due to him?-that whatever you do ought to have reference to him? If so,
it undoubtedly follows that your life is sadly corrupted, if it is not framed in
obedience to him, since his will ought to be the law of our lives. On the other
hand, your idea of his nature is not clear unless you acknowledge him to be the
origin and fountain of all goodness. Hence would arise both confidence in him,
and a desire of cleaving to him, did not the depravity of the human mind lead it
away from the proper course of investigation.<br></div>
<div>For, first of all, the pious mind does not devise for itself any kind of
God, but looks alone to the one true God; nor does it feign for him any
character it pleases, but is contented to have him in the character in which he
manifests himself always guarding, with the utmost diligences against
transgressing his will, and wandering, with daring presumptions from the right
path. He by whom God is thus known perceiving how he governs all things,
confides in him as his guardian and protector, and casts himself entirely upon
his faithfulness,-perceiving him to be the source of every blessing, if he is in
any strait or feels any want, he instantly recurs to his protection and trusts
to his aid,-persuaded that he is good and merciful, he reclines upon him with
sure confidence, and doubts not that, in the divine clemency, a remedy will be
provided for his every time of need,-acknowledging him as his Father and his
Lords he considers himself bound to have respect to his authority in all things,
to reverence his majesty aim at the advancement of his glory, and obey his
commands,-regarding him as a just judge, armed with severity to punish crimes,
he keeps the Judgment-seat always in his view. Standing in awe of it, he curbs
himself, and fears to provoke his anger. Nevertheless, he is not so terrified by
an apprehension of Judgment as to wish he could withdraw himself, even if the
means of escape lay before him; nay, he embraces him not less as the avenger of
wickedness than as the rewarder of the righteous; because he perceives that it
equally appertains to his glory to store up punishment for the one, and eternal
life for the other. Besides, it is not the mere fear of punishment that
restrains him from sin. Loving and revering God as his father, honouring and
obeying him as his master, although there were no hell, he would revolt at the
very idea of offending him.<br></div>
<div>Such is pure and genuine religion, namely, confidence in God coupled with
serious fear-fear, which both includes in it willing reverence, and brings along
with it such legitimate worship as is prescribed by the law. And it ought to be
more carefully considered that all men promiscuously do homage to God, but very
few truly reverence him. On all hands there is abundance of ostentatious
ceremonies, but sincerity of heart is rare.<br></div>

<div><font size="5">THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD NATURALLY IMPLANTED IN THE HUMAN
MIND.</font><br></div>
<div><i>Sections.</i><br></div>
<div>1.	 The knowledge of God being manifested to all makes the reprobate
without excuse. Universal belief and acknowledgement of the existence of
God.<br></div>
<div>2.	 Objection-that religion and the belief of a Deity are the inventions of
crafty politicians. Refutation of the objection. This universal belief confirmed
by the examples of wicked men and Atheists.<br></div>
<div>3.	 Confirmed also by the vain endeavours of the wicked to banish all fear
of God from their minds. Conclusion, that the knowledge of God is naturally
implanted in the human mind.<br></div>
<div>1. THAT there exists in the human minds and indeed by natural instinct,
some sense of Deity, we hold to be beyond dispute, since God himself, to prevent
any man from pretending ignorance, has endued all men with some idea of his
Godhead, the memory of which he constantly renews and occasionally enlarges,
that all to a man being aware that there is a God, and that he is their Maker,
may be condemned by their own conscience when they neither worship him nor
consecrate their lives to his service. Certainly, if there is any quarter where
it may be supposed that God is unknown, the most likely for such an instance to
exist is among the dullest tribes farthest removed from civilisation. But, as a
heathen tells us,<sup>5<a name="fnB50" href="#fn50">[4]</a></sup> <sup> </sup>
there is no nation so barbarous, no race so brutish, as not to be imbued with
the conviction that there is a God. Even those who, in other respects, seem to
differ least from the lower animals, constantly retain some sense of religion;
so thoroughly has this common conviction possessed the mind, so firmly is it
stamped on the breasts of all men. Since, then, there never has been, from the
very first, any quarter of the globe, any city, any household even, without
religion, this amounts to a tacit confession, that a sense of Deity is inscribed
on every heart. Nay, even idolatry is ample evidence of this fact. For we know
how reluctant man is to lower himself, in order to set other creatures above
him. Therefore, when he chooses to worship wood and stone rather than be thought
to have no God, it is evident how very strong this impression of a Deity must
be; since it is more difficult to obliterate it from the mind of man, than to
break down the feelings of his nature,-these certainly being broken down, when,
in opposition to his natural haughtiness, he spontaneously humbles himself
before the meanest object as an act of reverence to God.<br></div>
<div>2. It is most absurd, therefore, to maintain, as some do, that religion was
devised by the cunning and craft of a few individuals, as a means of keeping the
body of the people in due subjection, while there was nothing which those very
individuals, while teaching others to worship God, less believed than the
existence of a God. I readily acknowledge, that designing men have introduced a
vast number of fictions into religion, with the view of inspiring the populace
with reverence or striking them with terror, and thereby rendering them more
obsequious; but they never could have succeeded in this, had the minds of men
not been previously imbued with that uniform belief in God, from which, as from
its seed, the religious propensity springs. And it is altogether incredible that
those who, in the matter of religion, cunningly imposed on their ruder
neighbours, were altogether devoid of a knowledge of God. For though in old
times there were some, and in the present day not a few are found who deny the
being of a God, yet, whether they will or not, they occasionally feel the truth
which they are desirous not to know. We do not read of any man who broke out
into more unbridled and audacious contempt of the Deity than C.
Caligula,<sup>5<a name="fnB51" href="#fn51">[6]</a></sup> and yet none showed
greater dread when any indication of divine wrath was manifested. Thus, however
unwilling, he shook with terror before the God whom he professedly studied to
condemn. You may every day see the same thing happening to his modern imitators.
The most audacious despiser of God is most easily disturbed, trembling at the
sound of a falling leaf. How so, unless in vindication of the divine majesty,
which smites their consciences the more strongly the more they endeavour to flee
from it. They all, indeed, look out for hiding-places where they may conceal
themselves from the presence of the Lord, and again efface it from their mind;
but after all their efforts they remain caught within the net. Though the
conviction may occasionally seem to vanish for a moment, it immediately returns,
and rushes in with new impetuosity, so that any interval of relief from the
gnawing of conscience is not unlike the slumber of the intoxicated or the
insane, who have no quiet rest in sleep, but are continually haunted with dire
horrific dreams. Even the wicked themselves, therefore, are an example of the
fact that some idea of God always exists in every human mind.<br></div>
<div>3. All men of sound Judgment will therefore hold, that a sense of Deity is
indelibly engraven on the human heart. And that this belief is naturally
engendered in all, and thoroughly fixed as it were in our very bones, is
strikingly attested by the contumacy of the wicked, who, though they struggle
furiously, are unable to extricate themselves from the fear of God. Though
Diagoras,<sup>5<a name="fnB52" href="#fn52">[7]</a></sup> and others of like
stamps make themselves merry with whatever has been believed in all ages
concerning religion, and Dionysus scoffs at the Judgment of heaven, it is but a
Sardonian grin; for the worm of conscience, keener than burning steel, is
gnawing them within. I do not say with Cicero, that errors wear out by age, and
that religion increases and grows better day by day. For the world (as will be
shortly seen) labours as much as it can to shake off all knowledge of God, and
corrupts his worship in innumerable ways. I only say, that, when the stupid
hardness of heart, which the wicked eagerly court as a means of despising God,
becomes enfeebled, the sense of Deity, which of all things they wished most to
be extinguished, is still in vigour, and now and then breaks forth. Whence we
infer, that this is not a doctrine which is first learned at school, but one as
to which every man is, from the womb, his own master; one which nature herself
allows no individual to forget, though many, with all their might, strive to do
so. Moreover, if all are born and live for the express purpose of learning to
know God, and if the knowledge of God, in so far as it fails to produce this
effect, is fleeting and vain, it is clear that all those who do not direct the
whole thoughts and actions of their lives to this end fail to fulfil the law of
their being. This did not escape the observation even of philosophers. For it is
the very thing which Plato meant (in <i>Ph&uacute;d. et Theact.</i>) when he
taught, as he often does, that the chief good of the soul consists in
resemblance to God; <i>i.e.</i>, when, by means of knowing him, she is wholly
transformed into him. Thus Gryllus, also, in Plutarch (<i>lib. guod bruta anim.
ratione utantur</i>), reasons most skilfully, when he affirms that, if once
religion is banished from the lives of men, they not only in no respect excel,
but are, in many respects, much more wretched than the brutes, since, being
exposed to so many forms of evil, they continually drag on a troubled and
restless existence: that the only thing, therefore, which makes them superior is
the worship of God, through which alone they aspire to immortality.<br></div>

<a name="Heading328"></a><font face="Arial" size="6"><b><i>CHAPTER
4.</i></b></font></h2>
<div><font size="5">THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD STIFLED OR CORRUPTED, IGNORANTLY OR
MALICIOUSLY.</font><br></div>
<div><i>Sections.</i><br></div>
<div>1.	 The knowledge of God suppressed by ignorance, many falling away into
superstition. Such persons, however, inexcusable, because their error is
accompanied with pride and stubbornness.<br></div>
<div>2.	 Stubbornness the companion of impiety.<br></div>
<div>3.	 No pretext can justify superstition. This proved, first, from reason;
and, secondly, from Scripture.<br></div>
<div>4.	 The wicked never willingly come into the presence of God. Hence their
hypocrisy. Hence, too, their sense of Deity leads to no good result.<br></div>
<div>1. BUT though experience testifies that a seed of religion is divinely sown
in all, scarcely one in a hundred is found who cherishes it in his heart, and
not one in whom it grows to maturity so far is it from yielding fruit in its
season. Moreover, while some lose themselves in superstitious observances, and
others, of set purpose, wickedly revolt from God, the result is that, in regard
to the true knowledge of him, all are so degenerate, that in no part of the
world can genuine godliness be found. In saying that some fall away into
superstition, I mean not to insinuate that their excessive absurdity frees them
from guilt; for the blindness under which they labour is almost invariably
accompanied with vain pride and stubbornness. Mingled vanity and pride appear in
this, that when miserable men do seek after God, instead of ascending higher
than themselves as they ought to do, they measure him by their own carnal
stupidity, and, neglecting solid inquiry, fly off to indulge their curiosity in
vain speculation. Hence, they do not conceive of him in the character in which
he is manifested, but imagine him to be whatever their own rashness has devised.
This abyss standing open, they cannot move one footstep without rushing headlong
to destruction. With such an idea of God, nothing which they may attempt to
offer in the way of worship or obedience can have any value in his sight,
because it is not him they worship, but, instead of him, the dream and figment
of their own heart. This corrupt procedure is admirably described by Paul, when
he says, that &#8220;thinking to be wise, they became fools&#8221; (Rom. 1:22).
He had previously said that &#8220;they became vain in their
imaginations,&#8221; but lest any should suppose them blameless, he afterwards
adds that they were deservedly blinded, because, not contented with sober
inquiry, because, arrogating to themselves more than they have any title to do,
they of their own accord court darkness, nay, bewitch themselves with perverse,
empty show. Hence it is that their folly, the result not only of vain curiosity,
but of licentious desire and overweening confidence in the pursuit of forbidden
knowledge, cannot be excused.<br></div>
<div>2. The expression of David (Psalm 14:1, 53:1), &#8220;The fool hath said in
his heart, There is no God,&#8221; is primarily applied to those who, as will
shortly farther appear, stifle the light of nature, and intentionally stupefy
themselves. We see many, after they have become hardened in a daring course of
sin, madly banishing all remembrance of God, though spontaneously suggested to
them from within, by natural sense. To show how detestable this madness is, the
Psalmist introduces them as distinctly denying that there is a God, because
although they do not disown his essence, they rob him of his justice and
providence, and represent him as sitting idly in heaven. Nothing being less
accordant with the nature of God than to cast off the government of the world,
leaving it to chance, and so to wink at the crimes of men that they may wanton
with impunity in evil courses; it follows, that every man who indulges in
security, after extinguishing all fear of divine Judgment, virtually denies that
there is a God.<sup> </sup> As a just punishment of the wicked, after they have
closed their own eyes, God makes their hearts dull and heavy, and hence, seeing,
they see not.<sup> </sup> David, indeed, is the best interpreter of his own
meaning, when he says elsewhere, the wicked has &#8220;no fear of God before his
eyes,&#8221; (Psalm 36:1); and, again, &#8220;He has said in his heart, God has
forgotten; he hideth his face; he will never see it.&#8221; Thus although they
are forced to acknowledge that there is some God, they, however, rob him of his
glory by denying his power. For, as Paul declares, &#8220;If we believe not, he
abideth faithful, he cannot deny himself,&#8221; (2 Tim. 2:13); so those who
feign to themselves a dead and dumb idol, are truly said to deny God. It is,
moreover, to be observed, that though they struggle with their own convictions,
and would fain not only banish God from their minds, but from heaven also, their
stupefaction is never so complete as to secure them from being occasionally
dragged before the divine tribunal. Still, as no fear restrains them from
rushing violently in the face of God, so long as they are hurried on by that
blind impulse, it cannot be denied that their prevailing state of mind in regard
to him is brutish oblivion.<br></div>
<div>3. In this way, the vain pretext which many employ to clothe their
superstition is overthrown. They deem it enough that they have some kind of zeal
for religion, how preposterous soever it may be, not observing that true
religion must be conformable to the will of God as its unerring standard; that
he can never deny himself, and is no spectra or phantom, to be metamorphosed at
each individual&#8217;s caprice. It is easy to see how superstition, with its
false glosses, mocks God, while it tries to please him. Usually fastening merely
on things on which he has declared he sets no value, it either contemptuously
overlooks, or even undisguisedly rejects, the things which he expressly enjoins,
or in which we are assured that he takes pleasure. Those, therefore, who set up
a fictitious worship, merely worship and adore their own delirious fancies;
indeed, they would never dare so to trifle with God, had they not previously
fashioned him after their own childish conceits. Hence that vague and wandering
opinion of Deity is declared by an apostle to be ignorance of God:
&#8220;Howbeit, then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by
nature are no gods.&#8221; And he elsewhere declares, that the Ephesians were
&#8220;without God&#8221; (Eph. 2:12) at the time when they wandered without any
correct knowledge of him. It makes little difference, at least in this respect,
whether you hold the existence of one God, or a plurality of gods, since, in
both cases alike, by departing from the true God, you have nothing left but an
execrable idol. It remains, therefore, to conclude with Lactantius (<i>Instit.
Div.</i> lib 1:2, 6), &#8220;No religion is genuine that is not in accordance
with truth.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>4. To this fault they add a second-viz. that when they do think of God it
is against their will; never approaching him without being dragged into his
presence, and when there, instead of the voluntary fear flowing from reverence
of the divine majesty, feeling only that forced and servile fear which divine
Judgment extorts Judgment which, from the impossibility of escape, they are
compelled to dread, but which, while they dread, they at the same time also
hate. To impiety, and to it alone, the saying of Statius properly applies:
&#8220;Fear first brought gods into the world,&#8221; (<i>Theb.</i> lib. 1).
Those whose inclinations are at variance with the justice of God, knowing that
his tribunal has been erected for the punishment of transgression, earnestly
wish that that tribunal were overthrown. Under the influence of this feeling
they are actually warring against God, justice being one of his essential
attributes. Perceiving that they are always within reach of his power, that
resistance and evasion are alike impossible, they fear and tremble. Accordingly,
to avoid the appearance of condemning a majesty by which all are overawed, they
have recourse to some species of religious observance, never ceasing meanwhile
to defile themselves with every kind of vice, and add crime to crime, until they
have broken the holy law of the Lord in every one of its requirements, and set
his whole righteousness at nought; at all events, they are not so restrained by
their semblance of fear as not to luxuriate and take pleasure in iniquity,
choosing rather to indulge their carnal propensities than to curb them with the
bridle of the Holy Spirit. But since this shadow of religion (it scarcely even
deserves to be called a shadow) is false and vain, it is easy to infer how much
this confused knowledge of God differs from that piety which is instilled into
the breasts of believers, and from which alone true religion springs. And yet
hypocrites would fain, by means of tortuous windings, make a show of being near
to God at the very time they are fleeing from him. For while the whole life
ought to be one perpetual course of obedience, they rebel without fear in almost
all their actions, and seek to appease him with a few paltry sacrifices; while
they ought to serve him with integrity of heart and holiness of life, they
endeavour to procure his favour by means of frivolous devices and punctilios of
no value. Nay, they take greater license in their grovelling indulgences,
because they imagine that they can fulfil their duty to him by preposterous
expiations; in short, while their confidence ought to have been fixed upon him,
they put him aside, and rest in themselves or the creatures. At length they
bewilder themselves in such a maze of error, that the darkness of ignorance
obscures, and ultimately extinguishes, those sparks which were designed to show
them the glory of God. Still, however, the conviction that there is some Deity
continues to exist, like a plant which can never be completely eradicated,
though so corrupt, that it is only capable of producing the worst of fruit. Nay,
we have still stronger evidence of the proposition for which I now contend-viz.
that a sense of Deity is naturally engraven on the human heart, in the fact,
that the very reprobate are forced to acknowledge it. When at their ease, they
can jest about God, and talk pertly and loquaciously in disparagement of his
power; but should despair, from any cause, overtake them, it will stimulate them
to seek him, and dictate ejaculatory prayers, proving that they were not
entirely ignorant of God, but had perversely suppressed feelings which ought to
have been earlier manifested.<br></div>

5.</i></b></font></h2>
<div><font size="5">THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD CONSPICUOUS IN THE CREATION, AND
CONTINUAL GOVERNMENT OF THE WORLD.</font><br></div>
<div>This chapter consists of two parts: 1. The former, which occupies the first
ten sections, divides all the works of God into two great classes, and
elucidates the knowledge of God as displayed in each class. The one class is
treated of in the first six, and the other in the four following sections: 2.
The latter part of the chapter shows, that, in consequence of the extreme
stupidity of men, those manifestations of God, however perspicuous, lead to no
useful result. This latter part, which commences at the eleventh section, is
continued to the end of the chapter.<br></div>
<div><i>Sections.</i><br></div>
<div>1.	 The invisible and incomprehensible essence of God, to a certain extent,
made visible in his works.<br></div>
<div>2.	 This declared by the first class of works-viz. the admirable motions of
the heavens and the earth, the symmetry of the human body, and the connection of
its parts; in short, the various objects which are presented to every
eye.<br></div>
<div>3.	 This more especially manifested in the structure of the human
body.<br></div>
<div>4.	 The shameful ingratitude of disregarding God, who, in such a variety of
ways, is manifested within us. The still more shameful ingratitude of
contemplating the endowments of the soul, without ascending to Him who gave
them. No objection can be founded on any supposed organism in the
soul.<br></div>
<div>5.	 The powers and actions of the soul, a proof of its separate existence
from the body. Proofs of the soul&#8217;s immortality. Objection that the whole
world is quickened by one soul. Reply to the objection. Its impiety.<br></div>
<div>6.	 Conclusion from what has been said-viz. that the omnipotence, eternity,
and goodness of God, may be learned from the first class of works, <i>i.e.</i>,
those which are in accordance with the ordinary course of nature.<br></div>
<div>7.	 The second class of works-viz. those above the ordinary course of
nature, afford clear evidence of the perfections of God, especially his
goodness, justice, and mercy.<br></div>
<div>8.	 Also his providence, power, and wisdom.<br></div>
<div>9.	 Proofs and illustrations of the divine Majesty. The use of them-viz.
the acquisition of divine knowledge in combination with true piety.<br></div>
<div>10.	 The tendency of the knowledge of God to inspire the righteous with the
hope of future life, and remind the wicked of the punishments reserved for them.
Its tendency, moreover, to keep alive in the hearts of the righteous a sense of
the divine goodness.<br></div>
<div>11.	 The second part of the chapter, which describes the stupidity both of
learned and unlearned, in ascribing the whole order of things, and the admirable
arrangements of divine Providence, to fortune.<br></div>
<div>12.	 Hence Polytheism, with all its abominations, and the endless and
irreconcilable opinions of the philosophers concerning God.<br></div>
<div>13.	 All guilty of revolt from God, corrupting pure religion, either by
following general custom, or the impious consent of antiquity.<br></div>
<div>14.	 Though irradiated by the wondrous glories of creation, we cease not to
follow our own ways.<br></div>
<div>15.	 Our conduct altogether inexcusable, the dullness of perception being
attributable to ourselves, while we are fully reminded of the true path, both by
the structure and the government of the world.<br></div>
<div>1. SINCE the perfection of blessedness consists in the knowledge of God, he
has been pleased, in order that none might be excluded from the means of
obtaining felicity, not only to deposit in our minds that seed of religion of
which we have already spoken, but so to manifest his perfections in the whole
structure of the universe, and daily place himself in our view, that we cannot
open our eyes without being compelled to behold him. His essence, indeed, is
incomprehensible, utterly transcending all human thought; but on each of his
works his glory is engraven in characters so bright, so distinct, and so
illustrious, that none, however dull and illiterate, can plead ignorance as
their excuse. Hence, with perfect truth, the Psalmist exclaims, &#8220;He
covereth himself with light as with a garment,&#8221; (Psalm 104:2); as if he
had said, that God for the first time was arrayed in visible attire when, in the
creation of the world, he displayed those glorious banners, on which, to
whatever side we turn, we behold his perfections visibly portrayed. In the same
place, the Psalmist aptly compares the expanded heavens to his royal tent, and
says, &#8220;He layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters, maketh the
clouds his chariot, and walketh upon the wings of the wind,&#8221; sending forth
the winds and lightnings as his swift messengers. And because the glory of his
power and wisdom is more refulgent in the firmament, it is frequently designated
as his palace. And, first, wherever you turn your eyes, there is no portion of
the world, however minute, that does not exhibit at least some sparks of beauty;
while it is impossible to contemplate the vast and beautiful fabric as it
extends around, without being overwhelmed by the immense weight of glory. Hence,
the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews elegantly describes the visible worlds
as images of the invisible (Heb. 11:3), the elegant structure of the world
serving us as a kind of mirror, in which we may behold God, though otherwise
invisible. For the same reason, the Psalmist attributes language to celestial
objects, a language which all nations understand (Psalm 19:1), the manifestation
of the Godhead being too clear to escape the notice of any people, however
obtuse.<sup> </sup> The apostle Paul, stating this still more clearly, says,
&#8220;That which may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has showed it
unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are
clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal
power and Godhead,&#8221; (Rom. 1:20).<br></div>
<div>2. In attestation of his wondrous wisdom, both the heavens and the earth
present us with innumerable proofs not only those more recondite proofs which
astronomy, medicine, and all the natural sciences, are designed to illustrate,
but proofs which force themselves on the notice of the most illiterate peasant,
who cannot open his eyes without beholding them. It is true, indeed, that those
who are more or less intimately acquainted with those liberal studies are
thereby assisted and enabled to obtain a deeper insight into the secret workings
of divine wisdom.<sup> </sup> No man, however, though he be ignorant of these,
is incapacitated for discerning such proofs of creative wisdom as may well cause
him to break forth in admiration of the Creator. To investigate the motions of
the heavenly bodies, to determine their positions, measure their distances, and
ascertain their properties, demands skill, and a more careful examination; and
where these are so employed, as the Providence of God is thereby more fully
unfolded, so it is reasonable to suppose that the mind takes a loftier flight,
and obtains brighter views of his
glory.<sup>5<a name="fnB53" href="#fn53">[8]</a></sup> Still, none who have the
use of their eyes can be ignorant of the divine skill manifested so
conspicuously in the endless variety, yet distinct and well ordered array, of
the heavenly host; and, therefore, it is plain that the Lord has furnished every
man with abundant proofs of his wisdom. The same is true in regard to the
structure of the human frame. To determine the connection of its parts, its
symmetry and beauty, with the skill of a Galen (Lib. De Usu Partium), requires
singular acuteness; and yet all men acknowledge that the human body bears on its
face such proofs of ingenious contrivance as are sufficient to proclaim the
admirable wisdom of its Maker.<br></div>
<div>3. Hence certain of the
philosophers<sup>5<a name="fnB54" href="#fn54">[9]</a></sup> have not improperly
called man a <i>microcosm</i> (<i>miniature world</i>), as being a rare specimen
of divine power, wisdom, and goodness, and containing within himself wonders
sufficient to occupy our minds, if we are willing so to employ them. Paul,
accordingly, after reminding the Athenians that they &#8220;might feel after God
and find him,&#8221; immediately adds, that &#8220;he is not far from every one
of us,&#8221; (Acts 17:27); every man having within himself undoubted evidence
of the heavenly grace by which he lives, and moves, and has his being. But if,
in order to apprehend God, it is unnecessary to go farther than ourselves, what
excuse can there be for the sloth of any man who will not take the trouble of
descending into himself that he may find Him? For the same reason, too, David,
after briefly celebrating the wonderful name and glory of God, as everywhere
displayed, immediately exclaims, &#8220;What is man, that thou art mindful of
him?&#8221; and again, &#8220;Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou hast
ordained strength,&#8221; (Psalm 8:2, 4). Thus he declares not only that the
human race are a bright mirror of the Creator&#8217;s works, but that infants
hanging on their mothers&#8217; breasts have tongues eloquent enough to proclaim
his glory without the aid of other orators. Accordingly, he hesitates not to
bring them forward as fully instructed to refute the madness of those who, from
devilish pride, would fain extinguish the name of God. Hence, too, the passage
which Paul quotes from Aratus, &#8220;We are his offspring,&#8221; (Acts 17:28),
the excellent gifts with which he has endued us attesting that he is our
Father.<sup> </sup> In the same way also, from natural instinct, and, as it
were, at the dictation of experience, heathen poets called him the father of
men. No one, indeed, will voluntarily and willingly devote himself to the
service of God unless he has previously tasted his paternal love, and been
thereby allured to love and reverence Him.<br></div>
<div>4. But herein appears the shameful ingratitude of men. Though they have in
their own persons a factory where innumerable operations of God are carried on,
and a magazine stored with treasures of inestimable value-instead of bursting
forth in his praise, as they are bound to do, they, on the contrary, are the
more inflated and swelled with pride. They feel how wonderfully God is working
in them, and their own experience tells them of the vast variety of gifts which
they owe to his liberality. Whether they will or not, they cannot but know that
these are proofs of his Godhead, and yet they inwardly suppress them. They have
no occasion to go farther than themselves, provided they do not, by
appropriating as their own that which has been given them from heaven, put out
the light intended to exhibit God clearly to their minds. At this day, however,
the earth sustains on her bosom many monster minds-minds which are not afraid to
employ the seed of Deity deposited in human nature as a means of suppressing the
name of God. Can any thing be more detestable than this madness in man, who,
finding God a hundred times both in his body and his soul, makes his excellence
in this respect a pretext for denying that there is a God? He will not say that
chance has made him differ from the brutes that perish; but, substituting nature
as the architect of the universe, he suppresses the name of God. The swift
motions of the soul, its noble faculties and rare endowments, bespeak the agency
of God in a manner which would make the suppression of it impossible, did not
the Epicureans, like so many Cyclops, use it as a vantage-ground, from which to
wage more audacious war with God. Are so many treasures of heavenly wisdom
employed in the guidance of such a worm as man, and shall the whole universe be
denied the same privilege? To hold that there are organs in the soul
corresponding to each of its faculties, is so far from obscuring the glory of
God, that it rather illustrates it. Let Epicurus tell what concourse of atoms,
cooking meat and drink, can form one portion into refuse and another portion
into blood, and make all the members separately perform their office as
carefully as if they were so many souls acting with common consent in the
superintendence of one body.<br></div>
<div>5. But my business at present is not with that stye: I wish rather to deal
with those who, led away by absurd subtleties, are inclined, by giving an
indirect turn to the frigid doctrine of Aristotle, to employ it for the purpose
both of disproving the immortality of the soul, and robbing God of his rights.
Under the pretext that the faculties of the soul are organised, they chain it to
the body as if it were incapable of a separate existence, while they endeavour
as much as in them lies, by pronouncing eulogiums on nature, to suppress the
name of God. But there is no ground for maintaining that the powers of the soul
are confined to the performance of bodily functions. What has the body to do
with your measuring the heavens, counting the number of the stars, ascertaining
their magnitudes, their relative distances, the rate at which they move, and the
orbits which they describe? I deny not that Astronomy has its use; all I mean to
show is, that these lofty investigations are not conducted by organised
symmetry, but by the faculties of the soul itself apart altogether from the
body. The single example I have given will suggest many others to the reader.
The swift and versatile movements of the soul in glancing from heaven to earth,
connecting the future with the past, retaining the remembrance of former years,
nay, forming creations of its own-its skill, moreover, in making astonishing
discoveries, and inventing so many wonderful arts, are sure indications of the
agency of God in man. What shall we say of its activity when the body is asleep,
its many revolving thoughts, its many useful suggestions, its many solid
arguments, nay, its presentiment of things yet to come? What shall we say but
that man bears about with him a stamp of immortality which can never be effaced?
But how is it possible for man to be divine, and yet not acknowledge his
Creator? Shall we, by means of a power of judging implanted in our breast,
distinguish between justice and injustice, and yet there be no judge in heaven?
Shall some remains of intelligence continue with us in sleep, and yet no God
keep watch in heaven? Shall we be deemed the inventors of so many arts and
useful properties that God may be defrauded of his praise, though experience
tells us plainly enough, that whatever we possess is dispensed to us in unequal
measures by another hand? The talk of certain persons concerning a secret
inspiration quickening the whole world, is not only silly, but altogether
profane. Such persons are delighted with the following celebrated passage of
Virgil:<sup>6<a name="fnB55" href="#fn55">[0]</a></sup>-<br></div>
<div>&#8220;Know, first, that heaven, and earth&#8217;s compacted
frame,<br></div>
<div>And flowing waters, and the starry flame,<br></div>
<div>And both the radiant lights, one common soul<br></div>
<div>Inspires and feeds-and animates the whole.<br></div>
<div>This active mind, infused through all the space,<br></div>
<div>Unites and mingles with the mighty mass:<br></div>
<div>Hence, men and beasts the breath of life obtain,<br></div>
<div>And birds of air, and monsters of the main.<br></div>
<div>Th&#8217; ethereal vigour is in all the same,<br></div>
<div>And every soul is filled with equal
flame.&#8221;<sup>6<a name="fnB56" href="#fn56">[1]</a></sup><br></div>
<div>The meaning of all this is, that the world, which was made to display the
glory of God, is its own creator. For the same poet has, in another
place,<sup>6<a name="fnB57" href="#fn57">[2]</a></sup> adopted a view common to
both Greeks and Latins:-<br></div>
<div>&#8220;Hence to the bee some sages have assigned<br></div>
<div>A portion of the God, and heavenly mind;<br></div>
<div>For God goes forth, and spreads throughout the whole,<br></div>
<div>Heaven, earth, and sea, the universal soul;<br></div>
<div>Each, at its birth, from him all beings share,<br></div>
<div>Both man and brute, the breath of vital air;<br></div>
<div>To him return, and, loosed from earthly chain,<br></div>
<div>Fly whence they sprung, and rest in God again;<br></div>
<div>Spurn at the grave, and, fearless of decay,<br></div>
<div>Dwell in high heaven, art star th&#8217; ethereal
way.&#8221;<sup>6<a name="fnB58" href="#fn58">[3]</a></sup><br></div>
<div>Here we see how far that jejune speculation, of a universal mind animating
and invigorating the world, is fitted to beget and foster piety in our minds. We
have a still clearer proof of this in the profane verses which the licentious
Lucretius has written as a deduction from the same
principle.<sup>6<a name="fnB59" href="#fn59">[4]</a></sup> <sup> </sup> The
plain object is to form an unsubstantial deity, and thereby banish the true God
whom we ought to fear and worship. I admit, indeed that the expressions
&#8220;Nature is God,&#8221; may be piously used, if dictated by a pious mind;
but as it is inaccurate and harsh (Nature being more properly the order which
has been established by God), in matters which are so very important, and in
regard to which special reverence is due, it does harm to confound the Deity
with the inferior operations of his hands.<br></div>
<div>6. Let each of us, therefore, in contemplating his own nature, remember
that there is one God who governs all natures, and, in governing, wishes us to
have respect to himself, to make him the object of our faith, worship, and
adoration. Nothing, indeed, can be more preposterous than to enjoy those noble
endowments which bespeak the divine presence within us, and to neglect him who,
of his own good pleasure, bestows them upon us. In regard to his power, how
glorious the manifestations by which he urges us to the contemplation of
himself; unless, indeed, we pretend not to know whose energy it is that by a
word sustains the boundless fabric of the universe-at one time making heaven
reverberate with thunder, sending forth the scorching lightning, and setting the
whole atmosphere in a blaze; at another, causing the raging tempests to blow,
and forthwith, in one moment, when it so pleases him, making a perfect calm;
keeping the sea, which seems constantly threatening the earth with devastation,
suspended as it were in air; at one time, lashing it into fury by the
impetuosity of the winds; at another, appeasing its rage, and stilling all its
waves. Here we might refer to those glowing descriptions of divine power, as
illustrated by natural events, which occur throughout Scripture; but more
especially in the book of Job, and the prophecies of Isaiah. These, however, I
purposely omit, because a better opportunity of introducing them will be found
when I come to treat of the Scriptural account of the creation. (<i>Infra</i>,
chap. 14 s. 1, 2, 20, <i>sq</i>). I only wish to observe here, that this method
of investigating the divine perfections, by tracing the lineaments of his
countenance as shadowed forth in the firmament and on the earth, is common both
to those within and to those without the pale of the Church. From the power of
God we are naturally led to consider his eternity since that from which all
other things derive their origin must necessarily be selfexistent and eternal.
Moreover, if it be asked what cause induced him to create all things at first,
and now inclines him to preserve them, we shall find that there could be no
other cause than his own goodness. But if this is the only cause, nothing more
should be required to draw forth our love towards him; every creature, as the
Psalmist reminds us, participating in his mercy. &#8220;His tender mercies are
over all his works,&#8221; (Ps. 145:9).<br></div>
<div>7. In the second class of God&#8217;s works, namely those which are above
the ordinary course of nature, the evidence of his perfections are in every
respect equally clear. For in conducting the affairs of men, he so arranges the
course of his providence, as daily to declare, by the clearest manifestations,
that though all are in innumerable ways the partakers of his bounty, the
righteous are the special objects of his favour, the wicked and profane the
special objects of his severity. It is impossible to doubt his punishment of
crimes; while at the same time he, in no unequivocal manner, declares that he is
the protector, and even the avenger of innocence, by shedding blessings on the
good, helping their necessities, soothing and solacing their griefs, relieving
their sufferings, and in all ways providing for their safety. And though he
often permits the guilty to exult for a time with impunity, and the innocent to
be driven to and fro in adversity, nay, even to be wickedly and iniquitously
oppressed, this ought not to produce any uncertainty as to the uniform justice
of all his procedure. Nay, an opposite inference should be drawn. When any one
crime calls forth visible manifestations of his anger, it must be because he
hates all crimes; and, on the other hand, his leaving many crimes unpunished,
only proves that there is a Judgment in reserve, when the punishment now delayed
shall be inflicted. In like manner, how richly does he supply us with the means
of contemplating his mercy when, as frequently happens, he continues to visit
miserable sinners with unwearied kindness, until he subdues their depravity, and
woos them back with more than a parent&#8217;s fondness?<br></div>
<div>8. To this purpose the Psalmist (Ps. 107) mentioning how God, in a wondrous
manner, often brings sudden and unexpected succour to the miserable when almost
on the brink of despair, whether in protecting them when they stray in deserts,
and at length leading them back into the right path, or supplying them with food
when famishing for want, or delivering them when captive from iron fetters and
foul dungeons, or conducting them safe into harbour after shipwreck, or bringing
them back from the gates of death by curing their diseases, or, after burning up
the fields with heat and drought, fertilising them with the river of his grace,
or exalting the meanest of the people, and casting down the mighty from their
lofty seats:-the Psalmist, after bringing forward examples of this description,
infers that those things which men call fortuitous events, are so many proofs of
divine providence, and more especially of paternal clemency, furnishing ground
of joy to the righteous, and at the same time stopping the mouths of the
ungodly. But as the greater part of mankind, enslaved by error, walk blindfold
in this glorious theatre, he exclaims that it is a rare and singular wisdom to
meditate carefully on these works of God, which many, who seem most
sharp-sighted in other respects, behold without profit. It is indeed true, that
the brightest manifestation of divine glory finds not one genuine spectator
among a hundred. Still, neither his power nor his wisdom is shrouded in
darkness. His power is strikingly displayed when the rage of the wicked, to all
appearance irresistible, is crushed in a single moment; their arrogance subdued,
their strongest bulwarks overthrown, their armour dashed to pieces, their
strength broken, their schemes defeated without an effort, and audacity which
set itself above the heavens is precipitated to the lowest depths of the earth.
On the other hand, the poor are raised up out of the dust, and the needy lifted
out of the dung hill (Ps. 113:7), the oppressed and afflicted are rescued in
extremity, the despairing animated with hope, the unarmed defeat the armed, the
few the many, the weak the strong. The excellence of the divine wisdom is
manifested in distributing everything in due season, confounding the wisdom of
the world, and taking the wise in their own craftiness (1 Cor. 3:19); in short,
conducting all things in perfect accordance with reason.<br></div>
<div>9. We see there is no need of a long and laborious train of argument in
order to obtain proofs which illustrate and assert the Divine Majesty. The few
which we have merely touched, show them to be so immediately within our reach in
every quarter, that we can trace them with the eye, or point to them with the
finger. And here we must observe again (see chap. 2 s. 2), that the knowledge of
God which we are invited to cultivate is not that which, resting satisfied with
empty speculation, only flutters in the brain, but a knowledge which will prove
substantial and fruitful wherever it is duly perceived, and rooted in the heart.
The Lord is manifested by his perfections. When we feel their power within us,
and are conscious of their benefits, the knowledge must impress us much more
vividly than if we merely imagined a God whose presence we never felt. Hence it
is obvious, that in seeking God, the most direct path and the fittest method is,
not to attempt with presumptuous curiosity to pry into his essence, which is
rather to be adored than minutely discussed, but to contemplate him in his
works, by which he draws near, becomes familiar, and in a manner communicates
himself to us. To this the Apostle referred when he said, that we need not go
far in search of him (Acts 17:27), because, by the continual working of his
power, he dwells in every one of us. Accordingly, David (Psalm 145), after
acknowledging that his greatness is unsearchable, proceeds to enumerate his
works, declaring that his greatness will thereby be unfolded. It therefore
becomes us also diligently to prosecute that investigation of God which so
enraptures the soul with admiration as, at the same time, to make an efficacious
impression on it. And, as Augustine expresses it (in Psalm 144), since we are
unable to comprehend Him, and are, as it were, overpowered by his greatness, our
proper course is to contemplate his works, and so refresh ourselves with his
goodness.<br></div>
<div>10. By the knowledge thus acquired, we ought not only to be stimulated to
worship God, but also aroused and elevated to the hope of future life. For,
observing that the manifestations which the Lord gives both of his mercy and
severity are only begun and incomplete, we ought to infer that these are
doubtless only a prelude to higher manifestations, of which the full display is
reserved for another state. Conversely, when we see the righteous brought into
affliction by the ungodly, assailed with injuries, overwhelmed with calumnies,
and lacerated by insult and contumely, while, on the contrary, the wicked
flourish, prosper, acquire ease and honour, and all these with impunity, we
ought forthwith to infer, that there will be a future life in which iniquity
shall receive its punishment, and righteousness its reward. Moreover, when we
observe that the Lord often lays his chastening rod on the righteous, we may the
more surely conclude, that far less will the righteous ultimately escape the
scourges of his anger. There is a well-known passage in Augustine (De Civitat.
Dei, lib. 1 c. 8), &#8220;Were all sin now visited with open punishment, it
might be thought that nothing was reserved for the final Judgment; and, on the
other hand, were no sin now openly punished, it might be supposed there was no
divine providence.&#8221; It must be acknowledged, therefore, that in each of
the works of God, and more especially in the whole of them taken together, the
divine perfections are delineated as in a picture, and the whole human race
thereby invited and allured to acquire the knowledge of God, and, in consequence
of this knowledge, true and complete felicity. Moreover, while his perfections
are thus most vividly displayed, the only means of ascertaining their practical
operation and tendency is to descend into ourselves, and consider how it is that
the Lord there manifests his wisdom, power, and energy,-how he there displays
his justice, goodness, and mercy. For although David (Psalm 92:6) justly
complains of the extreme infatuation of the ungodly in not pondering the deep
counsels of God, as exhibited in the government of the human race, what he
elsewhere says (Psalm 40) is most true, that the wonders of the divine wisdom in
this respect are more in number than the hairs of our head. But I leave this
topic at present, as it will be more fully considered afterwards in its own
place (Book I. c. 16, see. 6-9).<br></div>
<div>11. Bright, however, as is the manifestation which God gives both of
himself and his immortal kingdom in the mirror of his works, so great is our
stupidity, so dull are we in regard to these bright manifestations, that we
derive no benefit from them. For in regard to the fabric and admirable
arrangement of the universe, how few of us are there who, in lifting our eyes to
the heavens, or looking abroad on the various regions of the earth, ever think
of the Creator? Do we not rather overlook Him, and sluggishly content ourselves
with a view of his works? And then in regard to supernatural events, though
these are occurring every day, how few are there who ascribe them to the ruling
providence of God-how many who imagine that they are casual results produced by
the blind evolutions of the wheel of chance? Even when under the guidance and
direction of these events, we are in a manner forced to the contemplation of God
(a circumstance which all must occasionally experience), and are thus led to
form some impressions of Deity, we immediately fly off to carnal dreams and
depraved fictions, and so by our vanity corrupt heavenly truth. This far,
indeed, we differ from each other, in that every one appropriates to himself
some peculiar error; but we are all alike in this, that we substitute monstrous
fictions for the one living and true God-a disease not confined to obtuse and
vulgar minds, but affecting the noblest, and those who, in other respects, are
singularly acute. How lavishly in this respect have the whole body of
philosophers betrayed their stupidity and want of sense? To say nothing of the
others whose absurdities are of a still grosser description, how completely does
Plato, the soberest and most religious of them all, lose himself in his round
globe?<sup>6<a name="fnB60" href="#fn60">[5]</a></sup> What must be the case
with the rest, when the leaders, who ought to have set them an example, commit
such blunders, and labour under such hallucinations? In like manner, while the
government of the world places the doctrine of providence beyond dispute, the
practical result is the same as if it were believed that all things were carried
hither and thither at the caprice of chance; so prone are we to vanity and
error. I am still referring to the most distinguished of the philosophers, and
not to the common herd, whose madness in profaning the truth of God exceeds all
bounds.<br></div>
<div>12. Hence that immense flood of error with which the whole world is
overflowed. Every individual mind being a kind of labyrinth, it is not
wonderful, not only that each nation has adopted a variety of fictions, but that
almost every man has had his own god. To the darkness of ignorance have been
added presumption and wantonness, and hence there is scarcely an individual to
be found without some idol or phantom as a substitute for Deity. Like water
gushing forth from a large and copious spring, immense crowds of gods have
issued from the human mind, every man giving himself full license, and devising
some peculiar form of divinity, to meet his own views. It is unnecessary here to
attempt a catalogue of the superstitions with which the world was overspread.
The thing were endless; and the corruptions themselves, though not a word should
be said, furnish abundant evidence of the blindness of the human mind. I say
nothing of the rude and illiterate vulgar; but among the
philosophers<sup>6<a name="fnB61" href="#fn61">[6]</a></sup> who attempted, by
reason and learning, to pierce the heavens, what shameful disagreement! The
higher any one was endued with genius, and the more he was polished by science
and art, the more specious was the colouring which he gave to his opinions. All
these, however, if examined more closely, will be found to be vain show. The
Stoics plumed themselves on their acuteness, when they sai  that the various
names of God might be extracted from all the parts of nature, and yet that his
unity was not thereby divided: as if we were not already too prone to vanity,
and had no need of being presented with an endless multiplicity of gods, to lead
us further and more grossly into error. The mystic theology of the Egyptians
shows how sedulously they laboured to be thought rational on this
subject.<sup>6<a name="fnB62" href="#fn62">[8]</a></sup> And, perhaps, at the
first glance, some show of probability might deceive the simple and unwary; but
never did any mortal devise a scheme by which religion was not foully corrupted.
This endless variety and confusion emboldened the Epicureans, and other gross
despisers of piety, to cut off all sense of God. For when they saw that the
wisest contradicted each others they hesitated not to infer from their
dissensions, and from the frivolous and absurd doctrines of each, that men
foolishly, and to no purpose, brought torment upon themselves by searching for a
God, there being none: and they thought this inference safe, because it was
better at once to deny God altogether, than to feign uncertain gods, and
thereafter engage in quarrels without end. They, indeed, argue absurdly, or
rather weave a cloak for their impiety out of human ignorance; though ignorance
surely cannot derogate from the prerogatives of God. But since all confess that
there is no topic on which such difference exists, both among learned and
unlearned, the proper inference is, that the human mind, which thus errs in
inquiring after God, is dull and blind in heavenly mysteries. Some praise the
answer of Simonides, who being asked by King Hero what God was, asked a day to
consider. When the king next day repeated the question, he asked two days; and
after repeatedly doubling the number of days, at length replied, &#8220;The
longer I consider, the darker the subject
appears.&#8221;<sup>6<a name="fnB63" href="#fn63">[9]</a></sup> He, no doubt,
wisely suspended his opinion, when he did not see clearly: still his answer
shows, that if men are only naturally taught, instead of having any distinct,
solid, or certain knowledge, they fasten only on contradictory principles, and,
in consequence, worship an unknown God.<br></div>
<div>13. Hence we must hold, that whosoever adulterates pure religion (and this
must be the case with all who cling to their own views), make a departure from
the one God. No doubt, they will allege that they have a different intention;
but it is of little consequence what they intend or persuade themselves to
believe, since the Holy Spirit pronounces all to be apostates, who, in the
blindness of their minds, substitute demons in the place of God. For this reason
Paul declares that the Ephesians were &#8220;without God,&#8221; (Eph. 2:12),
until they had learned from the Gospel what it is to worship the true God. Nor
must this be restricted to one people only, since, in another place, he declares
in general, that all men &#8220;became vain in their imaginations,&#8221; after
the majesty of the Creator was manifested to them in the structure of the world.
Accordingly, in order to make way for the only true God, he condemns all the
gods celebrated among the Gentiles as lying and false, leaving no Deity anywhere
but in Mount Zion where the special knowledge of God was professed (Hab. 2:18,
20). Among the Gentiles in the time of Christ, the Samaritans undoubtedly made
the nearest approach to true piety; yet we hear from his own mouth that they
worshipped they knew not what (John 4:22); whence it follows that they were
deluded by vain errors. In short, though all did not give way to gross vice, or
rush headlong into open idolatry, there was no pure and authentic religion
founded merely on common belief. A few individuals may not have gone all insane
lengths with the vulgar; still Paul&#8217;s declaration remains true, that the
wisdom of God was not apprehended by the princes of this world (1 Cor. 2:8). But
if the most distinguished wandered in darkness, what shall we say of the refuse?
No wonder, therefore, that all worship of man&#8217;s device is repudiated by
the Holy Spirit as degenerate. Any opinion which man can form in heavenly
mysteries, though it may not beget a long train of errors, is still the parent
of error. And though nothing worse should happen, even this is no light sin-to
worship an unknown God at random. Of this sin, however, we hear from our
Saviour&#8217;s own mouth (John 4:22), that all are guilty who have not been
taught out of the law who the God is whom they ought to worship. Nay, even
Socrates in Xenophon (lib. 1 Memorabilia), lauds the response of Apollo
enjoining every man to worship the gods according to the rites of his country,
and the particular practice of his own city. But what right have mortals thus to
decide of their own authority in a matter which is far above the world; or who
can so acquiesce in the will of his forefathers, or the decrees of the people,
as unhesitatingly to receive a god at their hands? Every one will adhere to his
own Judgment, sooner than submit to the dictation of others. Since, therefore,
in regulating the worship of God, the custom of a city, or the consent of
antiquity, is a too feeble and fragile bond of piety; it remains that God
himself must bear witness to himself from heaven.<br></div>
<div>14. In vain for us, therefore, does Creation exhibit so many bright lamps
lighted up to show forth the glory of its Author. Though they beam upon us from
every quarter, they are altogether insufficient of themselves to lead us into
the right path. Some sparks, undoubtedly, they do throw out; but these are
quenched before they can give forth a brighter effulgence. Wherefore, the
apostle, in the very place where he says that the worlds are images of invisible
things, adds that it is <i>by faith</i> we understand that they were framed by
the word of God (Heb. 11:3); thereby intimating that the invisible Godhead is
indeed represented by such displays, but that we have no eyes to perceive it
until they are enlightened through faith by internal revelation from God. When
Paul says that that which may be known of God is manifested by the creation of
the world, he does not mean such a manifestation as may be comprehended by the
wit of man (Rom. 1:19); on the contrary, he shows that it has no further effect
than to render us inexcusable (Acts 17:27). And though he says, elsewhere, that
we have not far to seek for God, inasmuch as he dwells within us, he shows, in
another passage, to what extent this nearness to God is availing. God, says he,
&#8220;in times past, suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.
Nevertheless, he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave
us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and
gladness,&#8221; (Acts 14:16, 17). But though God is not left without a witness,
while, with numberless varied acts of kindness, he woos men to the knowledge of
himself, yet they cease not to follow their own ways, in other words, deadly
errors.<br></div>
<div>15. But though we are deficient in natural powers which might enable us to
rise to a pure and clear knowledge of God, still, as the dullness which prevents
us is within, there is no room for excuse. We cannot plead ignorance, without
being at the same time convicted by our own consciences both of sloth and
ingratitude. It were, indeed, a strange defence for man to pretend that he has
no ears to hear the truth, while dumb creatures have voices loud enough to
declare it; to allege that he is unable to see that which creatures without eyes
demonstrate, to excuse himself on the ground of weakness of mind, while all
creatures without reason are able to teach. Wherefore, when we wander and go
astray, we are justly shut out from every species of excuse, because all things
point to the right path. But while man must bear the guilt of corrupting the
seed of divine knowledge so wondrously deposited in his mind, and preventing it
from bearing good and genuine fruit, it is still most true that we are not
sufficiently instructed by that bare and simple, but magnificent testimony which
the creatures bear to the glory of their Creator. For no sooner do we, from a
survey of the world, obtain some slight knowledge of Deity, than we pass by the
true God, and set up in his stead the dream and phantom of our own brain,
drawing away the praise of justice, wisdom, and goodness, from the
fountain-head, and transferring it to some other quarter. Moreover, by the
erroneous estimate we form, we either so obscure or pervert his daily works, as
at once to rob them of their glory and the author of them of his just
praise.<sup> </sup><br></div>

<div><font size="5">THE NEED OF SCRIPTURE, AS A GUIDE AND TEACHER, IN COMING TO
GOD AS A CREATOR.</font><br></div>
<div><i>Sections.</i><br></div>
<div>1.	 God gives his elect a better help to the knowledge of himself-viz. the
Holy Scriptures. This he did from the very first.<br></div>
<div>2.	 First, By oracles and visions, and the ministry of the Patriarchs.
Secondly, By the promulgation of the Law, and the preaching of the Prophets. Why
the doctrines of religion are committed to writing.<br></div>
<div>3.	 This view confirmed, 1. By the depravity of our nature making it
necessary in every one who would know God to have recourse to the word; 2. From
those passages of the Psalms in which God is introduced as reigning.<br></div>
<div>4.	 Another confirmation from certain direct statements in the Psalms.
Lastly, From the words of our Saviour.<br></div>
<div>1. THEREFORE, though the effulgence which is presented to every eye, both
in the heavens and on the earth, leaves the ingratitude of man without excuse,
since God, in order to bring the whole human race under the same condemnation,
holds forth to all, without exception, a mirror of his Deity in his works,
another and better help must be given to guide us properly to God as a Creator.
Not in vain, therefore, has he added the light of his Word in order that he
might make himself known unto salvation, and bestowed the privilege on those
whom he was pleased to bring into nearer and more familiar relation to himself.
For, seeing how the minds of men were carried to and fro, and found no certain
resting-place, he chose the Jews for a peculiar people, and then hedged them in
that they might not, like others, go astray. And not in vain does he, by the
same means, retain us in his knowledge, since but for this, even those who, in
comparison of others, seem to stand strong, would quickly fall away. For as the
aged, or those whose sight is defective, when any books however fair, is set
before them, though they perceive that there is something written are scarcely
able to make out two consecutive words, but, when aided by glasses, begin to
read distinctly, so Scripture, gathering together the impressions of Deity,
which, till then, lay confused in our minds, dissipates the darkness, and shows
us the true God clearly. God therefore bestows a gift of singular value, when,
for the instruction of the Church, he employs not dumb teachers merely, but
opens his own sacred mouth; when he not only proclaims that some God must be
worshipped, but at the same time declares that He is the God to whom worship is
due; when he not only teaches his elect to have respect to God, but manifests
himself as the God to whom this respect should be paid.<br></div>
<div>The course which God followed towards his Church from the very first, was
to supplement these common proofs by the addition of his Word, as a surer and
more direct means of discovering himself. And there can be no doubt that it was
by this help, Adam, Noah, Abraham, and the other patriarchs, attained to that
familiar knowledge which, in a manner, distinguished them from unbelievers. I am
not now speaking of the peculiar doctrines of faith by which they were elevated
to the hope of eternal blessedness. It was necessary, in passing from death unto
life, that they should know God, not only as a Creator, but as a Redeemer also;
and both kinds of knowledge they certainly did obtain from the Word. In point of
order, however, the knowledge first given was that which made them acquainted
with the God by whom the world was made and is governed. To this first knowledge
was afterwards added the more intimate knowledge which alone quickens dead
souls, and by which God is known not only as the Creator of the worlds and the
sole author and disposer of all events, but also as a Redeemer, in the person of
the Mediator. But as the fall and the corruption of nature have not yet been
considered, I now postpone the consideration of the remedy (for which, see Book
2 c. 6 &amp;c). Let the reader then remember, that I am not now treating of the
covenant by which God adopted the children of Abraham, or of that branch of
doctrine by which, as founded in Christ, believers have, properly speaking, been
in all ages separated from the profane heathen. I am only showing that it is
necessary to apply to Scripture, in order to learn the sure marks which
distinguish God, as the Creator of the world, from the whole herd of fictitious
gods.<sup> </sup> We shall afterward, in due course, consider the work of
Redemption. In the meantime, though we shall adduce many passages from the New
Testament, and some also from the Law and the Prophets, in which express mention
is made of Christ, the only object will be to show that God, the Maker of the
world, is manifested to us in Scripture, and his true character expounded, so as
to save us from wandering up and down, as in a labyrinth, in search of some
doubtful deity.<br></div>
<div>2. Whether God revealed himself to the fathers by oracles and
visions,<sup>7<a name="fnB64" href="#fn64">[0]</a></sup> or, by the
instrumentality and ministry of men, suggested what they were to hand down to
posterity, there cannot be a doubt that the certainty of what he taught them was
firmly engraven on their hearts, so that they felt assured and knew that the
things which they learnt came forth from God, who invariably accompanied his
word with a sure testimony, infinitely superior to mere opinion. At length, in
order that, while doctrine was continually enlarged, its truth might subsist in
the world during all ages, it was his pleasure that the same oracles which he
had deposited with the fathers should be consigned, as it were, to public
records. With this view the law was promulgated, and prophets were afterwards
added to be its interpreters. For though the uses of the law were manifold (Book
2 c. 7 and 8), and the special office assigned to Moses and all the prophets was
to teach the method of reconciliation between God and man (whence Paul calls
Christ &#8220;the end of the law,&#8221; Rom. 10:4); still I repeat that, in
addition to the proper doctrine of faith and repentance in which Christ is set
forth as a Mediator, the Scriptures employ certain marks and tokens to
distinguish the only wise and true God, considered as the Creator and Governor
of the world, and thereby guard against his being confounded with the herd of
false deities. Therefore, while it becomes man seriously to employ his eyes in
considering the works of God, since a place has been assigned him in this most
glorious theatre that he may be a spectator of them, his special duty is to give
ear to the Word, that he may the better
profit.<sup>7<a name="fnB65" href="#fn65">[1]</a></sup> Hence it is not strange
that those who are born in darkness become more and more hardened in their
stupidity; because the vast majority instead of confining themselves within due
bounds by listening with docility to the Word, exult in their own vanity. If
true religion is to beam upon us, our principle must be, that it is necessary to
begin with heavenly teaching, and that it is impossible for any man to obtain
even the minutest portion of right and sound doctrine without being a disciple
of Scripture. Hence, the first step in true knowledge is taken, when we
reverently embrace the testimony which God has been pleased therein to give of
himself. For not only does faith, full and perfect faith, but all correct
knowledge of God, originate in obedience. And surely in this respect God has
with singular Providence provided for mankind in all ages.<br></div>
<div>3. For if we reflect how prone the human mind is to lapse into
forgetfulness of God, how readily inclined to every kind of error, how bent
every now and then on devising new and fictitious religions, it will be easy to
understand how necessary it was to make such a depository of doctrine as would
secure it from either perishing by the neglect, vanishing away amid the errors,
or being corrupted by the presumptuous audacity of men. It being thus manifest
that God, foreseeing the inefficiency of his image imprinted on the fair form of
the universe, has given the assistance of his Word to all whom he has ever been
pleased to instruct effectually, we, too, must pursue this straight path, if we
aspire in earnest to a genuine contemplation of God;-we must go, I say, to the
Word, where the character of God, drawn from his works is described accurately
and to the life; these works being estimated, not by our depraved Judgment, but
by the standard of eternal truth. If, as I lately said, we turn aside from it,
how great soever the speed with which we move, we shall never reach the goal,
because we are off the course. We should consider that the brightness of the
Divine countenance, which even an apostle declares to be inaccessible (1 Tim.
6:16), is a kind of labyrinth,-a labyrinth to us inextricable, if the Word do
not serve us as a thread to guide our path; and that it is better to limp in the
way, than run with the greatest swiftness out of it. Hence the Psalmist, after
repeatedly declaring (Psalm 93, 96, 97, 99, &amp;c). that superstition should be
banished from the world in order that pure religion may flourish, introduces God
as <i>reigning</i>; meaning by the term, not the power which he possesses and
which he exerts in the government of universal nature, but the doctrine by which
he maintains his due supremacy: because error never can be eradicated from the
heart of man until the true knowledge of God has been implanted in it.<br></div>
<div>4. Accordingly, the same prophet, after mentioning that the heavens declare
the glory of God, that the firmament sheweth forth the works of his hands, that
the regular succession of day and night proclaim his Majesty, proceeds to make
mention of the Word:-&#8221;The law of the Lord,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is
perfect, converting the soul; the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the
simple. The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment
of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes,&#8221; (Psalm 19:1-9). For though
the law has other uses besides (as to which, see Book 2 c. 7, sec. 6, 10, 12),
the general meaning is, that it is the proper school for training the children
of God; the invitation given to all nations, to behold him in the heavens and
earth, proving of no avail. The same view is taken in the 29th Psalm, where the
Psalmist, after discoursing on the dreadful voice of God, which, in thunder,
wind, rain, whirlwind, and tempest, shakes the earth, makes the mountains
tremble, and breaks the cedars, concludes by saying, &#8220;that in his temple
does every one speak of his glory,&#8221; unbelievers being deaf to all
God&#8217;s words when they echo in the air. In like manner another Psalm, after
describing the raging billows of the sea, thus concludes, &#8220;Thy testimonies
are very sure; holiness becometh thine house for ever,&#8221; (Psalm 93:5). To
the same effect are the words of our Saviour to the Samaritan woman, when he
told her that her nation and all other nations worshipped they knew not what;
and that the Jews alone gave worship to the true God (John 4:22). Since the
human mind, through its weakness, was altogether unable to come to God if not
aided and upheld by his sacred word, it necessarily followed that all mankind,
the Jews excepted, inasmuch as they sought God without the Word, were labouring
under vanity and error.<br></div>

<div><font size="5">THE TESTIMONY OF THE SPIRIT NECESSARY TO GIVE FULL AUTHORITY
TO SCRIPTURE. THE IMPIETY OF PRETENDING THAT THE CREDIBILITY OF SCRIPTURE
DEPENDS ON THE JUDGMENT OF THE CHURCH.</font><br></div>
<div><i>Section.</i><br></div>
<div>1.	 The authority of Scripture derived not from men, but from the Spirit of
God. Objection, That Scripture depends on the decision of the Church.
Refutation, I. The truth of God would thus be subjected to the will of man. II.
It is insulting to the Holy Spirit. III. It establishes a tyranny in the Church.
IV. It forms a mass of errors. V. It subverts conscience. VI. It exposes our
faith to the scoffs of the profane.<br></div>
<div>2.	 Another reply to the objection drawn from the words of the Apostle
Paul. Solution of the difficulties started by opponents. A second objection
refuted.<br></div>
<div>3.	 A third objection founded on a sentiment of Augustine
considered.<br></div>
<div>4.	 Conclusion, That the authority of Scripture is founded on its being
spoken by God. This confirmed by the conscience of the godly, and the consent of
all men of the least candour. A fourth objection common in the mouths of the
profane. Refutation.<br></div>
<div>5.	 Last and necessary conclusion, That the authority of Scripture is
sealed on the hearts of believers by the testimony of the Holy Spirit. The
certainty of this testimony. Confirmation of it from a passage of Isaiah, and
the experience of believers. Also, from another passage of Isaiah.<br></div>
<div>1. BEFORE proceeding farther, it seems proper to make some observations on
the authority of Scripture, in order that our minds may not only be prepared to
receive it with reverence, but be divested of all doubt.<br></div>
<div>When that which professes to be the Word of God is acknowledged to be so,
no person, unless devoid of common sense and the feelings of a man, will have
the desperate hardihood to refuse credit to the speaker. But since no daily
responses are given from heaven, and the Scriptures are the only records in
which God has been pleased to consign his truth to perpetual remembrance, the
full authority which they ought to possess with the faithful is not recognised,
unless they are believed to have come from heaven, as directly as if God had
been heard giving utterance to them. This subject well deserves to be treated
more at large, and pondered more accurately. But my readers will pardon me for
having more regard to what my plan admits than to what the extent of this topic
requires.<br></div>
<div>A most pernicious error has very generally prevailed-viz. that Scripture is
of importance only in so far as conceded to it by the suffrage of the Church; as
if the eternal and inviolable truth of God could depend on the will of men. With
great insult to the Holy Spirit, it is asked, who can assure us that the
Scriptures proceeded from God; who guarantee that they have come down safe and
unimpaired to our times; who persuade us that <i>this</i> book is to be received
with reverence, and <i>that one</i> expunged from the list, did not the Church
regulate all these things with certainty? On the determination of the Church,
therefore, it is said, depend both the reverence which is due to Scripture, and
the books which are to be admitted into the canon. Thus profane men, seeking,
under the pretext of the Church, to introduce unbridled tyranny, care not in
what absurdities they entangle themselves and others, provided they extort from
the simple this one acknowledgement-viz. that there is nothing which the Church
cannot do. But what is to become of miserable consciences in quest of some solid
assurance of eternal life, if all the promises with regard to it have no better
support than man&#8217;s Judgment? On being told so, will they cease to doubt
and tremble? On the other hand, to what jeers of the wicked is our faith
subjected-into how great suspicion is it brought with all, if believed to have
only a precarious authority lent to it by the good will of men?<br></div>
<div>2. These ravings are admirably refuted by a single expression of an
apostle. Paul testifies that the Church is &#8220;built on the foundation of the
apostles and prophets,&#8221; (Eph. 2:20). If the doctrine of the apostles and
prophets is the foundation of the Church, the former must have had its certainty
before the latter began to exist. Nor is there any room for the cavil, that
though the Church derives her first beginning from thence, it still remains
doubtful what writings are to be attributed to the apostles and prophets, until
her Judgment is interposed. For if the Christian Church was founded at first on
the writings of the prophets, and the preaching of the apostles, that doctrine,
wheresoever it may be found, was certainly ascertained and sanctioned
antecedently to the Church, since, but for this, the Church herself never could
have existed.<sup>7<a name="fnB66" href="#fn66">[2]</a></sup> Nothings therefore
can be more absurd than the fiction, that the power of judging Scripture is in
the Church, and that on her nod its certainty depends. When the Church receives
it, and gives it the stamp of her authority, she does not make that authentic
which was otherwise doubtful or controverted but, acknowledging it as the truth
of God, she, as in duty bounds shows her reverence by an unhesitating assent. As
to the question, How shall we be persuaded that it came from God without
recurring to a decree of the Church? it is just the same as if it were asked,
How shall we learn to distinguish light from darkness, white from black, sweet
from bitter? Scripture bears upon the face of it as clear evidence of its truth,
as white and black do of their colour, sweet and bitter of their
taste.<br></div>
<div>3. I am aware it is usual to quote a sentence of Augustine in which he says
that he would not believe the gospel, were he not moved by the authority of the
Church (Aug. Cont. Epist. Fundament. c. 5). But it is easy to discover from the
context, how inaccurate and unfair it is to give it such a meaning. He was
reasoning against the Manichees, who insisted on being implicitly believed,
alleging that they had the truth, though they did not show they had. But as they
pretended to appeal to the gospel in support of Manes, he asks what they would
do if they fell in with a man who did not even believe the gospel-what kind of
argument they would use to bring him over to their opinion. He afterwards adds,
&#8220;But I would not believe the gospel,&#8221; &amp;c.; meaning, that were he
a stranger to the faith, the only thing which could induce him to embrace the
gospel would be the authority of the Church. And is it any thing wonderful, that
one who does not know Christ should pay respect to men?<br></div>
<div>Augustine, therefore, does not here say that the faith of the godly is
founded on the authority of the Church; nor does he mean that the certainty of
the gospel depends upon it; he merely says that unbelievers would have no
certainty of the gospel, so as thereby to win Christ, were they not influenced
by the consent of the Church. And he clearly shows this to be his meaning, by
thus expressing himself a little before: &#8220;When I have praised my own
creed, and ridiculed yours, who do you suppose is to judge between us; or what
more is to be done than to quit those who, inviting us to certainty, afterwards
command us to believe uncertainty, and follow those who invite us, in the first
instance, to believe what we are not yet able to comprehend, that waxing
stronger through faith itself, we may become able to understand what eve
believe-no longer men, but God himself internally strengthening and illuminating
our minds?&#8221; These unquestionably are the words of Augustine (August. Cont.
Epist. Fundament. cap. 4); and the obvious inference from them is, that this
holy man had no intention to suspend our faith in Scripture on the nod or
decision of the Church,<sup>7<a name="fnB67" href="#fn67">[3]</a></sup> but only
to intimate (what we too admit to be true) that those who are not yet
enlightened by the Spirit of God, become teachable by reverence for the Church,
and thus submit to learn the faith of Christ from the gospel. In this way,
though the authority of the Church leads us on, and prepares us to believe in
the gospel, it is plain that Augustine would have the certainty of the godly to
rest on a very different
foundation.<sup>7<a name="fnB68" href="#fn68">[4]</a></sup><br></div>
<div>At the same time, I deny not that he often presses the Manichees with the
consent of the whole Church, while arguing in support of the Scriptures, which
they rejected. Hence he upbraids Faustus (lib. 32) for not submitting to
evangelical truth-truth so well founded, so firmly established, so gloriously
renowned, and handed down by sure succession from the days of the apostles. But
he nowhere insinuates that the authority which we give to the Scriptures depends
on the definitions or devices of men. He only brings forward the universal
Judgment of the Church, as a point most pertinent to the cause, and one,
moreover, in which he had the advantage of his opponents. Any one who desires to
see this more fully proved may read his short treatises, <i>De Utilitate
Credendi</i> (The Advantages of Believing), where it will be found that the only
facility of believing which he recommends is that which affords an introduction,
and forms a fit commencement to inquiry; while he declares that we ought not to
be satisfied with opinion, but to strive after substantial truth.<br></div>
<div>4. It is necessary to attend to what I lately said, that our faith in
doctrine is not established until we have a perfect conviction that God is its
author. Hence, the highest proof of Scripture is uniformly taken from the
character of him whose Word it is. The prophets and apostles boast not their own
acuteness or any qualities which win credit to speakers, nor do they dwell on
reasons; but they appeal to the sacred name of God, in order that the whole
world may be compelled to submission. The next thing to be considered is, how it
appears not probable merely, but certain, that the name of God is neither rashly
nor cunningly pretended. If, then, we would consult most effectually for our
consciences, and save them from being driven about in a whirl of uncertainty,
from wavering, and even stumbling at the smallest obstacle, our conviction of
the truth of Scripture must be derived from a higher source than human
conjectures, Judgments, or reasons; namely, the secret testimony of the Spirit.
It is true, indeed, that if we choose to proceed in the way of arguments it is
easy to establish, by evidence of various kinds, that if there is a God in
heaven, the Law, the Prophecies, and the Gospel, proceeded from him. Nay,
although learned men, and men of the greatest talent, should take the opposite
side, summoning and ostentatiously displaying all the powers of their genius in
the discussion; if they are not possessed of shameless effrontery, they will be
compelled to confess that the Scripture exhibits clear evidence of its being
spoken by God, and, consequently, of its containing his heavenly doctrine. We
shall see a little farther on, that the volume of sacred Scripture very far
surpasses all other writings. Nay, if we look at it with clear eyes, and
unblessed Judgment, it will forthwith present itself with a divine majesty which
will subdue our presumptuous opposition, and force us to do it homage.<br></div>
<div>Still, however, it is preposterous to attempt, by discussion, to rear up a
full faith in Scripture. True, were I called to contend with the craftiest
despisers of God, I trust, though I am not possessed of the highest ability or
eloquence, I should not find it difficult to stop their obstreperous mouths; I
could, without much ado, put down the boastings which they mutter in corners,
were anything to be gained by refuting their cavils. But although we may
maintain the sacred Word of God against gainsayers, it does not follow that we
shall forthwith implant the certainty which faith requires in their hearts.
Profane men think that religion rests only on opinion, and, therefore, that they
may not believe foolishly, or on slight grounds, desire and insist to have it
proved by reason that Moses and the prophets were divinely inspired. But I
answer, that the testimony of the Spirit is superior to reason. For as God alone
can properly bear witness to his own words, so these words will not obtain full
credit in the hearts of men, until they are sealed by the inward testimony of
the Spirit. The same Spirit, therefore, who spoke by the mouth of the prophets,
must penetrate our hearts, in order to convince us that they faithfully
delivered the message with which they were divinely entrusted. This connection
is most aptly expressed by Isaiah in these words, &#8220;My Spirit that is upon
thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy
mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy
seed&#8217;s seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever,&#8221; (Isa.
59:21). Some worthy persons feel disconcerted, because, while the wicked murmur
with impunity at the Word of God, they have not a clear proof at hand to silence
them, forgetting that the Spirit is called an earnest and seal to confirm the
faith of the godly, for this very reason, that, until he enlightens their minds,
they are tossed to and fro in a sea of doubts.<br></div>
<div>5. Let it therefore be held as fixed, that those who are inwardly taught by
the Holy Spirit acquiesce implicitly in Scripture; that Scripture, carrying its
own evidence along with it, deigns not to submit to proofs and arguments, but
owes the full conviction with which we ought to receive it to the testimony of
the Spirit.<sup>7<a name="fnB69" href="#fn69">[5]</a></sup> Enlightened by him,
we no longer believe, either on our own Judgment or that of others, that the
Scriptures are from God; but, in a way superior to human Judgment, feel
perfectly assured-as much so as if we beheld the divine image visibly impressed
on it-that it came to us, by the instrumentality of men, from the very mouth of
God. We ask not for proofs or probabilities on which to rest our Judgment, but
we subject our intellect and Judgment to it as too transcendent for us to
estimate. This, however, we do, not in the manner in which some are wont to
fasten on an unknown object, which, as soon as known, displeases, but because we
have a thorough conviction that, in holding it, we hold unassailable truth; not
like miserable men, whose minds are enslaved by superstition, but because we
feel a divine energy living and breathing in it-an energy by which we are drawn
and animated to obey it, willingly indeed, and knowingly, but more vividly and
effectually than could be done by human will or knowledge. Hence, God most
justly exclaims by the mouth of Isaiah, &#8220;Ye are my witnesses, saith the
Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen, that ye may know and believe me, and
understand that I am he,&#8221; (Isa. 43:10).<br></div>
<div>Such, then, is a conviction which asks not for reasons; such, a knowledge
which accords with the highest reason, namely knowledge in which the mind rests
more firmly and securely than in any reasons; such in fine, the conviction which
revelation from heaven alone can produce. I say nothing more than every believer
experiences in himself, though my words fall far short of the reality. I do not
dwell on this subject at present, because we will return to it again: only let
us now understand that the only true faith is that which the Spirit of God seals
on our hearts. Nay, the modest and teachable reader will find a sufficient
reason in the promise contained in Isaiah, that all the children of the
renovated Church &#8220;shall be taught of the Lord,&#8221; (Isaiah 54:13). This
singular privilege God bestows on his elect only, whom he separates from the
rest of mankind. For what is the beginning of true doctrine but prompt alacrity
to hear the Word of God? And God, by the mouth of Moses, thus demands to be
heard: &#8220;It is not in heavens that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for
us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear and do it? But the word is
very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart,&#8221; (Deut. 30:12, 14).
God having been pleased to reserve the treasure of intelligence for his
children, no wonder that so much ignorance and stupidity is seen in the
<i>generality</i> of mankind. In the generality, I include even those specially
chosen, until they are ingrafted into the body of the Church. Isaiah, moreover,
while reminding us that the prophetical doctrine would prove incredible not only
to strangers, but also to the Jews, who were desirous to be thought of the
household of God, subjoins the reason, when he asks, &#8220;To whom has the arm
of the Lord been revealed?&#8221; (Isaiah 53:1). If at any time, then we are
troubled at the small number of those who believe, let us, on the other hand,
call to mind, that none comprehend the mysteries of God save those to whom it is
given.<sup> </sup><br></div>

refutation of two objections to the books of Moses and the Prophets, sec. 9, 10.
The third part exhibits proofs gathered out of the New Testament, <i>e.g.</i>,
the harmony of the Evangelists in their account of heavenly mysteries, the
majesty of the writings of John, Peter, and Paul, the remarkable calling of the
Apostles and conversion of Paul, sec. 11. The last part exhibits the proofs
drawn from ecclesiastical history, the perpetual consent of the Church in
receiving and preserving divine truth, the invincible force of the truth in
defending itself, the agreement of the godly (though otherwise differing so much
from one another), the pious profession of the same doctrine by many illustrious
men; in fine, the more than human constancy of the martyrs, sec. 12, 13. This is
followed by a conclusion of the particular topic discussed.<br></div>

<div>1. IN vain were the authority of Scripture fortified by argument, or
supported by the consent of the Church, or confirmed by any other helps, if
unaccompanied by an assurance higher and stronger than human Judgment can give.
Till this better foundation has been laid, the authority of Scripture remains in
suspense.<sup> </sup> On the other hand, when recognising its exemption from the
common rule, we receive it reverently, and according to its dignity, those
proofs which were not so strong as to produce and rivet a full conviction in our
minds, become most appropriate helps.<sup> </sup> For it is wonderful how much
we are confirmed in our belief, when we more attentively consider how admirably
the system of divine wisdom contained in it is arranged-how perfectly free the
doctrine is from every thing that savours of earth-how beautifully it harmonises
in all its parts-and how rich it is in all the other qualities which give an air
of majesty to composition. Our hearts are still more firmly assured when we
reflect that our admiration is elicited more by the dignity of the matter than
by the graces of style. For it was not without an admirable arrangement of
Providence, that the sublime mysteries of the kingdom of heaven have for the
greater part been delivered with a contemptible meanness of words. Had they been
adorned with a more splendid eloquence, the wicked might have cavilled, and
alleged that this constituted all their force. But now, when an unpolished
simplicity, almost bordering on rudeness, makes a deeper impression than the
loftiest flights of oratory, what does it indicate if not that the Holy
Scriptures are too mighty in the power of truth to need the rhetorician&#8217;s
art?<br></div>
<div>Hence there was good ground for the Apostle&#8217;s declaration, that the
faith of the Corinthians was founded not on &#8220;the wisdom of men,&#8221; but
on &#8220;the power of God,&#8221; (1 Cor. 2:5), this speech and preaching among
them having been &#8220;not with enticing words of man&#8217;s wisdom, but in
demonstration of the Spirit and of power,&#8221; (1 Cor. 2:5). For the truth is
vindicated in opposition to every doubt, when, unsupported by foreign aid, it
has its sole sufficiency in itself. How peculiarly this property belongs to
Scripture appears from this, that no human writings, however skilfully composed,
are at all capable of affecting us in a similar way. Read Demosthenes or Cicero,
read Plato, Aristotle, or any other of that class: you will, I admit, feel
wonderfully allured, pleased, moved, enchanted; but turn from them to the
reading of the Sacred Volume, and whether you will or not, it will so affect
you, so pierce your heart, so work its way into your very marrow, that, in
comparison of the impression so produced, that of orators and philosophers will
almost disappear; making it manifest that in the Sacred Volume there is a truth
divine, a something which makes it immeasurably superior to all the gifts and
graces attainable by man.<br></div>
<div>2. I confess, however, that in elegance and beauty, nay, splendour, the
style of some of the prophets is not surpassed by the eloquence of heathen
writers. By examples of this description, the Holy Spirit was pleased to show
that it was not from want of eloquence he in other instances used a rude and
homely style. But whether you read David, Isaiah, and others of the same class,
whose discourse flows sweet and pleasant; or Amos the herdsman, Jeremiah, and
Zechariah, whose rougher idiom savours of rusticity; that majesty of the Spirit
to which I adverted appears conspicuous in all. I am not unaware, that as Satan
often apes God, that he may by a fallacious resemblance the better insinuate
himself into the minds of the simple, so he craftily disseminated the impious
errors with which he deceived miserable men in an uncouth and semi-barbarous
style, and frequently employed obsolete forms of expression in order to cloak
his impostures. None possessed of any moderate share of sense need be told how
vain and vile such affectation is. But in regard to the Holy Scriptures, however
petulant men may attempt to carp at them, they are replete with sentiments which
it is clear that man never could have conceived.<sup> </sup> Let each of the
prophets be examined, and not one will be found who does not rise far higher
than human reach. Those who feel their works insipid must be absolutely devoid
of taste.<br></div>
<div>3. As this subject has been treated at large by others, it will be
sufficient here merely to touch on its leading points. In addition to the
qualities already mentioned, great weight is due to the antiquity of Scripture
(Euseb. Prepar. Evang. lib. 2 c. 1). Whatever fables Greek writers may retail
concerning the Egyptian Theology, no monument of any religion exists which is
not long posterior to the age of Moses. But Moses does not introduce a new
Deity. He only sets forth that doctrine concerning the eternal God which the
Israelites had received by tradition from their fathers, by whom it had been
transmitted, as it were, from hand to hand, during a long series of ages. For
what else does he do than lead them back to the covenant which had been made
with Abraham? Had he referred to matters of which they had never heard, he never
could have succeeded; but their deliverance from the bondage in which they were
held must have been a fact of familiar and universal notoriety, the very mention
of which must have immediately aroused the attention of all. It is, moreover,
probable, that they were intimately acquainted with the whole period of four
hundred years. Now, if Moses (who is so much earlier than all other writers)
traces the tradition of his doctrine from so remote a period, it is obvious how
far the Holy Scriptures must in point of antiquity surpass all other
writings.<br></div>
<div>4. Some perhaps may choose to credit the Egyptians in carrying back their
antiquity to a period of six thousand years before the world was created. But
their garrulity, which even some profane authors have held up to derision, it
cannot be necessary for me to refute. Josephus, however, in his work against
Appion, produces important passages from very ancient writers, implying that the
doctrine delivered in the law was celebrated among all nations from the remotest
ages, though it was neither read nor accurately known. And then, in order that
the malignant might have no ground for suspicion, and the ungodly no handle for
cavil, God has provided, in the most effectual manner, against both dangers.
When Moses relates the words which Jacob, under Divine inspiration, uttered
concerning his posterity almost three hundred years before, how does he ennoble
his own tribe? He stigmatises it with eternal infamy in the person of Levi.
&#8220;Simon and Levi,&#8221; says he, &#8220;are brethren; instruments of
cruelty are in their habitations. O my soul, come not thou into their secret;
unto their assembly mine honour be not thou united,&#8221; (Gen. 49:5, 6). This
stigma he certainly might have passed in silence, not only that he might spare
his own ancestor, but also save both himself and his whole family from a portion
of the disgrace. How can any suspicion attach to him, who, by voluntarily
proclaiming that the first founder of his family was declared detestable by a
Divine oracle, neither consults for his own private interest, nor declines to
incur obloquy among his tribe, who must have been offended by his statement of
the fact? Again, when he relates the wicked murmuring of his brother Aaron, and
his sister Miriam (Numb. 12:1), shall we say that he spoke his own natural
feelings, or that he obeyed the command of the Holy Spirit? Moreover, when
invested with supreme authority, why does he not bestow the office of High
Priest on his sons, instead of consigning them to the lowest place? I only touch
on a few points out of many; but the Law itself contains throughout numerous
proofs, which fully vindicate the credibility of Moses, and place it beyond
dispute, that he was in truth a messenger sent forth from God.<br></div>
<div>5. The many striking miracles which Moses relates are so many sanctions of
the law delivered, and the doctrine propounded, by
him.<sup>7<a name="fnB70" href="#fn70">[6]</a></sup> His being carried up into
the mount in a cloud; his remaining there forty days separated from human
society; his countenance glistening during the promulgation of the law, as with
meridian effulgence; the lightnings which flashed on every side; the voices and
thunderings which echoed in the air; the clang of the trumpet blown by no human
mouth; his entrance into the tabernacle, while a cloud hid him from the view of
the people; the miraculous vindication of his authority, by the fearful
destruction of Korah, Nathan, and Abiram, and all their impious faction; the
stream instantly gushing forth from the rock when struck with his rod; the manna
which rained from heaven at his prayer;-did not God by all these proclaim aloud
that he was an undoubted prophet? If any one object that I am taking debatable
points for granted, the cavil is easily answered. Moses published all these
things in the assembly of the people. How, then, could he possibly impose on the
very eye-witnesses of what was done? Is it conceivable that he would have come
forward, and, while accusing the people of unbelief, obstinacy, ingratitude, and
other crimes, have boasted that his doctrine had been confirmed in their own
presence by miracles which they never saw?<br></div>
<div>6. For it is also worthy of remark, that the miracles which he relates are
combined with disagreeable circumstances, which must have provoked opposition
from the whole body of the people, if there had been the smallest ground for it.
Hence it is obvious that they were induced to assent, merely because they had
been previously convinced by their own experience. But because the fact was too
ascribed them to magic (Exod. 9:11). But with what probability is a charge of
magic brought against him, who held it in such abhorrence, that he ordered every
one who should consult soothsayers and magicians to be stoned?<sup> </sup> (Lev.
20:27). Assuredly, no impostor deals in tricks, without studying to raise his
reputation by amazing the common people. But what does Moses do? By crying out,
that he and Aaron his brother are nothing (Exod. 16:7), that they merely execute
what God has commanded, he clears himself from every approach to suspicion.
Again, if the facts are considered in themselves, what kind of incantation could
cause manna to rain from heaven every day, and in sufficient quantity to
maintain a people, while any one, who gathered more than the appointed measure,
saw his incredulity divinely punished by its turning to worms? To this we may
add, that God then suffered his servant to be subjected to so many serious
trials, that the ungodly cannot now gain anything by their glamour. When (as
often happened) the people proudly and petulantly rose up against him, when
individuals conspired, and attempted to overthrow him, how could any impostures
have enabled clear to leave it free for heathen writers to deny that Moses did
perform miracles, the father of lies suggested a calumny, and him to elude their
rage? The event plainly shows that by these means his doctrine was attested to
all succeeding ages.<br></div>
<div>7. Moreover, it is impossible to deny that he was guided by a prophetic
spirit in assigning the first place to the tribe of Judah in the person of
Jacob, especially if we take into view the fact itself, as explained by the
event. Suppose that Moses was the inventor of the prophecy, still, after he
committed it to writing, four hundred years pass away, during which no mention
is made of a sceptre in the tribe of Judah. After Saul is anointed, the kingly
office seems fixed in the tribe of Benjamin (1 Sam. 11:15; 16:13). When David is
anointed by Samuel, what apparent ground is there for the transference? Who
could have looked for a king out of the plebeian family of a herdsman? And out
of seven brothers, who could have thought that the honour was destined for the
youngest? And then by what means did he afterwards come within reach of the
throne? Who dare say that his anointing was regulated by human art, or skill, or
prudence, and was not rather the fulfilment of a divine prophecy? In like
manner, do not the predictions, though obscure, of the admission of the Gentiles
into the divine covenant, seeing they were not fulfilled till almost two
thousand years after, make it palpable that Moses spoke under divine
inspiration? I omit other predictions which so plainly betoken divine
revelation, that all men of sound mind must see they were spoken by God.<sup>
</sup> In short, his Song itself (Deut. 32) is a bright mirror in which God is
manifestly seen.<br></div>
<div>8. In the case of the other prophets the evidence is even clearer. I will
only select a few examples, for it were too tedious to enumerate the whole.
Isaiah, in his own day, when the kingdom of Judah was at peace, and had even
some ground to confide in the protection of the Chaldeans, spoke of the
destruction of the city and the captivity of the people (Isaiah 55:1). Supposing
it not to be sufficient evidence of divine inspiration to foretell, many years
before, events which, at the time, seemed fabulous, but which ultimately turned
out to be true, whence shall it be said that the prophecies which he uttered
concerning their return proceeded, if it was not from God? He names Cyrus, by
whom the Chaldeans were to be subdued and the people restored to freedom. After
the prophet thus spoke, more than a hundred years elapsed before Cyrus was born,
that being nearly the period which elapsed between the death of the one and the
birth of the other. It was impossible at that time to guess that some Cyrus
would arise to make war on the Babylonians, and after subduing their powerful
monarchy, put an end to the captivity of the children of Israel. Does not this
simple, unadorned narrative plainly demonstrate that what Isaiah spoke was not
the conjecture of man, but the undoubted oracle of God? Again, when Jeremiah, a
considerable time before the people were led away, assigned seventy years as the
period of captivity, and fixed their liberation and return, must not his tongue
have been guided by the Spirit of God? What effrontery were it to deny that, by
these evidences, the authority of the prophets is established, the very thing
being fulfilled to which they appeal in support of their credibility!<sup>
</sup> &#8220;Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I
declare; before they spring forth I tell you of them,&#8221; (Isaiah 42:9). I
say nothing of the agreement between Jeremiah and Ezekiel, who, living so far
apart, and yet prophesying at the same time, harmonise as completely in all they
say as if they had mutually dictated the words to one another. What shall I say
of Daniel? Did not he deliver prophecies embracing a future period of almost six
hundred years, as if he had been writing of past events generally known? (Dan.
9, &amp;c). If the pious will duly meditate on these things, they will be
sufficiently instructed to silence the cavils of the ungodly. The demonstration
is too clear to be gainsaid.<sup> </sup><br></div>
<div>9. I am aware of what is muttered in corners by certain miscreants, when
they would display their acuteness in assailing divine truth. They ask, how do
we know that Moses and the prophets wrote the books which now bear their names?
Nay, they even dare to question whether there ever was a Moses. Were any one to
question whether there ever was a Plato, or an Aristotle, or a Cicero, would not
the rod or the whip be deemed the fit chastisement of such folly? The law of
Moses has been wonderfully preserved, more by divine providence than by human
care; and though, owing to the negligence of the priests, it lay for a short
time buried,-from the time when it was found by good King Josiah (2 Kings 22:8;
2 Chron. 34:15),-it has continued in the hands of men, and been transmitted in
unbroken succession from generation to generation. Nor, indeed, when Josiah
brought it forth, was it as a book unknown or new, but one which had always been
matter of notoriety, and was then in full remembrance. The original writing had
been deposited in the temple, and a copy taken from it had been deposited in the
royal archives (Deut. 17:18, 19); the only thing which had occurred was, that
the priests had ceased to publish the law itself in due form, and the people
also had neglected the wonted reading of it. I may add, that scarcely an age
passed during which its authority was not confirmed and renewed. Were the books
of Moses unknown to those who had the Psalms of David in their hands? To sum up
the whole in one word, it is certain beyond dispute, that these writings passed
down, if I may so express it, from hand to hand, being transmitted in an
unbroken series from the fathers, who either with their own ears heard them
spoken, or learned them from those who had, while the remembrance of them was
fresh.<br></div>
<div>10. An objection taken from the history of the Maccabees (1 Macc. 1:57, 58)
to impugn the credibility of Scripture, is, on the contrary, fitted the best
possible to confirm it. First, however, let us clear away the gloss which is put
upon it: having done so, we shall turn the engine which they erect against us
upon themselves. As Antiochus ordered all the books of Scripture to be burnt, it
is asked, where did the copies we now have come from? I, in my turn, ask, In
what workshop could they have been so quickly fabricated? It is certain that
they were in existence the moment the persecution ceased, and that they were
acknowledged without dispute by all the pious who had been educated in their
doctrine, and were familiarly acquainted with them. Nay, while all the wicked so
wantonly insulted the Jews as if they had leagued together for the purpose, not
one ever dared to charge them with having introduced spurious books. Whatever,
in their opinion, the Jewish religion might be, they acknowledged that Moses was
the founder of it. What, then, do those babblers, but betray their snarling
petulance in falsely alleging the spuriousness of books whose sacred antiquity
is proved by the consent of all history? But not to spend labour in vain in
refuting these vile calumnies, let us rather attend to the care which the Lord
took to preserve his Word, when against all hope he rescued it from the
truculence of a most cruel tyrant as from the midst of the flames-inspiring
pious priests and others with such constancy that they hesitated not, though it
should have been purchased at the expense of their lives, to transmit this
treasure to posterity, and defeating the keenest search of prefects and their
satellites.<br></div>
<div>Who does not recognise it as a signal and miraculous work of God, that
those sacred monuments which the ungodly persuaded themselves had utterly
perished, immediately returned to resume their former rights, and, indeed, in
greater honour? For the Greek translation appeared to disseminate them over the
whole world. Nor does it seem so wonderful that God rescued the tables of his
covenant from the sanguinary edicts of Antiochus, as that they remained safe and
entire amid the manifold disasters by which the Jewish nation was occasionally
crushed, devastated, and almost exterminated. The Hebrew language was in no
estimation, and almost unknown; and assuredly, had not God provided for
religion, it must have utterly perished. For it is obvious from the prophetical
writings of that age, how much the Jews, after their return from the captivity,
had lost the genuine use of their native tongue. It is of importance to attend
to this, because the comparison more clearly establishes the antiquity of the
Law and the Prophets. And whom did God employ to preserve the doctrine of
salvation contained in the Law and the Prophets, that Christ might manifest it
in its own time? The Jews, the bitterest enemies of Christ; and hence Augustine
justly calls them the librarians of the Christian Church, because they supplied
us with books of which they themselves had not the use.<br></div>
<div>11. When we proceed to the New Testament, how solid are the pillars by
which its truth is supported! Three evangelists give a narrative in a mean and
humble style. The proud often eye this simplicity with disdain, because they
attend not to the principal heads of doctrine; for from these they might easily
infer that these evangelists treat of heavenly mysteries beyond the capacity of
man. Those who have the least particle of candour must be ashamed of their
fastidiousness when they read the first chapter of Luke. Even our
Saviour&#8217;s discourses, of which a summary is given by these three
evangelists, ought to prevent every one from treating their writings with
contempt. John, again, fulminating in majesty, strikes down more powerfully than
any thunderbolt the petulance of those who refuse to submit to the obedience of
faith. Let all those acute censors, whose highest pleasure it is to banish a
reverential regard of Scripture from their own and other men&#8217;s hearts,
come forward; let them read the Gospel of John, and, willing or unwilling, they
will find a thousand sentences which will at least arouse them from their sloth;
nay, which will burn into their consciences as with a hot iron, and check their
derision. The same thing may be said of Peter and Paul, whose writings, though
the greater part read them blindfold, exhibit a heavenly majesty, which in a
manner binds and rivets every reader. But one circumstance, sufficient of itself
to exalt their doctrine above the world, is, that Matthew, who was formerly
fixed down to his money-table, Peter and John, who were employed with their
little boats, being all rude and illiterate, had never learned in any human
school that which they delivered to others. Paul, moreover, who had not only
been an avowed but a cruel and bloody foe, being changed into a new man, shows,
by the sudden and unhoped-for change, that a heavenly power had compelled him to
preach the doctrine which once he destroyed. Let those dogs deny that the Holy
Spirit descended upon the apostles, or, if not, let them refuse credit to the
history, still the very circumstances proclaim that the Holy Spirit must have
been the teacher of those who, formerly contemptible among the people, all of a
sudden began to discourse so magnificently of heavenly mysteries.<br></div>
<div>12. Add, moreover, that, for the best of reasons, the consent of the Church
is not without its weight. For it is not to be accounted of no consequence,
that, from the first publication of Scripture, so many ages have uniformly
concurred in yielding obedience to it, and that, notwithstanding of the many
extraordinary attempts which Satan and the whole world have made to oppress and
overthrow it, or completely efface it from the memory of men, it has flourished
like the palm tree and continued invincible. Though in old times there was
scarcely a sophist or orator of any note who did not exert his powers against
it, their efforts proved unavailing. The powers of the earth armed themselves
for its destruction, but all their attempts vanished into smoke. When thus
powerfully assailed on every side, how could it have resisted if it had trusted
only to human aid? Nay, its divine origin is more completely established by the
fact, that when all human wishes were against it, it advanced by its own energy.
Add that it was not a single city or a single nation that concurred in receiving
and embracing it. Its authority was recognised as far and as wide as the world
extends-various nations who had nothing else in common entering for this purpose
into a holy league. Moreover, while we ought to attach the greatest weight to
the agreement of minds so diversified, and in all other things so much at
variance with each other-an agreement which a Divine Providence alone could have
produced-it adds no small weight to the whole when we attend to the piety of
those who thus agree; not of all of them indeed, but of those in whom as lights
God was pleased that his Church should shine.<br></div>
<div>13. Again, with what confidence does it become us to subscribe to a
doctrine attested and confirmed by the blood of so many saints? They, when once
they had embraced it, hesitated not boldly and intrepidly, and even with great
alacrity, to meet death in its defence. Being transmitted to us with such an
earnest, who of us shall not receive it with firm and unshaken conviction? It is
therefore no small proof of the authority of Scripture, that it was sealed with
the blood of so many witnesses, especially when it is considered that in bearing
testimony to the faith, they met death not with fanatical enthusiasm (as erring
spirits are sometimes wont to do), but with a firm and constant, yet sober godly
zeal. There are other reasons, neither few nor feeble, by which the dignity and
majesty of the Scriptures may be not only proved to the pious, but also
completely vindicated against the cavils of slanderers. These, however, cannot
of themselves produce a firm faith in Scripture until our heavenly Father
manifest his presence in it, and thereby secure implicit reverence for it. Then
only, therefore, does Scripture suffice to give a saving knowledge of God when
its certainty is founded on the inward persuasion of the Holy Spirit. Still the
human testimonies which go to confirm it will not be without effect, if they are
used in subordination to that chief and highest proof, as secondary helps to our
weakness. But it is foolish to attempt to prove to infidels that the Scripture
is the Word of God. This it cannot be known to be, except by faith. Justly,
therefore, does Augustine remind us, that every man who would have any
understanding in such high matters must previously possess piety and mental
peace.<br></div>

<div>1. THOSE who, rejecting Scripture, imagine that they have some peculiar way
of penetrating to God, are to be deemed not so much under the influence of error
as madness. For certain giddy
men<sup>7<a name="fnB71" href="#fn71">[7]</a></sup> have lately appeared, who,
while they make a great display of the superiority of the Spirit, reject all
reading of the Scriptures themselves, and deride the simplicity of those who
only delight in what they call the dead and deadly letter. But I wish they would
tell me what spirit it is whose inspiration raises them to such a sublime height
that they dare despise the doctrine of Scripture as mean and childish. If they
answer that it is the Spirit of Christ, their confidence is exceedingly
ridiculous; since they will, I presume, admit that the apostles and other
believers in the primitive Church were not illuminated by any other Spirit. None
of these thereby learned to despise the word of God, but every one was imbued
with greater reverence for it, as their writings most clearly testify. And,
indeed, it had been so foretold by the mouth of Isaiah. For when he says,
&#8220;My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth,
shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of
the mouth of thy seed&#8217;s seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for
ever,&#8221; he does not tie down the ancient Church to external doctrine, as he
were a mere teacher of elements;<sup>7<a name="fnB72" href="#fn72">[8]</a></sup>
he rather shows that, under the reign of Christ, the true and full felicity of
the new Church will consist in their being ruled not less by the Word than by
the Spirit of God. Hence we infer that these miscreants are guilty of fearful
sacrilege in tearing asunder what the prophet joins in indissoluble union. Add
to this, that Paul, though carried up even to the third heaven, ceased not to
profit by the doctrine of the law and the prophets, while, in like manner, he
exhorts Timothy, a teacher of singular excellence, to give attention to reading
(1 Tim. 4:13). And the eulogium which he pronounces on Scripture well deserves
to be remembered-viz. that &#8220;it is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be
perfect,&#8221; (2 Tim. 3:16). What an infatuation of the devil, therefore, to
fancy that Scripture, which conducts the sons of God to the final goal, is of
transient and temporary use? Again, I should like those people to tell me
whether they have imbibed any other Spirit than that which Christ promised to
his disciples. Though their madness is extreme, it will scarcely carry them the
length of making this their boast. But what kind of Spirit did our Saviour
promise to send? One who should not speak of himself (John 16:13), but suggest
and instil the truths which he himself had delivered through the word. Hence the
office of the Spirit promised to us, is not to form new and unheard-of
revelations, or to coin a new form of doctrine, by which we may be led away from
the received doctrine of the gospel, but to seal on our minds the very doctrine
which the gospel recommends.<br></div>
<div>2. Hence it is easy to understand that we must give diligent heed both to
the reading and hearing of Scripture, if we would obtain any benefit from the
Spirit of God (just as Peter praises those who attentively study the doctrine of
the prophets (2 Pet. 1:19), though it might have been thought to be superseded
after the gospel light arose), and, on the contrary, that any spirit which
passes by the wisdom of God&#8217;s Word, and suggests any other doctrine, is
deservedly suspected of vanity and falsehood. Since Satan transforms himself
into an angel of light, what authority can the Spirit have with us if he be not
ascertained by an infallible mark? And assuredly he is pointed out to us by the
Lord with sufficient clearness; but these miserable men err as if bent on their
own destruction, while they seek the Spirit from themselves rather than from
Him. But they say that it is insulting to subject the Spirit, to whom all things
are to be subject, to the Scripture: as if it were disgraceful to the Holy
Spirit to maintain a perfect resemblance throughout, and be in all respects
without variation consistent with himself. True, if he were subjected to a
human, an angelical, or to any foreign standard, it might be thought that he was
rendered subordinate, or, if you will, brought into bondage, but so long as he
is compared with himself, and considered in himself, how can it be said that he
is thereby injured? I admit that he is brought to a test, but the very test by
which it has pleased him that his majesty should be confirmed. It ought to be
enough for us when once we hear his voice; but lest Satan should insinuate
himself under his name, he wishes us to recognise him by the image which he has
stamped on the Scriptures. The author of the Scriptures cannot vary, and change
his likeness. Such as he there appeared at first, such he will perpetually
remain. There is nothing contumelious to him in this, unless we are to think it
would be honourable for him to degenerate, and revolt against himself.<br></div>
<div>3. Their cavil about our cleaving to the dead letter carries with it the
punishment which they deserve for despising Scripture. It is clear that Paul is
there arguing against false apostles (2 Cor. 3:6), who, by recommending the law
without Christ, deprived the people of the benefit of the New Covenant, by which
the Lord engages that he will write his law on the hearts of believers, and
engrave it on their inward parts. The letter therefore is dead, and the law of
the Lord kills its readers when it is dissevered from the grace of Christ, and
only sounds in the ear without touching the heart. But if it is effectually
impressed on the heart by the Spirit; if it exhibits Christ, it is the word of
life converting the soul, and making wise the simple. Nay, in the very same
passage, the apostle calls his own preaching the ministration of the Spirit (2
Cor. 3:8), intimating that the Holy Spirit so cleaves to his own truth, as he
has expressed it in Scripture, that he then only exerts and puts forth his
strength when the word is received with due honour and respect.<br></div>
<div>There is nothing repugnant here to what was lately said (chap. 7) that we
have no great certainty of the word itself, until it be confirmed by the
testimony of the Spirit. For the Lord has so knit together the certainty of his
word and his Spirit, that our minds are duly imbued with reverence for the word
when the Spirit shining upon it enables us there to behold the face of God; and,
on the other hand, we embrace the Spirit with no danger of delusion when we
recognise him in his image, that is, in his word. Thus, indeed, it is. God did
not produce his word before men for the sake of sudden display, intending to
abolish it the moment the Spirit should arrive; but he employed the same Spirit,
by whose agency he had administered the word, to complete his work by the
efficacious confirmation of the word. In this way Christ explained to the two
disciples (Luke 24:27), not that they were to reject the Scriptures and trust to
their own wisdom, but that they were to understand the Scriptures. In like
manner, when Paul says to the Thessalonians, &#8220;Quench not the
Spirit,&#8221; he does not carry them aloft to empty speculation apart from the
word; he immediately adds, &#8220;Despise not prophesying,&#8221; (1 Thess.
5:19, 20). By this, doubtless, he intimates that the light of the Spirit is
quenched the moment prophesying fall into contempt. How is this answered by
those swelling enthusiasts, in whose idea the only true illumination consists,
in carelessly laying aside, and bidding adieu to the Word of God, while, with no
less confidence than folly, they fasten upon any dreaming notion which may have
casually sprung up in their minds? Surely a very different sobriety becomes the
children of God. As they feel that without the Spirit of God they are utterly
devoid of the light of truth, so they are not ignorant that the word is the
instrument by which the illumination of the Spirit is dispensed. They know of no
other Spirit than the one who dwelt and spake in the apostles-the Spirit by
whose oracles they are daily invited to the hearing of the word.<br></div>

10.</i></b></font></h2>
<div><font size="5">IN SCRIPTURE, THE TRUE GOD OPPOSED, EXCLUSIVELY, TO ALL THE
GODS OF THE HEATHEN.</font><br></div>
<div><i>Sections.</i><br></div>
<div>1.	 Explanation of the knowledge of God resumed. God as manifested in
Scripture, the same as delineated in his works.<br></div>
<div>2.	 The attributes of God as described by Moses, David, and Jeremiah.
Explanation of the attributes. Summary. Uses of this knowledge.<br></div>
<div>3.	 Scripture, in directing us to the true God, excludes the gods of the
heathen, who, however, in some sense, held the unity of God.<br></div>
<div>1. WE formerly observed that the knowledge of God, which, in other
respects, is not obscurely exhibited in the frame of the world, and in all the
creatures, is more clearly and familiarly explained by the word. It may now be
proper to show, that in Scripture the Lord represents himself in the same
character in which we have already seen that he is delineated in his works. A
full discussion of this subject would occupy a large space. But it will here be
sufficient to furnish a kind of index, by attending to which the pious reader
may be enabled to understand what knowledge of God he ought chiefly to search
for in Scripture, and be directed as to the mode of conducting the search. I am
not now adverting to the peculiar covenant by which God distinguished the race
of Abraham from the rest of the nations. For when by gratuitous adoption he
admitted those who were enemies to the rank of sons, he even then acted in the
character of a Redeemer. At present, however, we are employed in considering
that knowledge which stops short at the creation of the world, without ascending
to Christ the Mediator. But though it will soon be necessary to quote certain
passages from the New Testament (proofs being there given both of the power of
God the Creator, and of his providence in the preservation of what he originally
created), I wish the reader to remember what my present purpose is, that he may
not wander from the proper subject. Briefly, then, it will be sufficient for him
at present to understand how God, the Creator of heaven and earth, governs the
world which was made by him. In every part of Scripture we meet with
descriptions of his paternal kindness and readiness to do good, and we also meet
with examples of severity which show that he is the just punisher of the wicked,
especially when they continue obstinate notwithstanding of all his
forbearance.<br></div>
<div>2. There are certain passages which contain more vivid descriptions of the
divine character, setting it before us as if his genuine countenance were
visibly portrayed. Moses, indeed, seems to have intended briefly to comprehend
whatever may be known of God by man, when he said, &#8220;The Lord, The Lord
God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,
keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and
that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers
upon the children, and upon the children&#8217;s children, unto the third and to
the fourth generation,&#8221; (Ex. 34:6, 7). Here we may observe, <i>first</i>,
that his eternity and selfexistence are declared by his magnificent name twice
repeated; and, <i>secondly</i>, that in the enumeration of his perfections, he
is described not as he is in himself, but in relation to us, in order that our
acknowledgement of him may be more a vivid actual impression than empty
visionary speculation. Moreover, the perfections thus enumerated are just those
which we saw shining in the heavens, and on the earth-compassion, goodness,
mercy, justice, Judgment, and truth. For power and energy are comprehended under
the name Jehovah. Similar epithets are employed by the prophets when they would
fully declare his sacred name. Not to collect a great number of passages, it may
suffice at present to refer to one Psalm (145) in which a summary of the divine
perfections is so carefully given that not one seems to have been omitted.
Still, however, every perfection there set down may be contemplated in creation;
and, hence, such as we feel him to be when experience is our guide, such he
declares himself to be by his word. In Jeremiah, where God proclaims the
character in which he would have us to acknowledge him, though the description
is not so full, it is substantially the same. &#8220;Let him that
glorieth,&#8221; says he, &#8220;glory in this, that he understandeth and
knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise loving-kindness, Judgment, and
righteousness, in the earth,&#8221; (Jer. 9:24). Assuredly, the attributes which
it is most necessary for us to know are these three: Loving-kindness, on which
alone our entire safety depends: Judgment, which is daily exercised on the
wicked, and awaits them in a severer form, even for eternal destruction:
Righteousness, by which the faithful are preserved, and most benignly cherished.
The prophet declares, that when you understand these, you are amply furnished
with the means of glorying in God. Nor is there here any omission of his truth,
or power, or holiness, or goodness. For how could this knowledge of his
loving-kindness, Judgment, and righteousness, exist, if it were not founded on
his inviolable truth? How, again, could it be believed that he governs the earth
with Judgment and righteousness, without presupposing his mighty power? Whence,
too, his loving-kindness, but from his goodness? In fine, if all his ways are
loving-kindness, Judgment, and righteousness, his holiness also is thereby
conspicuous. Moreover, the knowledge of God, which is set before us in the
Scriptures, is designed for the same purpose as that which shines in
creation-viz. that we may thereby learn to worship him with perfect integrity of
heart and unfeigned obedience, and also to depend entirely on his
goodness.<br></div>
<div>3. Here it may be proper to give a summary of the general doctrine. First,
then, let the reader observe that the Scripture, in order to direct us to the
true God, distinctly excludes and rejects all the gods of the heathen, because
religion was universally adulterated in almost every age. It is true, indeed,
that the name of one God was everywhere known and celebrated. For those who
worshipped a multitude of gods, whenever they spoke the genuine language of
nature, simply used the name god, as if they had thought one god sufficient. And
this is shrewdly noticed by Justin Martyr, who, to the same effect, wrote a
treatise, entitled, On the Monarchy of God, in which he shows, by a great
variety of evidence, that the unity of God is engraven on the hearts of all.
Tertullian also proves the same thing from the common forms of
speech.<sup>7<a name="fnB73" href="#fn73">[9]</a></sup> But as all, without
exception, have in the vanity of their minds rushed or been dragged into lying
fictions, these impressions, as to the unity of God, whatever they may have
naturally been, have had no further effect than to render men inexcusable. The
wisest plainly discover the vague wanderings of their minds when they express a
wish for any kind of Deity, and thus offer up their prayers to unknown gods. And
then, in imagining a manifold nature in God, though their ideas concerning
Jupiter, Mercury, Venus, Minerva, and others, were not so absurd as those of the
rude vulgar, they were by no means free from the delusions of the devil. We have
elsewhere observed, that however subtle the evasions devised by philosophers,
they cannot do away with the charge of rebellion, in that all of them have
corrupted the truth of God. For this reason, Habakkuk (2:20), after condemning
all idols, orders men to seek God in his temple, that the faithful may
acknowledge none but Him, who has manifested himself in his word.<br></div>

<div><font size="5">IMPIETY OF ATTRIBUTING A VISIBLE FORM TO GOD.-THE SETTING UP
OF IDOLS A DEFECTION FROM THE TRUE GOD.</font><br></div>
<div>There are three leading divisions in this chapter. The first contains a
refutation of those who ascribe a visible form to God (s. 1 and 2), with an
answer to the objection of those who, because it is said that God manifested his
presence by certain symbols, use it as a defence of their error (s. 3 and 4).
Various arguments are afterwards adduced, disposing of the trite objection from
Gregory&#8217;s expression, that images are the books of the unlearned (s. 5-7).
The second division of the chapter relates to the origin of idols or images, and
the adoration of them, as approved by the Papists (s. 8-10). Their evasion
refuted (s. 11). The third division treats of the use and abuse of images (s.
12). Whether it is expedient to have them in Christian Churches (s. 13). The
concluding part contains a refutation of the second Council of Nice, which very
absurdly contends for images in opposition to divine truth, and even to the
disparagement of the Christian name.<br></div>

<div>16.	 The blasphemous expressions of some ancient idolaters approved by not

<div>1. AS Scripture, in accommodation to the rude and gross intellect of man,
usually speaks in popular terms, so whenever its object is to discriminate
between the true God and false deities, it opposes him in particular to idols;
not that it approves of what is taught more elegantly and subtilely by
philosophers, but that it may the better expose the folly, nay, madness of the
world in its inquiries after God, so long as every one clings to his own
speculations. This exclusive definition, which we uniformly meet with in
Scripture, annihilates every deity which men frame for themselves of their own
accord-God himself being the only fit witness to himself. Meanwhile, seeing that
this brutish stupidity has overspread the globe, men longing after visible forms
of God, and so forming deities of wood and stone, silver and gold, or of any
other dead and corruptible matter, we must hold it as a first principle, that as
often as any form is assigned to God, his glory is corrupted by an impious lie.
In the Law, accordingly, after God had claimed the glory of divinity for himself
alone, when he comes to show what kind of worship he approves and rejects, he
immediately adds, &#8220;Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any
likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in
the water under the earth,&#8221; (Exod. 20:4). By these words he curbs any
licentious attempt we might make to represent him by a visible shape, and
briefly enumerates all the forms by which superstition had begun, even long
before, to turn his truth into a lie. For we know that the Sun was worshipped by
the Persian. As many stars as the foolish nations saw in the sky, so many gods
they imagined them to be. Then to the Egyptians, every animal was a figure of
God.<sup>8<a name="fnB74" href="#fn74">[0]</a></sup> The Greeks, again, plumed
themselves on their superior wisdom in worshipping God under the human form
(Maximum Tyrius Platonic. Serm. 38). But God makes no comparison between images,
as if one were more, and another less befitting; he rejects, without exception,
all shapes and pictures, and other symbols by which the superstitious imagine
they can bring him near to them.<br></div>
<div>2. This may easily be inferred from the reasons which he annexes to his
prohibition. First, it is said in the books of Moses (Deut. 4:15), &#8220;Take
ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude in
the day that the Lord spake unto you in Horeb, out of the midst of the fire,
lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any
figure,&#8221; &amp;c. We see how plainly God declares against all figures, to
make us aware that all longing after such visible shapes is rebellion against
him. Of the prophets, it will be sufficient to mention Isaiah, who is the most
copious on this subjects (Isaiah 40:18; 41:7, 29; 45:9; 46:5), in order to show
how the majesty of God is defiled by an absurd and indecorous fiction, when he
who is incorporeal is assimilated to corporeal matter; he who is invisible to a
visible image; he who is a spirit to an inanimate object; and he who fills all
space to a bit of paltry wood, or stone, or gold. Paul, too, reasons in the same
way, &#8220;Forasmuch, then, as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to
think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and
man&#8217;s device,&#8221; (Acts 17:29). Hence it is manifest, that whatever
statues are set up or pictures painted to represent God, are utterly displeasing
to him, as a kind of insults to his majesty. And is it strange that the Holy
Spirit thunders such responses from heaven, when he compels even blind and
miserable idolaters to make a similar confession on the earth? Seneca&#8217;s
complaint, as given by Augustine De Civit. Dei, c. 10, is well known. He says
&#8220;The sacred immortal, and invisible gods they exhibit in the meanest and
most ignoble materials, and dress them in the clothing of men and beasts; some
confound the sexes, and form a compound out of different bodies, giving the name
of deities to objects, which, if they were met alive, would be deemed
monsters.&#8221; Hence, again, it is obvious, that the defenders of images
resort to a paltry quibbling evasion, when they pretend that the Jews were
forbidden to use them on account of their proneness to superstition; as if a
prohibition which the Lord founds on his own eternal essences and the uniform
course of nature, could be restricted to a single nation. Besides, when Paul
refuted the error of giving a bodily shape to God, he was addressing not Jews,
but Athenians.<br></div>
<div>3. It is true that the Lord occasionally manifested his presence by certain
signs, so that he was said to be seen face to face; but all the signs he ever
employed were in apt accordance with the scheme of doctrine, and, at the same
time, gave plain intimation of his incomprehensible essence. For the cloud, and
smoke, and flame, though they were symbols of heavenly glory (Deut. 4:11),
curbed men&#8217;s minds as with a bridle, that they might not attempt to
penetrate farther. Therefore, even Moses (to whom, of all men, God manifested
himself most familiarly) was not permitted though he prayed for it, to behold
that face, but received for answer, that the refulgence was too great for man
(Exod. 33:20). The Holy Spirit appeared under the form of a dove, but as it
instantly vanished, who does not see that in this symbol of a moment, the
faithful were admonished to regard the Spirit as invisible, to be contented with
his power and grace, and not call for any external figure? God sometimes
appeared in the form of a man, but this was in anticipation of the future
revelation in Christ, and, therefore, did not give the Jews the least pretext
for setting up a symbol of Deity under the human form. The mercy-seat, also
(Exod. 25:17, 18, 21), where, under the Law, God exhibited the presence of his
power, was so framed, as to intimate that God is best seen when the mind rises
in admiration above itself: the Cherubim with outstretched wings shaded, and the
veil covered it, while the remoteness of the place was in itself a sufficient
concealment. It is therefore mere infatuation to attempt to defend images of God
and the saints by the example of the Cherubim. For what, pray, did these figures
mean, if not that images are unfit to represent the mysteries of God, since they
were so formed as to cover the mercy-seat with their wings, thereby concealing
the view of God, not only from the eye, but from every human sense, and curbing
presumption? To this we may add, that the prophets depict the Seraphim, who are
exhibited to us in vision, as having their faces veiled; thus intimating, that
the refulgence of the divine glory is so great, that even the angels cannot gaze
upon it directly, while the minute beams which sparkle in the face of angels are
shrouded from our view. Moreover, all men of sound Judgment acknowledge that the
Cherubim in question belonged to the old tutelage of the law. It is absurd,
therefore, to bring them forward as an example for our age. For that period of
puerility, if I may so express it, to which such rudiments were adapted, has
passed away. And surely it is disgraceful, that heathen writers should be more
skilful interpreters of Scripture than the Papists. Juvenal (Sat. 14) holds up
the Jews to derision for worshipping the thin clouds and firmament. This he does
perversely and impiously; still, in denying that any visible shape of Deity
existed among them, he speaks more accurately than the Papists, who prate about
there having been some visible image. In the fact that the people every now and
then rushed forth with boiling haste in pursuit of idols, just like water
gushing forth with violence from a copious spring, let us learn how prone our
nature is to idolatry, that we may not, by throwing the whole blame of a common
vice upon the Jews, be led away by vain and sinful enticements to sleep the
sleep of death.<br></div>
<div>4. To the same effect are the words of the Psalmist (Psalms 115:4, 135:15),
&#8220;Their idols are silver and gold, the works of men&#8217;s hands.&#8221;
From the materials of which they are made, he infers that they are not gods,
taking it for granted that every human device concerning God is a dull fiction.
He mentions silver and gold rather than clay or stone, that neither splendour
nor cost may procure reverence to idols. He then draws a general conclusion,
that nothing is more unlikely than that gods should be formed of any kind of
inanimate matter. Man is forced to confess that he is but the creature of a day
(see Book 3 c. 9 s. 2), and yet would have the metal which he has deified to be
regarded as God. Whence had idols their origin, but from the will of man? There
was ground, therefore, for the sarcasm of the heathen poet (Hor. Sat. I. 8),
&#8220;I was once the trunk of a fig-tree, a useless log, when the tradesman,
uncertain whether he should make me a stool, &amp;c., chose rather that I should
be a god.&#8221; In other words, an earth-born creature, who breathes out his
life almost every moment, is able by his own device to confer the name and
honour of deity on a lifeless trunk. But as that Epicurean poet, in indulging
his wit, had no regard for religion, without attending to his jeers or those of
his fellows, let the rebuke of the prophet sting, nay, cut us to the heart, when
he speaks of the extreme infatuation of those who take a piece of wood to kindle
a fire to warm themselves, bake bread, roast or boil flesh, and out of the
residue make a god, before which they prostrate themselves as suppliants (Isaiah
44:16). Hence, the same prophet, in another place, not only charges idolaters as
guilty in the eye of the law, but upbraids them for not learning from the
foundations of the earth, nothing being more incongruous than to reduce the
immense and incomprehensible Deity to the stature of a few feet. And yet
experience shows that this monstrous proceeding, though palpably repugnant to
the order of nature, is natural to man. It is, moreover, to be observed, that by
the mode of expression which is employed, every form of superstition is
denounced. Being works of men, they have no authority from God (Isa. 2:8, 31:7;
Hos. 14:3; Mic. 5:13); and, therefore, it must be regarded as a fixed principle,
that all modes of worship devised by man are detestable. The infatuation is
placed in a still stronger light by the Psalmist (Psalm 115:8), when he shows
how aid is implored from dead and senseless objects, by beings who have been
endued with intelligence for the very purpose of enabling them to know that the
whole universe is governed by Divine energy alone. But as the corruption of
nature hurries away all mankind collectively and individually into this madness,
the Spirit at length thunders forth a dreadful imprecation, &#8220;They that
make them are like unto them, so is every one that trusteth in
them.&#8221;<sup>8<a name="fnB75" href="#fn75">[1]</a></sup> And it is to be
observed, that the thing forbidden is <i>likeness</i>, whether sculptured or
otherwise. This disposes of the frivolous precaution taken by the Greek Church.
They think they do admirably, because they have no sculptured shape of Deity,
while none go greater lengths in the licentious use of pictures. The Lord,
however, not only forbids any image of himself to be erected by a statuary, but
to be formed by any artist whatever, because every such image is sinful and
insulting to his majesty.<br></div>
<div>5. I am not ignorant, indeed, of the assertion, which is now more than
threadbare, &#8220;that images are the books of the unlearned.&#8221; So said
Gregory:<sup>8<a name="fnB76" href="#fn76">[2]</a></sup> a but the Holy Spirit
goes a very different decision; and had Gregory got his lesson in this matter in
the Spirit&#8217;s school, he never would have spoken as he did. For when
Jeremiah declares that &#8220;the stock is a doctrine of vanities,&#8221; (Jer.
10:8), and Habakkuk, &#8220;that the molten image&#8221; is &#8220;a teacher of
lies,&#8221; the general doctrine to be inferred certainly is, that every thing
respecting God which is learned from images is futile and false. If it is
objected that the censure of the prophets is directed against those who
perverted images to purposes of impious superstition, I admit it to be so; but I
add (what must be obvious to all), that the prophets utterly condemn what the
Papists hold to be an undoubted axiom-viz. that images are substitutes for
books. For they contrast images with the true God, as if the two were of an
opposite nature, and never could be made to agree. In the passages which I
lately quoted, the conclusion drawn is, that seeing there is one true God whom
the Jews worshipped, visible shapes made for the purpose of representing him are
false and wicked fictions; and all, therefore, who have recourse to them for
knowledge are miserably deceived. In short, were it not true that all such
knowledge is fallacious and spurious, the prophets would not condemn it in such
general terms. This at least I maintain, that when we teach that all human
attempts to give a visible shape to God are vanity and lies, we do nothing more
than state <i>verbatim</i> what the prophets taught.<br></div>
<div>6. Moreover, let Lactantius and
Eusebius<sup>8<a name="fnB77" href="#fn77">[3]</a></sup> be read on this
subject.<sup>8<a name="fnB78" href="#fn78">[4]</a></sup> These writers assume it
as an indisputable fact, that all the beings whose images were erected were
originally men. In like manner, Augustine distinctly declares, that it is
unlawful not only to worship images, but to dedicate them. And in this he says
no more than had been long before decreed by the Libertine Council, the
thirty-sixth Canon of which is, &#8220;There must be no pictures used in
churches: Let nothing which is adored or worshipped be painted on walls.&#8221;
But the most memorable passage of all is that which Augustine quotes in another
place from Varro, and in which he expressly concurs:-&#8221;Those who first
introduced images of the gods both took away fear and brought in error.&#8221;
Were this merely the saying of Varro, it might perhaps be of little weight,
though it might well make us ashamed, that a heathen, groping as it were in
darkness, should have attained to such a degree of light, as to see that
corporeal images are unworthy of the majesty of God, and that, because they
diminish reverential fear and encourage error. The sentiment itself bears
witness that it was uttered with no less truth than shrewdness. But Augustine,
while he borrows it from Varro, adduces it as conveying his own opinion. At the
outset, indeed, he declares that the first errors into which men fell concerning
God did not originate with images, but increased with them, as if new fuel had
been added. Afterwards, he explains how the fear of God was thereby extinguished
or impaired, his presence being brought into contempt by foolish, and childish,
and absurd representations.<sup>8<a name="fnB79" href="#fn79">[5]</a></sup> The
truth of this latter remark I wish we did not so thoroughly experience.
Whosoever, therefore, is desirous of being instructed in the true knowledge of
God must apply to some other teacher than images.<br></div>
<div>7. Let Papists, then, if they have any sense of shame, henceforth desist
from the futile plea, that images are the books of the unlearned-a plea so
plainly refuted by innumerable passages of Scripture. And yet were I to admit
the plea, it would not be a valid defence of their peculiar idols. It is well
known what kind of monsters they obtrude upon us as divine. For what are the
pictures or statues to which they append the names of saints, but exhibitions of
the most shameless luxury or obscenity? Were any one to dress himself after
their model, he would deserve the pillory. Indeed, brothels exhibit their
inmates more chastely and modestly dressed than churches do images intended to
represent virgins. The dress of the martyrs is in no respect more becoming. Let
Papists then have some little regard to decency in decking their idols, if they
would give the least plausibility to the false allegation, that they are books
of some kind of sanctity. But even then we shall answer, that this is not the
method in which the Christian people should be taught in sacred places. Very
different from these follies is the doctrine in which God would have them to be
there instructed. His injunction is, that the doctrine common to all should
there be set forth by the preaching of the Word, and the administration of the
sacraments,-a doctrine to which little heed can be given by those whose eyes are
carried too and fro gazing at idols. And who are the unlearned, whose rudeness
admits of being taught by images only? Just those whom the Lord acknowledges for
his disciples; those whom he honours with a revelation of his celestial
philosophy, and desires to be trained in the saving mysteries of his kingdom. I
confess, indeed, as matters now are, there are not a few in the present day who
cannot want such books. But, I ask, whence this stupidity, but just because they
are defrauded of the only doctrine which was fit to instruct them? The simple
reason why those who had the charge of churches resigned the office of teaching
to idols was, because they themselves were dumb. Paul declares, that by the true
preaching of the gospel Christ is portrayed and in a manner crucified before our
eyes (Gal. 3:1). Of what use, then, were the erection in churches of so many
crosses of wood and stone, silver and gold, if this doctrine were faithfully and
honestly preached-viz. Christ died that he might bear our curse upon the tree,
that he might expiate our sins by the sacrifice of his body, wash them in his
blood, and, in short, reconcile us to God the Father? From this one doctrine the
people would learn more than from a thousand crosses of wood and stone. As for
crosses of gold and silver, it may be true that the avaricious give their eyes
and minds to them more eagerly than to any heavenly instructor.<br></div>
<div>8. In regard to the origin of idols, the statement contained in the Book of
Wisdom has been received with almost universal consent-viz. that they originated
with those who bestowed this honour on the dead, from a superstitious regard to
their memory. I admit that this perverse practice is of very high antiquity, and
I deny not that it was a kind of torch by which the infatuated proneness of
mankind to idolatry was kindled into a greater blaze. I do not, however, admit
that it was the first origin of the practice. That idols were in use before the
prevalence of that ambitious consecration of the images of the dead, frequently
adverted to by profane writers, is evident from the words of Moses (Gen. 31:19).
When he relates that Rachel stole her father&#8217;s images, he speaks of the
use of idols as a common vice. Hence we may infer, that the human mind is, so to
speak, a perpetual forge of idols. There was a kind of renewal of the world at
the deluge, but before many years elapse, men are forging gods at will. There is
reason to believe, that in the holy Patriarch&#8217;s lifetime his grandchildren
were given to idolatry: so that he must with his own eyes, not without the
deepest grief, have seen the earth polluted with idols-that earth whose
iniquities God had lately purged with so fearful a Judgment. For Joshua
testifies (Josh. 24:2), that Torah and Nachor, even before the birth of Abraham,
were the worshipers of false gods. The progeny of Shem having so speedily
revolted, what are we to think of the posterity of Ham, who had been cursed long
before in their father? Thus, indeed, it is. The human mind, stuffed as it is
with presumptuous rashness, dares to imagine a god suited to its own capacity;
as it labours under dullness, nay, is sunk in the grossest ignorance, it
substitutes vanity and an empty phantom in the place of God. To these evils
another is added. The god whom man has thus conceived inwardly he attempts to
embody outwardly. The mind, in this way, conceives the idol, and the hand gives
it birth. That idolatry has its origin in the idea which men have, that God is
not present with them unless his presence is carnally exhibited, appears from
the example of the Israelites: &#8220;Up,&#8221; said they, &#8220;make us gods,
which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out
of the land of Egypt, we wet not what is become of him,&#8221; (Exod. 22:1).
They knew, indeed, that there was a God whose mighty power they had experienced
in so many miracles, but they had no confidence of his being near to them, if
they did not with their eyes behold a corporeal symbol of his presence, as an
attestation to his actual government. They desired, therefore, to be assured by
the image which went before them, that they were journeying under Divine
guidance. And daily experience shows, that the flesh is always restless until it
has obtained some figment like itself, with which it may vainly solace itself as
a representation of God. In consequence of this blind passion men have, almost
in all ages since the world began, set up signs on which they imagined that God
was visibly depicted to their eyes.<br></div>
<div>9. After such a figment is formed, adoration forthwith ensues: for when
once men imagined that they beheld God in images, they also worshipped him as
being there. At length their eyes and minds becoming wholly engrossed by them,
they began to grow more and more brutish, gazing and wondering as if some
divinity were actually before them. It hence appears that men do not fall away
to the worship of images until they have imbibed some idea of a grosser
description: not that they actually believe them to be gods, but that the power
of divinity somehow or other resides in them. Therefore, whether it be God or a
creature that is imaged, the moment you fall prostrate before it in veneration,
you are so far fascinated by superstition. For this reason, the Lord not only
forbade the erection of statues to himself, but also the consecration of titles
and stones which might be set up for adoration. For the same reason, also, the
second commandment has an additional part concerning adoration. For as soon as a
visible form is given to God, his power also is supposed to be annexed to it. So
stupid are men, that wherever they figure God, there they fix him, and by
necessary consequence proceed to adore him. It makes no difference whether they
worship the idol simply, or God in the idol; it is always idolatry when divine
honours are paid to an idol, be the colour what it may. And because God wills
not to be worshipped superstitiously whatever is bestowed upon idols is so much
robbed from him.<br></div>
<div>Let those attend to this who set about hunting for miserable pretexts in
defence of the execrable idolatry in which for many past ages true religion has
been buried and sunk. It is said that the images are not accounted gods. Nor
were the Jews so utterly thoughtless as not to remember that there was a God
whose hand led them out of Egypt before they made the calf. Indeed, Aaron
saying, that these were the gods which had brought them out of Egypt, they
intimated, in no ambiguous terms, that they wished to retain God, their
deliverer, provided they saw him going before them in the calf. Nor are the
heathen to be deemed to have been so stupid as not to understand that God was
something else than wood and stone. For they changed the images at pleasure, but
always retained the same gods in their
minds;<sup>8<a name="fnB80" href="#fn80">[6]</a></sup> besides, they daily
consecrated new images without thinking they were making new gods. Read the
excuses which Augustine tells us were employed by the idolaters of his time
(<i>August. in Ps.</i> 113). The vulgar, when accused, replied that they did not
worship the visible object, but the Deity which dwelt in it invisibly. Those,
again, who had what he calls a more refined religion, said, that they neither
worshipped the image, nor any inhabiting Deity, but by means of the corporeal
image beheld a symbol of that which it was their duty to worship. What then? All
idolaters whether Jewish or Gentile, were actuated in the very way which has
been described. Not contented with spiritual understanding, they thought that
images would give them a surer and nearer impression. When once this
preposterous representation of God was adopted, there was no limit until,
deluded every now and then by new impostures, they came to think that God
exerted his power in images.<sup>8<a name="fnB81" href="#fn81">[7]</a></sup>
Still the Jews were persuaded, that under such images they worshipped the
eternal God, the one true Lord of heaven and earth; and the Gentiles, also, in
worshipping their own false gods, supposed them to dwell in heaven.<br></div>
<div>10. It is an impudent falsehood to deny that the thing which was thus
anciently done is also done in our day. For why do men prostrate themselves
before images? Why, when in the act of praying, do they turn towards them as to
the ears of God? It is indeed true, as Augustine says (in Ps. 113), that no
person thus prays or worships, looking at an image, without being impressed with
the idea that he is heard by it, or without hoping that what he wishes will be
performed by it. Why are such distinctions made between different images of the
same God, that while one is passed by, or receives only common honour, another
is worshipped with the highest solemnities? Why do they fatigue themselves with
votive pilgrimages to images while they have many similar ones at
home?<sup>8<a name="fnB82" href="#fn82">[8]</a></sup> Why at the present time do
they fight for them to blood and slaughter, as for their altars and hearths,
showing more willingness to part with the one God than with their idols? And yet
I am not now detailing the gross errors of the vulgar-errors almost infinite in
number, and in possession of almost all hearts. I am only referring to what
those profess who are most desirous to clear themselves of idolatry. They say,
we do not call them our gods. Nor did either the Jews or Gentiles of old so call
them; and yet the prophets never ceased to charge them with their adulteries
with wood and stone for the very acts which are daily done by those who would be
deemed Christians, namely, for worshipping God carnally in wood and
stone.<br></div>
<div>11. I am not ignorant, however, and I have no wish to disguise the fact,
that they endeavour to evade the charge by means of a more subtle distinction,
which shall afterwards be fully considered (see <i>infra</i>, s. 16, and chap.
12 s. 2). The worship which they pay to their images they cloak with the name of
<font face="Graeca">eijdwloduleiva</font>
(<font face="SemiticaDict"><i>idolodulia</i></font>), and deny to be
<font face="Graeca">eijdwlolatreiva</font>
(<font face="SemiticaDict"><i>idolatria</i></font>). So they speaks holding that
the worship which they call <font face="SemiticaDict"><i>dulia</i></font> may,
without insult to God, be paid to statues and pictures. Hence, they think
themselves blameless if they are only the <i>servants</i>, and not the
<i>worshippers</i>, of idols; as if it were not a lighter matter to
<i>worship</i> than <i>to serve</i>. And yet, while they take refuge in a Greek
term, they very childishly contradict themselves. For the Greek word
<font face="Graeca">latreuvein</font> having no other meaning than <i>to
worship</i>, what they say is just the same as if they were to confess that they
worship their images without worshipping them. They cannot object that I am
quibbling upon words. The fact is, that they only betray their ignorance while
they attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the simple. But how eloquent soever
they may be, they will never prove by their eloquence that one and the same
thing makes two. Let them show how the things differ if they would be thought
different from ancient idolaters. For as a murderer or an adulterer will not
escape conviction by giving some adventitious name to his crime, so it is absurd
for them to expect that the subtle device of a name will exculpate them, if
they, in fact, differ in nothing from idolaters whom they themselves are forced
to condemn. But so far are they from proving that their case is different, that
the source of the whole evil consists in a preposterous rivalship with them,
while they with their minds devise, and with their hands execute, symbolical
shapes of God.<br></div>
<div>12. I am not, however, so superstitious as to think that all visible
representations of every kind are unlawful. But as sculpture and painting are
gifts of God, what I insist for is, that both shall be used purely and
lawfully,-that gifts which the Lord has bestowed upon us, for his glory and our
good, shall not be preposterously abused, nay, shall not be perverted to our
destruction. We think it unlawful to give a visible shape to God, because God
himself has forbidden it, and because it cannot be done without, in some degree,
tarnishing his glory. And lest any should think that we are singular in this
opinion, those acquainted with the productions of sound divines will find that
they have always disapproved of it. If it be unlawful to make any corporeal
representation of God, still more unlawful must it be to worship such a
representation instead of God, or to worship God in it. The only things,
therefore, which ought to be painted or sculptured, are things which can be
presented to the eye; the majesty of God, which is far beyond the reach of any
eye, must not be dishonored by unbecoming representations. Visible
representations are of two classes-viz. historical, which give a representation
of events, and pictorial, which merely exhibit bodily shapes and figures. The
former are of some use for instruction or admonition. The latter, so far as I
can see, are only fitted for amusement. And yet it is certain, that the latter
are almost the only kind which have hitherto been exhibited in churches. Hence
we may infer, that the exhibition was not the result of judicious selection, but
of a foolish and inconsiderate longing. I say nothing as to the improper and
unbecoming form in which they are presented, or the wanton license in which
sculptors and painters have here indulged (a point to which I alluded a little
ago, <i>supra</i>, s. 7). I only say, that though they were otherwise faultless,
they could not be of any utility in teaching.<br></div>
<div>13. But, without reference to the above distinction, let us here consider,
whether it is expedient that churches should contain representations of any
kind, whether of events or human forms. First, then, if we attach any weight to
the authority of the ancient Church, let us remember, that for five hundred
years, during which religion was in a more prosperous condition, and a purer
doctrine flourished, Christian churches were completely free from visible
representations (see Preface, and Book 4, c. 9 s. 9). Hence their first
admission as an ornament to churches took place after the purity of the ministry
had somewhat degenerated. I will not dispute as to the rationality of the
grounds on which the first introduction of them proceeded, but if you compare
the two periods, you will find that the latter had greatly declined from the
purity of the times when images were unknown. What then? Are we to suppose that
those holy fathers, if they had judged the thing to be useful and salutary,
would have allowed the Church to be so long without it? Undoubtedly, because
they saw very little or no advantage, and the greatest danger in it, they rather
rejected it intentionally and on rational grounds, than omitted it through
ignorance or carelessness. This is clearly attested by Augustine in these words
(Ep. 49. See also De Civit. Dei, lib 4 c. 31) &#8220;When images are thus placed
aloft in seats of honour, to be beheld by those who are praying or sacrificing,
though they have neither sense nor life, yet from appearing as if they had both,
they affect weak minds just as if they lived and breathed,&#8221; &amp;c. And
again, in another passage (in Ps. 112) he says, &#8220;The effect produced, and
in a manner extorted, by the bodily shape, is, that the mind, being itself in a
body, imagines that a body which is so like its oven must be similarly
affected,&#8221; &amp;c. A little farther on he says, &#8220;Images are more
capable of giving a wrong bent to an unhappy soul, from having mouth, eyes,
ears, and feet, than of correcting it, as they neither speak, nor see, nor hear,
nor walk.&#8221; This undoubtedly is the reason why John (1 John 5:21) enjoins
us to beware, not only of the worship of idols, but also of idols themselves.
And from the fearful infatuation under which the world has hitherto laboured,
almost to the entire destruction of piety, we know too well from experience that
the moment images appear in churches, idolatry has as it were raised its banner;
because the folly of manhood cannot moderate itself, but forthwith falls away to
superstitious worship. Even were the danger less imminent, still, when I
consider the proper end for which churches are erected, it appears to me more
unbecoming their sacredness than I well can tell, to admit any other images than
those living symbols which the Lord has consecrated by his own word: I mean
Baptism and the Lord&#8217;s Supper, with the other ceremonies. By these our
eyes ought to be more steadily fixed, and more vividly impressed, than to
require the aid of any images which the wit of man may devise. Such, then, is
the incomparable blessing of images-a blessing, the want of which, if we believe
the Papists, cannot possibly be
compensated!<sup>8<a name="fnB83" href="#fn83">[9]</a></sup><br></div>
<div>14. Enough, I believe, would have been said on this subject, were I not in
a manner arrested by the Council of Nice; not the celebrated Council which
Constantine the Great assembled, but one which was held eight hundred years ago
by the orders and under the auspices of the Empress
Irene.<sup>9<a name="fnB84" href="#fn84">[0]</a></sup> This Council decreed not
only that images were to be used in churches, but also that they were to be
worshipped. Every thing, therefore, that I have said, is in danger of suffering
great prejudice from the authority of this Synod.<sup> </sup> To confess the
truth, however, I am not so much moved by this consideration, as by a wish to
make my readers aware of the lengths to which the infatuation has been carried
by those who had a greater fondness for images than became Christians. But let
us first dispose of this matter. Those who defend the use of images appeal to
that Synod for support. But there is a refutation extant which bears the name of
Charlemagne, and which is proved by its style to be a production of that period.
It gives the opinions delivered by the bishops who were present, and the
arguments by which they supported them. John, deputy of the Eastern Churches,
said, &#8220;God created man in his own image,&#8221; and thence inferred that
images ought to be used. He also thought there was a recommendation of images in
the following passage, &#8220;Show me thy face, for it is beautiful.&#8221;
Another, in order to prove that images ought to be placed on altars, quoted the
passage, &#8220;No man, when he has lighted a candle, putteth it under a
bushel.&#8221; Another, to show the utility of looking at images, quoted a verse
of the Psalms &#8220;The light of thy countenance, O Lord, has shone upon
us.&#8221; Another laid hold of this similitude: As the Patriarchs used the
sacrifices of the Gentiles, so ought Christians to use the images of saints
instead of the idols of the Gentiles. They also twisted to the same effect the
words, &#8220;Lord, I have loved the beauty of thy house.&#8221; But the most
ingenious interpretation was the following, &#8220;As we have heard, so also
have we seen;&#8221; therefore, God is known not merely by the hearing of the
word, but also by the seeing of images. Bishop Theodore was equally acute:
&#8220;God,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is to be admired in his saints;&#8221; and it
is elsewhere said, &#8220;To the saints who are on earth;&#8221; therefore this
must refer to images. In short, their absurdities are so extreme that it is
painful even to quote them.<br></div>
<div>15. When they treat of adoration, great stress is laid on the worship of
Pharaoh, the staff of Joseph, and the inscription which Jacob set up. In this
last case they not only pervert the meaning of Scripture, but quote what is
nowhere to be found. Then the passages, &#8220;Worship at his
footstool&#8221;-&#8221;Worship in his holy mountain&#8221;-&#8221;The rulers of
the people will worship before thy face,&#8221; seem to them very solid and
apposite proofs. Were one, with the view of turning the defenders of images into
ridicule, to put words into their mouths, could they be made to utter greater
and grosser absurdities? But to put an end to all doubt on the subject of
images, Theodosius Bishop of Mira confirms the propriety of worshipping them by
the dreams of his archdeacon, which he adduces with as much gravity as if he
were in possession of a response from heaven. Let the patrons of images now go
and urge us with the decree of this Synod, as if the venerable Fathers did not
bring themselves into utter discredit by handling Scripture so childishly, or
wresting it so shamefully and profanely.<br></div>
<div>16. I come now to monstrous impieties, which it is strange they ventured to
utter, and twice strange that all men did not protest against with the utmost
detestation.<sup>9<a name="fnB85" href="#fn85">[1]</a></sup> It is right to
expose this frantic and flagitious extravagance, and thereby deprive the worship
of images of that gloss of antiquity in which Papists seek to deck it.
Theodosius Bishop of Amora fires oft an anathema at all who object to the
worship of images. Another attributes all the calamities of Greece and the East
to the crime of not having worshipped them. Of what punishment then are the
Prophets, Apostles, and Martyrs worthy, in whose day no images existed? They
afterwards add, that if the statue of the Emperor is met with odours and
incense, much more are the images of saints entitled to the honour. Constantius,
Bishop of Constantia in Cyprus, professes to embrace images with reverence, and
declares that he will pay them the respect which is due to the ever blessed
Trinity: every person refusing to do the same thing he anathematises and classes
with Marcionites and Manichees. Lest you should think this the private opinion
of an individual, they all assent. Nay, John the Eastern legate, carried still
farther by his zeal, declares it would be better to allow a city to be filled
with brothels than be denied the worship of images. At last it is resolved with
one consent that the Samaritans are the worst of all heretics, and that the
enemies of images are worse than the Samaritans. But that the play may not pass
off without the accustomed <i>Plaudite</i>, the whole thus concludes,
&#8220;Rejoice and exult, ye who, having the image of Christ, offer sacrifice to
it.&#8221; Where is now the distinction of
<font face="SemiticaDict"><i>latria</i></font> and
<font face="SemiticaDict">dulia</font> with which they would throw dust in all
eyes, human and divine? The Council unreservedly relies as much on images as on
the living God.<sup>9<a name="fnB86" href="#fn86">[2]</a></sup><br></div>

<div>1.	 Scripture, in teaching that there is but one God, does not make a
dispute about words, but attributes all honour and religious worship to him
alone. This proved, 1st, By the etymology of the term. 2d, By the testimony of
God himself, when he declares that he is a jealous God, and will not allow

<div>3.	 Passages of Scripture subversive of the Papistical distinction, and
proving that religious worship is due to God alone. Perversions of Divine
worship.<br></div>
<div>1. WE said at the commencement of our work (chap. 2), that the knowledge of
God consists not in frigid speculation, but carries worship along with it; and
we touched by the way (chap. 5 s. 6, 9, 10) on what will be more copiously
treated in other places (Book 2, chap. 8)-viz. how God is duly worshipped. Now I
only briefly repeat, that whenever Scripture asserts the unity of God, it does
not contend for a mere name, but also enjoins that nothing which belongs to
Divinity be applied to any other; thus making it obvious in what respect pure
religion differs from superstition. The Greek word
<font face="Graeca">eujsevbeia</font> means &#8220;right worship;&#8221; for the
Greeks, though groping in darkness, were always aware that a certain rule was to
be observed, in order that God might not be worshipped absurdly. Cicero truly
and shrewdly derives the name <i>religion</i> from <i>relego</i>, and yet the
reason which he assigns is forced and farfetched-viz. that honest worshipers
<i>read</i> and <i>read again</i>, and ponder what is
true.<sup>9<a name="fnB87" href="#fn87">[3]</a></sup> I rather think the name is
used in opposition to <i>vagrant license</i>-the greater part of mankind rashly
taking up whatever first comes in their way, whereas piety, that it may stand
with a firm step, confines itself within due bounds. In the same way
superstition seems to take its name from its not being contented with the
measure which reason prescribes, but accumulating a superfluous mass of
vanities. But to say nothing more of words, it has been universally admitted in
all ages, that religion is vitiated and perverted whenever false opinions are
introduced into it, and hence it is inferred, that whatever is allowed to be
done from inconsiderate zeal, cannot be defended by any pretext with which the
superstitious may choose to cloak it. But although this confession is in every
man&#8217;s mouth, a shameful stupidity is forthwith manifested, inasmuch as men
neither cleave to the one God, nor use any selection in their worship, as we
have already observed.<br></div>
<div>But God, in vindicating his own right, first proclaims that he is a jealous
God, and will be a stern avenger if he is confounded with any false god; and
thereafter defines what due worship is, in order that the human race may be kept
in obedience. Both of these he embraces in his Law when he first binds the
faithful in allegiance to him as their only Lawgiver, and then prescribes a rule
for worshipping him in accordance with his will. The Law, with its manifold uses
and objects, I will consider in its own place; at present I only advert to this
one, that it is designed as a bridle to curb men, and prevent them from turning
aside to spurious worship. But it is necessary to attend to the observation with
which I set out-viz. that unless everything peculiar to divinity is confined to
God alone, he is robbed of his honour, and his worship is violated.<br></div>
<div>It may be proper here more particularly to attend to the subtleties which
superstition employs. In revolting to strange gods, it avoids the appearance of
abandoning the Supreme God, or reducing him to the same rank with others. It
gives him the highest place, but at the same time surrounds him with a tribe of
minor deities, among whom it portions out his peculiar offices. In this way,
though in a dissembling and crafty manner, the glory of the Godhead is
dissected, and not allowed to remain entire. In the same way the people of old,
both Jews and Gentiles, placed an immense crowd in subordination to the father
and ruler of the gods, and gave them, according to their rank, to share with the
supreme God in the government of heaven and earth. In the same way, too, for
some ages past, departed saints have been exalted to partnership with God, to be
worshipped, invoked, and lauded in his stead. And yet we do not even think that
the majesty of God is obscured by this abomination, whereas it is in a great
measure suppressed and extinguished-all that we retain being a frigid opinion of
his supreme power. At the same time, being deluded by these entanglements, we go
astray after divers gods.<br></div>
<div>2. The distinction of what is called
<font face="SemiticaDict"><i>dulia</i></font> and
<font face="SemiticaDict"><i>latria</i></font> was invented for the very purpose
of permitting divine honours to be paid to angels and dead men with apparent
impunity. For it is plain that the worship which Papists pay to saints differs
in no respect from the worship of God: for this worship is paid without
distinction; only when they are pressed they have recourse to the evasion, that
what belongs to God is kept unimpaired, because they leave him
<font face="SemiticaDict"><i>latria</i></font>. But since the question relates
not to the word, but the thing, how can they be allowed to sport at will with a
matter of the highest moment? But not to insist on this, the utmost they will
obtain by their distinction is, that they give worship to God, and service to
the others. For <font face="Graeca">latrei;a</font> in Greek has the same
meaning as <i>worship</i> in Latin; whereas <font face="Graeca">doulei;a</font>
properly means service, though the words are sometimes used in Scripture
indiscriminately. But granting that the distinction is invariably preserved, the
thing to be inquired into is the meaning of each.
<font face="Graeca">Doulei;a</font> unquestionably means service, and
<font face="Graeca">latrei;a</font> worship. But no man doubts that to
<i>serve</i> is something higher than to <i>worship</i>. For it were often a
hard thing to serve him whom you would not refuse to reverence. It is,
therefore, an unjust division to assign the greater to the saints and leave the
less to God. But several of the ancient fathers observed this distinction. What
if they did, when all men see that it is not only improper, but utterly
frivolous?<br></div>
<div>3. Laying aside subtleties, let us examine the thing. When Paul reminds the
Galatians of what they were before they came to the knowledge of Gods he says
that they &#8220;did service unto them which by nature are no gods,&#8221; (Gal.
4:8). Because he does not say <font face="SemiticaDict"><i>latria</i></font>,
was their superstition excusable? This superstition, to which he gives the name
of <font face="SemiticaDict"><i>dulia</i></font>, he condemns as much as if he
had given it the name of <font face="SemiticaDict"><i>latria</i></font>. When
Christ repels Satan&#8217;s insulting proposal with the words, &#8220;It is
written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou
serve,&#8221; (Mt. 4:10), there was no question of
<font face="SemiticaDict"><i>latria</i></font>. For all that Satan asked was
<font face="Graeca">prosku;nesi"</font> (obeisance). In like manners when John
is rebuked by the angel for falling on his knees before him (Rev. 19:10; 22:8,
9), we ought not to suppose that John had so far forgotten himself as to have
intended to transfer the honour due to God alone to an angel. But because it was
impossible that a worship connected with religion should not savour somewhat of
divine worship, he could not <font face="Graeca">prosku;nei'n</font> (do
obeisance to) the angel without derogating from the glory of God. True, we often
read that men were worshipped; but that was, if I may so speak, civil honour.
The case is different with religious honour, which, the moment it is conjoined
with worship, carries profanation of the divine honour along with it. The same
thing may be seen in the case of Cornelius (Acts 10:25). He had not made so
little progress in piety as not to confine supreme worship to God alone.
Therefore, when he prostrates himself before Peter, he certainly does it not
with the intention of adoring him instead of God. Yet Peter sternly forbids him.
And why, but just because men never distinguish so accurately between the
worship of God and the creatures as not to transfer promiscuously to the
creature that which belongs only to God. Therefore, if we would have one God,
let us remember that we can never appropriate the minutest portion of his glory
without retaining what is his due. Accordingly, when Zechariah discourses
concerning the repairing of the Church, he distinctly says not only that there
would be one God, but also that he would have only one name-the reason being,
that he might have nothing in common with idols. The nature of the worship which
God requires will be seen in its own place (Book 2, c. 7 and 8). He has been
pleased to prescribe in his Law what is lawful and right, and thus restrict men
to a certain rule, lest any should allow themselves to devise a worship of their
own. But as it is inexpedient to burden the reader by mixing up a variety of
topics, I do not now dwell on this one. Let it suffice to remember, that
whatever offices of piety are bestowed anywhere else than on God alone, are of
the nature of sacrilege. First, superstition attached divine honours to the sun
and stars, or to idols: afterwards ambition followed-ambition which, decking man
in the spoils of God, dared to profane all that was sacred. And though the
principle of worshipping a supreme Deity continued to be held, still the
practice was to sacrifice promiscuously to genii and minor gods, or departed
heroes: so prone is the descent to this vice of communicating to a crowd that
which God strictly claims as his own peculiar right!<br></div>

13.</i></b></font></h2>
<div><font size="5">THE UNITY OF THE DIVINE ESSENCE IN THREE PERSONS TAUGHT, IN
SCRIPTURE, FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.</font><br></div>
<div>This chapter consists of two parts. The former delivers the orthodox
doctrine concerning the Holy Trinity. This occupies from sec. 1-21, and may be
divided into four heads; the first, treating of the meaning of Person, including
both the term and the thing meant by it, sec. 2-6; the second, proving the deity
of the Son, sec. 7-13; the third, the deity of the Holy Spirit, sec. 14 and 15;
and the fourth, explaining what is to be held concerning the Holy Trinity. The
second part of the chapter refutes certain heresies which have arisen,
particularly in our age, in opposition to this orthodox doctrine. This occupies
from sec. 21 to the end.<br></div>
<div><i>Sections.</i><br></div>
<div>1.	 Scripture, in teaching that the essence of God is immense and
spiritual, refutes not only idolaters and the foolish wisdom of the world, but
also the Manichees and Anthropomorphites. These latter briefly
refuted.<br></div>
<div>2.	 In this one essence are three persons, yet so that neither is there a
triple God, nor is the simple essence of God divided. Meaning of the word Person
in this discussion. Three hypostases in God, or the essence of God.<br></div>
<div>3.	 Objection of those who, in this discussion, reject the use of the word
Person. Answer 1. That it is not a foreign term, but is employed for the
explanation of sacred mysteries.<br></div>
<div>4.	 Answer continued, 2. The orthodox compelled to use the terms, Trinity,
Subsistence, and Person. Examples from the case of the Asians and
Sabellians.<br></div>
<div>5.	 Answer continued, 3. The ancient Church, though differing somewhat in
the explanation of these terms, agree in substance. Proofs from Hilary, Jerome,
Augustine, in their use of the words Essence, Substance, Hypostasis. 4. Provided
the orthodox meaning is retained, there should be no dispute about mere terms.
But those who object to the terms usually favour the Arian and Sabellian
heresy.<br></div>
<div>6.	 After the definition of the term follows a definition and explanation
of the thing meant by it. The distinction of Persons.<br></div>
<div>7.	 Proofs of the eternal Deity of the Son. The Son the
<font face="Graeca">lovgo"</font> of the Eternal Father, and, therefore, the Son
Eternal God. Objection. Reply.<br></div>
<div>8.	 Objection, that the <font face="Graeca">Lovgo"</font> began to be when
the creating God spoke. Answer confirmed by Scripture and argument.<br></div>
<div>9.	 The Son called God and Jehovah. Other names of the Eternal Father
applied to him in the Old Testament. He is, therefore, the Eternal God. Another
objection refuted. Case of the Jews explained.<br></div>
<div>10.	 The angel who appeared to the fathers under the Law asserts that he is
Jehovah. That angel was the <font face="Graeca">Lovgo"</font> of the Eternal
Father. The Son being that <font face="Graeca">Lovgo"</font> is Eternal God.
Impiety of Servetus refuted. Why the Son appeared in the form of an
angel.<br></div>
<div>11.	 Passages from the New Testament in which the Son is acknowledged to be
the Lord of Hosts, the Judge of the world, the God of glory, the Creator of the
world, the Lord of angels, the King of the Church, the eternal
<font face="Graeca">Lovgo"</font>, God blessed for ever, God manifest in the
flesh, the equal of God, the true God and eternal life, the Lord and God of all
believers. Therefore, the Eternal God.<br></div>
<div>12.	 Christ the Creator, Preserver, Redeemer, and Searcher of hearts.
Therefore, the Eternal God.<br></div>
<div>13.	 Christ, by his own inherent power, wrought miracles, and bestowed the
power of working them on others. Out of the Eternal God there is no salvation,
no righteousness, no life. All these are in Christ. Christ, consequently, is the
Eternal God. He in whom we believe and hope, to whom we pray, whom the Church
acknowledges as the Saviour of the faithful, whom to know is life eternal, in
whom the pious glory, and through whom eternal blessings are communicated, is
the Eternal God. All these Christ is, and, therefore, he is God.<br></div>
<div>14.	 The Divinity of the Spirit proved. I. He is the Creator and Preserver
of the world. II. He sent the Prophets. III. He quickeneth all things. IV. He is
everywhere present. V. He renews the saints, and fits them for eternal life. VI.
All the offices of Deity belong to him.<br></div>
<div>15.	 The Divinity of the Spirit continued. VII. He is called God. VIII.
Blasphemy against him is not forgiven.<br></div>
<div>16.	 What view to be taken of the Trinity. The form of Christian baptism
proves that there are in one essence. The Arian and Macedonian
heresies.<br></div>
<div>17.	 Of the distinction of Persons. They are distinct, but not divided.
This proved.<br></div>
<div>18.	 Analogies taken from human affairs to be cautiously used. Due regard
to be paid to those mentioned by Scripture.<br></div>
<div>19.	 How the Three Persons not only do not destroy, but constitute the most
perfect unity<br></div>
<div>20.	 Conclusion of this part of the chapter, and summary of the true
doctrine concerning the unity of Essence and the Three Persons.<br></div>
<div>21.	 Refutation of Arian, Macedonian, and Anti Trinitarian heresies.
Caution to be observed.<br></div>
<div>22.	 The more modern Anti Trinitarians, and especially Servetus,
refuted.<br></div>
<div>23.	 Other Anti Trinitarians refuted. No good objection that Christ is
called the Son of God, since he is also called God. Impious absurdities of some
heretics.<br></div>
<div>24.	 The name of God sometimes given to the Son absolutely as to the
Father. Same as to other attributes. Objections refuted.<br></div>
<div>25.	 Objections further refuted. Caution to be used.<br></div>
<div>26.	 Previous refutations further explained.<br></div>
<div>27.	 Reply to certain passages produced from Irenaeus. The meaning of
Irenaeus.<br></div>
<div>28.	 Reply to certain passages produced from Tertullian. The meaning of
Tertullian.<br></div>
<div>29.	 Anti Trinitarians refuted by ancient Christian writers; <i>e.g.</i>,
Justin, Hilary. Objections drawn from writings improperly attributed to
Ignatius. Conclusion of the whole discussion concerning the Trinity.<br></div>
<div>1. THE doctrine of Scripture concerning the immensity and the spirituality
of the essence of God, should have the effect not only of dissipating the wild
dreams of the vulgar, but also of refuting the subtleties of a profane
philosophy. One of the ancients thought he spake shrewdly when he said that
everything we see and everything we do not see is God (Senec. Praef. lib. 1
Quaest. Nat.) In this way he fancied that the Divinity was transfused into every
separate portion of the world. But although God, in order to keep us within the
bounds of soberness, treats sparingly of his essence, still, by the two
attributes which I have mentioned, he at once suppresses all gross imaginations,
and checks the audacity of the human mind. His immensity surely ought to deter
us from measuring him by our sense, while his spiritual nature forbids us to
indulge in carnal or earthly speculation concerning him. With the same view he
frequently represents heaven as his dwelling-place. It is true, indeed, that as
he is incomprehensible, he fills the earth also, but knowing that our minds are
heavy and grovel on the earth, he raises us above the worlds that he may shake
off our sluggishness and inactivity. And here we have a refutation of the error
of the Manichees, who, by adopting two first principles, made the devil almost
the equal of God. This, assuredly, was both to destroy his unity and restrict
his immensity. Their attempt to pervert certain passages of Scripture proved
their shameful ignorance, as the very nature of the error did their monstrous
infatuation. The Anthropomorphites also, who dreamed of a corporeal God, because
mouth, ears, eyes, hands, and feet, are often ascribed to him in Scripture, are
easily refuted. For who is so devoid of intellect as not to understand that God,
in so speaking, lisps with us as nurses are wont to do with little children?
Such modes of expression, therefore, do not so much express what kind of a being
God is, as accommodate the knowledge of him to our feebleness. In doing so, he
must, of course, stoop far below his proper height.<sup> </sup><br></div>
<div>2. But there is another special mark by which he designates himself, for
the purpose of giving a more intimate knowledge of his nature. While he
proclaims his unity, he distinctly sets it before us as existing in three
persons. These we must hold, unless the bare and empty name of Deity merely is
to flutter in our brain without any genuine knowledge. Moreover, lest any one
should dream of a threefold God, or think that the simple essence is divided by
the three Persons, we must here seek a brief and easy definition which may
effectually guard us from error. But as some strongly inveigh against the term
Person as being merely of human inventions let us first consider how far they
have any ground for doing so.<br></div>
<div>When the Apostle calls the Son of God &#8220;the express image of his
person,&#8221; (Heb. 1:3), he undoubtedly does assign to the Father some
subsistence in which he differs from the Son. For to hold with some interpreters
that the term is equivalent to essence (as if Christ represented the substance
of the Father like the impression of a seal upon wax), were not only harsh but
absurd. For the essence of God being simple and undivided, and contained in
himself entire, in full perfection, without partition or diminution, it is
improper, nay, ridiculous, to call it his express image
(<font face="Graeca">carakter</font>). But because the Father, though
distinguished by his own peculiar properties, has expressed himself wholly in
the Son, he is said with perfect reason to have rendered his person (hypostasis)
manifest in him. And this aptly accords with what is immediately added-viz. that
he is &#8220;the brightness of his glory.&#8221; The fair inference from the
Apostle&#8217;s words is, that there is a proper subsistence (hypostasis) of the
Father, which shines refulgent in the Son. From this, again it is easy to infer
that there is a subsistence (hypostasis) of the Son which distinguishes him from
the Father. The same holds in the case of the Holy Spirit; for we will
immediately prove both that he is God, and that he has a separate subsistence
from the Father. This, moreover, is not a distinction of essence, which it were
impious to multiply. If credit, then, is given to the Apostle&#8217;s testimony,
it follows that there are three persons (hypostases) in God. The Latins having
used the word <i>Persona</i> to express the same thing as the Greek
<font face="Graeca">uJpovstati"</font>, it betrays excessive fastidiousness and
even perverseness to quarrel with the term. The most literal translation would
be <i>subsistence</i>. Many have used <i>substance</i> in the same sense. Nor,
indeed, was the use of the term Person confined to the Latin Church. For the
Greek Church in like manner, perhaps, for the purpose of testifying their
consent, have taught that there are three <font face="Graeca">provswpa</font>
(<i>aspects</i>) in God. All these, however, whether Greeks or Latins, though
differing as to the word, are perfectly agreed in substance.<br></div>
<div>3. Now, then, though heretics may snarl and the excessively fastidious carp
at the word Person as inadmissible, in consequence of its human origin, since
they cannot displace us from our position that three are named, each of whom is
perfect God, and yet that there is no plurality of gods, it is most uncandid to
attack the terms which do nothing more than explain what the Scriptures declare
and sanction. &#8220;It were better,&#8221; they say, &#8220;to confine not only
our meanings but our words within the bounds of Scripture, and not scatter about
foreign terms to become the future seed-beds of brawls and dissensions. In this
way, men grow tired of quarrels about words; the truth is lost in altercation,
and charity melts away amid hateful strife.&#8221; If they call it a
<i>foreign</i> term, because it cannot be pointed out in Scripture in so many
syllables, they certainly impose an unjust law-a law which would condemn every
interpretation of Scripture that is not composed of other words of Scripture.
But if by <i>foreign</i> they mean that which, after being idly devised, is
superstitiously defended,-which tends more to strife than edification,-which is
used either out of place, or with no benefit which offends pious ears by its
harshness, and leads them away from the simplicity of God&#8217;s Word, I
embrace their soberness with all my heart. For I think we are bound to speak of
God as reverently as we are bound to think of him. As our own thoughts
respecting him are foolish, so our own language respecting him is absurd. Still,
however, some medium must be observed. The unerring standard both of thinking
and speaking must be derived from the Scriptures: by it all the thoughts of ours
minds, and the words of our mouths, should he tested. But in regard to those
parts of Scripture which, to our capacities, are dark and intricate, what
forbids us to explain them in clearer terms-terms, however, kept in reverent and
faithful subordination to Scripture truth, used sparingly and modestly, and not
without occasion? Of this we are not without many examples. When it has been
proved that the Church was impelled, by the strongest necessity, to use the
words Trinity and Person, will not he who still inveighs against novelty of
terms be deservedly suspected of taking offence at the light of truth, and of
having no other ground for his invective, than that the truth is made plain and
transparent?<br></div>
<div>4. Such novelty (if novelty it should be called) becomes most requisite,
when the truth is to be maintained against calumniators who evade it by
quibbling. Of this, we of the present day have too much experience in being
constantly called upon to attack the enemies of pure and sound doctrine. These
slippery snakes escape by their swift and tortuous windings, if not strenuously
pursued, and when caught, firmly held. Thus the early Christians, when harassed
with the disputes which heresies produced, were forced to declare their
sentiments in terms most scrupulously exact in order that no indirect
subterfuges might remain to ungodly men, to whom ambiguity of expression was a
kind of hiding-place. Arius confessed that Christ was God, and the Son of God;
because the passages of Scripture to this effect were too clear to be resisted,
and then, as if he had done well, pretended to concur with others. But,
meanwhile, he ceased not to give out that Christ was created, and had a
beginning like other creatures. To drag this man of wiles out of his
lurking-places, the ancient Church took a further step, and declared that Christ
is the eternal Son of the Father, and consubstantial with the Father. The
impiety was fully disclosed when the Arians began to declare their hatred and
utter detestation of the term <font face="Graeca">oJmoouvsio"</font>. Had their
first confession-viz. that Christ was God, been sincere and from the heart, they
would not have denied that he was consubstantial with the Father. Who dare
charge those ancient writers as men of strife and contention, for having debated
so warmly, and disturbed the quiet of the Church for a single word? That little
word distinguished between Christians of pure faith and the blasphemous Arians.
Next Sabellius arose, who counted the names of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, as
almost nonentities; maintaining that they were not used to mark out some
distinction, but that they were different attributes of God, like many others of
a similar kind. When the matter was debated, he acknowledged his belief that the
Father was God, the Son God, the Spirit God; but then he had the evasion ready,
that he had said nothing more than if he had called God powerful, and just, and
wise. Accordingly, he sung another note-viz. that the Father was the Son, and
the Holy Spirit the Father, without order or distinction. The worthy doctors who
then had the interests of piety at heart, in order to defeat it is man&#8217;s
dishonesty, proclaimed that three subsistence were to be truly acknowledged in
the one God. That they might protect themselves against tortuous craftiness by
the simple open truth, they affirmed that a Trinity of Persons subsisted in the
one God, or (which is the same thing) in the unity of God.<br></div>
<div>5. Where names have not been invented rashly, we must beware lest we become
chargeable with arrogance and rashness in rejecting them. I wish, indeed, that
such names were buried, provided all would concur in the belief that the Father,
Son, and Spirit, are one God, and yet that the Son is not the Father, nor the
Spirit the Son, but that each has his peculiar subsistence. I am not so minutely
precise as to fight furiously for mere words. For I observe, that the writers of
the ancient Church, while they uniformly spoke with great reverence on these
matters, neither agreed with each other, nor were always consistent with
themselves. How strange the formula used by Councils, and defended by Hilary!
How extravagant the view which Augustine sometimes takes! How unlike the Greeks
are to the Latins! But let one example of variance suffice. The Latins, in
translating <font face="Graeca">oJmoouvsio"</font> used consubstantialis
(consubstantial), intimating that there was one substance of the Father and the
Son, and thus using the word Substance for Essence. Hence Jerome, in his Letter
to Damasus, says it is profane to affirm that there are three substances in God.
But in Hilary you will find it said more than a hundred times that there are
three substances in God. Then how greatly is Jerome perplexed with the word
Hypostasis! He suspects some lurking poison, when it is said that there are
three Hypostases in God. And he does not disguise his belief that the
expression, though used in a pious sense, is improper; if, indeed, he was
sincere in saying this, and did not rather designedly endeavour, by an unfounded
calumny, to throw odium on the Eastern bishops whom he hated. He certainly shows
little candour in asserting, that in all heathen schools
<font face="Graeca">oujsiva</font> is equivalent to Hypostasis-an assertion
completely refuted by trite and common use.<br></div>
<div>More courtesy and moderation is shown by Augustine (De Trinit. lib. 5 c. 8
and 9), who, although he says that Hypostasis in this sense is new to Latin
ears, is still so far from objecting to the ordinary use of the term by the
Greeks, that he is even tolerant of the Latins, who had imitated the Greek
phraseology. The purport of what Socrates says of the term, in the Sixth Book of
the Tripartite History, is, that it had been improperly applied to this purpose
by the unskilful. Hilary (De Trinitat. lib. 2) charges it upon the heretics as a
great crime, that their misconduct had rendered it necessary to subject to the
peril of human utterance things which ought to have been reverently confined
within the mind, not disguising his opinion that those who do so, do what is
unlawful, speak what is ineffable, and pry into what is forbidden. Shortly
after, he apologises at great length for presuming to introduce new terms. For,
after putting down the natural names of Father, Son, and Spirit, he adds, that
all further inquiry transcends the significance of words, the discernment of
sense, and the apprehension of intellect. And in another place (De Conciliis),
he congratulates the Bishops of France in not having framed any other
confession, but received, without alteration, the ancient and most simple
confession received by all Churches from the days of the Apostles. Not unlike
this is the apology of Augustine, that the term had been wrung from him by
necessity from the poverty of human language in so high a matter: not that the
reality could be thereby expressed, but that he might not pass on in silence
without attempting to show how the Father, Son, and Spirit, are three.<br></div>
<div>The modesty of these holy men should be an admonition to us not instantly
to dip our pen in gall, and sternly denounce those who may be unwilling to swear
to the terms which we have devised, provided they do not in this betray pride,
or petulance, or unbecoming heat, but are willing to ponder the necessity which
compels us so to speak, and may thus become gradually accustomed to a useful
form of expression. Let men also studiously beware, that in opposing the Asians
on the one hand, and the Sabellians on the other, and eagerly endeavouring to
deprive both of any handle for cavil, they do not bring themselves under some
suspicion of being the disciples of either Arius or Sabellius. Arius says that
<i>Christ is God</i>, and then mutters that <i>he was made and had a
beginning</i>. He says, that <i>he is one with the Father</i>; but secretly
whispers in the ears of his party, <i>made one</i>, like other believers, though
with special privilege. Say, <i>he is consubstantial</i>, and you immediately
pluck the mask from this chameleon, though you add nothing to Scripture.
Sabellius says that <i>the Father, Son, and Spirit, indicate some distinction in
God</i>. Say, <i>they are three</i>, and he will bawl out that you are making
three Gods. Say, that <i>there is a Trinity of Persons in one Divine
essence</i>, you will only express in one word what the Scriptures say, and stop
his empty prattle. Should any be so superstitiously precise as not to tolerate
these terms, still do their worst, they will not be able to deny that when
<i>one</i> is spoken of, a unity of substance must be understood, and when
<i>three</i> in one essence, the persons in this Trinity are denoted. When this
is confessed without equivocations we dwell not on words. But I was long ago
made aware, and, indeed, on more than one occasion, that those who contend
pertinaciously about words are tainted with some hidden poison; and, therefore,
that it is more expedient to provoke them purposely, than to court their favour
by speaking obscurely.<br></div>
<div>6. But to say nothing more of words, let us now attend to the thing
signified. By <i>person</i>, then, I mean a subsistence in the Divine essence,-a
subsistence which, while related to the other two, is distinguished from them by
incommunicable properties. By <i>subsistence</i> we wish something else to be
understood than <i>essence</i>. For if the Word were God simply and had not some
property peculiar to himself, John could not have said correctly that he had
always been with God. When he adds immediately after, that the Word was God, he
calls us back to the one essence. But because he could not be with God without
dwelling in the Father, hence arises that subsistence, which, though connected
with the essence by an indissoluble tie, being incapable of separation, yet has
a special mark by which it is distinguished from it. Now, I say that each of the
three subsistences while related to the others is distinguished by its own
properties. Here relation is distinctly expressed, because, when God is
mentioned simply and indefinitely the name belongs not less to the Son and
Spirit than to the Father. But whenever the Father is compared with the Son, the
peculiar property of each distinguishes the one from the other. Again, whatever
is proper to each I affirm to be incommunicable, because nothing can apply or be
transferred to the Son which is attributed to the Father as a mark of
distinction. I have no objections to adopt the definition of Tertullian,
provided it is properly understood, &#8220;that there is in God a certain
arrangement or economy, which makes no change on the unity of
essence.&#8221;-Tertull. Lib. contra Praxeam.<br></div>
<div>7. Before proceeding farther, it will be necessary to prove the divinity of
the Son and the Holy Spirit. Thereafter, we shall see how they differ from each
other. When the Word of God is set before us in the Scriptures, it were
certainly most absurd to imagine that it is only a fleeting and evanescent
voice, which is sent out into the air, and comes forth beyond God himself, as
was the case with the communications made to the patriarchs, and all the
prophecies. The reference is rather to the wisdom ever dwelling with God, and by
which all oracles and prophecies were inspired. For, as Peter testifies (1 Pet.
1:11), the ancient prophets spake by the Spirit of Christ just as did the
apostles, and all who after them were ministers of the heavenly doctrine. But as
Christ was not yet manifested, we necessarily understand that the Word was
begotten of the Father before all ages. But if that Spirit, whose organs the
prophets were, belonged to the Word, the inference is irresistible, that the
Word was truly God. And this is clearly enough shown by Moses in his account of
the creation, where he places the Word as intermediate. For why does he
distinctly narrate that God, in creating each of his works, said, Let there be
this-let there be that, unless that the unsearchable glory of God might shine
forth in his image? I know prattlers would easily evade this, by saying that
<i>Word</i> is used for <i>order</i> or <i>command</i>; but the apostles are
better expositors, when they tell us that the worlds were created by the Son,
and that he sustains all things by his mighty word (Heb. 1:2). For we here see
that <i>word</i> is used for the nod or command of the Son, who is himself the
eternal and essential Word of the Father. And no man of sane mind can have any
doubt as to Solomon&#8217;s meaning, when he introduces Wisdom as begotten by
God, and presiding at the creation of the world, and all other divine operations
(Prov. 8:22). For it were trifling and foolish to imagine any temporary command
at a time when God was pleased to execute his fixed and eternal counsel, and
something more still mysterious. To this our Saviour&#8217;s words refer,
&#8220;My Father worketh hitherto, and I work,&#8221; (John 5:17). In thus
affirming, that from the foundation of the world he constantly worked with the
Father, he gives a clearer explanation of what Moses simply touched. The meaning
therefore is, that God spoke in such a manner as left the Word his peculiar part
in the work, and thus made the operation common to both. But the clearest
explanation is given by John, when he states that the Word-which was from the
beginning, God and with God, was, together with God the Father, the maker of all
things. For he both attributes a substantial and permanent essence to the Word,
assigning to it a certain peculiarity, and distinctly showing how God spoke the
world into being. Therefore, as all revelations from heaven are duly designated
by the title of the Word of God, so the highest place must be assigned to that
substantial Word, the source of all inspiration, which, as being liable to no
variation, remains for ever one and the same with God, and is God.<br></div>
<div>8. Here an outcry is made by certain men, who, while they dare not openly
deny his divinity, secretly rob him of his eternity. For they contend that the
Word only began to be when God opened his sacred mouth in the creation of the
world. Thus, with excessive temerity, they imagine some change in the essence of
God. For as the names of God, which have respect to external work, began to be
ascribed to him from the existence of the work (as when he is called the Creator
of heaven and earth), so piety does not recognise or admit any name which might
indicate that a change had taken place in God himself. For if any thing
adventitious took place, the saying of James would cease to be true, that
&#8220;every good gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, and cometh down
from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of
turning,&#8221; (James 1:17). Nothing, therefore, is more intolerable than to
fancy a beginning to that Word which was always God, and afterwards was the
Creator of the world. But they think they argue acutely, in maintaining that
Moses, when he says that God then spoke for the first time, must be held to
intimate that till then no Word existed in him. This is the merest trifling. It
does not surely follow, that because a thing begins to be manifested at a
certain time, it never existed previously. I draw a very different conclusion.
Since at the very moment when God said, &#8220;Let there be light,&#8221; the
energy of the Word-was immediately exerted, it must have existed long before. If
any inquire how long, he will find it was without beginning. No certain period
of time is defined, when he himself says, &#8220;Now O Father, glorify thou me
with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world
was,&#8221; (John 17:5). Nor is this omitted by John: for before he descends to
the creation of the world, he says, that &#8220;in the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God.&#8221; We, therefore, again conclude, that the Word
was eternally begotten by God, and dwelt with him from everlasting. In this way,
his true essence, his eternity, and divinity, are established.<br></div>
<div>9. But though I am not now treating of the office of the Mediator, having
deferred it till the subject of redemption is considered, yet because it ought
to be clear and incontrovertible to all, that Christ is that Word become
incarnate, this seems the most appropriate place to introduce those passages
which assert the Divinity of Christ. When it is said in the forty-fifth Psalm,
&#8220;Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever,&#8221; the Jews quibble that the
name Elohim is applied to angels and sovereign powers. But no passage is to be
found in Scripture, where an eternal throne is set up for a creature. For he is
not called God simply, but also the eternal Ruler. Besides, the title is not
conferred on any man, without some addition, as when it is said that Moses would
be a God to Pharaoh (Exod. 7:1). Some read as if it were in the genitive case,
but this is too insipid. I admit, that anything possessed of singular excellence
is often called divine, but it is clear from the context, that this meaning here
were harsh and forced, and totally inapplicable. But if their perverseness still
refuses to yield, surely there is no obscurity in Isaiah, where Christ is
introduced both us God, and as possessed of supreme powers one of the peculiar
attributes of God, &#8220;His name shall be called the Mighty God, the
Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace,&#8221; (Isa. 9:6). Here, too, the Jews
object, and invert the passage thus, This is the name by which the mighty God,
the Everlasting Father, will call him; so that all which they leave to the Son
is, &#8220; Prince of Peace.&#8221; But why should so many epithets be here
accumulated on God the Father, seeing the prophet&#8217;s design is to present
the Messiah with certain distinguished properties which may induce us to put our
faith in him? There can be no doubt, therefore, that he who a little before was
called Emmanuel, is here called the Mighty God. Moreover, there can be nothing
clearer than the words of Jeremiah, &#8220;This is the name whereby he shall be
called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS,&#8221; (Jer. 23:6). For as the Jews
themselves teach that the other names of God are mere epithets, whereas this,
which they call the ineffable name, is substantive, and expresses his essence,
we infer, that the only begotten Son is the eternal God, who elsewhere declares,
&#8220;My glory will I not give to another,&#8221; (Isa. 42:8). An attempt is
made to evade this from the fact, that this name is given by Moses to the altar
which he built, and by Ezekiel to the New Jerusalem. But who sees not that the
altar was erected as a memorial to show that God was the exalter of Moses, and
that the name of God was applied to Jerusalem, merely to testify the Divine
presence? For thus the prophet speaks, &#8220;The name of the city from that day
shall be, The Lord is there,&#8221; (Ezek. 48:35). In the same way, &#8220;Moses
built an altar, and called the name of it JEHOVAH-nissi,&#8221; (Jehovah my
exaltation). But it would seem the point is still more keenly disputed as to
another passage in Jeremiah, where the same title is applied to Jerusalem in
these words, &#8220;In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall
dwell safely; and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The Lord our
Righteousness.&#8221; But so far is this passage from being adverse to the truth
which we defend, that it rather supports it. The prophet having formerly
declared that Christ is the true Jehovah from whom righteousness flows, now
declares that the Church would be made so sensible of this as to be able to
glory in assuming his very name. In the former passage, therefore, the fountain
and cause of righteousness is set down, in the latter, the effect is
described.<br></div>
<div>10. But if this does not satisfy the Jews, I know not what cavils will
enable them to evade the numerous passages in which Jehovah is said to have
appeared in the form of an Angel (Judges 6:7; 13:16-23, &amp;c). This Angel
claims for himself the name of the Eternal God. Should it be alleged that this
is done in respect of the office which he bears, the difficulty is by no means
solved. No servant would rob God of his honour, by allowing sacrifice to be
offered to himself. But the Angel, by refusing to eat bread, orders the
sacrifice due to Jehovah to be offered to him. Thus the fact itself proves that
he was truly Jehovah. Accordingly, Manoah and his wife infer from the sign, that
they had seen not only an angel, but God. Hence Manoah&#8217;s exclamation,
&#8220;We shall die; for we have seen the Lord.&#8221; When the woman replies,
&#8220;If Jehovah had wished to slay us, he would not have received the
sacrifice at our hand,&#8221; she acknowledges that he who is previously called
an angel was certainly God. We may add, that the angel&#8217;s own reply removes
all doubt, &#8220;Why do ye ask my name, which is wonderful?&#8221; Hence the
impiety of Servetus was the more detestable, when he maintained that God was
never manifested to Abraham and the Patriarchs, but that an angel was worshipped
in his stead. The orthodox doctors of the Church have correctly and wisely
expounded, that the Word of God was the supreme angel, who then began, as it
were by anticipation, to perform the office of Mediator. For though he were not
clothed with flesh, yet he descended as in an intermediate form, that he might
have more familiar access to the faithful. This closer intercourse procured for
him the name of the Angel; still, however, he retained the character which
justly belonged to him-that of the God of ineffable glory. The same thing is
intimated by Hosea, who, after mentioning the wrestling of Jacob with the angel,
says, &#8220;Even the Lord God of hosts; the Lord is his memorial,&#8221; (Hosea
12:5). Servetus again insinuates that God personated an angel; as if the prophet
did not confirm what had been said by Moses, &#8220;Wherefore is it that thou
dost ask after my name?&#8221; (Gen. 32:29, 30). And the confession of the holy
Patriarch sufficiently declares that he was not a created angel, but one in whom
the fulness of the Godhead dwelt, when he says, &#8220;I have seen God face to
face.&#8221; Hence also Paul&#8217;s statement, that Christ led the people in
the wilderness (1 Cor. 10:4. See also Calvin on Acts 7:30, and <i>infra</i>,
chap. 14, s. 9). Although the time of humiliation had not yet arrived, the
eternal Word exhibited a type of the office which he was to fulfil. Again, if
the first chapter of Zechariah (ver. 9, &amp;c). and the second (ver. 3,
&amp;c). be candidly considered, it will be seen that the angel who sends the
other angel is immediately after declared to be the Lord of hosts, and that
supreme power is ascribed to him. I omit numberless passages in which our faith
rests secure, though they may not have much weight with the Jews. For when it is
said in Isaiah, &#8220;Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will
save us; this is the Lord: we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice
in his salvation,&#8221; (Isa. 25:9), even the blind may see that the God
referred to is he who again rises up for the deliverance of his people. And the
emphatic description, twice repeated, precludes the idea that reference is made
to any other than to Christ. Still clearer and stronger is the passage of
Malachi, in which a promise is made that the messenger who was then expected
would come to his own temple (Mal. 3:1). The temple certainly was dedicated to
Almighty God only, and yet the prophet claims it for Christ. Hence it follows,
that he is the God who was always worshipped by the Jews.<br></div>
<div>11. The New Testament teems with innumerable passages, and our object must
therefore be, the selection of a few, rather than an accumulation of the whole.
But though the Apostles spoke of him after his appearance in the flesh as
Mediator, every passage which I adduce will be sufficient to prove his eternal
Godhead. And the first thing deserving of special observation is that
predictions concerning the eternal God are applied to Christ, as either already
fulfilled in him, or to be fulfilled at some future period. Isaiah prophesies,
that &#8220;the Lord of Hosts&#8221; shall be &#8220;for a stone of stumbling,
and for a rock of offence,&#8221; (Isa. 8:14). Paul asserts that this prophecy
was fulfilled in Christ (Rom. 9:33), and, therefore, declares that Christ is
that Lord of Hosts. In like manner, he says in another passage, &#8220;We shall
all stand before the Judgment-seat of Christ. For it is written, As I live,
saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to
God.&#8221; Since in Isaiah God predicts this of himself (Isa. 45:23), and
Christ exhibits the reality fulfilled in himself, it follows that he is the very
God, whose glory cannot be given to another. It is clear also, that the passage
from the Psalms (Ps. 68:19) which he quotes in the Epistle to the Ephesians, is
applicable only to God, &#8220;When he ascended up on high, he led captivity
captive,&#8221; (Eph. 4:8). Understanding that such an ascension was shadowed
forth when the Lord exerted his power, and gained a glorious victory over
heathen nations, he intimates that what was thus shadowed was more fully
manifested in Christ. So John testifies that it was the glory of the Son which
was revealed to Isaiah in a vision (John 12:41; Isa. 6:4), though Isaiah himself
expressly says that what he saw was the Majesty of God. Again, there can be no
doubt that those qualities which, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, are applied to
the Son, are the brightest attributes of God, &#8220;Thou, Lord, in the
beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth,&#8221; &amp;c., and, &#8220;Let
all the angels of God worship him,&#8221; (Heb. 1:10, 6). And yet he does not
pervert the passages in thus applying them to Christ, since Christ alone
performed the things which these passages celebrate. It was he who arose and
pitied Zion-he who claimed for himself dominion over all nations and islands.
And why should John have hesitated to ascribe the Majesty of God to Christ,
after saying in his preface that the Word was God? (John 1:14). Why should Paul
have feared to place Christ on the Judgment-seat of God (2 Cor. 5:10), after he
had so openly proclaimed his divinity, when he said that he was God over all,
blessed for ever? And to show how consistent he is in this respect, he elsewhere
says that &#8220;God was manifest in the flesh,&#8221; (1 Tim. 3:16). If he is
God blessed for ever, he therefore it is to whom alone, as Paul affirms in
another place, all glory and honour is due. Paul does not disguise this, but
openly exclaims, that &#8220;being in the form of God (he) thought it not
robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation,&#8221; (Phil.
2:6). And lest the wicked should glamour and say that he was a kind of spurious
God, John goes farther, and affirms, &#8220;This is the true God, and eternal
life.&#8221; Though it ought to be enough for us that he is called God,
especially by a witness who distinctly testifies that we have no more gods than
one, Paul says, &#8220;Though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven
or in earth (as there be gods many, and lords many), but to us there is but one
God,&#8221; (1 Cor. 8:5, 6). When we hear from the same lips that God was
manifest in the flesh, that God purchased the Church with his own blood, why do
we dream of any second God, to whom he makes not the least allusion? And there
is no room to doubt that all the godly entertained the same view. Thomas, by
addressing him as his Lord and God, certainly professes that he was the only God
whom he had ever adored (John 20:28).<br></div>
<div>12. The divinity of Christ, if judged by the works which are ascribed to
him in Scripture, becomes still more evident. When he said of himself, &#8220;My
Father worketh hitherto, and I work,&#8221; the Jews, though most dull in regard
to his other sayings, perceived that he was laying claim to divine power. And,
therefore, as John relates (John 5:17), they sought the more to kill him,
because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also said that God was his Father,
making himself equal with God. What, then, will be our stupidity if we do not
perceive from the same passage that his divinity is plainly instructed? To
govern the world by his power and providence, and regulate all things by an
energy inherent in himself (this an Apostle ascribes to him, Heb. 1:3), surely
belongs to none but the Creator. Nor does he merely share the government of the
world with the Father, but also each of the other offices, which cannot be
communicated to creatures. The Lord proclaims by his prophets &#8220;I, even I,
am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake,&#8221; (Is.
43:25). When, in accordance with this declaration, the Jews thought that
injustice was done to God when Christ forgave sins, he not only asserted, in
distinct terms, that this power belonged to him, but also proved it by a miracle
(Mt. 9:6). We thus see that he possessed in himself not the ministry of
forgiving sins, but the inherent power which the Lord declares he will not give
to another. What! Is it not the province of God alone to penetrate and
interrogate the secret thoughts of the heart? But Christ also had this power,
and therefore we infer that Christ is God.<br></div>
<div>13. How clearly and transparently does this appear in his miracles? I admit
that similar and equal miracles were performed by the prophets and apostles; but
there is this very essential difference, that they dispensed the gifts of God as
his ministers, whereas he exerted his own inherent might. Sometimes, indeed, he
used prayer, that he might ascribe glory to the Father, but we see that for the
most part his own proper power is displayed. And how should not he be the true
author of miracles, who, of his own authority, commissions others to perform
them? For the Evangelist relates that he gave power to the apostles to cast out
devils, cure the lepers, raise the dead, &amp;c. And they, by the mode in which
they performed this ministry, showed plainly that their whole power was derived
from Christ. &#8220;In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,&#8221; says Peter
(Acts 3:6), &#8220;rise up and walk.&#8221; It is not surprising, then, that
Christ appealed to his miracles in order to subdue the unbelief of the Jews,
inasmuch as these were performed by his own energy, and therefore bore the most
ample testimony to his divinity.<br></div>
<div>Again, if out of God there is no salvation, no righteousness, no life,
Christ, having all these in himself, is certainly God. Let no one object that
life or salvation is transfused into him by God. For it is said not that he
received, but that he himself is salvation. And if there is none good but God,
how could a mere man be pure, how could he be, I say not good and just, but
goodness and justice? Then what shall we say to the testimony of the Evangelist,
that from the very beginning of the creation &#8220;in him was life, and this
life was the light of men?&#8221; Trusting to such proofs, we can boldly put our
hope and faith in him, though we know it is blasphemous impiety to confide in
any creature.<sup>9<a name="fnB88" href="#fn88">[4]</a></sup> &#8220;Ye believe
in God,&#8221;<sup>9<a name="fnB89" href="#fn89">[5]</a></sup> says he,
&#8220;believe also in me,&#8221; (John 14:1). And so Paul (Rom. 10:11, and
15:12) interprets two passages of Isaiah &#8220;Whose believeth in him shall not
be confounded,&#8221; (Isa. 28:16); and, &#8220;In that day there shall be a
root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the
Gentiles seek,&#8221; (Isa. 11:10). But why adduce more passages of Scripture on
this head, when we so often meet with the expression, &#8220;He that believeth
in me has eternal life?&#8221;<br></div>
<div>Again, the prayer of faith is addressed to him-prayer, which specially
belongs to the divine majesty, if anything so belongs. For the Prophet Joel
says, &#8220;And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of
the Lord (Jehovah) shall be delivered&#8221; (Joel 2:32). And another says,
&#8220;The name of the Lord (Jehovah) is a strong tower; the righteous runneth
into it and is safe,&#8221; (Prov. 18:10). But the name of Christ is invoked for
salvation, and therefore it follows that he is Jehovah. Moreover, we have an
example of invocation in Stephen, when he said, &#8220;Lord Jesus, receive my
spirit;&#8221; and thereafter in the whole Church, when Ananias says in the same
book, &#8220;Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he has done
to thy saints at Jerusalem; and here he has authority from the chief priests to
bind all that call on thy name,&#8221; (Acts 9:13, 14). And to make it more
clearly understood that in Christ dwelt the whole fulness of the Godhead bodily,
the Apostle declares that the only doctrine which he professed to the
Corinthians, the only doctrine which he taught, was the knowledge of Christ (1
Cor. 2:2). Consider what kind of thing it is, and how great, that the name of
the Son alone is preached to us, though God command us to glory only in the
knowledge of himself (Jer. 9:24). Who will dare to maintain that he, whom to
know forms our only ground of glorying, is a mere creature? To this we may add,
that the salutations prefixed to the Epistles of Paul pray for the same
blessings from the Son as from the Father. By this we are taught, not only that
the blessings which our heavenly Father bestows come to us through his
intercession, but that by a partnership in power, the Son himself is their
author. This practical knowledge is doubtless surer and more solid than any idle
speculation. For the pious soul has the best view of God, and may almost be said
to handle him, when it feels that it is quickened, enlightened, saved,
justified, and sanctified by him.<br></div>
<div>14. In asserting the divinity of the Spirit, the proof must be derived from
the same sources. And it is by no means an obscure testimony which Moses bears
in the history of the creation, when he says that the Spirit of God was expanded
over the abyss or shapeless matter; for it shows not only that the beauty which
the world displays is maintained by the invigorating power of the Spirit, but
that even before this beauty existed the Spirit was at work cherishing the
confused mass.<sup>9<a name="fnB90" href="#fn90">[6]</a></sup> Again, no cavils
can explain away the force of what Isaiah says, &#8220;And now the Lord God, and
his Spirit, has sent me,&#8221; (Isa. 48:16), thus ascribing a share in the
sovereign power of sending the prophets to the Holy Spirit. (Calvin in Acts
20:28). In this his divine majesty is clear.<br></div>
<div>But, as I observed, the best proof to us is our familiar experience. For
nothing can be more alien from a creature, than the office which the Scriptures
ascribe to him, and which the pious actually feel him discharging,-his being
diffused over all space, sustaining, invigorating, and quickening all things,
both in heaven and on the earth. The mere fact of his not being circumscribed by
any limits raises him above the rank of creatures, while his transfusing vigour
into all things, breathing into them being, life, and motion, is plainly divine.
Again, if regeneration to incorruptible life is higher, and much more excellent
than any present quickening, what must be thought of him by whose energy it is
produced? Now, many passages of Scripture show that he is the author of
regeneration, not by a borrowed, but by an intrinsic energy; and not only so,
but that he is also the author of future immortality. In short, all the peculiar
attributes of the Godhead are ascribed to him in the same way as to the Son. He
searches the deep things of Gods and has no counsellor among the creatures; he
bestows wisdom and the faculty of speech, though God declares to Moses (Exod.
4:11) that this is his own peculiar province. In like manner, by means of him we
become partakers of the divine nature, so as in a manner to feel his quickening
energy within us. Our justification is his work; from him is power,
sanctification, truth, grace, and every good thought, since it is from the
Spirit alone that all good gifts proceed. Particular attention is due to
Paul&#8217;s expression, that though there are diversities of gifts, &#8220;all
these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit,&#8221; (1 Cor. 12:11), he being
not only the beginning or origin, but also the
author;<sup>9<a name="fnB91" href="#fn91">[7]</a></sup> as is even more clearly
expressed immediately after in these words &#8220;dividing to every man
severally as he will.&#8221; For were he not something subsisting in God, will
and arbitrary disposal would never be ascribed to him. Most clearly, therefore
does Paul ascribe divine power to the Spirit, and demonstrate that he dwells
hypostatically in God.<br></div>
<div>15. Nor does the Scripture, in speaking of him, withhold the name of God.
Paul infers that we are the temple of God, from the fact that &#8220;the Spirit
of God dwelleth in us,&#8221; (1 Cor. 3:16; 6:19; and 2 Cor. 6:16). Now it ought
not to be slightly overlooked, that all the promises which God makes of choosing
us to himself as a temple, receive their only fulfilment by his Spirit dwelling
in us. Surely, as it is admirably expressed by Augustine (Ad Maximinum, Ep. 66),
&#8220;were we ordered to make a temple of wood and stone to the Spirit,
inasmuch as such worship is due to God alone, it would be a clear proof of the
Spirit&#8217;s divinity; how much clearer a proof in that we are not to make a
temple to him, but to be ourselves that temple.&#8221; And the Apostle says at
one time that we are the temple of God, and at another time, in the same sense,
that we are the temple of the Holy Spirit. Peter, when he rebuked Ananias for
having lied to the Holy Spirit, said, that he had not lied unto men, but unto
God. And when Isaiah had introduced the Lord of Hosts as speaking, Paul says, it
was the Holy Spirit that spoke (Acts 28:25, 26). Nay, words uniformly said by
the prophets to have been spoken by the Lord of Hosts, are by Christ and his
apostles ascribed to the Holy Spirit. Hence it follows that the Spirit is the
true Jehovah who dictated the prophecies. Again, when God complains that he was
provoked to anger by the stubbornness of the people, in place of Him, Isaiah
says that his Holy Spirit was grieved (Isa. 63:10). Lastly, while blasphemy
against the Spirit is not forgiven, either in the present life or that which is
to come, whereas he who has blasphemed against the Son may obtain pardon, that
majesty must certainly be divine which it is an inexpiable crime to offend or
impair. I designedly omit several passages which the ancient fathers adduced.
They thought it plausible to quote from David, &#8220;By the word of the Lord
were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath (Spirit) of his
mouth,&#8221; (Ps. 33:6), in order to prove that the world was not less the work
of the Holy Spirit than of the Son. But seeing it is usual in the Psalms to
repeat the same thing twice, and in Isaiah the <i>spirit</i> (breath) of the
mouth is equivalent to <i>word</i>, that proof was weak; and, accordingly, my
wish has been to advert briefly to those proofs on which pious minds may
securely rest.<br></div>
<div>16. But as God has manifested himself more clearly by the advent of Christ,
so he has made himself more familiarly known in three persons. Of many proofs
let this one suffice. Paul connects together these three, God, Faith, and
Baptism, and reasons from the one to the other-viz. because there is one faith
he infers that there is one God; and because there is one baptism he infers that
there is one faith. Therefore, if by baptism we are initiated into the faith and
worship of one God, we must of necessity believe that he into whose name we are
baptised is the true God. And there cannot be a doubt that our Saviour wished to
testify, by a solemn rehearsal, that the perfect light of faith is now
exhibited, when he said, &#8220;Go and teach all nations, baptising them in the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,&#8221; (Mt. 28:19),
since this is the same thing as to be baptised into the name of the one God, who
has been fully manifested in the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Hence it
plainly appears, that the three persons, in whom alone God is known, subsist in
the Divine essence. And since faith certainly ought not to look hither and
thither, or run up and down after various objects, but to look, refer, and
cleave to God alone, it is obvious that were there various kinds of faith, there
behaved also to be various gods. Then, as the baptism of faith is a sacrament,
its unity assures us of the unity of God. Hence also it is proved that it is
lawful only to be baptised into one God, because we make a profession of faith
in him in whose name we are baptised. What, then, is our Saviour&#8217;s meaning
in commanding baptism to be administered in the name of the Father, and the Son,
and the Holy Spirit, if it be not that we are to believe with one faith in the
name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy
Spirit?<sup>9<a name="fnB92" href="#fn92">[8]</a></sup> But is this any thing
else than to declare that the Father, Son, and Spirit, are one God? Wherefore,
since it must be held certain that there is one God, not more than one, we
conclude that the Word and Spirit are of the very essence of God. Nothing could
be more stupid than the trifling of the Arians, who, while acknowledging the
divinity of the Son, denied his divine essence. Equally extravagant were the
ravings of the Macedonians, who insisted that by the Spirit were only meant the
gifts of grace poured out upon men. For as wisdom understanding, prudence,
fortitude, and the fear of the Lord, proceed from the Spirit, so he is the one
Spirit of wisdom, prudence, fortitude, and piety. He is not divided according to
the distribution of his gifts, but, as the Apostle assures us (1 Cor. 12:11),
however they be divided, he remains one and the same.<br></div>
<div>17. On the other hand, the Scriptures demonstrate that there is some
distinction between the Father and the Word, the Word and the Spirit; but the
magnitude of the mystery reminds us of the great reverence and soberness which
ought to he employed in discussing it. It seems to me, that nothing can be more
admirable than the words of Gregory Nanzianzen: &#8220;<font face="Graeca"> JOu
fqavnw to e{i noh'sai, kai; toi'" trisi; perilavmpomai ouj fqavnw ta; triva
dielei'n kai; ei;" to; eJn ajnafevromai</font>&#8221; (Greg. Nanzian. in Serm.
de Sacro Baptis.). &#8220;I cannot think of the unity without being irradiated
by the Trinity: I cannot distinguish between the Trinity without being carried
up to the unity.&#8221;<sup>9<a name="fnB93" href="#fn93">[9]</a></sup>
Therefore, let us beware of imagining such a Trinity of persons as will distract
our thoughts, instead of bringing them instantly back to the unity. The words
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, certainly indicate a real distinction, not
allowing us to suppose that they are merely epithets by which God is variously
designated from his works. Still they indicate distinction only, not division.
The passages we have already quoted show that the Son has a distinct subsistence
from the Father, because the Word could not have been with God unless he were
distinct from the Father; nor but for this could he have had his glory with the
Father. In like manner, Christ distinguishes the Father from himself when he
says that there is another who bears witness of him (John 5:32; 8:16). To the
same effect is it elsewhere said, that the Father made all things by the Word.
This could not be, if he were not in some respect distinct from him. Besides, it
was not the Father that descended to the earth, but he who came forth from the
Father; nor was it the Father that died and rose again, but he whom the Father
had sent. This distinction did not take its beginning at the incarnation: for it
is clear that the only begotten Son previously existed in the bosom of the
Father (John 1:18). For who will dare to affirm that the Son entered his
Father&#8217;s bosom for the first time, when he came down from heaven to assume
human nature? Therefore, he was previously in the bosom of the Father, and had
his glory with the Father. Christ intimates the distinction between the Holy
Spirit and the Father, when he says that the Spirit proceedeth from the Father,
and between the Holy Spirit and himself, when he speaks of him as another as he
does when he declares that he will send another Comforter; and in many other
passages besides (John 14:6; 15:26; 14:16).<br></div>
<div>18. I am not sure whether it is expedient to borrow analogies from human
affairs to express the nature of this distinction. The ancient fathers sometimes
do so, but they at the same time admits that what they bring forward as
analogous is very widely different. And hence it is that I have a great dread of
any thing like presumption here, lest some rash saying may furnish an occasion
of calumny to the malicious, or of delusion to the unlearned. It were
unbecoming, however, to say nothing of a distinction which we observe that the
Scriptures have pointed out. This distinction is, that to the Father is
attributed the beginning of action, the fountain and source of all things; to
the Son, wisdom, counsel, and arrangement in action, while the energy and
efficacy of action is assigned to the Spirit. Moreover, though the eternity of
the Father is also the eternity of the Son and Spirit, since God never could be
without his own wisdom and energy; and though in eternity there can be no room
for first or last, still the distinction of order is not unmeaning or
superfluous, the Father being considered first, next the Son from him, and then
the Spirit from both. For the mind of every man naturally inclines to consider,
first, God, secondly, the wisdom emerging from him, and, lastly, the energy by
which he executes the purposes of his counsel. For this reason, the Son is said
to be of the Father only; the Spirit of both the Father and the Son. This is
done in many passages, but in none more clearly than in the eighth chapter to
the Romans, where the same Spirit is called indiscriminately the Spirit of
Christ, and the Spirit of him who raised up Christ from the dead. And not
improperly. For Peter also testifies (1 Pet. 1:21), that it was the Spirit of
Christ which inspired the prophets, though the Scriptures so often say that it
was the Spirit of God the Father.<br></div>
<div>19. Moreover, this distinction is so far from interfering with the most
perfect unity of God, that the Son may thereby be proved to be one God with the
Father, inasmuch as he constitutes one Spirit with him, and that the Spirit is
not different from the Father and the Son, inasmuch as he is the Spirit of the
Father and the Son. In each hypostasis the whole nature is understood the only
difference being that each has his own peculiar subsistence. The whole Father is
in the Son, and the whole Son in the Father, as the Son himself also declares
(John 14:10), &#8220;I am in the Father, and the Father in me;&#8221; nor do
ecclesiastical writers admit that the one is separated from the other by any
difference of essence. &#8220;By those names which denote distinctions&#8221;
says Augustine &#8220;is meant the relation which they mutually bear to each
other, not the very substance by which they are one.&#8221; In this way, the
sentiments of the Fathers, which might sometimes appear to be at variance with
each other, are to be reconciled. At one time they teach that the Father is the
beginning of the Son, at another they assert that the Son has both divinity and
essence from himself, and therefore is one beginning with the Father. The cause
of this discrepancy is well and clearly explained by Augustine, when he
says,<sup>10<a name="fnB94" href="#fn94">[0]</a></sup> &#8220;Christ, as to
himself, is called God, as to the Father he is called Son.&#8221; And again,
&#8220;The Father, as to himself, is called God, as to the Son he is called
Father. He who, as to the Son, is called Father, is not Son; and he who, as to
himself, is called Father, and he who, as to himself, is called Son, is the same
God.&#8221; Therefore, when we speak of the Son simply, without reference to the
Father, we truly and properly affirm that he is of himself, and, accordingly,
call him the only beginning; but when we denote the relation which he bears to
the Father, we correctly make the Father the beginning of the Son.
Augustine&#8217;s fifth book on the Trinity is wholly devoted to the explanation
of this subject. But it is far safer to rest contented with the relation as
taught by him, than get bewildered in vain speculation by subtle prying into a
sublime mystery.<br></div>
<div>20. Let those, then, who love soberness, and are contented with the measure
of faith, briefly receive what is useful to be known. It is as follows:-When we
profess to believe in one God, by the name God is understood the one simple
essence, comprehending three persons or hypostases; and, accordingly, whenever
the name of God is used indefinitely, the Son and Spirit, not less than the
Father, is meant. But when the Son is joined with the Father, relation comes
into view, and so we distinguish between the Persons. But as the Personal
subsistence carry an order with them, the principle and origin being in the
Father, whenever mention is made of the Father and Son, or of the Father and
Spirit together, the name of God is specially given to the Father. In this way
the unity of essence is retained, and respect is had to the order, which,
however derogates in no respect from the divinity of the Son and Spirit. And
surely since we have already seen how the apostles declare the Son of God to
have been He whom Moses and the prophets declared to be Jehovah, we must always
arrive at a unity of essence. We, therefore, hold it detestable blasphemy to
call the Son a different God from the Father, because the simple name God admits
not of relation, nor can God, considered in himself, be said to be this or that.
Then, that the name Jehovah, taken indefinitely, may be applied to Christ, is
clear from the words of Paul, &#8220;For this thing I besought the Lord
thrice.&#8221; After giving the answer, &#8220;My grace is sufficient for
thee,&#8221; he subjoins, &#8220;that the power of Christ may rest upon
me,&#8221; (2 Cor. 12:8, 9). For it is certain that the name of Lord
(<font face="Graeca">Kurivo"</font>) is there put for Jehovah, and, therefore,
to restrict it to the person of the Mediator were puerile and frivolous, the
words being used absolutely, and not with the view of comparing the Father and
the Son. And we know that, in accordance with the received usage of the Greeks,
the apostles uniformly substitute the word <font face="Graeca">Kurivo"</font>
for Jehovah. Not to go far for an example, Paul besought the Lord in the same
sense in which Peter quotes the passage of Joel, &#8220;Whosoever shall call
upon the name of the Lord shall be saved,&#8221; (Acts 2:21; Joel 2:28). Where
this name is specially applied to the Son, there is a different ground for it,
as will be seen in its own place; at present it is sufficient to remember, that
Paul, after praying to God absolutely, immediately subjoins the name of Christ.
Thus, too, the Spirit is called God absolutely by Christ himself. For nothing
prevents us from holding that he is the entire spiritual essence of God, in
which are comprehended Father, Son, and Spirit. This is plain from Scripture.
For as God is there called a Spirit, so the Holy Spirit also, in so far as he is
a hypostasis of the whole essence, is said to be both of God and from
God.<br></div>
<div>21. But since Satan, in order to pluck up our faith by the roots, has
always provoked fierce disputes, partly concerning the divine essence of the Son
and Spirit, and partly concerning the distinction of persons; since in almost
every age he has stirred up impious spirits to vex the orthodox doctors on this
head, and is attempting in the present day to kindle a new flame out of the old
embers, it will be proper here to dispose of some of these perverse dreams.
Hitherto our chief object has been to stretch out our hand for the guidance of
such as are disposed to learn, not to war with the stubborn and contentious; but
now the truth which was calmly demonstrated must be vindicated from the
calumnies of the ungodly. Still, however it will be our principal study to
provide a sure footing for those whose ears are open to the word of God. Here,
if any where, in considering the hidden mysteries of Scripture, we should
speculate soberly and with great moderation, cautiously guarding against
allowing either our mind or our tongue to go a step beyond the confines of
God&#8217;s word. For how can the human minds which has not yet been able to
ascertain of what the body of the sun consists, though it is daily presented to
the eye, bring down the boundless essence of God to its little measure? Nay, how
can it, under its own guidance, penetrate to a knowledge of the substance of God
while unable to understand its own? Wherefore, let us willingly leave to God the
knowledge of himself. In the words of Hilary (De Trinit. lib. 1), &#8220;He
alone is a fit witness to himself who is known only by himself.&#8221; This
knowledge, then, if we would leave to God, we must conceive of him as he has
made himself known, and in our inquiries make application to no other quarter
than his word. On this subject we have five homilies of Chrysostom against the
Anomoei (De Incomprehensit. Dei Natura), in which he endeavoured, but in vain,
to check the presumption of the sophists, and curb their garrulity. They showed
no more modesty here than they are wont to do in everything else. The very
unhappy results of their temerity should be a warning to us to bring more
docility than acumen to the discussion of this question, never to attempt to
search after God anywhere but in his sacred word, and never to speak or think of
him farther than we have it for our guide. But if the distinction of Father,
Son, and Spirit, subsisting in the one Godhead (certainly a subject of great
difficulty), gives more trouble and annoyance to some intellects than is meet,
let us remember that the human mind enters a labyrinth whenever it indulges its
curiosity, and thus submit to be guided by the divine oracles, how much soever
the mystery may be beyond our reach.<br></div>
<div>22. It were tedious, and to no purpose toilsome, to form a catalogue of the
errors by which, in regard to this branch of doctrine, the purity of the faith
has been assailed. The greater part of heretics have with their gross deliriums
made a general attack on the glory of God, deeming it enough if they could
disturb and shake the unwary. From a few individuals numerous sects have sprung
up, some of them rending the divine essence, and others confounding the
distinction of Persons. But if we hold, what has already been demonstrated from
Scripture, that the essence of the one God, pertaining to the Father, Son, and
Spirit, is simple and indivisible, and again, that the Father differs in some
special property from the Son, and the Son from the Spirit, the door will be
shut against Arius and Sabellius, as well as the other ancient authors of error.
But as in our day have arisen certain frantic men, such as Servetus and others,
who, by new devices, have thrown every thing into confusion, it may be
worthwhile briefly to discuss their fallacies.<br></div>
<div>The name of Trinity was so much disliked, nay detested, by Servetus, that
he charged all whom he called Trinitarians with being Atheists. I say nothing of
the insulting terms in which he thought proper to make his charges. The sum of
his speculations was, that a threefold Deity is introduced wherever three
Persons are said to exist in his essence, and that this Triad was imaginary,
inasmuch as it was inconsistent with the unity of God. At the same time, he
would have it that the Persons are certain external ideas which do not truly
subsist in the Divine essence, but only figure God to us under this or that
form: that at first, indeed, there was no distinction in God, because originally
the Word was the same as the Spirit, but ever since Christ came forth God of
God, another Spirit, also a God, had proceeded from him. But although he
sometimes cloaks his absurdities in allegory, as when he says that the eternal
Word of God was the Spirit of Christ with God, and the reflection of the idea,
likewise that the Spirit was a shadow of Deity, he at last reduces the divinity
of both to nothing; maintaining that, according to the mode of distribution,
there is a part of God as well in the Son as in the Spirit, just as the same
Spirit substantially is a portion of God in us, and also in wood and stone. His
absurd babbling concerning the person of the Mediator will be seen in its own
place.<sup>10<a name="fnB95" href="#fn95">[1]</a></sup><br></div>
<div>The monstrous fiction that a Person is nothing else than a visible
appearance of the glory of God, needs not a long refutation. For when John
declares that before the world was created the Logos was God (John 1:1), he
shows that he was something very different from an idea. But if even then, and
from the remotest eternity, that Logos, who was God, was with the Father, and
had his own distinct and peculiar glory with the Father (John 17:5), he
certainly could not be an external or figurative splendour, but must necessarily
have been a hypostasis which dwelt inherently in God himself. But although there
is no mention made of the Spirit antecedent to the account of the creation, he
is not there introduced as a shadow, but as the essential power of God, where
Moses relates that the shapeless mass was unborn by him (Gen. 1:2). It is
obvious that the eternal Spirit always existed in God, seeing he cherished and
sustained the confused materials of heaven and earth before they possessed order
or beauty. Assuredly he could not then be an image or representation of God, as
Servetus dreams. But he is elsewhere forced to make a more open disclosure of
his impiety when he says, that God by his eternal reason decreeing a Son to
himself, in this way assumed a visible appearance. For if this be true, no other
Divinity is left to Christ than is implied in his having been ordained a Son by
God&#8217;s eternal decree. Moreover, those phantoms which Servetus substitutes
for the hypostases he so transforms as to make new changes in God. But the most
execrable heresy of all is his confounding both the Son and Spirit promiscuously
with all the creatures. For he distinctly asserts, that there are parts and
partitions in the essence of God, and that every such portion is God. This he
does especially when he says, that the spirits of the faithful are co-eternal
and consubstantial with God, although he elsewhere assigns a substantial
divinity, not only to the soul of man, but to all created things.<br></div>
<div>23. This pool has bred another monster not unlike the former. For certain
restless spirits, unwilling to share the disgrace and obloquy of the impiety of
Servetus, have confessed that there were indeed three Persons, but added, as a
reason, that the Father, who alone is truly and properly God, transfused his
Divinity into the Son and Spirit when he formed them. Nor do they refrain from
expressing themselves in such shocking terms as these: that the Father is
essentially distinguished from the Son and Spirit by this; that he is the only
<i>essentiator</i>. Their first pretext for this is, that Christ is uniformly
called the Son of God. From this they infer, that there is no proper God but the
Father. But they forget, that although the name of God is common also to the
Son, yet it is sometimes, by way of excellence, ascribed to the Father, as being
the source and principle of Divinity; and this is done in order to mark the
simple unity of essence. They object, that if the Son is truly God, he must be
deemed the Son of a person: which is absurd. I answer, that both are true;
namely, that he is the Son of God, because he is the Word, begotten of the
Father before all ages; (for we are not now speaking of the Person of the
Mediator), and yet, that for the purpose of explanation, regard must be had to
the Person, so that the name God may not be understood in its absolute sense,
but as equivalent to Father. For if we hold that there is no other God than the
Fathers this rank is clearly denied to the Son.<br></div>
<div>In every case where the Godhead is mentioned, we are by no means to admit
that there is an antithesis between the Father and the Son, as if to the former
only the name of God could competently be applied. For assuredly, the God who
appeared to Isaiah was the one true God, and yet John declares that he was
Christ (Isa. 6; John 12:41). He who declared, by the mouth of Isaiah, that he
was to be &#8220;for a stone of stumbling&#8221; to the Jews, was the one God;
and yet Paul declares that he was Christ (Isa. 8:14; Rom. 9:33). He who
proclaims by Isaiah, &#8220;Unto me every knee shall bow,&#8221; is the one God;
yet Paul again explains that he is Christ (Isa. 45:23; Rom. 14:11). To this we
may add the passages quoted by an Apostle, &#8220;Thou, Lord, hast laid the
foundations of the earth;&#8221; &#8220;Let all the angels of God worship
him,&#8221; (Heb. 1:10; 10:6; Ps. 102:26; 97:7). All these apply to the one God;
and yet the Apostle contends that they are the proper attributes of Christ.
There is nothing in the cavil, that what properly applies to God is transferred
to Christ, because he is the brightness of his glory. Since the name of Jehovah
is everywhere applied to Christ, it follows that, in regard to Deity, he is of
himself. For if he is Jehovah, it is impossible to deny that he is the same God
who elsewhere proclaims by Isaiah, &#8220;I am the first, and I am the last; and
beside me there is no God,&#8221; (Is. 44:6). We would also do well to ponder
the words of Jeremiah, &#8220;The gods that have not made the heavens and the
earth, even they shall perish from the earth and from under these
heavens,&#8221; (Jer. 10:11); whence it follows conversely, that He whose
divinity Isaiah repeatedly proves from the creation of the world, is none other
than the Son of God. And how is it possible that the Creator, who gives to all
should not be of himself, but should borrow his essence from another? Whosoever
says that the Son was <i>essentiated</i> by the
Father,<sup>10<a name="fnB96" href="#fn96">[2]</a></sup> denies his
selfexistence. Against this, however, the Holy Spirit protests, when he calls
him Jehovah. On the supposition, then, that the whole essence is in the Father
only, the essence becomes divisible, or is denied to the Son, who, being thus
robbed of his essences will be only a titular God. If we are to believe these
triflers, divine essence belongs to the Father only, on the ground that he is
sole God, and <i>essentiator</i> of the Son. In this way, the divinity of the
Son will be something abstracte <sup><a name="fnB97" href="#fn97">[3]</a></sup>
from the essence of God, or the derivation of a part from the whole. On the same
principle it must also be conceded, that the Spirit belongs to the Father only.
For if the derivation is from the primary essence which is proper to none but
the Father, the Spirit cannot justly be deemed the Spirit of the Son. This view,
however, is refuted by the testimony of Paul, when he makes the Spirit common
both to Christ and the Father. Moreover, if the Person of the Father is expunged
from the Trinity, in what will he differ from the Son and Spirit, except in
being the only God? They confess that Christ is God, and that he differs from
the Father. If he differs, there must be some mark of distinction between them.
Those who place it in the essence, manifestly reduce the true divinity of Christ
to nothing, since divinity cannot exist without essence, and indeed without
entire essence.<sup>10<a name="fnB98" href="#fn98">[4]</a></sup> The Father
certainly cannot differ from the Son, unless he have something peculiar to
himself, and not common to him with the Son. What, then, do these men show as
the mark of distinction? If it is in the essence, let them tell whether or not
he communicated essence to the Son. This he could not do in part merely, for it
were impious to think of a divided God. And besides, on this supposition, there
would be a rending of the Divine essence. The whole entire essence must
therefore be common to the Father and the Son; and if so, in respect of essence
there is no distinction between them. If they reply that the Father, while
essentiating, still remains the only God, being the possessor of the essence,
then Christ will be a figurative God, one in name or semblance only, and not in
reality, because no property can be more peculiar to God than essence, according
to the words, &#8220;I AM hath sent me unto you,&#8221; (Ex. 3:4).<br></div>
<div>24. The assumption, that whenever God is mentioned absolutely, the Father
only is meant, may be proved erroneous by many passages. Even in those which
they quote in support of their views they betray a lamentable inconsistency
because the name of Son occurs there by way of contrast, showing that the other
name God is used relatively, and in that way confined to the person of the
Father. Their objection may be disposed of in a single word. Were not the Father
alone the true God, he would, say they, be his own Father. But there is nothing
absurd in the name of God being specially applied, in respect of order and
degree, to him who not only of himself begat his own wisdom, but is the God of
the Mediator, as I will more fully show in its own place. For ever since Christ
was manifested in the flesh he is called the Son of God, not only because
begotten of the Father before all worlds he was the Eternal Word, but because he
undertook the person and office of the Mediator that he might unite us to God.
Seeing they are so bold in excluding the Son from the honour of God, I would
fain know whether, when he declares that there is &#8220;none good but one, that
is, God,&#8221; he deprives himself of goodness. I speak not of his human
nature, lest perhaps they should object, that whatever goodness was in it was
derived by gratuitous gift: I ask whether the Eternal Word of God is good, yes
or no? If they say no, their impiety is manifest; if yes, they refute
themselves. Christ&#8217;s seeming at the first glance to disclaim the name of
good (Mt. 19:17), rather confirms our view. Goodness. being the special property
of God alone, and yet being at the time applied to him in the ordinary way of
salutation, his rejection of false honour intimates that the goodness in which
he excels is Divine. Again, I ask whether, when Paul affirms. that God alone is
&#8220;immortal,&#8221; &#8220;wise, and true,&#8221; (1 Tim. 1:17), he reduces
Christ to the rank of beings mortal, foolish, and false. Is not he immortal,
who, from the beginning, had life so as to bestow immortality on angels? Is not
he wise who is the eternal wisdom of God? Is not he true who is truth
itself?<br></div>
<div>I ask, moreover, whether they think Christ should be worshipped. If he
claims justly, that every knee shall bow to him, it follows that he is the God
who, in the law, forbade worship to be offered to any but himself. If they
insist on applying to the Father only the words of Isaiah, &#8220;I am, and
besides me there is none else,&#8221; (Is. 44:6), I turn the passage against
themselves, since we see that every property of God is attributed to
Christ.<sup>10<a name="fnB99" href="#fn99">[5]</a></sup> There is no room for
the cavil that Christ was exalted in the flesh in which he humbled himself, and
in respect of which all power is given to him in heaven and on earth. For
although the majesty of King and Judge extends to the whole person of the
Mediator, yet had he not been God manifested in the flesh, he could not have
been exalted to such a height without coming into collision with God. And the
dispute is admirably settled by Paul, when he declares that he was equal with
God before he humbled himself, and assumed the form of a servants (Phil. 2:6,
7). Moreover, how could such equality exist, if he were not that God whose name
is Jah and Jehovah, who rides upon the cherubim, is King of all the earth, and
King of ages? Let them glamour as they may, Christ cannot be robbed of the
honour described by Isaiah, &#8220;Lo, this is our God; we have waited for
him,&#8221; (Is. 25:9); for these words describe the advent of God the Redeemer,
who was not only to bring back the people from Babylonish captivity, but restore
the Church, and make her completely perfect.<br></div>
<div>Nor does another cavil avail them, that Christ was God in his Father. For
though we admit that, in respect of order and gradation, the beginning of
divinity is in the Father, we hold it a detestable fiction to maintain that
essence is proper to the Father alone, as if he were the deifier of the Son. On
this view either the essence is manifold, or Christ is God only in name and
imagination. If they grant that the Son is God, but only in subordination to the
Father, the essence which in the Father is unformed and unbegotten will in him
be formed and begotten. I know that many who would be thought wise deride us for
extracting the distinction of persons from the words of Moses when he introduces
God as saying, &#8220;Let us make man in our own image,&#8221; (Gen. 1:26).
Pious readers, however, see how frigidly and absurdly the colloquy were
introduced by Moses, if there were not several persons in the Godhead. It is
certain that those whom the Father addresses must have been untreated. But
nothing is untreated except the one God. Now then, unless they concede that the
power of creating was common to the Father, Son, and Spirit, and the power of
commanding common, it will follow that God did not speak thus inwardly with
himself, but addressed other extraneous architects. In fine, there is a single
passage which will at once dispose of these two objections. The declaration of
Christ that &#8220;God is a Spirit,&#8221; (John 4:24), cannot be confined to
the Father only, as if the Word were not of a spiritual nature. But if the name
Spirit applies equally to the Son as to the Father, I infer that under the
indefinite name of God the Son is included. He adds immediately after, that the
only worshipers approved by the Father are those who worship him in spirit and
in truth; and hence I also infer, that because Christ performs the office of
teacher under a head, he applies the name God to the Father, not for the purpose
of destroying his own Divinity, but for the purpose of raising us up to it as it
were step by step.<br></div>
<div>25. The hallucination consists in dreaming of individuals, each of whom
possesses a part of the essence. The Scriptures teach that there is essentially
but one God, and, therefore, that the essence both of the Son and Spirit is
unbegotten; but inasmuch as the Father is first in order, and of himself begat
his own Wisdom, he, as we lately observed, is justly regarded as the principle
and fountain of all the Godhead. Thus God, taken indefinitely, is unbegotten,
and the Father, in respect of his person, is unbegotten. For it is absurd to
imagine that our doctrine gives any ground for alleging that we establish a
quaternion of gods. They falsely and calumniously ascribe to us the figment of
their own brain, as if we virtually held that three persons emanate from one
essence,<sup>10<a name="fnB100" href="#fn100">[6]</a></sup> whereas it is plain,
from our writings, that we do not disjoin the persons from the essence, but
interpose a distinction between the persons residing in it. If the persons were
separated from the essence, there might be some plausibility in their argument;
as in this way there would be a trinity of Gods, not of persons comprehended in
one God. This affords an answer to their futile question-whether or not the
essence concurs in forming the Trinity; as if we imagined that three Gods were
derived from it. Their objection, that there would thus be a Trinity without a
God, originates in the same absurdity. Although the essence does not contribute
to the distinction, as if it were a part or member, the persons are not without
it, or external to it; for the Father, if he were not God, could not be the
Father; nor could the Son possibly be Son unless he were God. We say, then, that
the Godhead is absolutely of itself. And hence also we hold that the Son,
regarded as God, and without reference to person, is also of himself; though we
also say that, regarded as Son, he is of the Father. Thus his essence is without
beginning, while his person has its beginning in God. And, indeed, the orthodox
writers who in former times spoke of the Trinity, used this term only with
reference to the Persons. To have included the essence in the distinction, would
not only have been an absurd error, but gross impiety. For those who class the
three thus-Essence, Son, and
Spirit<sup>10<a name="fnB101" href="#fn101">[7]</a></sup>-plainly do away with
the essence of the Son and Spirit; otherwise the parts being intermingled would
merge into each other-a circumstance which would vitiate any
distinction.<sup>10<a name="fnB102" href="#fn102">[8]</a></sup> In short, if God
and Father were synonymous terms, the Father would be deifier in a sense which
would leave the Son nothing but a shadow; and the Trinity would be nothing more
than the union of one God with two creatures.<br></div>
<div>26. To the objection, that if Christ be properly God, he is improperly
called the Son of God, it has been already answered, that when one person is
compared with another, the name God is not used indefinitely, but is restricted
to the Father, regarded as the beginning of the Godhead, not by
<i>essentiating</i>, as fanatics absurdly express it, but in respect of order.
In this sense are to be understood the words which Christ addressed to the
Father, &#8220;This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true
God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent,&#8221; (John 17:3). For speaking in
the person of the Mediator, he holds a middle place between God and man; yet so
that his majesty is not diminished thereby. For though he humbled (emptied)
himself, he did not lose the glory which he had with the Father, though it was
concealed from the world.<sup> </sup> So in the Epistle to the Hebrews (Heb.
1:10; 2:9), though the apostle confesses that Christ was made a little lower
than the angels, he at the same time hesitates not to assert that he is the
eternal God who founded the earth. We must hold, therefore, that as often as
Christ, in the character of Mediator, addresses the Father, he, under the term
God, includes his own divinity also. Thus, when he says to the apostles,
&#8220;It is expedient for you that I go away,&#8221; &#8220;My Father is
greater than I,&#8221; he does not attribute to himself a secondary divinity
merely, as if in regard to eternal essence he were inferior to the Father; but
having obtained celestial glory, he gathers together the faithful to share it
with him. He places the Father in the higher degree, inasmuch as the full
perfection of brightness conspicuous in heaven, differs from that measure of
glory which he himself displayed when clothed in flesh. For the same reason Paul
says, that Christ will restore &#8220;the kingdom to God, even the
Father,&#8221; &#8220;that God may be all in all,&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:24, 28).
Nothing can be more absurd than to deny the perpetuity of Christ&#8217;s
divinity. But if he will never cease to be the Son of God, but will ever remain
the same that he was from the beginning, it follows that under the name of
Father the one divine essence common to both is comprehended. And assuredly
Christ descended to us for the very purpose of raising us to the Father, and
thereby, at the same time, raising us to himself, inasmuch as he is one with the
Father. It is therefore erroneous and impious to confine the name of God to the
Father, so as to deny it to the Son. Accordingly, John, declaring that he is the
true God, has no idea of placing him beneath the Father in a subordinate rank of
divinity. I wonder what these fabricators of new gods mean, when they confess
that Christ is truly God, and yet exclude him from the godhead of the Father, as
if there could be any true God but the one God, or as if transfused divinity
were not a mere modern fiction.<br></div>
<div>27. In the many passages which they collect from Iren&Ecirc;us, in which he
maintains that the Father of Christ is the only eternal God of Israel, they
betray shameful ignorance, or very great dishonesty. For they ought to have
observed, that that holy man was contending against certain frantic persons,
who, denying that the Father of Christ was that God who had in old times spoken
by Moses and the prophets, held that he was some phantom or other produced from
the pollution of the world. His whole object, therefore, is to make it plain,
that in the Scriptures no other God is announced but the Father of Christ; that
it is wicked to imagine any other. Accordingly, there is nothing strange in his
so often concluding that the God of Israel was no other than he who is
celebrated by Christ and the apostles. Now, when a different heresy is to be
resisted, we also say with truth, that the God who in old times appeared to the
fathers, was no other than Christ. Moreover, if it is objected that he was the
Father, we have the answer ready, that while we contend for the divinity of the
Son, we by no means exclude the Father. When the reader attends to the purpose
of Iren&Ecirc;us, the dispute is at an end. Indeed, we have only to look to lib.
3 c. 6, where the pious writer insists on this one point, &#8220;that he who in
Scripture is called God absolutely and indefinitely, is truly the only God; and
that Christ is called God absolutely.&#8221; Let us remember (as appears from
the whole work, and especially from lib. 2 c. 46), that the point under
discussion was, that the name of Father is not applied enigmatically and
parabolically to one who was not truly God. We may adds that in lib. 3 c. 9, he
contends that the Son as well as the Father united was the God proclaimed by the
prophets and apostles. He afterwards explains (lib. 3 c. 12) how Christ, who is
Lord of all, and King and Judge, received power from him who is God of all,
namely, in respect of the humiliation by which he humbled himself, even to the
death of the cross. At the same time he shortly after affirms (lib. 3 c. 16),
that the Son is the maker of heaven and earth, who delivered the law by the hand
of Moses, and appeared to the fathers. Should any babbler now insist that,
according to Irenaeus, the Father alone is the God of Israel, I will refer him
to a passage in which Irenaeus distinctly says (lib. 3 c. 18, 23), that Christ
is ever one and the same, and also applies to Christ the words of the prophecy
of Habakkuk, &#8220;God cometh from the south.&#8221; To the same effect he says
(lib. 4 c. 9), &#8220;Therefore, Christ himself, with the Father, is the God of
the living.&#8221; And in the 12th chapter of the same book he explains that
Abraham believed God, because Christ is the maker of heaven and earth, and very
God.<br></div>
<div>28. With no more truth do they claim Tertullian as a patron. Though his
style is sometimes rugged and obscure, he delivers the doctrine which we
maintain in no ambiguous manner, namely, that while there is one God, his Word,
however, is with dispensation or economy; that there is only one God in unity of
substance; but that, nevertheless, by the mystery of dispensation, the unity is
arranged into Trinity; that there are three, not in state, but in degree-not in
substance, but in form-not in power, but in
order.<sup>10<a name="fnB103" href="#fn103">[9]</a></sup> He says indeed that he
holds the Son to be second to the Father; but he means that the only difference
is by distinction. In one place he says the Son is visible; but after he has
discoursed on both views, he declares that he is invisible regarded as the Word.
In fine, by affirming that the Father is characterised by his own Person, he
shows that he is very far from countenancing the fiction which we refute. And
although he does not acknowledge any other God than the Father, yet, explaining
himself in the immediate context, he shows that he does not speak exclusively in
respect of the Son, because he denies that he is a different God from the
Father; and, accordingly, that the one supremacy is not violated by the
distinction of Person. And it is easy to collect his meaning from the whole
tenor of his discourse. For he contends against Praxeas, that although God has
three distinct Persons, yet there are not several gods, nor is unity divided.
According to the fiction of Praxeas, Christ could not be God without being the
Father also; and this is the reason why Tertullian dwells so much on the
distinction. When he calls the Word and Spirit a portion of the whole, the
expression, though harsh, may be allowed, since it does not refer to the
substance, but only (as Tertullian himself testifies) denotes arrangement and
economy which applies to the persons only. Accordingly, he asks, &#8220;How many
persons, Praxeas, do you think there are, but just as many as there are names
for?&#8221; In the same way, he shortly after says, &#8220;That they may believe
the Father and the Son, each in his own name and person.&#8221; These things, I
think, sufficiently refute the effrontery of those who endeavour to blind the
simple by pretending the authority of Tertullian.<br></div>
<div>29. Assuredly, whosoever will compare the writings of the ancient fathers
with each other, will not find any thing in Irenaeus different from what is
taught by those who come after him. Justin is one of the most ancient, and he
agrees with us out and out. Let them object that, by him and others, the Father
of Christ is called the one God. The same thing is taught by Hilary, who uses
the still harsher expression, that Eternity is in the Father. Is it that he may
withhold divine essence from the Son? His whole work is a defence of the
doctrine which we maintain; and yet these men are not ashamed to produce some
kind of mutilated excerpts for the purpose of persuading us that Hilary is a
patron of their heresy. With regard to what they pretend as to Ignatius, if they
would have it to be of the least importance, let them prove that the apostles
enacted laws concerning Lent, and other corruptions. Nothing can be more
nauseating, than the absurdities which have been published under the name of
Ignatius; and therefore, the conduct of those who provide themselves with such
masks for deception is the less entitled to toleration.<br></div>
<div>Moreover, the consent of the ancient fathers clearly appears from this,
that in the Council of Nice, no attempt was made by Arius to cloak his heresy by
the authority of any approved author; and no Greek or Latin writer apologises as
dissenting from his predecessors. It cannot be necessary to observe how
carefully Augustine, to whom all these miscreants are most violently opposed,
examined all ancient writings, and how reverently he embraced the doctrine
taught by them (August. lib. de Trinit. &amp;c). He is most scrupulous in
stating the grounds on which he is forced to differ from them, even in the
minutest point. On this subject, too, if he finds any thing ambiguous or obscure
in other writers, he does not disguise
it.<sup>11<a name="fnB104" href="#fn104">[0]</a></sup> <sup> </sup> And he
assumes it as an acknowledged fact, that the doctrine opposed by the Arians was
received without dispute from the earliest antiquity. At the same time, he was
not ignorant of what some others had previously taught. This is obvious from a
single expression. When he says (De Doct. Christ. lib. 1). that &#8220;unity is
in the Father,&#8221; will they pretend that he then forgot himself? In another
passage, he clears away every such charge, when he calls the Father the
beginning of the Godhead, as being from none-thus wisely inferring that the name
of God is specially ascribed to the Father, because, unless the beginning were
from him, the simple unity of essence could not be maintained. I hope the pious
reader will admit that I have now disposed of all the calumnies by which Satan
has hitherto attempted to pervert or obscure the pure doctrine of faith. The
whole substance of the doctrine has, I trust, been faithfully expounded, if my
readers will set bounds to their curiosity, and not long more eagerly than they
ought for perplexing disputation. I did not undertake to satisfy those who
delight in speculate views, but I have not designedly omitted any thing which I
thought adverse to me. At the same time, studying the edification of the Church,
I have thought it better not to touch on various topics, which could have
yielded little profit, while they must have needlessly burdened and fatigued the
reader. For instance, what avails it to discuss, as Lombard does at length (lib.
1 dist. 9), Whether or not the Father always generates? This idea of continual
generation becomes an absurd fiction from the moment it is seen, that from
eternity there were three persons in one God.<br></div>

<div><font size="5">IN THE CREATION OF THE WORLD, AND ALL THINGS IN IT, THE TRUE
GOD DISTINGUISHED BY CERTAIN MARKS FROM FICTITIOUS GODS.</font><br></div>
<div>In this chapter commences the second part of Book First-viz. the knowledge
of man. Certain things premised. I. The creation of the world generally (s. 1
and 2). II. The subject of angels considered (s. 3-13). III. Of bad angels or
devils (s. 13-20); and, IV. The practical use to be made of the history of the
creation (s. 20-22).<br></div>
<div><i>Sections.</i><br></div>
<div>1.	 The mere fact of creation should lead us to acknowledge God, but to
prevent our falling away to Gentile fictions, God has been pleased to furnish a
history of the creation. An impious objection, Why the world was not created
sooner? Answer to it. Shrewd saying of an old man.<br></div>
<div>2.	 For the same reason, the world was created, not in an instant, but in
six days. The order of creation described, showing that Adam was not created
until God had, with infinite goodness made ample provision for him.<br></div>
<div>3.	 The doctrine concerning angels expounded. 1. That we may learn from
them also to acknowledge God. 2. That we may be put on our guard against the
errors of the worshippers of angels and the Manichees. Manicheeism refuted. Rule
of piety.<br></div>
<div>4.	 The angels created by God. At what time and in what order it is
inexpedient to inquire. The garrulity of the Pseudo-Dionysius.<br></div>
<div>5.	 The nature, offices, and various names of angels.<br></div>
<div>6.	 Angels the dispensers of the divine beneficence to us.<br></div>
<div>7.	 A kind of prefects over kingdoms and provinces, but specially the
guardians of the elect. Not certain that every believer is under the charge of a
single angel. Enough, that all angels watch over the safety of the
Church.<br></div>
<div>8.	 The number and orders of angels not defined. Why angels said to be
winged.<br></div>
<div>9.	 Angels are ministering spirits and spiritual essences.<br></div>
<div>10.	 The heathen error of placing angels on the throne of God refuted. 1.
By passages of Scripture.<br></div>
<div>11.	 Refutation continued. 2. By inferences from other passages. Why God
employs the ministry of angels.<br></div>
<div>12.	 Use of the doctrine of Scripture concerning the holy angels.<br></div>
<div>13.	 The doctrine concerning bad angels or devils reduced to four heads. 1.
That we may guard against their wiles and assaults.<br></div>
<div>14.	 That we may be stimulated to exercises of piety. Why one angel in the
singular number often spoken of.<br></div>
<div>15.	 The devil being described as the enemy of man, we should perpetually
war against him.<br></div>
<div>16.	 The wickedness of the devil not by creation but by corruption. Vain
and useless to inquire into the mode, time, and character of the fall of
angels.<br></div>
<div>17.	 Though the devil is always opposed in will and endeavour to the will
of God, he can do nothing without his permission and consent.<br></div>
<div>18.	 God so overrules wicked spirits as to permit them to try the faithful,
and rule over the wicked.<br></div>
<div>19.	 The nature of bad angels. They are spiritual essences endued with
sense and intelligence.<br></div>
<div>20.	 The latter part of the chapter briefly embracing the history of
creation, and showing what it is of importance for us to know concerning
God.<br></div>
<div>21.	 The special object of this knowledge is to prevent us, through
ingratitude or thoughtlessness, from overlooking the perfections of God. Example
of this primary knowledge.<br></div>
<div>22.	 Another object of this knowledge-viz. that perceiving how these things
were created for our use, we may be excited to trust in God, pray to him, and
love him.<br></div>
<div>1. ALTHOUGH Isaiah justly charges the worshipers of false gods with
stupidity, in not learning from the foundations of the earth, and the circle of
the heavens, who the true God is (Isa. 40:21); yet so sluggish and grovelling is
our intellect, that it was necessary he should be more clearly depicted, in
order that the faithful might not fall away to Gentile fictions. the idea that
God is the soul of the world, though the most tolerable that philosophers have
suggested, is absurd; and, therefore, it was of importance to furnish us with a
more intimate knowledge in order that we might not wander to and fro in
uncertainty. Hence God was pleased that a history of the creation should exist-a
history on which the faith of the Church might lean without seeking any other
God than Him whom Moses sets forth as the Creator and Architect of the world.
First, in that history, the period of time is marked so as to enable the
faithful to ascend by an unbroken succession of years to the first origin of
their race and of all things.<sup> </sup> This knowledge is of the highest use
not only as an antidote to the monstrous fables which anciently prevailed both
in Egypt and the other regions of the world, but also as a means of giving a
clearer manifestation of the eternity of God as contrasted with the birth of
creation, and thereby inspiring us with higher admiration. We must not be moved
by the profane jeer, that it is strange how it did not sooner occur to the Deity
to create the heavens and the earth, instead of idly allowing an infinite period
to pass away, during which thousands of generations might have existed, while
the present world is drawing to a close before it has completed its six
thousandth year.<sup> </sup> Why God delayed so long it is neither fit nor
lawful to inquire. Should the human mind presume to do it, it could only fail in
the attempt, nor would it be useful for us to know what God, as a trial of the
modesty of our faith, has been pleased purposely to conceal. It was a shrewd
saying of a good old man, who when some one pertly asked in derision what God
did before the world was created, answered he made a hell for the inquisitive
(August. Confess., lib. 11 c. 12). This reproof, not less weighty than severe,
should repress the tickling wantonness which urges many to indulge in vicious
and hurtful speculation.<br></div>
<div>In fine, let us remember that that invisible God, whose wisdom, power, and
justice, are incomprehensible, is set before us in the history of Moses as in a
mirror, in which his living image is reflected. For as an eye, either dimmed by
age or weakened by any other cause, sees nothing distinctly without the aid of
glasses, so (such is our imbecility) if Scripture does not direct us in our
inquiries after God, we immediately turn vain in our imaginations. Those who now
indulge their petulance, and refuse to take warning, will learn, when too late,
how much better it had been reverently to regard the secret counsels of God,
than to belch forth blasphemies which pollute the face of heaven. Justly does
Augustine complain that God is insulted whenever any higher reason than his will
is demanded. (Lib. de Gent.). He also in another place wisely reminds us that it
is just as improper to raise questions about infinite periods of time as about
infinite space. (De Civit. Dei.). However wide the circuit of the heavens may
be, it is of some definite extent. But should any one expostulate with God that
vacant space remains exceeding creation by a hundred-fold, must not every pious
mind detest the presumption? Similar is the madness of those who charge God with
idleness in not having pleased them by creating the world countless ages sooner
than he did create it. In their cupidity they affect to go beyond the world, as
if the ample circumference of heaven and earth did not contain objects numerous
and resplendent enough to absorb all our senses; as if, in the period of six
thousand years, God had not furnished facts enough to exercise our minds in
ceaseless meditation. Therefore, let us willingly remain hedged in by those
boundaries within which God has been pleased to confine our persons, and, as it
were, enclose our minds, so as to prevent them from losing themselves by
wandering unrestrained.<br></div>
<div>2. With the same view Moses relates that the work of creation was
accomplished not in one moment, but in six days. By this statement we are drawn
away from fiction to the one God who thus divided his work into six days, that
we may have no reluctance to devote our whole lives to the contemplation of it.
For though our eyes, in what direction soever they turn, are forced to behold
the works of God, we see how fleeting our attention is, and holy quickly pious
thoughts, if any arise, vanish away. Here, too, objection is taken to these
progressive steps as inconsistent with the power of God, until human reason is
subdued to the obedience of faith, and learns to welcome the calm quiescence to
which the sanctification of the seventh day invited us. In the very order of
events, we ought diligently to ponder on the paternal goodness of God toward the
human race, in not creating Adam until he had liberally enriched the earth with
all good things. Had he placed him on an earth barren and unfurnished; had he
given life before light, he might have seemed to pay little regard to his
interest. But now that he has arranged the motions of the sun and stars for
man&#8217;s use, has replenished the air, earth, and water, with living
creatures, and produced all kinds of fruit in abundance for the supply of food,
by performing the office of a provident and industrious head of a family, he has
shown his wondrous goodness toward us. These subjects, which I only briefly
touch, if more attentively pondered, will make it manifest that Moses was a sure
witness and herald of the one only Creator. I do not repeat what I have already
explained-viz. that mention is here made not of the bare essence of God, but
that his eternal Wisdom and Spirit are also set before us, in order that we may
not dream of any other God than Him who desires to be recognised in that express
image.<br></div>
<div>3. But before I begin to treat more fully of the nature of man (chap. 15
and B. 2 c. 1), it will be proper to say something of angels. For although
Moses, in accommodation to the ignorance of the generality of men, does not in
the history of the creation make mention of any other works of God than those
which meet our eye, yet, seeing he afterwards introduces angels as the ministers
of God, we easily infer that he for whom they do service is their Creator.
Hence, though Moses, speaking in popular language, did not at the very
commencement enumerate the angels among the creatures of God, nothing prevents
us from treating distinctly and explicitly of what is delivered by Scripture
concerning them in other places. For if we desire to know God by his works, we
surely cannot overlook this noble and illustrious specimen. We may add that this
branch of doctrine is very necessary for the refutation of numerous errors. The
minds of many are so struck with the excellence of angelic natures, that they
would think them insulted in being subjected to the authority of God, and so
made subordinate. Hence a fancied divinity has been assigned them. Manes, too,
has arisen with his sect, fabricating to himself two principles-God and the
devil, attributing the origin of good things to God, but assigning all bad
natures to the devil as their author. Were this delirium to take possession of
our minds, God would be denied his glory in the creation of the world. For,
seeing there is nothing more peculiar to God than eternity and
<font face="Graeca">aujtousiva</font>, <i>i.e.</i> self-existence, or existence
of himself, if I may so speak, do not those who attribute it to the devil in
some degree invest him with the honour of divinity? And where is the omnipotence
of God, if the devil has the power of executing whatever he pleases against the
will, and notwithstanding of the opposition of God? But the only good ground
which the Manichees have-viz. that it were impious to ascribe the creation of
any thing bad to a good God, militates in no degree against the orthodox faith,
since it is not admitted that there is any thing naturally bad throughout the
universe; the depravity and wickedness whether of man or of the devil, and the
sins thence resulting, being not from nature, but from the corruption of nature;
nor, at first, did anything whatever exist that did not exhibit some
manifestation of the divine wisdom and justice. To obviate such perverse
imaginations, we must raise our minds higher than our eyes can penetrate. It was
probably with this view that the Nicene Creed, in calling God the creator of all
things, makes express mention of things invisible. My care, however, must be to
keep within the bounds which piety prescribes, lest by indulging in speculations
beyond my reach, I bewilder the reader, and lead him away from the simplicity of
the faith. And since the Holy Spirit always instructs us in what is useful, but
altogether omits, or only touches cursorily on matters which tend little to
edification, of all such matters, it certainly is our duty to remain in willing
ignorance.<br></div>
<div>4. Angels being the ministers appointed to execute the commands of God,
must, of course, be admitted to be his creatures, but to stir up questions
concerning the time or order in which they were created (see Lombard, lib. 2
dist. 2, sqq.), bespeaks more perverseness than industry. Moses relates that the
heavens and the earth were finished, with all their host; what avails it
anxiously to inquire at what time other more hidden celestial hosts than the
stars and planets also began to be? Not to dwell on this, let us here remember
that on the whole subject of religion one rule of modesty and soberness is to be
observed, and it is this, in obscure matters not to speak or think, or even long
to know, more than the Word of God has delivered. A second rule is, that in
reading the Scriptures we should constantly direct our inquiries and meditations
to those things which tend to edification, not indulge in curiosity, or in
studying things of no use. And since the Lord has been pleased to instruct us,
not in frivolous questions, but in solid piety, in the fear of his name, in true
faith, and the duties of holiness, let us rest satisfied with such knowledge.
Wherefore, if we would be duly wise, we must renounce those vain babblings of
idle men, concerning the nature, ranks, and number of angels, without any
authority from the Word of God. I know that many fasten on these topics more
eagerly, and take greater pleasure in them than in those relating to daily
practice. But if we decline not to be the disciples of Christ, let us not
decline to follow the method which he has prescribed. In this way, being
contented with him for our master, we will not only refrain from, but even feel
averse to, superfluous speculations which he discourages. None can deny that
Dionysus (whoever he may have been) has many shrewd and subtle disquisitions in
his Celestial Hierarchy, but on looking at them more closely, every one must see
that they are merely idle talk. The duty of a Theologian, however, is not to
tickle the ear, but confirm the conscience, by teaching what is true, certain,
and useful. When you read the work of Dionysus, you would think that the man had
come down from heaven, and was relating, not what he had learned, but what he
had actually seen. Paul, however, though he was carried to the third heaven, so
far from delivering any thing of the kind, positively declares, that it was not
lawful for man to speak the secrets which he had seen. Bidding adieu, therefore,
to that nugatory wisdom, let us endeavour to ascertain from the simple doctrine
of Scripture what it is the Lord&#8217;s pleasure that we should know concerning
angels.<br></div>
<div>5. In Scripture, then, we uniformly read that angels are heavenly spirits,
whose obedience and ministry God employs to execute all the purposes which he
has decreed, and hence their name as being a kind of intermediate messengers to
manifest his will to men. The names by which several of them are distinguished
have reference to the same office. They are called hosts, because they surround
their Prince as his court,-adorn and display his majesty,-like soldiers, have
their eyes always turned to their leader&#8217;s standard, and are so ready and
prompt to execute his orders, that the moment he gives the nod, they prepare
for, or rather are actually at work. In declaring the magnificence of the divine
throne, similar representations are given by the prophets, and especially by
Daniel, when he says, that when God stood up to Judgment, &#8220;thousand
thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before
him,&#8221; (Dan. 7:10). As by these means the Lord wonderfully exerts and
declares the power and might of his hand, they are called virtues. Again, as his
government of the world is exercised and administered by them, they are called
at one time Principalities, at another Powers, at another Dominions (Col. 1:16;
Eph. 1:21). Lastly, as the glory of God in some measure dwells in them, they are
also termed Thrones; though as to this last designation I am unwilling to speak
positively, as a different interpretation is equally, if not more congruous. To
say nothing, therefore, of the name of Thrones, the former names are often
employed by the Holy Spirit in commendation of the dignity of angelic service.
Nor is it right to pass by unhonoured those instruments by whom God specially
manifests the presence of his power. Nay, they are more than once called Gods,
because the Deity is in some measure represented to us in their service, as in a
mirror. I am rather inclined, however, to agree with ancient writers, that in
those passages<sup>11<a name="fnB105" href="#fn105">[1]</a></sup> wherein it is
stated that the angel of the Lord appeared to Abraham, Jacob, and Moses, Christ
was that angel. Still it is true, that when mention is made of all the angels,
they are frequently so designated. Nor ought this to seem strange. For if
princes and rulers have this honour given them, because in their office they are
vicegerents of God, the supreme King and Judge, with far greater reason may it
be given to angels, in whom the brightness of the divine glory is much more
conspicuously displayed.<br></div>
<div>6. But the point on which the Scriptures specially insist is that which
tends most to our comfort, and to the confirmation of our faith, namely, that
angels are the ministers and dispensers of the divine bounty towards us.
Accordingly, we are told how they watch for our safety, how they undertake our
defence, direct our path, and take heed that no evil befall us. There are whole
passages which relate, in the first instance, to Christ, the Head of the Church,
and after him to all believers. &#8220;He shall give his angels charge over
thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest
thou dash thy foot against a stone.&#8221; Again, &#8220;The angel of the Lord
encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth
them.&#8221;<sup>11<a name="fnB106" href="#fn106">[2]</a></sup> By these
passages the Lord shows that the protection of those whom he has undertaken to
defend he has delegated to his angels. Accordingly, an angel of the Lord
consoles Hagar in her flight, and bids her be reconciled to her mistress.
Abraham promises to his servant that an angel will be the guide of his journey.
Jacob, in blessing Ephraim and Manasseh, prays &#8220;The angel which redeemed
me from all evil bless the lads.&#8221; So an angel was appointed to guard the
camp of the Israelites; and as often as God was pleased to deliver Israel from
the hands of his enemies, he stirred up avengers by the ministry of angels.
Thus, in fine (not to mention more), angels ministered to Christ, and were
present with him in all straits. To the women they announced his resurrection;
to the disciples they foretold his glorious advent. In discharging the office of
our protectors, they war against the devil and all our enemies, and execute
vengeance upon those who afflict us. Thus we read that an angel of the Lord, to
deliver Jerusalem from siege, slew one hundred and eighty-five thousand men in
the camp of the king of Assyria in a single night.<br></div>
<div>7. Whether or not each believer has a single angel assigned to him for his
defence, I dare not positively affirm. When Daniel introduces the angel of the
Persian and the angel of the Greeks, he undoubtedly intimates that certain
angels are appointed as a kind of presidents over kingdoms and
provinces.<sup>11<a name="fnB107" href="#fn107">[3]</a></sup> Again, when Christ
says that the angels of children always behold the face of his Father, he
insinuates that there are certain angels to whom their safety has been
entrusted. But I know not if it can be inferred from this, that each believer
has his own angel. This, indeed, I hold for certain, that each of us is cared
for, not by one angel merely, but that all with one consent watch for our
safety. For it is said of all the angels collectively, that they rejoice
&#8220;over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just
persons which need no repentance.&#8221; It is also said, that the angels
(meaning more than one) carried the soul of Lazarus into Abraham&#8217;s bosom.
Nor was it to no purpose that Elisha showed his servant the many chariots of
fire which were specially allotted him.<br></div>
<div>There is one passage which seems to intimate somewhat more clearly that
each individual has a separate angel. When Peter, after his deliverance from
prison, knocked at the door of the house where the brethren were assembled,
being unable to think it could be himself, they said that it was his angel. This
idea seems to have been suggested to them by a common belief that every believer
has a single angel assigned to him. Here, however, it may be alleged, that there
is nothing to prevent us from understanding it of any one of the angels to whom
the Lord might have given the charge of Peter at that particular time, without
implying that he was to be his, perpetual guardian, according to the vulgar
imagination (see Calvin on Mark 5:9), that two angels a good and a bad, as a
kind of genii, are assigned to each individual. After all, it is not worthwhile
anxiously to investigate a point which does not greatly concern us. If any one
does not think it enough to know that all the orders of the heavenly host are
perpetually watching for his safety, I do not see what he could gain by knowing
that he has one angel as a special guardian. Those, again, who limit the care
which God takes of each of us to a single angel, do great injury to themselves
and to all the members of the Church, as if there were no value in those
promises of auxiliary troops, who on every side encircling and defending us,
embolden us to fight more manfully.<br></div>
<div>8. Those who presume to dogmatize on the ranks and numbers of angels, would
do well to consider on what foundation they rest. As to their rank, I admit that
Michael is described by David as a mighty Prince, and by Jude as an
Archangel.<sup>11<a name="fnB108" href="#fn108">[4]</a></sup> Paul also tells
us, that an archangel will blow the trumpet which is to summon the world to
Judgment. But how is it possible from such passages to ascertain the gradations
of honour among the angels to determine the insignia, and assign the place and
station of each? Even the two names, Michael and Gabriel, mentioned in
Scripture, or a third, if you choose to add it from the history of Tobit, seem
to intimate by their meaning that they are given to angels in accommodation to
the weakness of our capacity, though I rather choose not to speak positively on
the point. As to the number of angels, we learn from the mouth of our Saviour
that there are many legions, and from Daniel that there are many myriads.
Elisha&#8217;s servant saw a multitude of chariots, and their vast number is
declared by the fact, that they encamp round about those that fear the Lord. It
is certain that spirits have no bodily shape, and yet Scripture, in
accommodation to us, describes them under the form of winged Cherubim and
Seraphim; not without cause, to assure us that when occasion requires, they will
hasten to our aid with incredible swiftness, winging their way to us with the
speed of lightning. Farther than this, in regard both to the ranks and numbers
of angels, let us class them among those mysterious subjects, the full
revelation of which is deferred to the last day, and accordingly refrain from
inquiring too curiously, or talking presumptuously.<br></div>
<div>9. There is one point, however, which though called into doubt by certain
restless individuals, we ought to hold for certain-viz. that angels are
ministering spirits (Heb. 1:14); whose service God employs for the protection of
his people, and by whose means he distributes his favours among men, and also
executes other works. The Sadducees of old maintained, that by angels nothing
more was meant than the movements which God impresses on men, or manifestations
which he gives of his own power (Acts 23:8). But this dream is contradicted by
so many passages of Scriptures that it seems strange how such gross ignorance
could have had any countenance among the Jews. To say nothing of the passages I
have already quoted, passages which refer to thousands and legions of angels,
speak of them as rejoicing, as bearing up the faithful in their hands, carrying
their souls to rest, beholding the face of their Father, and so
forth:<sup>11<a name="fnB109" href="#fn109">[5]</a></sup> there are other
passages which most clearly prove that they are real beings possessed of
spiritual essence. Stephen and Paul say that the Law was enacted in the hands of
angels. Our Saviour, moreover says that at the resurrection the elect will be
like angels; that the day of Judgment is known not even to the angels; that at
that time he himself will come with the holy angels. However much such passages
may be twisted, their meaning is plain. In like manner, when Paul beseeches
Timothy to keep his precepts as before Christ and his elect angels, it is not
qualities or inspirations without substance that he speaks of, but true spirits.
And when it is said, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, that Christ was made more
excellent than the angels, that the world was not made subject to them, that
Christ assumed not their nature, but that of man, it is impossible to give a
meaning to the passages without understanding that angels are blessed spirits,
as to whom such comparisons may competently be made. The author of that Epistle
declares the same thing when he places the souls of believers and the holy
angels together in the kingdom of heaven. Moreover, in the passages we have
already quoted, the angels of children are said to behold the face of God, to
defend us by their protection, to rejoice in our salvation, to admire the
manifold grace of God in the Church, to be under Christ their head. To the same
effect is their frequent appearance to the holy patriarchs in human form, their
speaking, and consenting to be hospitably entertained. Christ, too, in
consequence of the supremacy which he obtains as Mediator, is called the Angel
(Mal. 3:1). It was thought proper to touch on this subject in passing, with the
view of putting the simple upon their guard against the foolish and absurd
imaginations which, suggested by Satan many centuries ago, are ever and anon
starting up anew<br></div>
<div>10. It remains to give warning against the superstition which usually
begins to creep in, when it is said that all blessings are ministered and
dispensed to us by angels. For the human mind is apt immediately to think that
there is no honour which they ought not to receive, and hence the peculiar
offices of Christ and God are bestowed upon them. In this ways the glory of
Christ was for several former ages greatly obscured, extravagant eulogiums being
pronounced on angels without any authority from Scripture. Among the corruptions
which we now oppose, there is scarcely any one of greater antiquity. Even Paul
appears to have had a severe contest with some who so exalted angels as to make
them almost the superiors of Christ. Hence he so anxiously urges in his Epistle
to the Colossians (Col. 1:16, 20), that Christ is not only superior to all
angels, but that all the endowments which they possess are derived from him;
thus warning us against forsaking him, by turning to those who are not
sufficient for themselves, but must draw with us at a common fountain. As the
refulgence of the Divine glory is manifested in them, there is nothing to which
we are more prone than to prostrate ourselves before them in stupid adoration,
and then ascribe to them the blessings which we owe to God alone. Even John
confesses in the Apocalypse (Rev. 19:10; 22:8, 9), that this was his own case,
but he immediately adds the answer which was given to him, &#8220;See thou do it
not; I am thy fellow servant: worship God.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>11. This danger we will happily avoid, if we consider why it is that Gods
instead of acting directly without their agency, is wont to employ it in
manifesting his power, providing for the safety of his people, and imparting the
gifts of his beneficence. This he certainly does not from necessity, as if he
were unable to dispense with them. Whenever he pleases, he passes them by, and
performs his own work by a single nod: so far are they from relieving him of any
difficulty. Therefore, when he employs them it is as a help to our weakness,
that nothing may be wanting to elevate our hopes or strengthen our confidence.
It ought, indeed, to be sufficient for us that the Lord declares himself to be
our protector. But when we see ourselves beset by so many perils, so many
injuries, so many kinds of enemies, such is our frailty and effeminacy, that we
might at times be filled with alarm, or driven to despair, did not the Lord
proclaim his gracious presence by some means in accordance with our feeble
capacities. For this reason, he not only promises to take care of us, but
assures us that he has numberless attendants, to whom he has committed the
charge of our safety, that whatever dangers may impend, so long as we are
encircled by their protection and guardianship, we are placed beyond all hazard
of evil. I admit that after we have a simple assurance of the divine protection,
it is improper in us still to look round for help. But since for this our
weakness the Lord is pleased, in his infinite goodness and indulgence, to
provide, it would ill become us to overlook the favour. Of this we have an
example in the servant of Elisha (2 Kings 6:17), who, seeing the mountain
encompassed by the army of the Assyrians, and no means of escape, was completely
overcome with terror, and thought it all over with himself and his master. Then
Elisha prayed to God to open the eyes of the servant, who forthwith beheld the
mountain filled with horses and chariots of fire; in other words, with a
multitude of angels, to whom he and the prophet had been given in charge.
Confirmed by the vision he received courage, and could boldly defy the enemy,
whose appearance previously filled him with dismay.<br></div>
<div>12. Whatever, therefore, is said as to the ministry of angels, let us
employ for the purpose of removing all distrust, and strengthening our
confidence in God. Since the Lord has provided us with such protection, let us
not be terrified at the multitude of our enemies as if they could prevail
notwithstanding of his aid, but let us adopt the sentiment of Elisha, that more
are for us than against us. How preposterous, therefore, is it to allow
ourselves to be led away from God by angels who have been appointed for the very
purpose of assuring us of his more immediate presence to help us? But we are so
led away, if angels do not conduct us directly to him-making us look to him,
invoke and celebrate him as our only defender-if they are not regarded merely as
hands moving to our assistance just as he directs-if they do not direct us to
Christ as the only Mediator on whom we must wholly depend and recline, looking
towards him, and resting in him. Our minds ought to give thorough heed to what
Jacob saw in his vision (Gen. 28:12),-angels descending to the earth to men, and
again mounting up from men to heaven, by means of a ladder, at the head of which
the Lord of Hosts was seated, intimating that it is solely by the intercession
of Christ that the ministry of angels extends to us, as he himself declares,
&#8220;Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and
descending upon the Son of man,&#8221; (John 1:51). Accordingly, the servant of
Abraham, though he had been commended to the guardianship of an angel (Gen.
24:7), does not therefore invoke that angel to be present with him, but trusting
to the commendation, pours out his prayers before the Lord, and entreats him to
show mercy to Abraham. As God does not make angels the ministers of his power
and goodness, that he may share his glory with them, so he does not promise his
assistance by their instrumentality, that we may divide our confidence between
him and them. Away, then, with that Platonic philosophy of seeking access to God
by means of angels and courting them with the view of making God more propitious
(<i>Plat. in Epinomide et Cratylo</i>),-a philosophy which presumptuous and
superstitious men attempted at first to introduce into our religion, and which
they persist in even to this day.<br></div>
<div>13. The tendency of all that Scripture teaches concerning devils is to put
us on our guard against their wiles and machinations, that we may provide
ourselves with weapons strong enough to drive away the most formidable foes. For
when Satan is called the god and ruler of this world, the strong man armed, the
prince of the power of the air, the roaring
lion,<sup>11<a name="fnB110" href="#fn110">[6]</a></sup> the object of all these
descriptions is to make us more cautious and vigilant, and more prepared for the
contest. This is sometimes stated in distinct terms. For Peter, after describing
the devil as a roaring lion going about seeking whom he may devour, immediately
adds the exhortation, &#8220;whom resist steadfast in the faith,&#8221; (1 Pet.
5:9). And Paul, after reminding us that we wrestle not against flesh and blood,
but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness
of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places, immediately enjoins
us to put on armour equal to so great and perilous a contest (Ephes. 6:12).
Wherefore, let this be the use to which we turn all these statements. Being
forewarned of the constant presence of an enemy the most daring, the most
powerful, the most crafty, the most indefatigable, the most completely equipped
with all the engines and the most expert in the science of war, let us not allow
ourselves to be overtaken by sloth or cowardice, but, on the contrary, with
minds aroused and ever on the alert, let us stand ready to resist; and, knowing
that this warfare is terminated only by death, let us study to persevere. Above
all, fully conscious of our weakness and want of skill, let us invoke the help
of God, and attempt nothing without trusting in him, since it is his alone to
supply counsel, and strength, and courage, and arms.<br></div>
<div>14. That we may feel the more strongly urged to do so, the Scripture
declares that the enemies who war against us are not one or two, or few in
number, but a great host. Mary Magdalene is said to have been delivered from
seven devils by which she was possessed; and our Saviour assures us that it is
an ordinary circumstance, when a devil has been expelled, if access is again
given to it, to take seven other spirits, more wicked than itself, and resume
the vacant possession. Nay, one man is said to have been possessed by a whole
legion.<sup>11<a name="fnB111" href="#fn111">[7]</a></sup> By this, then, we are
taught that the number of enemies with whom we have to war is almost infinite,
that we may not, from a contemptuous idea of the fewness of their numbers, be
more remiss in the contest, or from imagining that an occasional truce is given
us, indulge in sloth. In one Satan or devil being often mentioned in the
singular number, the thing denoted is that domination of iniquity which is
opposed to the reign of righteousness. For, as the Church and the communion of
saints has Christ for its head, so the faction of the wicked and wickedness
itself, is portrayed with its prince exercising supremacy. Hence the expression,
&#8220;Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
angels,&#8221; (Mt. 25:41).<br></div>
<div>15. One thing which ought to animate us to perpetual contest with the devil
is, that he is everywhere called both our adversary and the adversary of God.
For, if the glory of God is dear to us, as it ought to be, we ought to struggle
with all our might against him who aims at the extinction of that glory. If we
are animated with proper zeal to maintain the Kingdom of Christ, v. e must wage
irreconcilable war with him who conspires its ruin. Again, if we have any
anxiety about our own salvation, we ought to make no peace nor truce with him
who is continually laying schemes for its destruction. But such is the character
given to Satan in the third chapter of Genesis, where he is seen seducing man
from his allegiance to God, that he may both deprive God of his due honour, and
plunge man headlong in destruction. Such, too, is the description given of him
in the Gospels (Mt. 13:28), where he is called the enemy, and is said to sow
tares in order to corrupt the seed of eternal life. In one word, in all his
actions we experience the truth of our Saviour&#8217;s description, that he was
&#8220;a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth,&#8221; (John
8:44). Truth he assails with lies, light he obscures with darkness. The minds of
men he involves in error; he stirs up hatred, inflames strife and war, and all
in order that he may overthrow the kingdom of God, and drown men in eternal
perdition with himself. Hence it is evident that his whole nature is depraved,
mischievous, and malignant. There must be extreme depravity in a mind bent on
assailing the glory of God and the salvation of man. This is intimated by John
in his Epistle, when he says that he &#8220;sinneth from the beginning,&#8221;
(1 John 3:8), implying that he is the author, leader, and contriver of all
malice and wickedness.<br></div>
<div>16. But as the devil was created by God, we must remember that this malice
which we attribute to his nature is not from creation, but from depravation.
Every thing damnable in him he brought upon himself, by his revolt and fall. Of
this Scripture reminds us, lest, by believing that he was so created at first,
we should ascribe to God what is most foreign to his nature. For this reason,
Christ declares (John 8:44), that Satan, when he lies, &#8220;speaketh of his
own,&#8221; and states the reason, &#8220;because he abode not in the
truth.&#8221; By saying that he abode not in the truth, he certainly intimates
that he once was in the truth, and by calling him the father of lies, he puts it
out of his power to charge God with the depravity of which he was himself the
cause. But although the expressions are brief and not very explicit, they are
amply sufficient to vindicate the majesty of God from every calumny. And what
more does it concern us to know of devils? Some murmur because the Scripture
does not in various passages give a distinct and regular exposition of
Satan&#8217;s fall, its cause, mode, date, and nature. But as these things are
of no consequence to us, it was better, if not entirely to pass them in silence,
at least only to touch lightly upon them. The Holy Spirit could not deign to
feed curiosity with idle, unprofitable histories. We see it was the Lord&#8217;s
purpose to deliver nothing in his sacred oracles which we might not learn for
edification. Therefore, instead of dwelling on superfluous matters, let it be
sufficient for us briefly to hold, with regard to the nature of devils, that at
their first creation they were the angels of God, but by revolting they both
ruined themselves, and became the instruments of perdition to others. As it was
useful to know this much, it is clearly taught by Peter and Jude;
&#8220;God,&#8221; they say, &#8220;spared not the angels that sinned, but cast
them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved
unto Judgment,&#8221; (2 Pet. 2:4; Jude ver. 6). And Paul, by speaking of the
elect angels, obviously draws a tacit contrast between them and reprobate
angels.<br></div>
<div>17. With regard to the strife and war which Satan is said to wage with God,
it must be understood with this qualification, that Satan cannot possibly do
anything against the will and consent of God. For we read in the history of Job,
that Satan appears in the presence of God to receive his commands, and dares not
proceed to execute any enterprise until he is authorised. In the same way, when
Ahab was to be deceived, he undertook to be a lying spirit in the mouth of all
the prophets; and on being commissioned by the Lord, proceeds to do so. For this
reason, also, the spirit which tormented Saul is said to be an evil spirit from
the Lord, because he was, as it were, the scourge by which the misdeeds of the
wicked king were punished. In another place it is said that the plagues of Egypt
were inflicted by God through the instrumentality of wicked angels. In
conformity with these particular examples, Paul declares generally that
unbelievers are blinded by God, though he had previously described it as the
doing of Satan.<sup>11<a name="fnB112" href="#fn112">[8]</a></sup> It is
evident, therefore, that Satan is under the power of God, and is so ruled by his
authority, that he must yield obedience to it. Moreover, though we say that
Satan resists God, and does works at variance with His works, we at the same
time maintain that this contrariety and opposition depend on the permission of
God. I now speak not of Satan&#8217;s will and endeavour, but only of the
result. For the disposition of the devil being wicked, he has no inclination
whatever to obey the divine will, but, on the contrary, is wholly bent on
contumacy and rebellion. This much, therefore, he has of himself, and his own
iniquity, that he eagerly, and of set purpose, opposes God, aiming at those
things which he deems most contrary to the will of God. But as God holds him
bound and fettered by the curb of his power, he executes those things only for
which permission has been given him, and thus, however unwilling, obeys his
Creator, being forced, whenever he is required, to do Him service.<br></div>
<div>18. God thus turning the unclean spirits hither and thither at his
pleasure, employs them in exercising believers by warring against them,
assailing them with wiles, urging them with solicitations, pressing close upon
them, disturbing, alarming, and occasionally wounding, but never conquering or
oppressing them; whereas they hold the wicked in thraldom, exercise dominion
over their minds and bodies, and employ them as bond-slaves in all kinds of
iniquity. Because believers are disturbed by such enemies, they are addressed in
such exhortations as these: &#8220;Neither give place to the devil;&#8221;
&#8220;Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom
he may devour; whom resist steadfast in the faith,&#8221; (Eph. 4:27; 1 Pet.
5:8). Paul acknowledges that he was not exempt from this species of contest when
he says, that for the purpose of subduing his pride, a messenger of Satan was
sent to buffet him (2 Cor. 12:7). This trial, therefore, is common to all the
children of God. But as the promise of bruising Satan&#8217;s head (Gen. 3:15)
applies alike to Christ and to all his members, I deny that believers can ever
be oppressed or vanquished by him. They are often, indeed, thrown into alarm,
but never so thoroughly as not to recover themselves. They fall by the violence
of the blows, but they get up again; they are wounded, but not mortally. In
fine, they labour on through the whole course of their lives, so as ultimately
to gain the victory, though they meet with occasional defeats. We know how
David, through the just anger of God, was left for a time to Satan, and by his
instigation numbered the people (2 Sam. 24:1); nor without cause does Paul hold
out a hope of pardon in case any should have become ensnared by the wiles of the
devil (2 Tim. 2:26). Accordingly, he elsewhere shows that the promise above
quoted commences in this life where the struggle is carried on, and that it is
completed after the struggle is ended. His words are, &#8220;The God of peace
shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly,&#8221; (Rom. 16:20). In our Head,
indeed, this victory was always perfect, because the prince of the world
&#8220;had nothing&#8221; in him (John 14:30); but in us, who are his members,
it is now partially obtained, and will be perfected when we shall have put off
our mortal flesh, through which we are liable to infirmity, and shall have been
filled with the energy of the Holy Spirit. In this way, when the kingdom of
Christ is raised up and established, that of Satan falls, as our Lord himself
expresses it, &#8220;I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven,&#8221; (Luke
10:18). By these words, he confirmed the report which the apostles gave of the
efficacy of their preaching. In like manner he says, &#8220;When a strong man
armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace. But when a stronger than he
shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein
he trusted, and divideth his spoils,&#8221; (Luke 11:21, 22). And to this end,
Christ, by dying, overcame Satan, who had the power of death (Heb. 2:14), and
triumphed over all his hosts that they might not injure the Church, which
otherwise would suffer from them every moment. For (such being our weakness, and
such his raging fury), how could we withstand his manifold and unintermitted
assaults for any period, however short, if we did not trust to the victory of
our leader? God, therefore, does not allow Satan to have dominion over the souls
of believers, but only gives over to his sway the impious and unbelieving, whom
he deigns not to number among his flock. For the devil is said to have
undisputed possession of this world until he is dispossessed by Christ. In like
manner, he is said to blind all who do not believe the Gospel, and to do his own
work in the children of disobedience. And justly; for all the wicked are vessels
of wrath, and, accordingly, to whom should they be subjected but to the minister
of the divine vengeance? In fine, they are said to be of their father the
devil.<sup>11<a name="fnB113" href="#fn113">[9]</a></sup> For as believers are
recognised to be the sons of God by bearing his image, so the wicked are
properly regarded as the children of Satan, from having degenerated into his
image.<br></div>
<div>19. Having above refuted that nugatory philosophy concerning the holy
angels, which teaches that they are nothing but good motions or inspirations
which God excites in the minds of men, we must here likewise refute those who
foolishly allege that devils are nothing but bad affections or perturbations
suggested by our carnal nature. The brief refutation is to be found in passages
of Scripture on this subject, passages neither few nor obscure. First, when they
are called unclean spirits and apostate angels (Mt. 12:43; Jude, verse 6), who
have degenerated from their original, the very terms sufficiently declare that
they are not motions or affections of the mind, but truly, as they are called,
minds or spirits endued with sense and intellect. In like manner, when the
children of God are contrasted by John, and also by our Saviour, with the
children of the devil, would not the contrast be absurd if the term devil meant
nothing more than evil inspirations? And John adds still more emphatically, that
the devil sinneth from the beginning (1 John 3:8). In like manner, when Jude
introduces the archangel Michael contending with the devil (Jude, verse 9), he
certainly contrasts a wicked and rebellious with a good angel. To this
corresponds the account given in the Book of Job, that Satan appeared in the
presence of God with the holy angels. But the clearest passages of all are those
which make mention of the punishment which, from the Judgment of God, they
already begin to feel, and are to feel more especially at the resurrection,
&#8220;What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come
hither to torment us before the time?&#8221; (Mt. 8:29); and again,
&#8220;Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
angels,&#8221; (Mt. 25:41). Again, &#8220;If God spared not the angels that
sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness
to be reserved unto Judgment,&#8221; &amp;c. (2 Pet. 2:4). How absurd the
expressions, that devils are doomed to eternal punishment, that fire is prepared
for them, that they are even now excruciated and tormented by the glory of
Christ, if there were truly no devils at all? But as all discussion on this
subject is superfluous for those who give credit to the Word of God, while
little is gained by quoting Scripture to those empty speculators whom nothing
but novelty can please, I believe I have already done enough for my purpose,
which was to put the pious on their guard against the delirious dreams with
which restless men harass themselves and the simple. The subject, however,
deserved to be touched upon, lest any, by embracing that errors should imagine
they have no enemy and thereby be more remiss or less cautious in
resisting.<br></div>
<div>20. Meanwhile, being placed in this most beautiful theatre, let us not
decline to take a pious delight in the clear and manifest works of God. For, as
we have elsewhere observed, though not the chief, it is, in point of order, the
first evidence of faiths to remember to which side soever we turn, that all
which meets the eye is the work of God, and at the same time to meditate with
pious care on the end which God had in view in creating it. Wherefore, in order
that we may apprehend with true faith what it is necessary to know concerning
God, it is of importance to attend to the history of the creation, as briefly
recorded by Moses and afterwards more copiously illustrated by pious writers,
more especially by Basil and Ambrose. From this history we learn that God, by
the power of his Word and his Spirit, created the heavens and the earth out of
nothing; that thereafter he produced things inanimate and animate of every kind,
arranging an innumerable variety of objects in admirable order, giving each kind
its proper nature, office, place, and station; at the same time, as all things
were liable to corruption, providing for the perpetuation of each single
species, cherishing some by secret methods, and, as it were, from time to time
instilling new vigour into them, and bestowing on others a power of continuing
their race, so preventing it from perishing at their own death. Heaven and earth
being thus most richly adorned, and copiously supplied with all things, like a
large and splendid mansion gorgeously constructed and exquisitely furnished, at
length man was made-man, by the beauty of his person and his many noble
endowments, the most glorious specimen of the works of God. But, as I have no
intention to give the history of creation in detail, it is sufficient to have
again thus briefly touched on it in passing. I have already reminded my reader,
that the best course for him is to derive his knowledge of the subject from
Moses and others who have carefully and faithfully transmitted an account of the
creation.<br></div>
<div>21. It is unnecessary to dwell at length on the end that should be aimed at
in considering the works of God. The subject has been in a great measure
explained elsewhere, and in so far as required by our present work, may now be
disposed of in a few words. Undoubtedly were one to attempt to speak in due
terms of the inestimable wisdom, power, justice, and goodness of God, in the
formation of the world, no grace or splendour of diction could equal the
greatness of the subject. Still there can be no doubt that the Lord would have
us constantly occupied with such holy meditation, in order that, while we
contemplate the immense treasures of wisdom and goodness exhibited in the
creatures as in so many mirrors, we may not only run our eye over them with a
hasty, and, as it were, evanescent glance, but dwell long upon them, seriously
and faithfully turn them in our minds, and every now and then bring them to
recollection. But as the present work is of a didactic nature, we cannot
fittingly enter on topics which require lengthened discourse. Therefore, in
order to be compendious, let the reader understand that he has a genuine
apprehension of the character of God as the Creator of the world; first, if he
attends to the general rule, never thoughtlessly or obliviously to overlook the
glorious perfections which God displays in his creatures; and, secondly, if he
makes a self application of what he sees, so as to fix it deeply on his heart.
The former is exemplified when we consider how great the Architect must be who
framed and ordered the multitude of the starry host so admirably, that it is
impossible to imagine a more glorious sight, so stationing some, and fixing them
to particular spots that they cannot move; giving a freer course to others yet
setting limits to their wanderings; so tempering the movement of the whole as to
measure out day and night, months, years, and seasons, and at the same time so
regulating the inequality of days as to prevent every thing like confusion. The
former course is, moreover, exemplified when we attend to his power in
sustaining the vast mass, and guiding the swift revolutions of the heavenly
bodies, &amp;c. These few examples sufficiently explain what is meant by
recognising the divine perfections in the creation of the world. Were we to
attempt to go over the whole subject we should never come to a conclusion, there
being as many miracles of divine power, as many striking evidences of wisdom and
goodness, as there are classes of objects, nay, as there are individual objects,
great or small, throughout the universe.<br></div>
<div>22. The other course which has a closer relation to faith remains to be
considered-viz. that while we observe how God has destined all things for our
good and salvation, we at the same time feel his power and grace, both in
ourselves and in the great blessings which he has bestowed upon us; thence
stirring up ourselves to confidence in him, to invocation, praise, and love.
Moreover, as I lately observed, the Lord himself, by the very order of creation,
has demonstrated that he created all things for the sake of man. Nor is it
unimportant to observe, that he divided the formation of the world into six
days, though it had been in no respect more difficult to complete the whole
work, in all its parts, in one moment than by a gradual progression. But he was
pleased to display his providence and paternal care towards us in this, that
before he formed man, he provided whatever he foresaw would be useful and
salutary to him. How ungrateful, then, were it to doubt whether we are cared for
by this most excellent Parent, who we see cared for us even before we were born!
How impious were it to tremble in distrust, lest we should one day be abandoned
in our necessity by that kindness which, antecedent to our existence, displayed
itself in a complete supply of all good things! Moreover, Moses tells us that
everything which the world contains is liberally placed at our disposal. This
God certainly did not that he might delude us with an empty form of donation.
Nothing, therefore, which concerns our safety will ever be wanting. To conclude,
in one word; as often as we call God the Creator of heaven and earth, let us
remember that the distribution of all the things which he created are in his
hand and power, but that we are his sons, whom he has undertaken to nourish and
bring up in allegiance to him, that we may expect the substance of all good from
him alone, and have full hope that he will never suffer us to be in want of
things necessary to salvation, so as to leave us dependent on some other source;
that in everything we desire we may address our prayers to him, and, in every
benefit we receive, acknowledge his hand, and give him thanks; that thus allured
by his great goodness and beneficence, we may study with our whole heart to love
and serve him.<br></div>

philosophers. The delusion of Pelagians and Papists. Objection as to the fall of
man when free, refuted.<br></div>
<div>1. WE have now to speak of the creation of man, not only because of all the
works of God it is the noblest, and most admirable specimen of his justice,
wisdom, and goodness, but, as we observed at the outset, we cannot clearly and
properly know God unless the knowledge of ourselves be added.<sup> </sup> This
knowledge is twofold,-relating, first, to the condition in which we were at
first created; and, secondly to our condition such as it began to be immediately
after Adam&#8217;s fall. For it would little avail us to know how we were
created if we remained ignorant of the corruption and degradation of our nature
in consequence of the fall. At present, however, we confine ourselves to a
consideration of our nature in its original integrity. And, certainly, before we
descend to the miserable condition into which man has fallen, it is of
importance to consider what he was at first. For there is need of caution, lest
we attend only to the natural ills of man, and thereby seem to ascribe them to
the Author of nature; impiety deeming it a sufficient defence if it can pretend
that everything vicious in it proceeded in some sense from God, and not
hesitating, when accused, to plead against God, and throw the blame of its guilt
upon Him. Those who would be thought to speak more reverently of the Deity catch
at an excuse for their depravity from nature, not considering that they also,
though more obscurely, bring a charge against God, on whom the dishonour would
fall if anything vicious were proved to exist in nature. Seeing, therefore, that
the flesh is continually on the alert for subterfuges, by which it imagines it
can remove the blame of its own wickedness from itself to some other quarter, we
must diligently guard against this depraved procedure, and accordingly treat of
the calamity of the human race in such a way as may cut off every evasion, and
vindicate the justice of God against all who would impugn it. We shall
afterwards see, in its own place (Book 2 chap. 1 sec. 3), how far mankind now
are from the purity originally conferred on Adam. And, first, it is to be
observed, that when he was formed out of the dust of the ground a curb was laid
on his pride-nothing being more absurd than that those should glory in their
excellence who not only dwell in tabernacles of clay, but are themselves in part
dust and ashes. But God having not only deigned to animate a vessel of clay, but
to make it the habitation of an immortal spirit, Adam might well glory in the
great liberality of his
Maker.<sup>12<a name="fnB114" href="#fn114">[0]</a></sup><br></div>
<div>2. Moreover, there can be no question that man consists of a body and a
soul; meaning by soul, an immortal though created essence, which is his nobler
part. Sometimes he is called a spirit. But though the two terms, while they are
used together differ in their meaning, still, when spirit is used by itself it
is equivalent to soul, as when Solomon speaking of death says, that the spirit
returns to God who gave it (Eccles. 12:7). And Christ, in commending his spirit
to the Father, and Stephen his to Christ, simply mean, that when the soul is
freed from the prison-house of the body, God becomes its perpetual keeper. Those
who imagine that the soul is called a spirit because it is a breath or energy
divinely infused into bodies, but devoid of essence, err too grossly, as is
shown both by the nature of the thing, and the whole tenor of Scripture. It is
true, indeed, that men cleaving too much to the earth are dull of apprehension,
nay, being alienated from the Father of Lights, are so immersed in darkness as
to imagine that they will not survive the grave; still the light is not so
completely quenched in darkness that all sense of immortality is lost.
Conscience, which, distinguishing, between good and evil, responds to the
Judgment of God, is an undoubted sign of an immortal spirit. How could motion
devoid of essence penetrate to the Judgment-seat of God, and under a sense of
guilt strike itself with terror? The body cannot be affected by any fear of
spiritual punishment. This is competent only to the soul, which must therefore
be endued with essence. Then the mere knowledge of a God sufficiently proves
that souls which rise higher than the world must be immortal, it being
impossible that any evanescent vigour could reach the very fountain of life. In
fine, while the many noble faculties with which the human mind is endued
proclaim that something divine is engraven on it, they are so many evidences of
an immortal essence. For such sense as the lower animals possess goes not beyond
the body, or at least not beyond the objects actually presented to it. But the
swiftness with which the human mind glances from heaven to earth, scans the
secrets of nature, and, after it has embraced all ages, with intellect and
memory digests each in its proper order, and reads the future in the past,
clearly demonstrates that there lurks in man a something separated from the
body. We have intellect by which we are able to conceive of the invisible God
and angels-a thing of which body is altogether incapable. We have ideas of
rectitude, justice, and honesty-ideas which the bodily senses cannot reach. The
seat of these ideas must therefore be a spirit. Nay, sleep itself, which
stupefying the man, seems even to deprive him of life, is no obscure evidence of
immortality; not only suggesting thoughts of things which never existed, but
foreboding future events. I briefly touch on topics which even profane writers
describe with a more splendid eloquence. For pious readers, a simple reference
is sufficient. Were not the soul some kind of essence separated from the body,
Scripture would not teach<sup>12<a name="fnB115" href="#fn115">[1]</a></sup>
that we dwell in houses of clay, and at death remove from a tabernacle of flesh;
that we put off that which is corruptible, in order that, at the last day, we
may finally receive according to the deeds done in the body. These, and similar
passages which everywhere occur, not only clearly distinguish the soul from the
body, but by giving it the name of man, intimate that it is his principal part.
Again, when Paul exhorts believers to cleanse themselves from all filthiness of
the flesh and the spirit, he shows that there are two parts in which the taint
of sin resides. Peter, also, in calling Christ the Shepherd and Bishop of souls,
would have spoken absurdly if there were no souls towards which he might
discharge such an office. Nor would there be any ground for what he says
concerning the eternal salvation of souls, or for his injunction to purify our
souls, or for his assertion that fleshly lusts war against the soul; neither
could the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews say, that pastors watch as those
who must give an account for our souls, if souls were devoid of essence. To the
same effect Paul calls God to witness upon his soul, which could not be brought
to trial before God if incapable of suffering punishment. This is still more
clearly expressed by our Saviour, when he bids us fear him who, after he has
killed the body, is able also to cast into hell fire. Again when the author of
the Epistle to the Hebrews distinguishes the fathers of our flesh from God, who
alone is the Father of our spirits, he could not have asserted the essence of
the soul in clearer terms. Moreover, did not the soul, when freed from the
fetters of the body, continue to exist, our Saviour would not have represented
the soul of Lazarus as enjoying blessedness in Abraham s bosom, while, on the
contrary, that of Dives was suffering dreadful torments. Paul assures us of the
same thing when he says, that so long as we are present in the body, we are
absent from the Lord. Not to dwell on a matter as to which there is little
obscurity, I will only add, that Luke mentions among the errors of the Sadducees
that they believed neither angel nor spirit.<br></div>
<div>3. A strong proof of this point may be gathered from its being said, that
man was created in the image of God. For though the divine glory is displayed in
man&#8217;s outward appearance, it cannot be doubted that the proper seat of the
image is in the soul. I deny not, indeed, that external shape, in so far as it
distinguishes and separates us from the lower animals, brings us nearer to God;
nor will I vehemently oppose any who may choose to include under the image of
God that<br></div>
<div>&#8220;While the mute creation downward bend<br></div>
<div>Their sight, and to their earthly mother tend,<br></div>
<div>Man looks aloft, and with erected eyes,<br></div>
<div>Beholds his own hereditary
skies.&#8221;<sup>12<a name="fnB116" href="#fn116">[2]</a></sup><br></div>
<div>Only let it be understood, that the image of God which is beheld or made
conspicuous by these external marks, is spiritual. For Osiander (whose writings
exhibit a perverse ingenuity in futile devices), extending the image of God
indiscriminately as well to the body as to the soul, confounds heaven with
earth. He says, that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, placed their
image in man, because, even though Adam had stood entire, Christ would still
have become man. Thus, according to him, the body which was destined for Christ
was a model and type of that corporeal figure which was then formed. But where
does he find that Christ is an image of the Spirit? I admit, indeed, that in the
person of the Mediator, the glory of the whole Godhead is displayed: but how can
the eternal Word, who in order precedes the Spirit, be called his image? In
short, the distinction between the Son and the Spirit is destroyed when the
former is represented as the image of the latter. Moreover, I should like to
know in what respect Christ in the flesh in which he was clothed resembles the
Holy Spirit, and by what marks, or lineaments, the likeness is expressed. And
since the expression, &#8220;Let us make man in our own image,&#8221; is used in
the person of the Son also, it follows that he is the image of himself-a thing
utterly absurd. Add that, according to the figment of
Osiander,<sup>12<a name="fnB117" href="#fn117">[3]</a></sup> Adam was formed
after the model or type of the man Christ. Hence Christ, in as much as he was to
be clothed with flesh, was the idea according to which Adam was formed, whereas
the Scriptures teach very differently-viz. that he was formed in the image of
God. There is more plausibility in the imagination of those who interpret that
Adam was created in the image of God, because it was conformable to Christ, who
is the only image of God; but not even for this is there any solid foundation.
The &#8220;image&#8221; and &#8220;likeness&#8221; has given rise to no small
discussion; interpreters searching without cause for a difference between the
two terms, since &#8220;likeness&#8221; is merely added by way of exposition.
First, we know that repetitions are common in Hebrew, which often gives two
words for one thing; And, secondly, there is no ambiguity in the thing itself,
man being called the image of God because of his likeness to God. Hence there is
an obvious absurdity in those who indulge in philosophical speculation as to
these names, placing the <i>Zelem</i>, that is the image, in the substance of
the soul, and the <i>Demuth</i>, that is the likeness, in its qualities, and so
forth. God having determined to create man in his own image, to remove the
obscurity which was in this terms adds, by way of explanation, in <i>his
likeness</i>, as if he had said, that he would make man, in whom he would, as it
were, image himself by means of the marks of resemblance impressed upon him.
Accordingly, Moses, shortly after repeating the account, puts down the image of
God twice, and makes no mention of the likeness. Osiander frivolously objects
that it is not a part of the man, or the soul with its faculties, which is
called the image of God, but the whole Adam, who received his name from the dust
out of which he was taken. I call the objection frivolous, as all sound readers
will judge. For though the whole man is called mortal, the soul is not therefore
liable to death, nor when he is called a rational animal is reason or
intelligence thereby attributed to the body. Hence, although the soul is not the
man, there is no absurdity in holding that he is called the image of God in
respect of the soul; though I retain the principle which I lately laid down,
that the image of God extends to everything in which the nature of man surpasses
that of all other species of animals. Accordingly, by this term is denoted the
integrity with which Adam was endued when his intellect was clear, his
affections subordinated to reason, all his senses duly regulated, and when he
truly ascribed all his excellence to the admirable gifts of his Maker. And
though the primary seat of the divine image was in the mind and the heart, or in
the soul and its powers, there was no part even of the body in which some rays
of glory did not shine. It is certain that in every part of the world some
lineaments of divine glory are beheld and hence we may infer, that when his
image is placed in man, there is a kind of tacit antithesis, as it were, setting
man apart from the crowd, and exalting him above all the other creatures. But it
cannot be denied that the angels also were created in the likeness of God,
since, as Christ declares (Mt. 22:30), our highest perfection will consist in
being like them. But it is not without good cause that Moses commends the favour
of God towards us by giving us this peculiar title, the more especially that he
was only comparing man with the visible creation.<br></div>
<div>4. But our definition of the image seems not to be complete until it
appears more clearly what the faculties are in which man excels, and in which he
is to be regarded as a mirror of the divine glory. This, however, cannot be
better known than from the remedy provided for the corruption of nature. It
cannot be doubted that when Adam lost his first estate he became alienated from
God. Wherefore, although we grant that the image of God was not utterly effaced
and destroyed in him, it was, however, so corrupted, that any thing which
remains is fearful deformity; and, therefore, our deliverance begins with that
renovation which we obtain from Christ, who is, therefore, called the second
Adam, because he restores us to true and substantial integrity. For although
Paul, contrasting the quickening Spirit which believers receive from Christ,
with the living soul which Adam was created (1 Cor. 15:45), commends the richer
measure of grace bestowed in regeneration, he does not, however, contradict the
statement, that the end of regeneration is to form us anew in the image of God.
Accordingly, he elsewhere shows that the new man is renewed after the image of
him that created him (Col. 3:19). To this corresponds another passage,
&#8220;Put ye on the new man, who after God is created,&#8221; (Eph. 4:24). We
must now see what particulars Paul comprehends under this renovation. In the
first place, he mentions knowledge, and in the second, true righteousness and
holiness. Hence we infer, that at the beginning the image of God was manifested
by light of intellect, rectitude of heart, and the soundness of every part. For
though I admit that the forms of expression are elliptical, this principle
cannot be overthrown-viz. that the leading feature in the renovation of the
divine image must also have held the highest place in its creation. To the same
effect Paul elsewhere says, that beholding the glory of Christ with unveiled
face, we are transformed into the same image. We now see how Christ is the most
perfect image of God, into which we are so renewed as to bear the image of God
in knowledge, purity, righteousness, and true holiness. This being established,
the imagination of Osiander, as to bodily form, vanishes of its own accord. As
to that passage of St Paul (1 Cor. 11:7), in which the man alone to the express
exclusion of the woman, is called the image and glory of God, it is evident from
the context, that it merely refers to civil order. I presume it has already been
sufficiently proved, that the image comprehends everything which has any
relation to the spiritual and eternal life. The same thing, in different terms,
is declared by St John when he says, that the light which was from the
beginning, in the eternal Word of God, was the light of man (John 1:4). His
object being to extol the singular grace of God in making man excel the other
animals, he at the same time shows how he was formed in the image of God, that
he may separate him from the common herd, as possessing not ordinary animal
existence, but one which combines with it the light of intelligence. Therefore,
as the image of God constitutes the entire excellence of human nature, as it
shone in Adam before his fall, but was afterwards vitiated and almost destroyed,
nothing remaining but a ruin, confused, mutilated, and tainted with impurity, so
it is now partly seen in the elect, in so far as they are regenerated by the
Spirit. Its full lustre, however, will be displayed in heaven. But in order to
know the particular properties in which it consists, it will be proper to treat
of the faculties of the soul. For there is no solidity in Augustine&#8217;s
speculation,<sup>12<a name="fnB118" href="#fn118">[4]</a></sup> that the soul is
a mirror of the Trinity, inasmuch as it comprehends within itself, intellect,
will, and memory. Nor is there probability in the opinion of those who place
likeness to God in the dominion bestowed upon man, as if he only resembled God
in this, that he is appointed lord and master of all things. The likeness must
be within, in himself. It must be something which is not external to him but is
properly the internal good of the soul.<br></div>
<div>5. But before I proceed further, it is necessary to advert to the dream of
the Manichees, which Servetus has attempted in our day to revive. Because it is
said that God breathed into man&#8217;s nostrils the breath of life (Gen. 2:7),
they thought that the soul was a transmission of the substance of God; as if
some portion of the boundless divinity had passed into man. It cannot take long
time to show how many gross and foul absurdities this devilish error carries in
its train. For if the soul of man is a portion transmitted from the essence of
God, the divine nature must not only be liable to passion and change, but also
to ignorance, evil desires, infirmity, and all kinds of vice. There is nothing
more inconstant than man, contrary movements agitating and distracting his soul.
He is ever and anon deluded by want of skill, and overcome by the slightest
temptations; while every one feels that the soul itself is a receptacle for all
kinds of pollution. All these things must be attributed to the divine nature, if
we hold that the soul is of the essence of God, or a secret influx of divinity.
Who does not shudder at a thing so monstrous? Paul, indeed, quoting from Aratus,
tells us we are his offspring (Acts 17:28); not in substance, however, but in
quality, in as much as he has adorned us with divine endowments. Meanwhile, to
lacerate the essence of the Creator, in order to assign a portion to each
individual, is the height of madness. It must, therefore, be held as certain,
that souls, notwithstanding of their having the divine image engraven on them,
are created just as angels are. Creation, however, is not a transfusion of
essence,<sup>12<a name="fnB119" href="#fn119">[5]</a></sup> but a commencement
of it out of nothing. Nor, though the spirit is given by God, and when it quits
the flesh again returns to him, does it follow that it is a portion withdrawn
from his essence.<sup>12<a name="fnB120" href="#fn120">[6]</a></sup> Here, too,
Osiander, carried away by his illusions entangled himself in an impious error,
by denying that the image of God could be in man without his essential
righteousness; as if God were unable, by the mighty power of his Spirit, to
render us conformable to himself, unless Christ were substantially transfused
into us. Under whatever colour some attempt to gloss these delusions, they can
never so blind the eyes of intelligent readers as to prevent them from
discerning in them a revival of Manicheism. But from the words of Paul, when
treating of the renewal of the image (2 Cor. 3:18), the inference is obvious,
that man was conformable to God, not by an influx of substance, but by the grace
and virtue of the Spirit. He says, that by beholding the glory of Christ, we are
transformed into the same image as by the Spirit of the Lord; and certainly the
Spirit does not work in us so as to make us of the same substance with
God.<br></div>
<div>6. It were vain to seek a definition of the soul from philosophers, not one
of whom, with the exception of Plato, distinctly maintained its immortality.
Others of the school of Socrates, indeed, lean the same way, but still without
teaching distinctly a doctrine of which they were not fully persuaded. Plato,
however, advanced still further, and regarded the soul as an image of God.
Others so attach its powers and faculties to the present life, that they leave
nothing external to the body. Moreover, having already shown from Scripture that
the substance of the soul is incorporeal, we must now add, that though it is not
properly enclosed by space, it however occupies the body as a kind of
habitation, not only animating all its parts, and rendering the organs fit and
useful for their actions, but also holding the first place in regulating the
conduct. This it does not merely in regard to the offices of a terrestrial life,
but also in regard to the service of God. This, though not clearly seen in our
corrupt state, yet the impress of its remains is seen in our very vices. For
whence have men such a thirst for glory but from a sense of shame? And whence
this sense of shame but from a respect for what is honourable? Of this, the
first principle and source is a consciousness that they were born to cultivate
righteousness,-a consciousness akin to religion. But as man was undoubtedly
created to meditate on the heavenly life, so it is certain that the knowledge of
it was engraven on the soul. And, indeed, man would want the principal use of
his understanding if he were unable to discern his felicity, the perfection of
which consists in being united to God. Hence, the principal action of the soul
is to aspire thither, and, accordingly, the more a man studies to approach to
God, the more he proves himself to be endued with reason.<br></div>
<div>Though there is some plausibility in the opinion of those who maintain that
man has more than one soul, namely, a sentient and a rational, yet as there is
no soundness in their arguments, we must reject it, unless we would torment
ourselves with things frivolous and useless. They tell us (see chap. 5 sec. 4),
there is a great repugnance between organic movements and the rational part of
the soul. As if reason also were not at variance with herself, and her counsels
sometimes conflicting with each other like hostile armies. But since this
disorder results from the depravation of nature, it is erroneous to infer that
there are two souls, because the faculties do not accord so harmoniously as they
ought. But I leave it to philosophers to discourse more subtilely of these
faculties. For the edification of the pious, a simple definition will be
sufficient. I admit, indeed, that what they ingeniously teach on the subject is
true, and not only pleasant, but also useful to be known; nor do I forbid any
who are inclined to prosecute the study. First, I admit that there are five
senses, which Plato (in The&Ecirc;teto) prefers calling organs, by which all
objects are brought into a common sensorium, as into a kind of
receptacle:<sup>12<a name="fnB121" href="#fn121">[7]</a></sup> Next comes the
imagination (<i>phantasia</i>), which distinguishes between the objects brought
into the sensorium: Next, reason, to which the general power of Judgment
belongs: And, lastly, intellect, which contemplates with fixed and quiet look
whatever reason discursively revolves. In like
manner,<sup>12<a name="fnB122" href="#fn122">[8]</a></sup> to intellect, fancy,
and reason, the three cognitive faculties of the soul, correspond three appetite
faculties-viz. will-whose office is to choose whatever reason and intellect
propound; irascibility, which seizes on what is set before it by reason and
fancy; and concupiscence, which lays hold of the objects presented by sense and
fancy.<br></div>
<div>Though these things are true, or at least plausible, still, as I fear they
are more fitted to entangle, by their obscurity, than to assist us, I think it
best to omit them. If any one chooses to distribute the powers of the mind in a
different manner, calling one appetive, which, though devoid of reason, yet
obeys reason, if directed from a different quarter, and another intellectual, as
being by itself participant of reason, I have no great objection. Nor am I
disposed to quarrel with the view, that there are three principles of
action-viz. sense, intellect, and appetite. But let us rather adopt a division
adapted to all capacities-a thing which certainly is not to be obtained from
philosophers. For they,<sup>12<a name="fnB123" href="#fn123">[9]</a></sup> when
they would speak most plainly, divide the soul into appetite and intellect, but
make both double. To the latter they sometimes give the name of
<i>contemplative</i>, as being contented with mere knowledge and having no
active powers (which circumstance makes Cicero designate it by the name of
intellect, <i>ingenii</i>) (De Fin. lib. 5). At other times they give it the
name of <i>practical</i>, because it variously moves the will by the
apprehension of good or evil. Under this class is included the art of living
well and justly. The former-viz. appetite-they divide into will and
concupiscence, calling it <font face="Graeca">bouvlesi"</font>, so whenever the
appetite, which they call <font face="Graeca">oJrmhv</font>, obeys the reason.
But when appetite, casting off the yoke of reason, runs to intemperance, they
call it <font face="Graeca">pavtho"</font>. Thus they always presuppose in man a
reason by which he is able to guide himself aright.<br></div>
<div>7. From this method of teaching we are forced somewhat to dissent. For
philosophers, being unacquainted with the corruption of nature, which is the
punishment of revolt, erroneously confound two states of man which are very
different from each other. Let us therefore hold, for the purpose of the present
work, that the soul consists of two parts, the intellect and the will (Book 2
chap. 2 sec. 2, 12),-the office of the intellect being to distinguish between
objects, according as they seem deserving of being approved or disapproved; and
the office of the will, to choose and follow what the intellect declares to be
good, to reject and shun what it declares to be bad (Plato, in Ph&Ecirc;dro). We
dwell not on the subtlety of Aristotle, that the mind has no motion of itself;
but that the moving power is choice, which he also terms the appetite intellect.
Not to lose ourselves in superfluous questions, let it be enough to know that
the intellect is to us, as it were, the guide and ruler of the soul; that the
will always follows its beck, and waits for its decision, in matters of desire.
For which reason Aristotle truly taught, that in the appetite there is a pursuit
and rejection corresponding in some degree to affirmation and negation in the
intellect (Aristot. Ethic. lib. 6 sec. 2). Moreover, it will be seen in another
place (Book 2 c. 2 see. 12-26), how surely the intellect governs the will. Here
we only wish to observe, that the soul does not possess any faculty which may
not be duly referred to one or other of these members. And in this way we
comprehend sense under intellect. Others distinguish thus: They say that sense
inclines to pleasure in the same way as the intellect to good; that hence the
appetite of sense becomes concupiscence and lust, while the affection of the
intellect becomes will. For the term appetite, which they prefer, I use that of
will, as being more common.<br></div>
<div>8. Therefore, God has provided the soul of man with intellect, by which he
might discern good from evil, just from unjust, and might know what to follow or
to shun, reason going before with her lamp; whence philosophers, in reference to
her directing power, have called her <font face="Graeca">to;
eJgemoniko;n</font>.<sup> </sup> To this he has joined will, to which choice
belongs. Man excelled in these noble endowments in his primitive condition, when
reason, intelligence, prudence, and Judgment, not only sufficed for the
government of his earthly life, but also enabled him to rise up to God and
eternal happiness. Thereafter choice was added to direct the appetites, and
temper all the organic motions; the will being thus perfectly submissive to the
authority of reason. In this upright state, man possessed freedom of will, by
which, if he chose, he was able to obtain eternal life. It were here
unseasonable to introduce the question concerning the secret predestination of
God, because we are not considering what might or might not happen, but what the
nature of man truly was. Adam, therefore, might have stood if he chose, since it
was only by his own will that he fell; but it was because his will was pliable
in either directions and he had not received constancy to persevere, that he so
easily fell. Still he had a free choice of good and evil; and not only so, but
in the mind and will there was the highest rectitude, and all the organic parts
were duly framed to obedience, until man corrupted its good properties, and
destroyed himself.<sup> </sup> Hence the great darkness of philosophers who have
looked for a complete building in a ruin, and fit arrangement in disorder. The
principle they set out with was, that man could not be a rational animal unless
he had a free choice of good and evil. They also imagined that the distinction
between virtue and vice was destroyed, if man did not of his own counsel arrange
his life. So far well, had there been no change in man. This being unknown to
them, it is not surprising that they throw every thing into confusion. But those
who, while they profess to be the disciples of Christ, still seek for free-will
in man, notwithstanding of his being lost and drowned in spiritual destruction,
labour under manifold delusion, making a heterogeneous mixture of inspired
doctrine and philosophical opinions, and so erring as to both. But it will be
better to leave these things to their own place (see Book 2 chap. 2) At present
it is necessary only to remember, that man, at his first creation, was very
different from all his posterity; who, deriving their origin from him after he
was corrupted, received a hereditary taint. At first every part of the soul was
formed to rectitude. There was soundness of mind and freedom of will to choose
the good. If any one objects that it was placed, as it were, in a slippery
position, because its power was weak, I answer, that the degree conferred was
sufficient to take away every excuse. For surely the Deity could not be tied
down to this condition,-to make man such, that he either could not or would not
sin. Such a nature might have been more
excellent;<sup>13<a name="fnB124" href="#fn124">[0]</a></sup> but to expostulate
with God as if he had been bound to confer this nature on man, is more than
unjust, seeing he had full right to determine how much or how little He would
give. Why He did not sustain him by the virtue of perseverance is hidden in his
counsel; it is ours to keep within the bounds of soberness. Man had received the
power, if he had the will, but he had not the will which would have given the
power; for this will would have been followed by perseverance. Still, after he
had received so much, there is no excuse for his having spontaneously brought
death upon himself. No necessity was laid upon God to give him more than that
intermediate and even transient will, that out of man&#8217;s fall he might
extract materials for his own glory.<br></div>

<div>1. IT were cold and lifeless to represent God as a momentary Creator, who
completed his work once for all, and then left it. Here, especially, we must
dissent from the profane, and maintain that the presence of the divine power is
conspicuous, not less in the perpetual condition of the world then in its first
creation. For, although even wicked men are forced, by the mere view of the
earth and sky, to rise to the Creator, yet faith has a method of its own in
assigning the whole praise of creation to God. To this effect is the passage of
the Apostle already quoted that by faith we understand that the worlds were
framed by the Word of God (Heb. 11:3); because, without proceeding to his
Providence, we cannot understand the full force of what is meant by God being
the Creator, how much soever we may seem to comprehend it with our mind, and
confess it with our tongue. The carnal mind, when once it has perceived the
power of God in the creation, stops there, and, at the farthest, thinks and
ponders on nothing else than the wisdom, power, and goodness displayed by the
Author of such a work (matters which rise spontaneously, and force themselves on
the notice even of the unwilling), or on some general agency on which the power
of motion depends, exercised in preserving and governing it. In short, it
imagines that all things are sufficiently sustained by the energy divinely
infused into them at first. But faith must penetrate deeper. After learning that
there is a Creator, it must forthwith infer that he is also a Governor and
Preserver, and that, not by producing a kind of general motion in the machine of
the globe as well as in each of its parts, but by a special providence
sustaining, cherishing, superintending, all the things which he has made, to the
very minutest, even to a sparrow. Thus David, after briefly premising that the
world was created by God, immediately descends to the continual course of
Providence, &#8220;By the word of the Lord were the heavens framed, and all the
host of them by the breath of his mouth;&#8221; immediately adding, &#8220;The
Lord looketh from heaven, he beholdeth the children of men,&#8221; (Ps. 33:6,
13, &amp;c). He subjoins other things to the same effect. For although all do
not reason so accurately, yet because it would not be credible that human
affairs were superintended by God, unless he were the maker of the world, and no
one could seriously believe that he is its Creator without feeling convinced
that he takes care of his works; David with good reason, and in admirable order,
leads us from the one to the other. In general, indeed, philosophers teach, and
the human mind conceives, that all the parts of the world are invigorated by the
secret inspiration of God. They do not, however reach the height to which David
rises taking all the pious along with him, when he says, &#8220;These wait all
upon thee, that thou mayest give them their meat in due season. That thou givest
them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good. Thou
hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and
return to their dust. Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created, and thou
renewest the face of the earth,&#8221; (Ps. 104:27-30). Nay, though they
subscribe to the sentiment of Paul, that in God &#8220;we live, and move, and
have our being,&#8221; (Acts 17:28), yet they are far from having a serious
apprehension of the grace which he commends, because they have not the least
relish for that special care in which alone the paternal favour of God is
discerned.<br></div>
<div>2. That this distinction may be the more manifest, we must consider that
the Providence of God, as taught in Scripture, is opposed to fortune and
fortuitous causes. By an erroneous opinion prevailing in all ages, an opinion
almost universally prevailing in our own day-viz. that all things happen
fortuitously, the true doctrine of Providence has not only been obscured, but
almost buried. If one falls among robbers, or ravenous beasts; if a sudden gust
of wind at sea causes shipwreck; if one is struck down by the fall of a house or
a tree; if another, when wandering through desert paths, meets with deliverance;
or, after being tossed by the waves, arrives in port, and makes some wondrous
hair-breadth escape from death-all these occurrences, prosperous as well as
adverse, carnal sense will attribute to fortune. But whose has learned from the
mouth of Christ that all the hairs of his head are numbered (Mt. 10:30), will
look farther for the cause, and hold that all events whatsoever are governed by
the secret counsel of God. With regard to inanimate objects again we must hold
that though each is possessed of its peculiar properties, yet all of them exert
their force only in so far as directed by the immediate hand of God. Hence they
are merely instruments, into which God constantly infuses what energy he sees
meet, and turns and converts to any purpose at his pleasure. No created object
makes a more wonderful or glorious display than the sun. For, besides
illuminating the whole world with its brightness, how admirably does it foster
and invigorate all animals by its heat, and fertilise the earth by its rays,
warming the seeds of grain in its lap, and thereby calling forth the verdant
blade! This it supports, increases, and strengthens with additional nurture,
till it rises into the stalk; and still feeds it with perpetual moisture, till
it comes into flower; and from flower to fruit, which it continues to ripen till
it attains maturity. In like manner, by its warmth trees and vines bud, and put
forth first their leaves, then their blossom, then their fruit. And the Lord,
that he might claim the entire glory of these things as his own, was pleased
that light should exist, and that the earth should be replenished with all kinds
of herbs and fruits before he made the sun. No pious man, therefore, will make
the sun either the necessary or principal cause of those things which existed
before the creation of the sun, but only the instrument which God employs,
because he so pleases; though he can lay it aside, and act equally well by
himself: Again, when we read, that at the prayer of Joshua the sun was stayed in
its course (Josh. 10:13); that as a favour to Hezekiah, its shadow receded ten
degrees (2 Kings 20:11); by these miracles God declared that the sun does not
daily rise and set by a blind instinct of nature, but is governed by Him in its
course, that he may renew the remembrance of his paternal favour toward us.
Nothing is more natural than for spring, in its turns to succeed winter, summer
spring, and autumn summer; but in this series the variations are so great and so
unequal as to make it very apparent that every single year, month, and day, is
regulated by a new and special providence of God.<br></div>
<div>3. And truly God claims omnipotence to himself, and would have us to
acknowledge it,-not the vain, indolent, slumbering omnipotence which sophists
feign, but vigilant, efficacious, energetic, and ever active,-not an omnipotence
which may only act as a general principle of confused motion, as in ordering a
stream to keep within the channel once prescribed to it, but one which is intent
on individual and special movements. God is deemed omnipotent, not because he
can act though he may cease or be idle, or because by a general instinct he
continues the order of nature previously appointed; but because, governing
heaven and earth by his providence, he so overrules all things that nothing
happens without his counsel. For when it is said in the Psalms, &#8220;He has
done whatsoever he has pleased,&#8221; (Ps. 115:3), the thing meant is his sure
and deliberate purpose. It were insipid to interpret the Psalmist&#8217;s words
in philosophic fashion, to mean that God is the primary agent, because the
beginning and cause of all motion. This rather is the solace of the faithful, in
their adversity, that every thing which they endure is by the ordination and
command of God, that they are under his hand. But if the government of God thus
extends to all his works, it is a childish cavil to confine it to natural
influx.<sup>13<a name="fnB125" href="#fn125">[1]</a></sup> Those moreover who
confine the providence of God within narrow limits, as if he allowed all things
to be borne along freely according to a perpetual law of nature, do not more
defraud God of his glory than themselves of a most useful doctrine; for nothing
were more wretched than man if he were exposed to all possible movements of the
sky, the air, the earth, and the water. We may add, that by this view the
singular goodness of God towards each individual is unbecomingly impaired. David
exclaims (Ps. 8:3), that infants hanging at their mothers breasts are eloquent
enough to celebrate the glory of God, because, from the very moment of their
births they find an aliment prepared for them by heavenly care. Indeed, if we do
not shut our eyes and senses to the fact, we must see that some mothers have
full provision for their infants, and others almost none, according as it is the
pleasure of God to nourish one child more liberally, and another more sparingly.
Those who attribute due praise to the omnipotence of God thereby derive a double
benefit. He to whom heaven and earth belong, and whose nod all creatures must
obey, is fully able to reward the homage which they pay to him, and they can
rest secure in the protection of Him to whose control everything that could do
them harm is subject, by whose authority, Satan, with all his furies and
engines, is curbed as with a bridle, and on whose will everything adverse to our
safety depends. In this way, and in no other, can the immoderate and
superstitious fears, excited by the dangers to which we are exposed, be calmed
or subdued. I say superstitious fears. For such they are, as often as the
dangers threatened by any created objects inspire us with such terror, that we
tremble as if they had in themselves a power to hurt us, or could hurt at random
or by chance; or as if we had not in God a sufficient protection against them.
For example, Jeremiah forbids the children of God &#8220; to be dismayed at the
signs of heaven, as the heathen are dismayed at them,&#8221; (Jer. 10:2). He
does not, indeed, condemn every kind of fear. But as unbelievers transfer the
government of the world from God to the stars, imagining that happiness or
misery depends on their decrees or presages, and not on the Divine will, the
consequence is, that their fear, which ought to have reference to him only, is
diverted to stars and comets. Let him, therefore, who would beware of such
unbelief, always bear in mind, that there is no random power, or agency, or
motion in the creatures, who are so governed by the secret counsel of God, that
nothing happens but what he has knowingly and willingly
decreed.<sup>13<a name="fnB126" href="#fn126">[2]</a></sup><br></div>
<div>4. First, then, let the reader remember that the providence we mean is not
one by which the Deity, sitting idly in heaven, looks on at what is taking place
in the world, but one by which he, as it were, holds the helms and overrules all
events. Hence his providence extends not less to the hand than to the
eye.<sup>13<a name="fnB127" href="#fn127">[3]</a></sup> When Abraham said to his
son, <i>God will provide</i> (Gen. 22:8), he meant not merely to assert that the
future event was foreknown to Gods but to resign the management of an unknown
business to the will of Him whose province it is to bring perplexed and dubious
matters to a happy result. Hence it appears that providence consists in action.
What many talk of bare prescience is the merest trifling. Those do not err quite
so grossly who attribute government to God, but still, as I have observed, a
confused and promiscuous government which consists in giving an impulse and
general movement to the machine of the globe and each of its parts, but does not
specially direct the action of every creature. It is impossible, however, to
tolerate this error. For, according to its abettors, there is nothing in this
providence, which they call universal, to prevent all the creatures from being
moved contingently, or to prevent man from turning himself in this direction or
in that, according to the mere freedom of his own will. In this ways they make
man a partner with God,-God, by his energy, impressing man with the movement by
which he can act, agreeably to the nature conferred upon him while man
voluntarily regulates his own actions. In short, their doctrine is, that the
world, the affairs of men, and men themselves, are governed by the power, but
not by the decree of God. I say nothing of the Epicureans (a pest with which the
world has always been plagued), who dream of an inert and idle
God,<sup>13<a name="fnB128" href="#fn128">[4]</a></sup> and others, not a whit
sounder, who of old feigned that God rules the upper regions of the air, but
leaves the inferior to Fortune. Against such evident madness even dumb creatures
lift their voice.<br></div>
<div>My intention now is, to refute an opinion which has very generally
obtained-an opinion which, while it concedes to God some blind and equivocal
movement, withholds what is of principal moment-viz. the disposing and directing
of every thing to its proper end by incomprehensible wisdom. By withholding
government, it makes God the ruler of the world in name only, not in reality.
For what, I ask, is meant by government, if it be not to preside so as to
regulate the destiny of that over which you preside? I do not, however, totally
repudiate what is said of an universal providence, provided, on the other hand,
it is conceded to me that the world is governed by God, not only because he
maintains the order of nature appointed by him, but because he takes a special
charge of every one of his works. It is true, indeed, that each species of
created objects is moved by a secret instinct of nature, as if they obeyed the
eternal command of God, and spontaneously followed the course which God at first
appointed. And to this we may refer our Saviour&#8217;s words, that he and his
Father have always been at work from the beginning (John 5:17); also the words
of Paul, that &#8220;in him we live, and move, and have our being,&#8221; (Acts
17:28); also the words of the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, who, when
wishing to prove the divinity of Christ, says, that he upholdeth &#8220;all
things by the word of his power,&#8221; (Heb. 1:3). But some, under pretext of
the general, hide and obscure the special providence, which is so surely and
clearly taught in Scripture, that it is strange how any one can bring himself to
doubt of it. And, indeed, those who interpose that disguise are themselves
forced to modify their doctrine, by adding that many things are done by the
special care of God. This, however, they erroneously confine to particular acts.
The thing to be proved, therefore, is, that single events are so regulated by
God, and all events so proceed from his determinate counsel, that nothing
happens fortuitously.<br></div>
<div>5. Assuming that the beginning of motion belongs to God, but that all
things move spontaneously or casually, according to the impulse which nature
gives, the vicissitudes of day and nights summer and winter, will be the work of
God; inasmuch as he, in assigning the office of each, appointed a certain law,
namely, that they should always with uniform tenor observe the same course, day
succeeding night, month succeeding month, and year succeeding year. But, as at
one time, excessive heat, combined with drought, burns up the fields; at another
time excessive rains rot the crops, while sudden devastation is produced by
tempests and storms of hail, these will not be the works of God, unless in so
far as rainy or fair weather, heat or cold, are produced by the concourse of the
stars, and other natural causes. According to this view, there is no place left
either for the paternal favour, or the Judgments of God. If it is said that God
fully manifests his beneficence to the human race, by furnishing heaven and
earth with the ordinary power of producing food, the explanation is meagre and
heathenish: as if the fertility of one year were not a special blessing, the
penury and dearth of another a special punishment and curse from God. But as it
would occupy too much time to enumerate all the arguments, let the authority of
God himself suffice. In the Law and the Prophets he repeatedly declares, that as
often as he waters the earth with dew and rain, he manifests his favour, that by
his command the heaven becomes hard as iron, the crops are destroyed by mildew
and other evils, that storms and hail, in devastating the fields, are signs of
sure and special vengeance. This being admitted, it is certain that not a drop
of rain falls without the express command of God. David, indeed (Ps. 146:9),
extols the general providence of God in supplying food to the young ravens that
cry to him but when God himself threatens living creatures with famine, does he
not plainly declare that they are all nourished by him, at one time with scanty,
at another with more ample measure? It is childish, as I have already said, to
confine this to particular acts, when Christ says, without reservation, that not
a sparrow falls to the ground without the will of his Father (Mt. 10:29).
Surely, if the flight of birds is regulated by the counsel of God, we must
acknowledge with the prophet, that while he &#8220;dwelleth on high,&#8221; he
&#8220;humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and in the
earth,&#8221; (Ps. 113:5, 6).<br></div>
<div>6. But as we know that it was chiefly for the sake of mankind that the
world was made, we must look to this as the end which God has in view in the
government of it. The prophet Jeremiah exclaims, &#8220;O Lord, I know that the
way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his
steps,&#8221; (Jer. 10:23). Solomon again says, &#8220;Man&#8217;s goings are of
the Lord: how can a man then understand his own way?&#8221; (Prov. 20:24). Will
it now be said that man is moved by God according to the bent of his nature, but
that man himself gives the movement any direction he pleases? Were it truly so,
man would have the full disposal of his own ways. To this it will perhaps be
answered, that man can do nothing without the power of God. But the answer will
not avail, since both Jeremiah and Solomon attribute to God not power only, but
also election and decree. And Solomon, in another place, elegantly rebukes the
rashness of men in fixing their plans without reference to God, as if they were
not led by his hand. &#8220;The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer
of the tongue, is from the Lord,&#8221; (Prov. 16:1). It is a strange
infatuation, surely for miserable men, who cannot even give utterance except in
so far as God pleases, to begin to act without him! Scriptures moreover, the
better to show that every thing done in the world is according to his decree,
declares that the things which seem most fortuitous are subject to him. For what
seems more attributable to chance than the branch which falls from a tree, and
kills the passing traveller? But the Lord sees very differently, and declares
that He delivered him into the hand of the slayer (Exod. 21:13). In like manners
who does not attribute the lot to the blindness of Fortune? Not so the Lord, who
claims the decision for himself (Prov. 16:33). He says not, that by his power
the lot is thrown into the lap, and taken out, but declares that the only thing
which could be attributed to chance is from him. To the same effect are the
words of Solomon, &#8220;The poor and the deceitful man meet together; the Lord
lighteneth both their eyes,&#8221; (Prov. 29:13). For although rich and poor are
mingled together in the world, in saying that the condition of each is divinely
appointed, he reminds us that God, Who enlightens all, has his own eye always
open, and thus exhorts the poor to patient endurance, seeing that those who are
discontented with their lot endeavour to shake off a burden which God has
imposed upon them. Thus, too, another prophet upbraids the profane, who ascribe
it to human industry, or to fortune, that some grovel in the mire while others
rise to honour. &#8220;Promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the
west, nor from the south. But God is the judge: he putteth down ones and setteth
up another,&#8221; (Ps. 75:6, 7). Because God cannot divest himself of the
office of judge, he infers that to his secret counsel it is owing that some are
elevated, while others remain without honour.<br></div>
<div>7. Nay, I affirm in general, that particular events are evidences of the
special providence of God. In the wilderness God caused a south wind to blow,
and brought the people a plentiful supply of birds (Exod. 19:13). When he
desired that Jonah should be thrown into the sea, he sent forth a whirlwind.
Those who deny that God holds the reins of government will say that this was
contrary to ordinary practice, whereas I infer from it that no wind ever rises
or rages without his special command. In no way could it be true that &#8220;he
maketh the winds his messengers, and the flames of fire his ministers;&#8221;
that &#8220;he maketh the clouds his chariot, and walketh upon the wings of the
wind,&#8221; (Ps. 104:3, 4), did he not at pleasure drive the clouds and winds
and therein manifest the special presence of his power. In like manner, we are
elsewhere taught, that whenever the sea is raised into a storm, its billows
attest the special presence of God. &#8220;He commandeth and raiseth the stormy
wind, which lifteth up the waves.&#8221; &#8220;He maketh the storm a calm, so
that the waves thereof are still,&#8221; (Ps. 107:25, 29 ) He also elsewhere
declares, that he had smitten the people with blasting and mildew (Amos 4:9).
Again while man naturally possesses the power of continuing his species, God
describes it as a mark of his special favour, that while some continue
childless, others are blessed with offspring: for the fruit of the womb is his
gift. Hence the words of Jacob to Rachel, &#8220;Am I in God&#8217;s stead, who
has withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?&#8221; (Gen. 30:2). To conclude in
one word. Nothing in nature is more ordinary than that we should be nourished
with bread. But the Spirit declares not only that the produce of the earth is
God&#8217;s special gift, but &#8220;that man does not live by bread
only,&#8221; (Deut. 8:3), because it is not mere fulness that nourishes him but
the secret blessing of God. And hence, on the other hand, he threatens to take
away &#8220;the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay
of water,&#8221; (Is. 3:1). Indeed, there could be no serious meaning in our
prayer for daily bread, if God did not with paternal hand supply us with food.
Accordingly, to convince the faithful that God, in feeding them, fulfils the
office of the best of parents, the prophet reminds them that he &#8220;giveth
food to all flesh,&#8221; (Ps. 136:25). In fine, when we hear on the one hand,
that &#8220;the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open
unto their cry,&#8221; and, on the other hand, that &#8220;the face of the Lord
is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the
earth,&#8221; (Ps. 34:15, 16), let us be assured that all creatures above and
below are ready at his service, that he may employ them in whatever way he
pleases. Hence we infer, not only that the general providence of God, continuing
the order of nature, extends over the creatures, but that by his wonderful
counsel they are adapted to a certain and special purpose.<br></div>
<div>8. Those who would cast obloquy on this doctrine, calumniate it as the
dogma of the Stoics concerning fate. The same charge was formerly brought
against Augustine (lib. ad Bonifac. 2, c. 6 et alibi). We are unwilling to
dispute about words; but we do not admit the term Fate, both because it is of
the class which Paul teaches us to shun, as profane novelties (1 Tim. 6:20), and
also because it is attempted, by means of an odious term, to fix a stigma on the
truth of God. But the dogma itself is falsely and maliciously imputed to us. For
we do not with the Stoics imagine a necessity consisting of a perpetual chain of
causes, and a kind of involved series contained in nature, but we hold that God
is the disposer and ruler of all things,-that from the remotest eternity,
according to his own wisdom, he decreed what he was to do, and now by his power
executes what he decreed.<sup> </sup> Hence we maintain, that by his providence,
not heaven and earth and inanimate creatures only, but also the counsels and
wills of men are so governed as to move exactly in the course which he has
destined. What, then, you will say, does nothing happen fortuitously, nothing
contingently? I answer, it was a true saying of Basil the Great, that Fortune
and Chance are heathen terms; the meaning of which ought not to occupy pious
minds. For if all success is blessing from God, and calamity and adversity are
his curse, there is no place left in human affairs for fortune and chance. We
ought also to be moved by the words of Augustine (Retract. lib. 1 cap. 1),
&#8220;In my writings against the Academics,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I regret
having so often used the term Fortune; although I intended to denote by it not
some goddess, but the fortuitous issue of events in external matters, whether
good or evil. Hence, too, those words, Perhaps, Perchance,
Fortuitously,<sup>13<a name="fnB129" href="#fn129">[5]</a></sup> which no
religion forbids us to use, though everything must be referred to Divine
Providence. Nor did I omit to observe this when I said, Although, perhaps, that
which is vulgarly called Fortune, is also regulated by a hidden order, and what
we call Chance is nothing else than that the reason and cause of which is
secret. It is true, I so spoke, but I repent of having mentioned Fortune there
as I did, when I see the very bad custom which men have of saying, not as they
ought to do, &euml;So God pleased,&#8217; but, &euml;So Fortune pleased.&#8217;
&#8220; In short, Augustine everywhere teaches, that if anything is left to
fortune, the world moves at random. And although he elsewhere declares
(Qu&Ecirc;stionum, lib. 83). that all things are carried on, partly by the free
will of man, and partly by the Providence of God, he shortly after shows clearly
enough that his meaning was, that men also are ruled by Providence, when he
assumes it as a principle, that there cannot be a greater absurdity than to hold
that anything is done without the ordination of God; because it would happen at
random. For which reason, he also excludes the contingency which depends on
human will, maintaining a little further on, in clearer terms, that no cause
must be sought for but the will of God. When he uses the term permission, the
meaning which he attaches to it will best appear from a single passage (De
Trinity. lib. 3 cap. 4), where he proves that the will of God is the supreme and
primary cause of all things, because nothing happens without his order or
permission. He certainly does not figure God sitting idly in a watch-tower, when
he chooses to permit anything. The will which he represents as interposing is,
if I may so express it, active (<i>actualis</i>), and but for this could not be
regarded as a cause.<br></div>
<div>9. But since our sluggish minds rest far beneath the height of Divine
Providence, we must have recourse to a distinction which may assist them in
rising. I say then, that though all things are ordered by the counsel and
certain arrangement of God, to us, however, they are fortuitous,-not because we
imagine that Fortune rules the world and mankind, and turns all things upside
down at random (far be such a heartless thought from every Christian breast);
but as the order, method, end, and necessity of events, are, for the most part,
hidden in the counsel of God, though it is certain that they are produced by the
will of God, they have the appearance of being fortuitous, such being the form
under which they present themselves to us, whether considered in their own
nature, or estimated according to our knowledge and Judgment. Let us suppose,
for example, that a merchant, after entering a forest in company with
trust-worthy individuals, imprudently strays from his companions and wanders
bewildered till he falls into a den of robbers and is murdered. His death was
not only foreseen by the eye of God, but had been fixed by his decree. For it is
said, not that he foresaw how far the life of each individual should extend, but
that he determined and fixed the bounds which could not be passed (Job 14:5).
Still, in relation to our capacity of discernment, all these things appear
fortuitous. How will the Christian feel? Though he will consider that every
circumstance which occurred in that person&#8217;s death was indeed in its
nature fortuitous, he will have no doubt that the Providence of God overruled it
and guided fortune to his own end. The same thing holds in the case of future
contingencies. All future events being uncertain to us, seem in suspense as if
ready to take either direction. Still, however, the impression remains seated in
our hearts, that nothing will happen which the Lord has not provided. In this
sense the term event is repeatedly used in Ecclesiastes, because, at the first
glance, men do not penetrate to the primary cause which lies concealed. And yet,
what is taught in Scripture of the secret providence of God was never so
completely effaced from the human heart, as that some sparks did not always
shine in the darkness. Thus the soothsayers of the Philistine, though they waver
in uncertainty, attribute the adverse event partly to God and partly to chance.
If the ark, say they, &#8220;Goes up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemish,
then he has done us this great evil; but if not, then we shall know that it is
not his hand that smote us, it was a chance that happened to us.&#8221; (1 Sam.
6:9). Foolishly, indeed, when divination fails them they flee to fortune. Still
we see them constrained, so as not to venture to regard their disaster as
fortuitous. But the mode in which God, by the curb of his Providence, turns
events in whatever direction he pleases, will appear from a remarkable example.
At the very same moment when David was discovered in the wilderness of Maon, the
Philistines make an inroad into the country, and Saul is forced to depart (1
Sam. 23:26, 27). If God, in order to provide for the safety of his servant,
threw this obstacle in the way of Saul, we surely cannot say, that though the
Philistine took up arms contrary to human expectation, they did it by chance.
What seems to us contingence, faith will recognise as the secret impulse of God.
The reason is not always equally apparent, but we ought undoubtedly to hold that
all the changes which take place in the world are produced by the secret agency
of the hand of God. At the same time, that which God has determined, though it
must come to pass, is not, however, precisely, or in its own nature, necessary.
We have a familiar example in the case of our Saviour&#8217;s bones. As he
assumed a body similar to ours, no sane man will deny that his bones were
capable of being broken and yet it was impossible that they should be broken
(John 19:33, 36). Hence, again, we see that there was good ground for the
distinction which the Schoolmen made between necessity, <i>secundum quid</i>,
and necessity absolute, also between the necessity of <i>consequent</i> and of
<i>consequence</i>. God made the bones of his Son frangible, though he exempted
them from actual fracture; and thus, in reference to the necessity of his
counsel, made that impossible which might have naturally taken place.<sup>

17.</i></b></font></h2>
<div><font size="5">USE TO BE MADE OF THE DOCTRINE OF
PROVIDENCE.</font><br></div>
<div>This chapter may be conveniently divided into two parts:-I. A general
explanation is given of the doctrine of Divine Providence, in so far as
conducive to the solid instruction and consolation of the godly, sect. 1, and
specially sect. 2-12. First, however, those are refuted who deny that the world
is governed by the secret and incomprehensible counsel of God; those also who
throw the blame of all wickedness upon God, and absurdly pretend that exercises
of piety are useless, sect. 2-5. Thereafter is added a holy meditation on Divine
Providence, which, in the case of prosperity, is painted to the life, sect.
6-11.<br></div>
<div>II. A solution of two objections from passages of Scripture, which
attribute repentance to God, and speak of something like an abrogation of his
decrees.<br></div>
<div><i>Sections.</i><br></div>
<div>1.	 Summary of the doctrine of Divine Providence. 1. It embraces the future
and the past. 2. It works by means, without means, and against means. 3.
Mankind, and particularly the Church, the object of special care. 4. The mode of
administration usually secret, but always just. This last point more fully
considered.<br></div>
<div>2.	 The profane denial that the world is governed by the secret counsel of
God, refuted by passages of Scripture. Salutary counsel.<br></div>
<div>3.	 This doctrine, as to the secret counsel of God in the government of the
world, gives no countenance either to the impiety of those who throw the blame
of their wickedness upon God, the petulance of those who reject means, or the
error of those who neglect the duties of religion.<br></div>
<div>4.	 As regards future events, the doctrine of Divine Providence not
inconsistent with deliberation on the part of man.<br></div>
<div>5.	 In regard to past events, it is absurd to argue that crimes ought not
to be punished, because they are in accordance with the divine decrees. 1. The
wicked resist the declared will of God. 2. They are condemned by conscience. 3.
The essence and guilt of the crime is in themselves, though God uses them as
instruments.<br></div>
<div>6.	 A holy meditation on Divine Providence. 1. All events happen by the
ordination of God. 2. All things contribute to the advantage of the godly. 3.
The hearts of men and all their endeavours are in the hand of God. 4. Providence
watches for the safety of the righteous. 5. God has a special care of his
elect.<br></div>
<div>7.	 Meditation on Providence continued. 6. God in various ways curbs and
defeats the enemies of the Church. 7. He overrules all creatures, even Satan
himself, for the good of his people.<br></div>
<div>8.	 Meditation on Providence continued. 8. He trains the godly to patience
and moderation. Examples. Joseph, Job, and David. 9. He shakes off their
lethargy, and urges them to repentance.<br></div>
<div>9.	 Meditation continued. 10. The right use of inferior causes explained.
11. When the godly become negligent or imprudent in the discharge of duty,
Providence reminds them of their fault. 12. It condemns the iniquities of the
wicked. 13. It produces a right consideration of the future, rendering the
servants of God prudent, diligent, and active. 14. It causes them to resign
themselves to the wisdom and omnipotence of God, and, at the same time, makes
them diligent in their calling.<br></div>
<div>10.	 Meditation continued. 15. Though human life is beset with innumerable
evils, the righteous, trusting to Divine Providence, feel perfectly
secure.<br></div>
<div>11.	 The use of the foregoing meditation.<br></div>
<div>12.	 The second part of the chapter, disposing of two objections. 1. That
Scripture represents God as changing his purpose, or repenting, and that,
therefore, his Providence is not fixed. Answer to this first objection. Proof
from Scripture that God cannot repent.<br></div>
<div>13.	 Why repentance attributed to God.<br></div>
<div>14.	 Second objection, that Scripture speaks of an annulment of the divine
decrees. Objection answered. Answer confirmed by an example.<br></div>
<div>1. MOREOVER, such is the proneness of the human mind to indulge in vain
subtleties, that it becomes almost impossible for those who do not see the sound
and proper use of this doctrine, to avoid entangling themselves in perplexing
difficulties. It will, therefore, be proper here to advert to the end which
Scripture has in view in teaching that all things are divinely ordained. And it
is to be observed, first, that the Providence of God is to be considered with
reference both to the past and the future; and, secondly, that in overruling all
things, it works at one time with means, at another without means, and at
another against means. Lastly, the design of God is to show that He takes care
of the whole human race, but is especially vigilant in governing the Church,
which he favours with a closer inspection. Moreover, we must add, that although
the paternal favour and beneficence, as well as the judicial severity of God, is
often conspicuous in the whole course of his Providence, yet occasionally as the
causes of events are concealed, the thought is apt to rise, that human affairs
are whirled about by the blind impulse of Fortune, or our carnal nature inclines
us to speak as if God were amusing himself by tossing men up and down like
balls. It is true, indeed, that if with sedate and quiet minds we were disposed
to learn, the issue would at length make it manifest, that the counsel of God
was in accordance with the highest reason, that his purpose was either to train
his people to patience, correct their depraved affections, tame their
wantonness, inure them to self-denial, and arouse them from torpor; or, on the
other hand, to cast down the proud, defeat the craftiness of the ungodly, and
frustrate all their schemes. How much soever causes may escape our notice, we
must feel assured that they are deposited with him, and accordingly exclaim with
David, &#8220;Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done,
and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: if I would declare and speak of them,
they are more than can be numbered,&#8221; (Ps. 40:5). For while our adversities
ought always to remind us of our sins, that the punishment may incline us to
repentance, we see, moreover, how Christ declares there is something more in the
secret counsel of his Father than to chastise every one as he deserves. For he
says of the man who was born blind, &#8220;Neither has this man sinned, nor his
parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him,&#8221; (John
9:3). Here, where calamity takes precedence even of birth, our carnal sense
murmurs as if God were unmerciful in thus afflicting those who have not
offended. But Christ declares that, provided we had eyes clear enough, we should
perceive that in this spectacle the glory of his Father is brightly displayed.
We must use modesty, not as it were compelling God to render an account, but so
revering his hidden Judgments as to account his will the best of all
reasons.<sup>13<a name="fnB130" href="#fn130">[6]</a></sup> When the sky is
overcast with dense clouds, and a violent tempest arises, the darkness which is
presented to our eye, and the thunder which strikes our ears, and stupefies all
our senses with terror, make us imagine that every thing is thrown into
confusion, though in the firmament itself all continues quiet and serene. In the
same way, when the tumultuous aspect of human affairs unfits us for judging, we
should still hold, that God, in the pure light of his justice and wisdom, keeps
all these commotions in due subordination, and conducts them to their proper
end. And certainly in this matter many display monstrous infatuation, presuming
to subject the works of God to their calculation, and discuss his secret
counsels, as well as to pass a precipitate Judgment on things unknown, and that
with greater license than on the doings of mortal men. What can be more
preposterous than to show modesty toward our equals, and choose rather to
suspend our Judgment than incur the blame of rashness, while we petulantly
insult the hidden Judgments of God, Judgments which it becomes us to look up to
and revere.<br></div>
<div>2. No man, therefore, will duly and usefully ponder on the providence of
God save he who recollects that he has to do with his own Maker, and the Maker
of the world, and in the exercise of the humility which becomes him, manifests
both fear and reverence. Hence it is, that in the present day so many dogs tear
this doctrine with envenomed teeth, or, at least, assail it with their bark,
refusing to give more license to God than their own reason dictates to
themselves. With what petulance, too, are we assailed for not being contented
with the precepts of the Law, in which the will of God is comprehended, and for
maintaining that the world is governed by his secret counsels? As if our
doctrine were the figment of our own brain, and were not distinctly declared by
the Spirit, and repeated in innumerable forms of expression! Since some feeling
of shame restrains them from daring to belch forth their blasphemies against
heaven, that they may give the freer vent to their rage, they pretend to pick a
quarrel with us. But if they refuse to admit that every event which happens in
the world is governed by the incomprehensible counsel of God, let them explain
to what effect Scripture declares, that &#8220;his Judgments are a great
deep,&#8221; (Ps. 36:7). For when Moses exclaims that the will of God &#8220;is
not in heaven that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and
bring it unto us? Neither is it beyond the sea that thou shouldest say, Who
shall go over the sea and bring it unto us?&#8221; (Deut. 30:12, 13), because it
was familiarly expounded in the law, it follows that there must be another
hidden will which is compared to &#8220; a great deep.&#8221; It is of this will
Paul exclaims, &#8220;O! the depths of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of
God! How unsearchable are his Judgments, and his ways past finding out! For who
has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counsellor?&#8221; (Rom.
11:33, 34). It is true, indeed, that in the law and the gospel are comprehended
mysteries which far transcend the measure of our sense; but since God, to enable
his people to understand those mysteries which he has deigned to reveal in his
word, enlightens their minds with a spirit of understanding, they are now no
longer a deep, but a path in which they can walk safely-a lamp to guide their
feet-a light of life-a school of clear and certain truth. But the admirable
method of governing the world is justly called a deep, because, while it lies
hid from us, it is to be reverently adored. Both views Moses has beautifully
expressed in a few words. &#8220;Secret things,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;belong
unto the Lord our God, but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to
our children for ever,&#8221; (Deut. 29:29). We see how he enjoins us not only
studiously to meditate on the law, but to look up with reverence to the secret
Providence of God. The Book of Job also, in order to keep our minds humble,
contains a description of this lofty theme. The author of the Book, after taking
an ample survey of the universe, and discoursing magnificently on the works of
God, at length adds, &#8220;Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a
portion is heard of him?&#8221; (Job 26:14). For which reason he, in another
passage, distinguishes between the wisdom which dwells in God, and the measure
of wisdom which he has assigned to man (Job 28:21, 28). After discoursing of the
secrets of nature, he says that wisdom &#8220;is hid from the eyes of all
living;&#8221; that &#8220;God understandeth the way thereof.&#8221; Shortly
after he adds, that it has been divulged that it might be investigated; for
&#8220;unto man he said, Behold the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom.&#8221; To
this the words of Augustine refer, &#8220;As we do not know all the things which
God does respecting us in the best order, we ought, with good intention, to act
according to the Law, and in some things be acted upon according to the Law, his
Providence being a Law immutable,&#8221; (August. Quest. lib. 83 c. 27).
Therefore, since God claims to himself the right of governing the world, a right
unknown to us, let it be our law of modesty and soberness to acquiesce in his
supreme authority regarding his will as our only rule of justice, and the most
perfect cause of all things,-not that absolute will, indeed, of which sophists
prate, when by a profane and impious divorce, they separate his justice from his
power, but that universal overruling Providence from which nothing flows that is
not right, though the reasons thereof may be
concealed.<sup>13<a name="fnB131" href="#fn131">[7]</a></sup><br></div>
<div>3. Those who have learned this modesty will neither murmur against God for
adversity in time past, nor charge him with the blame of their own wickedness,
as Homer&#8217;s Agamemnon does.-<font face="Graeca"> JEgw d! ouvk aJivtiov"
eimi, ajlla; Zeu;" kai moi'ra.</font> &#8220;<i>Blame not me, but Jupiter and
fate</i>.&#8221; On the other hand, they will note like the youth in Plautus,
destroy themselves in despairs as if hurried away by the Fates. &#8220;Unstable
is the condition of affairs; instead of doing as they list, men only fulfil
their fate: I will hie me to a rock, and there end my fortune with my
life.&#8221; Nor will they, after the example of another, use the name of God as
a cloak for their crimes. For in another comedy Lyconides thus expresses
himself:-&#8221;God was the impeller: I believe the gods wished it. Did they not
wish it, it would not be done, I know.&#8221; They will rather inquire and learn
from Scripture what is pleasing to God, and then, under the guidance of the
Spirit, endeavour to attain it. Prepared to follow whithersoever God may call,
they will show by their example that nothing is more useful than the knowledge
of this doctrine, which perverse men undeservedly assail, because it is
sometimes wickedly abused. The profane make such a bluster with their foolish
puerilities, that they almost, according to the expression, confound heaven and
earth. If the Lord has marked the moment of our death, it cannot be escaped,-it
is vain to toil and use precaution.<sup> </sup> Therefore, when one ventures not
to travel on a road which he hears is infested by robbers; when another calls in
the physician, and annoys himself with drugs, for the sake of his health; a
third abstains from coarser food, that he may not injure a sickly constitution;
and a fourth fears to dwell in a ruinous house; when all, in short, devise, and,
with great eagerness of mind, strike out paths by which they may attain the
objects of their desire; either these are all vain remedies, laid hold of to
correct the will of God, or his certain decree does not fix the limits of life
and death, health and sickness, peace and war, and other matters which men,
according as they desire and hate, study by their own industry to secure or
avoid. Nay, these trifles even infer, that the prayers of the faithful must be
perverse, not to say superfluous, since they entreat the Lord to make a
provision for things which he has decreed from eternity. And then, imputing
whatever happens to the providence of God, they connive at the man who is known
to have expressly designed it. Has an assassin slain an honest citizen? He has,
say they, executed the counsel of God. Has some one committed theft or adultery?
The deed having been provided and ordained by the Lord, he is the minister of
his providence. Has a son waited with indifference for the death of his parent,
without trying any remedy? He could not oppose God, who had so predetermined
from eternity. Thus all crimes receive the name of virtues, as being in
accordance with divine ordination.<br></div>
<div>4. As regards future events, Solomon easily reconciles human deliberation
with divine providence. For while he derides the stupidity of those who presume
to undertake anything without God, as if they were not ruled by his hand, he
elsewhere thus expresses himself: &#8220;A man&#8217;s heart deviseth his ways
but the Lord directeth his steps,&#8221; (Prov. 16:9); intimating, that the
eternal decrees of God by no means prevent us from proceeding, under his will,
to provide for ourselves, and arrange all our affairs. And the reason for this
is clear. For he who has fixed the boundaries of our life, has at the same time
entrusted us with the care of it, provided us with the means of preserving it,
forewarned us of the dangers to which we are exposed, and supplied cautions and
remedies, that we may not be overwhelmed unawares. Now, our duty is clear,
namely, since the Lord has committed to us the defence of our life,-to defend
it; since he offers assistance,-to use it; since he forewarns us of danger,-not
to rush on heedless; since he supplies remedies,-not to neglect them. But it is
said, a danger that is not fatal will not hurt us, and one that is fatal cannot
be resisted by any precaution. But what if dangers are not fatal, merely because
the Lord has furnished you with the means of warding them off, and surmounting
them? See how far your reasoning accords with the order of divine procedure: You
infer that danger is not to be guarded against, because, if it is not fatal, you
shall escape without precaution; whereas the Lord enjoins you to guard against
its just because he wills it not to be
fatal.<sup>13<a name="fnB132" href="#fn132">[8]</a></sup> These insane cavillers
overlook what is plainly before their eyes-viz. that the Lord has furnished men
with the artful of deliberation and caution, that they may employ them in
subservience to his providence, in the preservation of their life; while, on the
contrary, by neglect and sloth, they bring upon themselves the evils which he
has annexed to them. How comes it that a provident man, while he consults for
his safety, disentangles himself from impending evils; while a foolish man,
through unadvised temerity, perishes, unless it be that prudence and folly are,
in either case, instruments of divine dispensation? God has been pleased to
conceal from us all future events that we may prepare for them as doubtful, and
cease not to apply the provided remedies until they have either been overcome,
or have proved too much for all our care. Hence, I formerly observed, that the
Providence of God does not interpose simply; but, by employing means, assumes,
as it were, a visible form.<br></div>
<div>5. By the same class of persons, past events are referred improperly and
inconsiderately to simple providence. As all contingencies whatsoever depend on
it, therefore, neither thefts nor adulteries, nor murders, are perpetrated
without an interposition of the divine will. Why, then, they ask, should the
thief be punished for robbing him whom the Lord chose to chastise with poverty?
Why should the murderer be punished for slaying him whose life the Lord had
terminated? If all such persons serve the will of God, why should they be
punished? I deny that they serve the will of God. For we cannot say that he who
is carried away by a wicked mind performs service on the order of God, when he
is only following his own malignant desires. He obeys God, who, being instructed
in his will, hastens in the direction in which God calls him. But how are we so
instructed unless by his word? The will declared by his word is, therefore, that
which we must keep in view in acting, God requires of us nothing but what he
enjoins.<sup> </sup> If we design anything contrary to his precept, it is not
obedience, but contumacy and transgression. But if he did not will it, we could
not do it. I admit this. But do we act wickedly for the purpose of yielding
obedience to him? This, assuredly, he does not command. Nay, rather we rush on,
not thinking of what he wishes, but so inflamed by our own passionate lust,
that, with destined purpose, we strive against him. And in this way, while
acting wickedly, we serve his righteous ordination, since in his boundless
wisdom he well knows how to use bad instruments for good purposes. And see how
absurd this mode of arguing is. They will have it that crimes ought not to be
punished in their authors, because they are not committed without the
dispensation of God. I concede more-that thieves and murderers, and other
evil-doers, are instruments of Divine Providence, being employed by the Lord
himself to execute the Judgments which he has resolved to inflict. But I deny
that this forms any excuse for their misdeeds. For how? Will they implicate God
in the same iniquity with themselves, or will they cloak their depravity by his
righteousness? They cannot exculpate themselves, for their own conscience
condemns them: they cannot charge God, since they perceive the whole wickedness
in themselves, and nothing in Him save the legitimate use of their wickedness.
But it is said he works by their means. And whence, I pray, the f&uacute;tid
odour of a dead body, which has been unconfined and putrefied by the sun&#8217;s
heat? All see that it is excited by the rays of the sun, but no man therefore
says that the fetid odour is in them. In the same way, while the matter and
guilt of wickedness belongs to the wicked man, why should it be thought that God
contracts any impurity in using it at pleasure as his instrument? Have done,
then, with that dog-like petulance which may, indeed, bay from a distance at the
justice of God, but cannot reach it!<br></div>
<div>6. These calumnies, or rather frenzied dreams, will easily be dispelled by
a pure and holy meditation on Divine Providence, meditation such as piety
enjoins, that we may thence derive the best and sweetest fruit. The Christian,
then, being most fully persuaded, that all things come to pass by the
dispensation of God, and that nothing happens fortuitously, will always direct
his eye to him as the principal cause of events, at the same time paying due
regard to inferior causes in their own place. Next, he will have no doubt that a
special providence is awake for his preservation, and will not suffer anything
to happen that will not turn to his good and safety. But as its business is
first with men and then with the other creatures, he will feel assured that the
providence of God reigns over both. In regard to men, good as well as bad, he
will acknowledge that their counsels, wishes, aims and faculties are so under
his hand, that he has full power to turn them in whatever direction, and
constrain them as often as he pleases. The fact that a special providence
watches over the safety of believers, is attested by a vast number of the
clearest promises.<sup>13<a name="fnB133" href="#fn133">[9]</a></sup>
&#8220;Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never
suffer the righteous to be moved.&#8221; &#8220;Casting all your care upon him:
for he careth for you.&#8221; &#8220;He that dwelleth in the secret place of the
Most High, shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.&#8221; &#8220;He that
toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye.&#8221; &#8220;We have a strong
city: salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.&#8221; &#8220;Can a
woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son
of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.&#8221; Nay, the
chief aim of the historical books of Scripture is to show that the ways of his
saints are so carefully guarded by the Lord, as to prevent them even from
dashing their foot against a stone. Therefore, as we a little ago justly
exploded the opinion of those who feign a universal providence, which does not
condescend to take special care of every creature, so it is of the highest
moment that we should specially recognise this care towards ourselves. Hence,
our Saviour, after declaring that even a sparrow falls not to the ground without
the will of his Father, immediately makes the application, that being more
valuable than many sparrows, we ought to consider that God provides more
carefully for us. He even extends this so far, as to assure us that the hairs of
our head are all numbered. What more can we wish, if not even a hair of our head
can fall, save in accordance with his will? I speak not merely of the human race
in general. God having chosen the Church for his abode, there cannot be a doubt,
that in governing it, he gives singular manifestations of his paternal
care.<br></div>
<div>7. The servant of God being confirmed by these promises and examples, will
add the passages which teach that all men are under his power, whether to
conciliate their minds, or to curb their wickedness, and prevent it from doing
harm. For it is the Lord who gives us favour, not only with those who wish us
well, but also in the eyes of the Egyptians (Exod. 3:21), in various ways
defeating the malice of our enemies. Sometimes he deprives them of all presence
of mind, so that they cannot undertake anything soundly or soberly. In this ways
he sends Satan to be a lie in the mouths of all the prophets in order to deceive
Ahab (1 Kings 22:22), by the counsel of the young men he so infatuates Rehoboam,
that his folly deprives him of his kingdom (1 Kings 12:10, 15). Sometimes when
he leaves them in possession of intellect, he so fills them with terror and
dismays that they can neither will nor plan the execution of what they had
designed. Sometimes, too, after permitting them to attempt what lust and rage
suggested, he opportunely interrupts them in their career, and allows them not
to conclude what they had begun. Thus the counsel of Ahithophel, which would
have been fatal to David, was defeated before its time (2 Sam. 17:7, 14). Thus,
for the good and safety of his people, he overrules all the creatures, even the
devil himself who, we see, durst not attempt any thing against Job without his
permission and command. This knowledge is necessarily followed by gratitude in
prosperity, patience in adversity, and incredible security for the time to come.
Every thing, therefore, which turns out prosperous and according to his wish,
the Christian will ascribe entirely to God, whether he has experienced his
beneficence through the instrumentality of men, or been aided by inanimate
creatures. For he will thus consider with himself: Certainly it was the Lord
that disposed the minds of these people in my favour, attaching them to me so as
to make them the instruments of his kindness. In an abundant harvest he will
think that it is the Lord who listens to the heaven, that the heaven may listen
to the earth, and the earth herself to her own offspring; in other cases, he
will have no doubt that he owes all his prosperity to the divine blessing, and,
admonished by so many circumstances, will feel it impossible to be
ungrateful.<br></div>
<div>8. If any thing adverse befalls him, he will forthwith raise his mind to
God, whose hand is most effectual in impressing us with patience and placid
moderation of mind. Had Joseph kept his thoughts fixed on the treachery of his
brethren, he never could have resumed fraternal affection for them. But turning
toward the Lord, he forgot the injury, and was so inclined to mildness and
mercy, that he even voluntarily comforts his brethren, telling them, &#8220;Be
not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither; for God did send
me before you to preserve life.&#8221; &#8220;As for you, ye thought evil
against me; but God meant it unto good,&#8221; (Gen. 45:5; 50:20). Had Job
turned to the Chaldees, by whom he was plundered, he should instantly have been
fired with revenge, but recognising the work of the Lord, he solaces himself
with this most beautiful sentiment: &#8220;The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken
away; blessed be the name of the Lord,&#8221; (Job 1:21). So when David was
assailed by Shimei with stones and curses, had he immediately fixed his eyes on
the man, he would have urged his people to retaliate the injury; but perceiving
that he acts not without an impulse from the Lord, he rather calms them.
&#8220;So let him curse,&#8221; says he, &#8220;because the Lord has said unto
him, Curse David.&#8221; With the same bridle he elsewhere curbs the excess of
his grief, &#8220;I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, because thou didst
it,&#8221; (Ps. 39:9). If there is no more effectual remedy for anger and
impatience, he assuredly has not made little progress who has learned so to
meditate on Divine Providence, as to be able always to bring his mind to this,
The Lord willed it, it must therefore be borne; not only because it is unlawful
to strive with him, but because he wills nothing that is not just and befitting.
The whole comes to this. When unjustly assailed by men, overlooking their malice
(which could only aggravate our grief, and whet our minds for vengeance), let us
remember to ascend to God, and learn to hold it for certain, that whatever an
enemy wickedly committed against us was permitted, and sent by his righteous
dispensation. Paul, in order to suppress our desire to retaliate injuries,
wisely reminds us that we wrestle not with flesh and blood, but with our
spiritual enemy the devil, that we may prepare for the contest (Eph. 6:12). But
to calm all the impulses of passion, the most useful consideration is, that God
arms the devil, as well as all the wicked, for conflict, and sits as umpire,
that he may exercise our patience. But if the disasters and miseries which press
us happen without the agency of men, let us call to mind the doctrine of the Law
(Deut. 28:1), that all prosperity has its source in the blessing of God, that
all adversity is his curse. And let us tremble at the dreadful denunciation,
&#8220;And if ye will not be reformed by these things, but will walk contrary
unto me; then will I also walk contrary unto you,&#8221; (Lev. 26:23, 24). These
words condemn our torpor, when, according to our carnal sense, deeming that
whatever happens in any way is fortuitous, we are neither animated by the
kindness of God to worship him, nor by his scourge stimulated to repentance. And
it is for this reason that Jeremiah (Lament. 3:38), and Amos (Amos 3:6),
expostulated bitterly with the Jews, for not believing that good as well as evil
was produced by the command of God. To the same effect are the words in Isaiah,
&#8220;I form the light and create darkness: I make peace and create evil. I the
Lord do all these things,&#8221; (Is. 45:7).<br></div>
<div>9. At the same time, the Christian will not overlook inferior causes. For,
while he regards those by whom he is benefited as ministers of the divine
goodness, he will not, therefore, pass them by, as if their kindness deserved no
gratitude, but feeling sincerely obliged to them, will willingly confess the
obligation, and endeavour, according to his ability, to return it. In fine, in
the blessings which he receives, he will revere and extol God as the principal
author, but will also honour men as his ministers, and perceive, as is the
truth, that by the will of God he is under obligation to those, by whose hand
God has been pleased to show him kindness. If he sustains any loss through
negligence or imprudence, he will, indeed, believe that it was the Lord&#8217;s
will it should so be, but, at the same time, he will impute it to himself. If
one for whom it was his duty to care, but whom he has treated with neglect, is
carried off by disease, although aware that the person had reached a limit
beyond which it was impossible to pass, he will not, therefore, extenuate his
fault, but, as he had neglected to do his duty faithfully towards him, will feel
as if he had perished by his guilty negligence. Far less where, in the case of
theft or murder, fraud and preconceived malice have existed, will he palliate it
under the pretext of Divine Providence, but in the same crime will distinctly
recognise the justice of God, and the iniquity of man, as each is separately
manifested. But in future events, especially, will he take account of such
inferior causes. If he is not left destitute of human aid, which he can employ
for his safety, he will set it down as a divine blessing; but he will not,
therefore, be remiss in taking measures, or slow in employing the help of those
whom he sees possessed of the means of assisting him. Regarding all the aids
which the creatures can lend him, as hands offered him by the Lord, he will
avail himself of them as the legitimate instruments of Divine Providence. And as
he is uncertain what the result of any business in which he engages is to be
(save that he knows, that in all things the Lord will provide for his good), he
will zealously aim at what he deems for the best, so far as his abilities enable
him. In adopting his measures, he will not be carried away by his own
impressions, but will commit and resign himself to the wisdom of God, that under
his guidance he may be led into the right path. However, his confidence in
external aid will not be such that the presence of it will make him feel secure,
the absence of it fill him with dismay, as if he were destitute. His mind will
always be fixed on the Providence of God alone, and no consideration of present
circumstances will be allowed to withdraw him from the steady contemplation of
it. Thus Joab, while he acknowledges that the issue of the battle is entirely in
the hand of God, does not therefore become inactive, but strenuously proceeds
with what belongs to his proper calling, &#8220;Be of good courage,&#8221; says
he, &#8220;and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our
God; and the Lord do that which seemeth him good,&#8221; (2 Sam. 10:12). The
same conviction keeping us free from rashness and false confidence, will
stimulate us to constant prayer, while at the same time filling our minds with
good hope, it will enable us to feel secure, and bid defiance to all the dangers
by which we are surrounded.<br></div>
<div>10. Here we are forcibly reminded of the inestimable felicity of a pious
mind. Innumerable are the ills which beset human life, and present death in as
many different forms. Not to go beyond ourselves, since the body is a
receptacle, nay the nurse, of a thousand diseases, a man cannot move without
carrying along with him many forms of destruction. His life is in a manner
interwoven with death. For what else can be said where heat and cold bring equal
danger? Then, in what direction soever you turn, all surrounding objects not
only may do harm, but almost openly threaten and seem to present immediate
death. Go on board a ship, you are but a plank&#8217;s breadth from death. Mount
a horse, the stumbling of a foot endangers your life. Walk along the streets,
every tile upon the roofs is a source of danger. If a sharp instrument is in
your own hand, or that of a friend, the possible harm is manifest. All the
savage beasts you see are so many beings armed for your destruction. Even within
a high walled garden, where everything ministers to delight, a serpent will
sometimes lurk. Your house, constantly exposed to fire, threatens you with
poverty by day, with destruction by night. Your fields, subject to hail, mildew,
drought, and other injuries, denounce barrenness, and thereby famine. I say
nothing of poison, treachery, robbery, some of which beset us at home, others
follow us abroad. Amid these perils, must not man be very miserable, as one who,
more dead than alive, with difficulty draws an anxious and feeble breath, just
as if a drawn sword were constantly suspended over his neck? It may be said that
these things happen seldom, at least not always, or to all, certainly never all
at once. I admit it; but since we are reminded by the example of others, that
they may also happen to us, and that our life is not an exception any more than
theirs, it is impossible not to fear and dread as if they were to befall us.
What can you imagine more grievous than such trepidation? Add that there is
something like an insult to God when it is said, that man, the noblest of the
creatures, stands exposed to every blind and random stroke of fortune. Here,
however, we were only referring to the misery which man should feel, were he
placed under the dominion of chance.<br></div>
<div>11. But when once the light of Divine Providence has illumined the
believer&#8217;s soul, he is relieved and set free, not only from the extreme
fear and anxiety which formerly oppressed him, but from all care. For as he
justly shudders at the idea of chance, so he can confidently commit himself to
God. This, I say, is his comfort, that his heavenly Father so embraces all
things under his power-so governs them at will by his nod-so regulates them by
his wisdom, that nothing takes place save according to his appointment; that
received into his favour, and entrusted to the care of his angels neither fire,
nor water, nor sword, can do him harm, except in so far as God their master is
pleased to permit. For thus sings the Psalm, &#8220;Surely he shall deliver thee
from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover
thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust; his truth shall be
thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor
for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that walketh in
darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday&#8221; &amp;c. (Ps.
91:2-6). Hence the exulting confidence of the saints, &#8220;The Lord is on my
side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me? The Lord taketh my part with
them that help me.&#8221; &#8220;Though an host should encamp against me, my
heart shall not fear.&#8221; &#8220;Yea, though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I will fear no evil.&#8221; (Ps. 118:6; 27:3; 23:4).<br></div>
<div>How comes it, I ask, that their confidence never fails, but just that while
the world apparently revolves at random, they know that God is every where at
work, and feel assured that his work will be their safety? When assailed by the
devil and wicked men, were they not confirmed by remembering and meditating on
Providence, they should, of necessity, forthwith despond. But when they call to
mind that the devil, and the whole train of the ungodly, are, in all directions,
held in by the hand of God as with a bridle, so that they can neither conceive
any mischief, nor plan what they have conceived, nor how much soever they may
have planned, move a single finger to perpetrate, unless in so far as he
permits, nay, unless in so far as he commands; that they are not only bound by
his fetters, but are even forced to do him service,-when the godly think of all
these things they have ample sources of consolation. For, as it belongs to the
lord to arm the fury of such foes and turn and destine it at pleasure, so it is
his also to determine the measure and the end, so as to prevent them from
breaking loose and wantoning as they list. Supported by this conviction, Paul,
who had said in one place that his journey was hindered by Satan (1 Thess.
2:18), in another resolves, with the permission of God, to undertake it (1 Cor.
16:7). If he had only said that Satan was the obstacle, he might have seemed to
give him too much power, as if he were able even to overturn the counsels of
God; but now, when he makes God the disposer, on whose permission all journies
depend, he shows, that however Satan may contrive, he can accomplish nothing
except in so far as He pleases to give the word. For the same reason, David,
considering the various turns which human life undergoes as it rolls, and in a
manner whirls around, retakes himself to this asylum, &#8220;My times are in thy
hand,&#8221; (Ps. 31:15). He might have said the course of life or <i>time</i>
in the singular number, but by <i>times</i> he meant to express, that how
unstable soever the condition of man may be, the vicissitudes which are ever and
anon taking place are under divine regulation. Hence Rezin and the king of
Israel, after they had joined their forces for the destruction of Israel, and
seemed torches which had been kindled to destroy and consume the land, are
termed by the prophet &#8220;smoking fire brands.&#8221; They could only emit a
little smoke (Is. 7:4). So Pharaoh, when he was an object of dread to all by his
wealth and strength, and the multitude of his troops, is compared to the largest
of beasts, while his troops are compared to fishes; and God declares that he
will take both leader and army with his hooks, and drag them whither he pleases
(Ezek. 29:4). In one word, not to dwell longer on this, give heed, and you will
at once perceive that ignorance of Providence is the greatest of all miseries,
and the knowledge of it the highest happiness.<br></div>
<div>12. On the Providence of God, in so far as conducive to the solid
instruction and consolation of believers (for, as to satisfying the curiosity of
foolish men, it is a thing which cannot be done, and ought not to be attempted),
enough would have been said, did not a few passages remain which seem to
insinuate, contrary to the view which we have expounded, that the counsel of God
is not firm and stable, but varies with the changes of sublunary affairs. First,
in reference to the Providence of God, it is said that he repented of having
made man (Gen. 6:6), and of having raised Saul to the kingdom (1 Sam. 15:11),
and that he will repent of the evil which he had resolved to inflict on his
people as soon as he shall have perceived some amendment in them (Jer. 18:8).
Secondly, his decrees are sometimes said to be annulled. He had by Jonah
proclaimed to the Ninevites, &#8220;Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be
overthrown,&#8221; but, immediately on their repentance, he inclined to a more
merciful sentence (Jonah 3:4-10). After he had, by the mouth of Isaiah, given
Hezekiah intimation of his death, he was moved by his tears and prayers to defer
it (Is. 38:15; 2 Kings 20:15). Hence many argue that God has not fixed human
affairs by an eternal decree, but according to the merits of each individual,
and as he deems right and just, disposes of each single year, and day, and hour.
As to repentance, we must hold that it can no more exist in God than ignorance,
or error, or impotence. If no man knowingly or willingly reduces himself to the
necessity of repentance, we cannot attribute repentance to God without saying
either that he knows not what is to happen, or that he cannot evade it, or that
he rushes precipitately and inconsiderately into a resolution, and then
forthwith regrets it. But so far is this from the meaning of the Holy Spirit,
that in the very mention of repentance he declares that God is not influenced by
any feeling of regret, that he is not a man that he should repent. And it is to
be observed, that, in the same chapter, both things are so conjoined, that a
comparison of the passages admirably removes the appearance of contradiction.
When it is said that God repented of having made Saul king, the term
<i>change</i> is used figuratively. Shortly after, it is added, &#8220;The
Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should
repent,&#8221; (1 Sam. 15:29). In these words, his immutability is plainly
asserted without figure. Wherefore it is certain that, in administering human
affairs, the ordination of God is perpetual and superior to every thing like
repentance. That there might be no doubt of his constancy, even his enemies are
forced to bear testimony to it. For, Balaam, even against his will, behaved to
break forth into this exclamation, &#8220;God is not a man, that he should lie;
neither the son of man, that he should repent: has he said, and shall he not do
it? or has he spoken, and shall he not make it good?&#8221; (Num.
23:19).<br></div>
<div>13. What then is meant by the term repentance? The very same that is meant
by the other forms of expression, by which God is described to us humanly.
Because our weakness cannot reach his height, any description which we receive
of him must be lowered to our capacity in order to be intelligible. And the mode
of lowering is to represent him not as he really is, but as we conceive of him.
Though he is incapable of every feeling of perturbation, he declares that he is
angry with the wicked. Wherefore, as when we hear that God is angry, we ought
not to imagine that there is any emotion in him, but ought rather to consider
the mode of speech accommodated to our sense, God appearing to us like one
inflamed and irritated whenever he exercises Judgment, so we ought not to
imagine any thing more under the term repentance than a change of action, men
being wont to testify their dissatisfaction by such a change. Hence, because
every change whatever among men is intended as a correction of what displeases,
and the correction proceeds from repentance, the same term applied to God simply
means that his procedure is changed. In the meantime, there is no inversion of
his counsel or will, no change of his affection. What from eternity he had
foreseen, approved, decreed, he prosecutes with unvarying uniformity, how sudden
soever to the eye of man the variation may seem to be.<br></div>
<div>14. Nor does the Sacred History, while it relates that the destruction
which had been proclaimed to the Ninevites was remitted, and the life of
Hezekiah, after an intimation of death, prolonged, imply that the decrees of God
were annulled. Those who think so labour under delusion as to the meaning of
<i>threatenings</i>, which, though they affirm simply, nevertheless contain in
them a tacit condition dependent on the result. Why did the Lord send Jonah to
the Ninevites to predict the overthrow of their city? Why did he by Isaiah give
Hezekiah intimation of his death? He might have destroyed both them and him
without a message to announce the disaster. He had something else in view than
to give them a warning of death, which might let them see it at a distance
before it came. It was because he did not wish them destroyed but reformed, and
thereby saved from destruction. When Jonah prophesies that in forty days Nineveh
will be overthrown, he does it in order to prevent the overthrow. When Hezekiah
is forbidden to hope for longer life, it is that he may obtain longer life. Who
does not now see that, by threatening of this kind, God wished to arouse those
to repentance whom he terrified, that they might escape the Judgment which their
sins deserved? If this is so, the very nature of the case obliges us to supply a
tacit condition in a simple denunciation. This is even confirmed by analogous
cases. The Lord rebuking King Abimelech for having carried off the wife of
Abraham, uses these words: &#8220;Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman
which thou hast taken; for she is a man&#8217;s wife.&#8221; But, after
Abimelech&#8217;s excuse, he thus speaks: &#8220;Restore the man his wife, for
he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live; and if thou
restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that art
thine,&#8221; (Gen. 20:3, 7). You see that, by the first announcement, he makes
a deep impression on his mind, that he may render him eager to give
satisfaction, and that by the second he clearly explains his will. Since the
other passages may be similarly explained, you must not infer from them that the
Lord derogated in any respect from his former counsel, because he recalled what
he had promulgated. When, by denouncing punishment, he admonishes to repentance
those whom he wishes to spare, he paves the way for his eternal decree, instead
of varying it one whit either in will or in language. The only difference is,
that he does not express, in so many syllables, what is easily understood. The
words of Isaiah must remain true, &#8220;The Lord of hosts has purposed, and who
shall disannul it? And his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it
back?&#8221; (Isaiah 14:27).<br></div>

<div>This last chapter of the First Book consists of three parts: I. It having
been said above that God bends all the reprobate, and even Satan himself, at his
will, three objections are started. First, that this happens by the permission,
not by the will of God. To this objection there is a twofold reply, the one,
that angels and men, good and bad, do nothing but what is appointed by God; the
second, that all movements are secretly directed to their end by the hidden
inspiration of God, sec. 1, 2. II. A second objection is, that there are two
contrary wills in God, if by a secret counsel he decrees what he openly
prohibits by his law. This objection refuted, sec. 3. III. The third objection
is, that God is made the author of all wickedness, when he is said not only to
use the agency of the wicked, but also to govern their counsels and affections,
and that therefore the wicked are unjustly punished. This objection refuted in
the last section.<br></div>
<div><i>Sections.</i><br></div>
<div>1.	 The carnal mind the source of the objections which are raised against
the Providence of God. A primary objection, making a distinction between the
<i>permission</i> and the <i>will</i> of God, refuted. Angels and men, good and
bad, do nought but what has been decreed by God. This proved by
examples.<br></div>
<div>2.	 All hidden movements directed to their end by the unseen but righteous
instigation of God. Examples, with answers to objections.<br></div>
<div>3.	 These objections originate in a spirit of pride and blasphemy.
Objection, that there must be two contrary wills in God, refuted. Why the one
simple will of God seems to us as if it were manifold.<br></div>
<div>4.	 Objection, that God is the author of sin, refuted by examples.
Augustine&#8217;s answer and admonition.<br></div>
<div>1. FROM other passages, in which God is said to draw or bend Satan himself,
and all the reprobate, to his will, a more difficult question arises. For the
carnal mind can scarcely comprehend how, when acting by their means, he
contracts no taint from their impurity, nay, how, in a common operation, he is
exempt from all guilt, and can justly condemn his own ministers. Hence a
distinction has been invented between <i>doing</i> and <i>permitting</i> because
to many it seemed altogether inexplicable how Satan and all the wicked are so
under the hand and authority of God, that he directs their malice to whatever
end he pleases, and employs their iniquities to execute his Judgments. The
modesty of those who are thus alarmed at the appearance of absurdity might
perhaps be excused, did they not endeavour to vindicate the justice of God from
every semblance of stigma by defending an untruth. It seems absurd that man
should be blinded by the will and command of God, and yet be forthwith punished
for his blindness. Hence, recourse is had to the evasion that this is done only
by the permission, and not also by the will of God. He himself, however, openly
declaring that he <i>does</i> this, repudiates the evasion. That men do nothing
save at the secret instigation of God, and do not discuss and deliberate on any
thing but what he has previously decreed with himself and brings to pass by his
secret direction, is proved by numberless clear passages of Scripture. What we
formerly quoted from the Psalms, to the effect that he does whatever pleases
him, certainly extends to all the actions of men. If God is the arbiter of peace
and war, as is there said, and that without any exception, who will venture to
say that men are borne along at random with a blind impulse, while He is
unconscious or quiescent? But the matter will be made clearer by special
examples. From the first chapter of Job we learn that Satan appears in the
presence of God to receive his orders, just as do the angels who obey
spontaneously. The manner and the end are different, but still the fact is, that
he cannot attempt anything without the will of God. But though afterwards his
power to afflict the saint seems to be only a bare permission, yet as the
sentiment is true, &#8220;The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; as it
pleased the Lord, so it has been done,&#8221; we infer that God was the author
of that trial of which Satan and wicked robbers were merely the instruments.
Satan&#8217;s aim is to drive the saint to madness by despair. The Sabeans
cruelly and wickedly make a sudden incursion to rob another of his goods. Job
acknowledges that he was deprived of all his property, and brought to poverty,
because such was the pleasure of God. Therefore, whatever men or Satan himself
devise, God holds the helm, and makes all their efforts contribute to the
execution of his Judgments. God wills that the perfidious Ahab should be
deceived; the devil offers his agency for that purpose, and is sent with a
definite command to be a lying spirit in the mouth of all the prophets (2 Kings
22:20). If the blinding and infatuation of Ahab is a Judgment from God, the
fiction of bare permission is at an end; for it would be ridiculous for a judge
only to permit, and not also to decree, what he wishes to be done at the very
time that he commits the execution of it to his ministers. The Jews purposed to
destroy Christ. Pilate and the soldiers indulged them in their fury; yet the
disciples confess in solemn prayer that all the wicked did nothing but what the
hand and counsel of God had decreed (Acts 4:28), just as Peter had previously
said in his discourse, that Christ was delivered to death by the determinate
counsel and foreknowledge of God (Acts 2:23); in other words, that God, to whom
all things are known from the beginning, had determined what the Jews had
executed. He repeats the same thing elsewhere, &#8220;Those things, which God
before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer,
he has so fulfilled,&#8221; (Acts 4:18). Absalom incestuously defiling his
father&#8217;s bed, perpetrates a detestable crime. God, however, declares that
it was his work; for the words are, &#8220;Thou midst it secretly, but I will do
this thing before all Israel, and before the
sun.&#8221;<sup>14<a name="fnB135" href="#fn135">[1]</a></sup> The cruelties of
the Chaldeans in Judea are declared by Jeremiah to be the work of God. For which
reason, Nebuchadnezzar is called the servant of God. God frequently exclaims,
that by his hiss, by the clang of his trumpet, by his authority and command, the
wicked are excited to war. He calls the Assyrian the rod of his anger, and the
axe which he wields in his hand. The overthrow of the city and downfall of the
temple, he calls his own work. David, not murmuring against God, but
acknowledging him to be a just judge, confesses that the curses of Shimei are
uttered by his orders. &#8220;The Lord,&#8221; says he, &#8220;has bidden him
curse.&#8221; Often in sacred history whatever happens is said to proceed from
the Lord, as the revolt of the ten tribes, the death of Eli&#8217;s sons, and
very many others of a similar description. Those who have a tolerable
acquaintance with the Scriptures see that, with a view to brevity, I am only
producing a few out of many passages, from which it is perfectly clear that it
is the merest trifling to substitute a bare permission for the providence of
God, as if he sat in a watch-tower waiting for fortuitous events, his Judgments
meanwhile depending on the will of man.<br></div>
<div>2. With regard to secret movements, what Solomon says of the heart of a
king, that it is turned hither and thither, as God sees meet, certainly applies
to the whole human race, and has the same force as if he had said, that whatever
we conceive in our minds is directed to its end by the secret inspiration of
God. And certainly, did he not work internally in the minds of men, it could not
have been properly said, that he takes away the lip from the true, and prudence
from the aged-takes away the heart from the princes of the earth, that they
wander through devious paths. To the same effect, we often read that men are
intimidated when He fills their hearts with terror. Thus David left the camp of
Saul while none knew of its because a sleep from God had fallen upon all. But
nothing can be clearer than the many passages which declare, that he blinds the
minds of men, and smites them with giddiness, intoxicates them with a spirit of
stupor, renders them infatuated, and hardens their hearts. Even these
expressions many would confine to permissions as if, by deserting the reprobate,
he allowed them to be blinded by Satan. But since the Holy Spirit distinctly
says, that the blindness and infatuation are inflicted by the just Judgment of
God, the solution is altogether inadmissible. He is said to have hardened the
heart of Pharaoh, to have hardened it yet more, and confirmed it. Some evade
these forms of expression by a silly cavil, because Pharaoh is elsewhere said to
have hardened his own heart, thus making his will the cause of hardening it; as
if the two things did not perfectly agree with each other, though in different
senses-viz. that man, though acted upon by God, at the same time also acts. But
I retort the objection on those who make it. If to harden means only bare
permission, the contumacy will not properly belong to Pharaoh. Now, could any
thing be more feeble and insipid than to interpret as if Pharaoh had only
allowed himself to be hardened? We may add, that Scripture cuts off all handle
for such cavils: &#8220;I,&#8221; saith the Lord, &#8220;will harden his
heart,&#8221; (Exod. 4:21). So also, Moses says of the inhabitants of the land
of Canaan, that they went forth to battle because the Lord had hardened their
hearts (Josh. 11:20). The same thing is repeated by another prophet, &#8220;He
turned their hearts to hate his people,&#8221; (Psalm 105:25). In like manner,
in Isaiah, he says of the Assyrian, &#8220;I will send him against a
hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge
to take the spoil, and to take the prey,&#8221; (Isaiah 10:6); not that he
intends to teach wicked and obstinate man to obey spontaneously, but because he
bends them to execute his Judgments, just as if they carried their orders
engraven on their minds. And hence it appears that they are impelled by the sure
appointment of God. I admit, indeed, that God often acts in the reprobate by
interposing the agency of Satan; but in such a manner, that Satan himself
performs his part, just as he is impelled, and succeeds only in so far as he is
permitted. The evil spirit that troubled Saul is said to be from the Lord (1
Sam. 16:14), to intimate that Saul&#8217;s madness was a just punishment from
God. Satan is also said to blind the minds of those who believe not (2 Cor.
4:4). But how so, unless that a spirit of error is sent from God himself, making
those who refuse to obey the truth to believe a lie? According to the former
view, it is said, &#8220;If the prophet be deceived when he has spoken a thing,
I the Lord have deceived that prophet,&#8221; (Ezek. 14:9). According to the
latter view, he is said to have given men over to a reprobate mind (Rom. 1:28),
because he is the special author of his own just vengeance; whereas Satan is
only his minister (see Calv. in Ps. 141:4). But as in the Second Book (Chap. 4
sec. 3, 4), in discussing the question of man&#8217;s freedom, this subject will
again be considered, the little that has now been said seems to be all that the
occasion requires. The sum of the whole is this,-since the will of God is said
to be the cause of all things, all the counsels and actions of men must be held
to be governed by his providence; so that he not only exerts his power in the
elect, who are guided by the Holy Spirit, but also forces the reprobate to do
him service.<br></div>
<div>3. As I have hitherto stated only what is plainly and unambiguously taught
in Scripture, those who hesitate not to stigmatise what is thus taught by the
sacred oracles, had better beware what kind of censure they employ. If, under a
pretence of ignorance, they seek the praise of modesty, what greater arrogance
can be imagined than to utter one word in opposition to the authority of God-to
say, for instance, &#8220;I think otherwise,&#8221;-&#8221;I would not have this
subject touched?&#8221; But if they openly blaspheme, what will they gain by
assaulting heaven? Such petulance, indeed, is not new. In all ages there have
been wicked and profane men, who rabidly assailed this branch of doctrine. But
what the Spirit declared of old by the mouth of David (Ps. 51:6), they will feel
by experience to be true-God will overcome when he is judged. David indirectly
rebukes the infatuation of those whose license is so unbridled, that from their
grovelling spot of earth they not only plead against God, but arrogate to
themselves the right of censuring him. At the same time, he briefly intimates
that the blasphemies which they belch forth against heaven, instead of reaching
God, only illustrate his justice, when the mists of their calumnies are
dispersed. Even our faith, because founded on the sacred word of God, is
superior to the whole world, and is able from its height to look down upon such
mists.<br></div>
<div>Their first objection-that if nothing happens without the will of God, he
must have two contrary wills, decreeing by a secret counsel what he has openly
forbidden in his law-is easily disposed of. But before I reply to it, I would
again remind my readers, that this cavil is directed not against me, but against
the Holy Spirit, who certainly dictated this confession to that holy man Job,
&#8220;The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away,&#8221; when, after being
plundered by robbers, he acknowledges that their injustice and mischief was a
just chastisement from God. And what says the Scripture elsewhere? The sons of
Eli &#8220;hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the Lord would
slay them,&#8221; (1 Sam. 2:25). Another prophet also exclaims, &#8220;Our God
is in the heavens: he has done whatsoever he has pleased,&#8221; (Ps. 115:3). I
have already shown clearly enough that God is the author of all those things
which, according to these objectors, happen only by his inactive permission. He
testifies that he creates light and darkness, forms good and evil (Is. 45:7);
that no evil happens which he has not done (Amos 3:6). Let them tell me whether
God exercises his Judgments willingly or unwillingly. As Moses teaches that he
who is accidentally killed by the blow of an axe, is delivered by God into the
hand of him who smites him (Deut. 19:5), so the Gospel, by the mouth of Luke,
declares, that Herod and Pontius Pilate conspired &#8220;to do whatsoever thy
hand and thy counsel determined before to be done,&#8221; (Acts 4:28). And, in
truth, if Christ was not crucified by the will of God, where is our redemption?
Still, however, the will of God is not at variance with itself. It undergoes no
change. He makes no pretence of not willing what he wills, but while in himself
the will is one and undivided, to us it appears manifold, because, from the
feebleness of our intellect, we cannot comprehend how, though after a different
manner, he wills and wills not the very same thing. Paul terms the calling of
the Gentiles a hidden mystery, and shortly after adds, that therein was
manifested the manifold wisdom of God (Eph. 3:10). Since, on account of the
dullness of our sense, the wisdom of God seems manifold (or, as an old
interpreter rendered it, multiform), are we, therefore, to dream of some
variation in God, as if he either changed his counsel, or disagreed with
himself? Nay, when we cannot comprehend how God can will that to be done which
he forbids us to do, let us call to mind our imbecility, and remember that the
light in which he dwells is not without cause termed inaccessible (1 Tim. 6:16),
because shrouded in darkness. Hence, all pious and modest men will readily
acquiesce in the sentiment of Augustine: &#8220;Man sometimes with a good will
wishes something which God does not will, as when a good son wishes his father
to live, while God wills him to die. Again, it may happen that man with a bad
will wishes what God wills righteously, as when a bad son wishes his father to
die, and God also wills it. The former wishes what God wills not, the latter
wishes what God also wills. And yet the filial affection of the former is more
consonant to the good will of God, though willing differently, than the
unnatural affection of the latter, though willing the same thing; so much does
approbation or condemnation depend on what it is befitting in man, and what in
God to will, and to what end the will of each has respect. For the things which
God rightly wills, he accomplishes by the evil wills of bad
men,&#8221;-(<i>August. Enchirid. ad Laurent. cap.</i> 101). He had said a
little before (cap. 100), that the apostate angels, by their revolt, and all the
reprobate, as far as they themselves were concerned, did what God willed not;
but, in regard to his omnipotence, it was impossible for them to do so: for,
while they act against the will of God, his will is accomplished in them. Hence
he exclaims, &#8220;Great is the work of God, exquisite in all he wills! so
that, in a manner wondrous and ineffable, that is not done without his will
which is done contrary to it, because it could not be done if he did not permit;
nor does he permit it unwillingly, but willingly; nor would He who is good
permit evil to be done, were he not omnipotent to bring good out of evil,&#8221;
(<i>Augustin. in</i> Ps. 111:2).<br></div>
<div>4. In the same way is solved, or rather spontaneously vanishes, another
objection-viz. If God not only uses the agency of the wicked, but also governs
their counsels and affections, he is the author of all their sins; and,
therefore, men, in executing what God has decreed, are unjustly condemned,
because they are obeying his will. Here <i>will</i> is improperly confounded
with <i>precept</i>, though it is obvious, from innumerable examples, that there
is the greatest difference between
them.<sup>14<a name="fnB136" href="#fn136">[2]</a></sup> When Absalom defiled
his father&#8217;s bed, though God was pleased thus to avenge the adultery of
David, he did not therefore enjoin an abandoned son to commit incest, unless,
perhaps, in respect of David, as David himself says of Shimei&#8217;s curses.
For, while he confesses that Shimei acts by the order of God, he by no means
commends the obedience, as if that petulant dog had been yielding obedience to a
divine command; but, recognising in his tongue the scourge of God, he submits
patiently to be chastised. Thus we must hold, that while by means of the wicked
God performs what he had secretly decreed, they are not excusable as if they
were obeying his precept, which of set purpose they violate according to their
lust.<br></div>
<div>How these things, which men do perversely, are of God, and are ruled by his
secret providence, is strikingly shown in the election of King Jeroboam (1 Kings
12:20), in which the rashness and infatuation of the people are severely
condemned for perverting the order sanctioned by God, and perfidiously revolting
from the family of David. And yet we know it was God&#8217;s will that Jeroboam
should be anointed. Hence the apparent contradiction in the words of Hosea
(Hosea 8:4; 13:11), because, while God complained that that kingdom was erected
without his knowledge, and against his will, he elsewhere declares, that he had
given King Jeroboam in his anger. How shall we reconcile the two things,-that
Jeroboam&#8217;s reign was not of God, and yet God appointed him king? In this
way: The people could not revolt from the family of David without shaking off a
yoke divinely imposed on them, and yet God himself was not deprived of the power
of thus punishing the ingratitude of Solomon. We, therefore, see how God, while
not willing treachery, with another view justly wills the revolt; and hence
Jeroboam, by unexpectedly receiving the sacred unction, is urged to aspire to
the kingdom. For this reason, the sacred history says, that God stirred up an
enemy to deprive the son of Solomon of part of the kingdom (1 Kings 11:23). Let
the reader diligently ponder both points: how, as it was the will of God that
the people should be ruled by the hand of one king, their being rent into two
parties was contrary to his will; and yet how this same will originated the
revolt. For certainly, when Jeroboam, who had no such thought, is urged by the
prophet verbally, and by the oil of unction, to hope for the kingdom, the thing
was not done without the knowledge or against the will of God, who had expressly
commanded it; and yet the rebellion of the people is justly condemned, because
it was against the will of God that they revolted from the posterity of David.
For this reason, it is afterwards added, that when Rehoboam haughtily spurned
the prayers of the people, &#8220;the cause was from the Lord, that he might
perform his saying, which the Lord spake by Ahijah,&#8221; (I Kings 12:15). See
how sacred unity was violated against the will of God, while, at the same time,
with his will the ten tribes were alienated from the son of Solomon. To this
might be added another similar example-viz. the murder of the sons of Ahab, and
the extermination of his whole progeny by the consent, or rather the active
agency, of the people. Jehu says truly &#8220;There shall fall unto the earth
nothing of the word of the Lord, which the Lord spake concerning the house of
Ahab: for the Lord has done that which he spake by his servant Elijah,&#8221; (2
Kings 10:10). And yet, with good reason, he upbraids the citizens of Samaria for
having lent their assistance. &#8220;Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired
against my master, and slew him, but who slew all these?&#8221;<br></div>
<div>If I mistake not, I have already shown clearly how the same act at once
betrays the guilt of man, and manifests the righteousness of God. Modest minds
will always be satisfied with Augustine&#8217;s answer, &#8220;Since the Father
delivered up the Son, Christ his own body, and Judas his Master, how in such a
case is God just, and man guilty, but just because in the one act which they
did, the reasons for which they did it are different?&#8221; (<i>August. Ep. 48,
ad Vincentium</i>). If any are not perfectly satisfied with this
explanation-viz. that there is no concurrence between God and man, when by His
righteous impulse man does what he ought not to do, let them give heed to what
Augustine elsewhere observes: &#8220;Who can refrain from trembling at those
Judgments when God does according to his pleasure even in the hearts of the
wicked, at the same time rendering to them according to their deeds?&#8221;
(<i>De Grat. et lib. Arbit. ad Valent.</i> c. 20). And certainly, in regard to
the treachery of Judas, there is just as little ground to throw the blame of the
crime upon God, because He was both pleased that his Son should be delivered up
to death, and did deliver him, as to ascribe to Judas the praise of our
redemption. Hence Augustine, in another place, truly observes, that when God
makes his scrutiny, he looks not to what men could do, or to what they did, but
to what they wished to do, thus taking account of their will and purpose. Those
to whom this seems harsh had better consider how far their captiousness is
entitled to any toleration, while, on the ground of its exceeding their
capacity, they reject a matter which is clearly taught by Scripture, and
complain of the enunciation of truths, which, if they were not useful to be
known, God never would have ordered his prophets and apostles to teach. Our true
wisdom is to embrace with meek docility, and without reservation, whatever the
Holy Scriptures, have delivered. Those who indulge their petulance, a petulance
manifestly directed against God, are undeserving of a longer
refutation.<br></div>
