<div><br><br>The First Part of the Apostles&#8217; Creed&#8212;viz. the knowledge of
God the Creator, being disposed of, we now come to the Second Part, which
relates to the knowledge of God as a Redeemer in Christ. The subjects treated of
accordingly are, <i>first</i>, the Occasion of Redemption&#8212;viz.
Adam&#8217;s fall; and, <i>secondly</i>, Redemption itself. The first five
chapters are devoted to the former subject, and the remainder to the
latter.<br><br>Under the Occasion of Redemption, the Fall is considered not only in
a general way, but also specially in its effects. Hence the first four chapters
treat of original sin, free will, the corruption of human nature, and the
operation of God in the heart. The fifth chapter contains a refutation of the
arguments usually urged in support of free will.<br><br>The subject of redemption
may be reduced to five particular heads:<br><br>I. The character of him in whom
salvation for lost man must be sought, Chap. 6.<br><br>II. How he was manifested to
the world, namely, in a twofold manner. First, under the Law. Here the Decalogue
is expounded, and some other points relating to the law discussed, Chap. 7 and
8. Secondly, under the Gospel. Here the resemblance and difference of the two
dispensations are considered, Chap. 9, 10, 11.<br><br>III. What kind of person
Christ was, and behaved to be, in order to perform the office of
Mediator&#8212;viz. God and man in one person, Chap. 12, 13, 14.<br><br>IV. For what
end he was sent into the world by the Father. Here Christ&#8217;s prophetical,
kingly, and priestly offices are considered, Chap. 15.<br><br>V. In what way, or by
what successive steps, Christ fulfilled the office of our Redeemer, Chap. 16.
Here are considered his crucifixion, death, burial, descent to hell,
resurrection, ascension to heaven, and seat at the right hand of the Father,
together with the practical use of the whole doctrine. Chapter 17 contains an
answer to the question, Whether Christ is properly said to have merited the
grace of God for us.<br><br><br><br><br><br></div>

<div align="center">THROUGH THE FALL AND REVOLT OF ADAM, THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE
MADE ACCURSED AND DEGENERATE. OF ORIGINAL SIN.<br><br><br><br></div>
<div><i>I. How necessary the knowledge of ourselves is, its nature, the danger
of mistake, its leading parts, sect. 1, 2, 3. II. The causes of Adam&#8217;s
fearful fall, sect. 4. III. The effects of the fall extending to Adam&#8217;s
posterity, and all the creatures, sect. 5, to the end of the Chapter, where the
nature, propagation, and effect of original sin are
considered.</i><br><br><br><br></div>
<div align="center">Sections.<br><br><br><br></div>
<div>1.	 The knowledge of ourselves most necessary. To use it properly we must
be divested of pride, and clothed with true humility, which will dispose us to
consider our fall, and embrace the mercy of God in Christ.<br><br>2.	 Though there
is plausibility in the sentiment which stimulates us to self-admiration, the
only sound sentiment is that which inclines us to true humbleness of mind.
Pretexts for pride. The miserable vanity of sinful man.<br><br>3.	 Different views
taken by carnal wisdom and by conscience, which appeals to divine justice as its
standard. The knowledge of ourselves, consisting of two parts, the former of
which having already been discussed, the latter is here considered.<br><br>4.	 In
considering this latter part, two points to be considered; 1. How it happened
that Adam involved himself and the whole human race in this dreadful calamity.
This the result not of sensual intemperance, but of infidelity (the source of
other heinous sins), which led to revolt from God, from whom all true happiness
must be derived. An enumeration of the other sins produced by the infidelity of
the first man.<br><br>5.	 The second point to be considered is, the extent to which
the contagious influence of the fall extends. It extends, 1. To all the
creatures, though unoffending; and, 2. To the whole posterity of Adam. Hence
hereditary corruption, or original sin, and the depravation of a nature which
was previously pure and good. This depravation communicated to the whole
posterity of Adam, but not in the way supposed by the Pelagians and
Celestians.<br><br>6.	 Depravation communicated not merely by imitation, but by
propagation. This proved, 1. From the contrast drawn between Adam and Christ.
Confirmation from passages of Scripture; 2 From the general declaration that we
are the children of wrath.<br><br>7.	 Objection, that if Adam&#8217;s sin is
propagated to his posterity, the soul must be derived by transmission. Answer.
Another objection&#8212;viz. that children cannot derive corruption from pious
parents. Answer.<br><br>8.	 Definition of original sin. Two parts in the definition.
Exposition of the latter part. Original sin exposes us to the wrath of God. It
also produces in us the works of the flesh. Other definitions considered.<br><br>9.	
Exposition of the former part of the definition&#8212;viz. that hereditary
depravity extends to all the faculties of the soul.<br><br>10.	From the exposition
of both parts of the definition it follows that God is not the author of sin,
the whole human race being corrupted by an inherent viciousness.<br><br>11.	 This,
however, is not from nature, but is an adventitious quality. Accordingly, the
dream of the Manichees as to two principles vanishes.<br><br><br><br>1. IT was not
without reason that the ancient proverb so strongly recommended to man the
knowledge of himself. For if it is deemed disgraceful to be ignorant of things
pertaining to the business of life, much more disgraceful is self-ignorance, in
consequence of which we miserably deceive ourselves in matters of the highest
moment, and so walk blindfold. But the more useful the precept is, the more
careful we must be not to use it preposterously, as we see certain philosophers
have done. For they, when exhorting man to know himself, state the motive to be,
that he may not be ignorant of his own excellence and dignity. They wish him to
see nothing in himself but what will fill him with vain confidence, and inflate
him with pride. But self-knowledge consists in this, <i>first</i>, When
reflecting on what God gave us at our creation, and still continues graciously
to give, we perceive how great the excellence of our nature would have been had
its integrity remained, and, at the same time, remember that we have nothing of
our own, but depend entirely on God, from whom we hold at pleasure whatever he
has seen it meet to bestow; <i>secondly</i>, When viewing our miserable
condition since Adam&#8217;s fall, all confidence and boasting are overthrown,
we blush for shame, and feel truly humble. For as God at first formed us in his
own image, that he might elevate our minds to the pursuit of virtue, and the
contemplation of eternal life, so to prevent us from heartlessly burying those
noble qualities which distinguish us from the lower animals, it is of importance
to know that we were endued with reason and intelligence, in order that we might
cultivate a holy and honourable life, and regard a blessed immortality as our
destined aim. At the same time, it is impossible to think of our primeval
dignity without being immediately reminded of the sad spectacle of our ignominy
and corruption, ever since we fell from our original in the person of our first
parent. In this way, we feel dissatisfied with ourselves, and become truly
humble, while we are inflamed with new desires to seek after God, in whom each
may regain those good qualities of which all are found to be utterly
destitute.<br><br>2. In examining ourselves, the search which divine truth enjoins,
and the knowledge which it demands, are such as may indispose us to every thing
like confidence in our own powers, leave us devoid of all means of boasting, and
so incline us to submission. This is the course which we must follow, if we
would attain to the true goal, both in speculation and practice. I am not
unaware how much more plausible the view is, which invites us rather to ponder
on our good qualities, than to contemplate what must overwhelm us with
shame&#8212;our miserable destitution and ignominy. There is nothing more
acceptable to the human mind than flattery, and, accordingly, when told that its
endowments are of a high order, it is apt to be excessively credulous. Hence it
is not strange that the greater part of mankind have erred so egregiously in
this matter. Owing to the innate self-love by which all are blinded, we most
willingly persuade ourselves that we do not possess a single quality which is
deserving of hatred; and hence, independent of any countenance from without,
general credit is given to the very foolish idea, that man is perfectly
sufficient of himself for all the purposes of a good and happy life. If any are
disposed to think more modestly, and concede somewhat to God, that they may not
seem to arrogate every thing as their own, still, in making the division, they
apportion matters so, that the chief ground of confidence and boasting always
remains with themselves. Then, if a discourse is pronounced which flatters the
pride spontaneously springing up in man&#8217;s inmost heart, nothing seems more
delightful. Accordingly, in every age, he who is most forward in extolling the
excellence of human nature, is received with the loudest applause. But be this
heralding of human excellence what it may, by teaching man to rest in himself,
it does nothing more than fascinate by its sweetness, and, at the same time, so
delude as to drown in perdition all who assent to it. For what avails it to
proceed in vain confidence, to deliberate, resolve, plan, and attempt what we
deem pertinent to the purpose, and, at the very outset, prove deficient and
destitute both of sound intelligence and true virtue, though we still
confidently persist till we rush headlong on destruction? But this is the best
that can happen to those who put confidence in their own powers. Whosoever,
therefore, gives heed to those teachers, who merely employ us in contemplating
our good qualities, so far from making progress in self-knowledge, will be
plunged into the most pernicious ignorance.<br><br>3. While revealed truth concurs
with the general consent of mankind in teaching that the second part of wisdom
consists in self-knowledge, they differ greatly as to the method by which this
knowledge is to be acquired. In the judgment of the flesh man deems his
self-knowledge complete, when, with overweening confidence in his own
intelligence and integrity, he takes courage, and spurs himself on to virtuous
deeds, and when, declaring war upon vice, he uses his utmost endeavour to attain
to the honourable and the fair. But he who tries himself by the standard of
divine justice, finds nothing to inspire him with confidence; and hence, the
more thorough his self-examination, the greater his despondency. Abandoning all
dependence on himself, he feels that he is utterly incapable of duly regulating
his conduct. It is not the will of God, however, that we should forget the
primeval dignity which he bestowed on our first parents&#8212;a dignity which
may well stimulate us to the pursuit of goodness and justice. It is impossible
for us to think of our first original, or the end for which we were created,
without being urged to meditate on immortality, and to seek the kingdom of God.
But such meditation, so far from raising our spirits, rather casts them down,
and makes us humble. For what is our original? One from which we have fallen.
What the end of our creation? One from which we have altogether strayed, so
that, weary of our miserable lot, we groan, and groaning sigh for a dignity now
lost. When we say that man should see nothing in himself which can raise his
spirits, our meaning is, that he possesses nothing on which he can proudly plume
himself. Hence, in considering the knowledge which man ought to have of himself,
it seems proper to divide it thus, <i>first</i>, to consider the end for which
he was created, and the qualities&#8212;by no means contemptible
qualities&#8212;with which he was endued, thus urging him to meditate on divine
worship and the future life; and, <i>secondly</i>, to consider his faculties, or
rather want of faculties&#8212;a want which, when perceived, will annihilate all
his confidence, and cover him with confusion. The tendency of the former view is
to teach him what his duty is, of the latter, to make him aware how far he is
able to perform it. We shall treat of both in their proper order.<br><br>4. As the
act which God punished so severely must have been not a trivial fault, but a
heinous crime, it will be necessary to attend to the peculiar nature of the sin
which produced Adam&#8217;s fall, and provoked God to inflict such fearful
vengeance on the whole human race. The common idea of sensual intemperance is
childish. The sum and substance of all virtues could not consist in abstinence
from a single fruit amid a general abundance of every delicacy that could be
desired, the earth, with happy fertility, yielding not only abundance, but also
endless variety. We must, therefore, look deeper than sensual intemperance. The
prohibition to touch the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was a trial of
obedience, that Adam, by observing it, might prove his willing submission to the
command of God. For the very term shows the end of the precept to have been to
keep him contented with his lot, and not allow him arrogantly to aspire beyond
it. The promise, which gave him hope of eternal life as long as he should eat of
the tree of life, and, on the other hand, the fearful denunciation of death the
moment he should taste of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, were meant
to prove and exercise his faith. Hence it is not difficult to infer in what way
Adam provoked the wrath of God. Augustine, indeed, is not far from the mark,
when he says (in Psal. 19), that pride was the beginning of all evil, because,
had not man&#8217;s ambition carried him higher than he was permitted, he might
have continued in his first estate. A further definition, however, must be
derived from the kind of temptation which Moses describes. When, by the subtlety
of the devil, the woman faithlessly abandoned the command of God, her fall
obviously had its origin in disobedience. This Paul confirms, when he says,
that, by the disobedience of one man, all were destroyed. At the same time, it
is to be observed, that the first man revolted against the authority of God, not
only in allowing himself to be ensnared by the wiles of the devil, but also by
despising the truth, and turning aside to lies. Assuredly, when the word of God
is despised, all reverence for Him is gone. His majesty cannot be duly honoured
among us, nor his worship maintained in its integrity, unless we hang as it were
upon his lips. Hence infidelity was at the root of the revolt. From infidelity,
again, sprang ambition and pride, together with ingratitude; because Adam, by
longing for more than was allotted him, manifested contempt for the great
liberality with which God had enriched him. It was surely monstrous impiety that
a son of earth should deem it little to have been made in the likeness, unless
he were also made the equal of God. If the apostasy by which man withdraws from
the authority of his Maker, nay, petulantly shakes off his allegiance to him, is
a foul and execrable crime, it is in vain to extenuate the sin of Adam. Nor was
it simple apostasy. It was accompanied with foul insult to God, the guilty pair
assenting to Satan&#8217;s calumnies when he charged God with malice, envy, and
falsehood. In fine, infidelity opened the door to ambition, and ambition was the
parent of rebellion, man casting off the fear of God, and giving free vent to
his lust. Hence, Bernard truly says, that, in the present day, a door of
salvation is opened to us when we receive the gospel with our ears, just as by
the same entrance, when thrown open to Satan, death was admitted. Never would
Adam have dared to show any repugnance to the command of God if he had not been
incredulous as to his word. The strongest curb to keep all his affections under
due restraint, would have been the belief that nothing was better than to
cultivate righteousness by obeying the commands of God, and that the highest
possible felicity was to be loved by
him.<sup><font size="2">14</font><a name="fnB1" href="#fn1">[3]</a></sup> Man,
therefore, when carried away by the blasphemies of Satan, did his very utmost to
annihilate the whole glory of God.<br><br>5. As Adam&#8217;s spiritual life would
have consisted in remaining united and bound to his Maker, so estrangement from
him was the death of his soul. Nor is it strange that he who perverted the whole
order of nature in heaven and earth deteriorated his race by his revolt.
&#8220;The whole creation groaneth,&#8221; saith St Paul, &#8220;being made
subject to vanity, not willingly,&#8221; (Rom. 8:20, 22). If the reason is
asked, there cannot be a doubt that creation bears part of the punishment
deserved by man, for whose use all other creatures were made. Therefore, since
through man&#8217;s fault a curse has extended above and below, over all the
regions of the world, there is nothing unreasonable in its extending to all his
offspring. After the heavenly image in man was effaced, he not only was himself
punished by a withdrawal of the ornaments in which he had been
arrayed&#8212;viz. wisdom, virtue, justice, truth, and holiness, and by the
substitution in their place of those dire pests, blindness, impotence, vanity,
impurity, and unrighteousness, but he involved his posterity also, and plunged
them in the same wretchedness. This is the hereditary corruption to which early
Christian writers gave the name of Original Sin, meaning by the term the
depravation of a nature formerly good and pure. The subject gave rise to much
discussion, there being nothing more remote from common apprehension, than that
the fault of one should render all guilty, and so become a common sin. This
seems to be the reason why the oldest doctors of the church only glance
obscurely at the point, or, at least, do not explain it so clearly as it
required. This timidity, however, could not prevent the rise of a Pelagius with
his profane fiction&#8212;that Adam sinned only to his own hurt, but did no hurt
to his posterity. Satan, by thus craftily hiding the disease, tried to render it
incurable. But when it was clearly proved from Scripture that the sin of the
first man passed to all his posterity, recourse was had to the cavil, that it
passed by imitation, and not by propagation. The orthodoxy, therefore, and more
especially Augustine, laboured to show, that we are not corrupted by acquired
wickedness, but bring an innate corruption from the very womb. It was the
greatest impudence to deny this. But no man will wonder at the presumption of
the Pelagians and Celestians, who has learned from the writings of that holy man
how extreme the effrontery of these heretics was. Surely there is no ambiguity
in David&#8217;s confession, &#8220;I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my
mother conceive me,&#8221; (Ps. 51:5). His object in the passage is not to throw
blame on his parents; but the better to commend the goodness of God towards him,
he properly reiterates the confession of impurity from his very birth. As it is
clear, that there was no peculiarity in David&#8217;s case, it follows that it
is only an instance of the common lot of the whole human race. All of us,
therefore, descending from an impure seed, come into the world tainted with the
contagion of sin. Nay, before we behold the light of the sun we are in
God&#8217;s sight defiled and polluted. &#8220;Who can bring a clean thing out
of an unclean? Not one,&#8221; says the Book of Job (Job 14:4).<br><br>6. We thus
see that the impurity of parents is transmitted to their children, so that all,
without exception, are originally depraved. The commencement of this depravity
will not be found until we ascend to the first parent of all as the fountain
head. We must, therefore, hold it for certain, that, in regard to human nature,
Adam was not merely a progenitor, but, as it were, a root, and that,
accordingly, by his corruption, the whole human race was deservedly vitiated.
This is plain from the contrast which the Apostle draws between Adam and Christ,
&#8220;Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin;
and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned; even so might grace
reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord,&#8221;
(Rom. 5:19&#8211;21). To what quibble will the Pelagians here recur? That the
sin of Adam was propagated by imitation! Is the righteousness of Christ then
available to us only in so far as it is an example held forth for our imitation?
Can any man tolerate such blasphemy? But if, out of all controversy, the
righteousness of Christ, and thereby life, is ours by communication, it follows
that both of these were lost in Adam that they might be recovered in Christ,
whereas sin and death were brought in by Adam, that they might be abolished in
Christ. There is no obscurity in the words, &#8220;As by one man&#8217;s
disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be
made righteous.&#8221; Accordingly, the relation subsisting between the two is
this, As Adam, by his ruin, involved and ruined us, so Christ, by his grace,
restored us to salvation. In this clear light of truth I cannot see any need of
a longer or more laborious proof. Thus, too, in the First Epistle to the
Corinthians, when Paul would confirm believers in the confident hope of the
resurrection, he shows that the life is recovered in Christ which was lost in
Adam (1 Cor. 15:22). Having already declared that all died in Adam, he now also
openly testifies, that all are imbued with the taint of sin. Condemnation,
indeed, could not reach those who are altogether free from blame. But his
meaning cannot be made clearer than from the other member of the sentence, in
which he shows that the hope of life is restored in Christ. Every one knows that
the only mode in which this is done is, when by a wondrous communication Christ
transfuses into us the power of his own righteousness, as it is elsewhere said,
&#8220;The Spirit is life because of righteousness,&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:22).
Therefore, the only explanation which can be given of the expression, &#8220;in
Adam all died,&#8221; is, that he by sinning not only brought disaster and ruin
upon himself, but also plunged our nature into like destruction; and that not
only in one fault, in a matter not pertaining to us, but by the corruption into
which he himself fell, he infected his whole seed. Paul never could have said
that all are &#8220;by nature the children of wrath,&#8221; (Eph. 2:3), if they
had not been cursed from the womb. And it is obvious that the nature there
referred to is not nature such as God created, but as vitiated in Adam; for it
would have been most incongruous to make God the author of death. Adam,
therefore, when he corrupted himself, transmitted the contagion to all his
posterity. For a heavenly Judge, even our Saviour himself, declares that all are
by birth vicious and depraved, when he says that &#8220;that which is born of
the flesh is fleshy&#8221; (John 3:6), and that therefore the gate of life is
closed against all until they have been regenerated.<br><br>7. To the understanding
of this subject, there is no necessity for an anxious discussion (which in no
small degree perplexed the ancient doctors), as to whether the soul of the child
comes by transmission from the soul of the
parent.<sup><font size="2">14</font><a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[4]</a></sup> It
should be enough for us to know that Adam was made the depository of the
endowments which God was pleased to bestow on human nature, and that, therefore,
when he lost what he had received, he lost not only for himself but for us all.
Why feel any anxiety about the transmission of the soul, when we know that the
qualities which Adam lost he received for us not less than for himself, that
they were not gifts to a single man, but attributes of the whole human race?
There is nothing absurd, therefore, in the view, that when he was divested, his
nature was left naked and destitute that he having been defiled by sin, the
pollution extends to all his seed. Thus, from a corrupt root corrupt branches
proceeding, transmit their corruption to the saplings which spring from them.
The children being vitiated in their parent, conveyed the taint to the
grandchildren; in other words, corruption commencing in Adam, is, by perpetual
descent, conveyed from those preceding to those coming after them. The cause of
the contagion is neither in the substance of the flesh nor the soul, but God was
pleased to ordain that those gifts which he had bestowed on the first man, that
man should lose as well for his descendants as for himself. The Pelagian cavil,
as to the improbability of children deriving corruption from pious parents,
whereas, they ought rather to be sanctified by their purity, is easily refuted.
Children come not by spiritual regeneration but carnal
descent.<sup><font size="2">14</font><a name="fnB3" href="#fn3">[5]</a></sup>
Accordingly, as Augustine says, &#8220;Both the condemned unbeliever and the
acquitted believer beget offspring not acquitted but condemned, because the
nature which begets is
corrupt.&#8221;<sup><font size="2">14</font><a name="fnB4" href="#fn4">[6]</a></sup>
Moreover, though godly parents do in some measure contribute to the holiness of
their offspring, this is by the blessing of God; a blessing, however, which does
not prevent the primary and universal curse of the whole race from previously
taking effect. Guilt is from nature, whereas sanctification is from supernatural
grace.<br><br>8. But lest the thing itself of which we speak be unknown or doubtful,
it will be proper to define original sin. (Calvin, in Conc. Trident. 1, Dec.
Sess. 5). I have no intention, however, to discuss all the definitions which
different writers have adopted, but only to adduce the one which seems to me
most accordant with truth. Original sin, then, may be defined a hereditary
corruption and depravity of our nature, extending to all the parts of the soul,
which first makes us obnoxious to the wrath of God, and then produces in us
works which in Scripture are termed works of the flesh. This corruption is
repeatedly designated by Paul by the term
sin<sup><font size="2">14</font><a name="fnB5" href="#fn5">[7]</a></sup> (Gal.
5:19); while the works which proceed from it, such as adultery, fornication,
theft, hatred, murder, revellings, he terms, in the same way, the fruits of sin,
though in various passages of Scripture, and even by Paul himself, they are also
termed sins. The two things, therefore, are to be distinctly observed&#8212;viz.
that being thus perverted and corrupted in all the parts of our nature, we are,
merely on account of such corruption, deservedly condemned by God, to whom
nothing is acceptable but righteousness, innocence, and purity. This is not
liability for another&#8217;s fault. For when it is said, that the sin of Adam
has made us obnoxious to the justice of God, the meaning is not, that we, who
are in ourselves innocent and blameless, are bearing his guilt, but that since
by his transgression we are all placed under the curse, he is said to have
brought us under
obligation.<sup><font size="2">14</font><a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[8]</a></sup>
Through him, however, not only has punishment been derived, but pollution
instilled, for which punishment is justly due. Hence Augustine, though he often
terms it another&#8217;s sin (that he may more clearly show how it comes to us
by descent), at the same time asserts that it is each individual&#8217;s own
sin.<sup><font size="2">14</font><a name="fnB7" href="#fn7">[9]</a></sup> And
the Apostle most distinctly testifies, that &#8220;death passed upon all men,
for that all have sinned,&#8221; (Rom. 5:12); that is, are involved in original
sin, and polluted by its stain. Hence, even infants bringing their condemnation
with them from their mother&#8217;s womb, suffer not for another&#8217;s, but
for their own defect. For although they have not yet produced the fruits of
their own unrighteousness, they have the seed implanted in them. Nay, their
whole nature is, as it were, a seed-bed of sin, and therefore cannot but be
odious and abominable to God. Hence it follows, that it is properly deemed
sinful in the sight of God; for there could be no condemnation without guilt.
Next comes the other point&#8212;viz. that this perversity in us never ceases,
but constantly produces new fruits, in other words, those works of the flesh
which we formerly described; just as a lighted furnace sends forth sparks and
flames, or a fountain without ceasing pours out water. Hence, those who have
defined original sin as the want of the original righteousness which we ought to
have had, though they substantially comprehend the whole case, do not
significantly enough express its power and energy. For our nature is not only
utterly devoid of goodness, but so prolific in all kinds of evil, that it can
never be idle. Those who term it <i>concupiscence</i> use a word not very
inappropriate, provided it were added (this, however, many will by no means
concede), that everything which is in man, from the intellect to the will, from
the soul even to the flesh, is defiled and pervaded with this concupiscence; or,
to express it more briefly, that the whole man is in himself nothing else than
concupiscence.<br><br>9. I have said, therefore, that all the parts of the soul were
possessed by sin, ever since Adam revolted from the fountain of righteousness.
For not only did the inferior appetites entice him, but abominable impiety
seized upon the very citadel of the mind, and pride penetrated to his inmost
heart (Rom. 7:12; Book 4, chap. 15, sec. 10&#8211;12), so that it is foolish and
unmeaning to confine the corruption thence proceeding to what are called sensual
motions, or to call it an excitement, which allures, excites, and drags the
single part which they call sensuality into sin. Here Peter Lombard has
displayed gross ignorance (Lomb., lib. 2 Dist. 31). When investigating the seat
of corruption, he says it is in the flesh (as Paul declares), not properly,
indeed, but as being more apparent in the flesh. As if Paul had meant that only
a part of the soul, and not the whole nature, was opposed to supernatural grace.
Paul himself leaves no room for doubt, when he says, that corruption does not
dwell in one part only, but that no part is free from its deadly taint. For,
speaking of corrupt nature, he not only condemns the inordinate nature of the
appetites, but, in particular, declares that the understanding is subjected to
blindness, and the heart to depravity (Eph. 4:17, 18). The third chapter of the
Epistle to the Romans is nothing but a description of original sin; The same
thing appears more clearly from the mode of renovation. For the spirit, which is
contrasted with the old man, and the flesh, denotes not only the grace by which
the sensual or inferior part of the soul is corrected, but includes a complete
reformation of all its parts (Eph. 4:23). And, accordingly, Paul enjoins not
only that gross appetites be suppressed, but that we be renewed in the spirit of
our mind (Eph. 4:23), as he elsewhere tells us to be transformed by the renewing
of our mind (Rom. 12:2). Hence it follows, that that part in which the dignity
and excellence of the soul are most conspicuous, has not only been wounded, but
so corrupted, that mere cure is not sufficient. There must be a new nature. How
far sin has seized both on the mind and heart, we shall shortly see. Here I only
wished briefly to observe, that the whole man, from the crown of the head to the
sole of the foot, is so deluged, as it were, that no part remains exempt from
sin, and, therefore, everything which proceeds from him is imputed as sin. Thus
Paul says, that all carnal thoughts and affections are enmity against God, and
consequently death (Rom. 8:7).<br><br>10. Let us have done, then, with those who
dare to inscribe the name of God on their vices, because we say that men are
born vicious. The divine workmanship, which they ought to look for in the nature
of Adam, when still entire and uncorrupted, they absurdly expect to find in
their depravity. The blame of our ruin rests with our own carnality, not with
God, its only cause being our degeneracy from our original condition. And let no
one here glamour that God might have provided better for our safety by
preventing Adam&#8217;s fall. This objection, which, from the daring presumption
implied in it, is odious to every pious mind, relates to the mystery of
predestination, which will afterwards be considered in its own place (Tertull.
de Pr&#190;script., Calvin, Lib. de Predest). Meanwhile let us remember that our
ruin is attributable to our own depravity, that we may not insinuate a charge
against God himself, the Author of nature. It is true that nature has received a
mortal wound, but there is a great difference between a wound inflicted from
without, and one inherent in our first condition. It is plain that this wound
was inflicted by sin; and, therefore, we have no ground of complaint except
against ourselves. This is carefully taught in Scripture. For the Preacher says,
&#8220;Lo, this only have I found, that God made man upright; but they have
sought out many inventions,&#8221; (Eccl. 7:29). Since man, by the kindness of
God, was made upright, but by his oven infatuation fell away unto vanity, his
destruction is obviously attributable only to himself (Athanas. in Orat. Cont.
Idola).<br><br>11. We say, then, that man is corrupted by a natural viciousness, but
not by one which proceeded from nature. In saying that it proceeded not from
nature, we mean that it was rather an adventitious event which befell man, than
a substantial property assigned to him from the
beginning.<sup><font size="2">15</font><a name="fnB8" href="#fn8">[0]</a></sup>
We, however call it <i>natural</i> to prevent any one from supposing that each
individual contracts it by depraved habit, whereas all receive it by a
hereditary law. And we have authority for so calling it. For, on the same
grounds the apostle says, that we are &#8220;by nature the children of
wrath,&#8221; (Eph. 2:3). How could God, who takes pleasure in the meanest of
his works be offended with the noblest of them all? The offence is not with the
work itself, but the corruption of the work. Wherefore, if it is not improper to
say, that, in consequence of the corruption of human nature, man is naturally
hateful to God, it is not improper to say, that he is naturally vicious and
depraved. Hence, in the view of our corrupt nature, Augustine hesitates not to
call those sins natural which necessarily reign in the flesh wherever the grace
of God is wanting. This disposes of the absurd notion of the Manichees, who,
imagining that man was essentially wicked, went the length of assigning him a
different Creator, that they might thus avoid the appearance of attributing the
cause and origin of evil to a righteous God.<br><br><br><br></div>

<div align="center">MAN NOW DEPRIVED OF FREEDOM OF WILL, AND MISERABLY
ENSLAVED.<br><br><br><br></div>
<div><i>Having in the first chapter treated of the fall of man, and the
corruption of the human race, it becomes necessary to inquire, Whether the sons
of Adam are deprived of all liberty; and if any particle of liberty remains, how
far its power extends? The four next chapters are devoted to this question. This
second chapter may be reduced to three general heads: I. The foundation of the

10&#8211;27.</i><br><br><br><br></div>
<div align="center"><i>Sections.</i><br><br></div>
<div><br><br>1.	 Connection of the previous with the four following chapters. In
order to lay a proper foundation for the discussion of free will, two obstacles
in the way to be removed&#8212;viz. sloth and pride. The basis and sum of the
whole discussion. The solid structure of this basis, and a clear demonstration
of it by the argument <i>a majori ad minus</i>. Also from the inconveniences and
absurdities arising from the obstacle of pride.<br><br>2.	 The second part of the
chapter containing the opinions of others. 1. The opinions of
philosophers.<br><br>3.	 The labyrinths of philosophers. A summary of the opinion
common to all the philosophers.<br><br>4.	 The opinions of others
continued&#8212;viz. The opinions of the ancient theologians on the subject of
free will. These composed partly of Philosophy and partly of Theology. Hence
their falsehood, extravagance, perplexity, variety, and contradiction. Too great
fondness for philosophy in the Church has obscured the knowledge of God and of
ourselves. The better to explain the opinions of philosophers, a definition of
Free Will given. Wide difference between this definition and these
opinions.<br><br>5.	 Certain things annexed to Free Will by the ancient theologians,
especially the Schoolmen. Many kinds of Free Will according to them.<br><br>6.	
Puzzles of scholastic divines in the explanation of this question.<br><br>7.	 The
conclusion that so trivial a matter ought not to be so much magnified. Objection
of those who have a fondness for new terms in the Church. Objection
answered.<br><br>8.	 Another answer. The Fathers, and especially Augustine, while
retaining the term Free Will, yet condemned the doctrine of the heretics on the
subject, as destroying the grace of God.<br><br>9.	 The language of the ancient
writers on the subject of Free Will is, with the exception of that of Augustine,
almost unintelligible. Still they set little or no value on human virtue, and
ascribe the praise of all goodness to the Holy Spirit.<br><br>10.	 The last part of
the chapter, containing a simple statement of the true doctrine. The fundamental
principle is, that man first begins to profit in the knowledge of himself when
he becomes sensible of his ruined condition. This confirmed, 1. by passages of
Scripture.<br><br>11.	 Confirmed, 2. by the testimony of ancient
theologians.<br><br>12.	 The foundation being laid, to show how far the power both
of the intellect and will now extends, it is maintained in general, and in
conformity with the views of Augustine and the Schoolmen, that the natural
endowments of man are corrupted, and the supernatural almost entirely lost. A
separate consideration of the powers of the Intellect and the Will. Some general
considerations, 1. The intellect possesses some powers of perception. Still it
labours under a twofold defect.<br><br>13.	Man&#8217;s intelligence extends both to
things terrestrial and celestial. The power of the intellect in regard to the
knowledge of things terrestrial. First, with regard to matters of civil
polity.<br><br>14.	 The power of the intellect, secondly, with regard to the arts.
Particular gifts in this respect conferred on individuals, and attesting the
grace of God.<br><br>15.	 The rise of this knowledge of things terrestrial, first,
that we may see how human nature, notwithstanding of its fall, is still adorned
by God with excellent endowments.<br><br>16.	 Use of this knowledge continued.
Secondly, that we may see that these endowments bestowed on individuals are
intended for the common benefit of mankind. They are sometimes conferred even on
the wicked.<br><br>17.	 Some portion of human nature still left. This, whatever be
the amount of it, should be ascribed entirely to the divine indulgence. Reason
of this. Examples.<br><br>18.	 Second part of the discussion, namely, that which
relates to the power of the human intellect in regard to things celestial. These
reducible to three heads, namely, divine knowledge, adoption, and will. The
blindness of man in regard to these proved and thus tested by a simile.<br><br>19.	
Proved, moreover, by passages of Scripture, showing, 1. That the sons of Adam
are endued with some light, but not enough to enable them to comprehend God.
Reasons.<br><br>20.	 Adoption not from nature, but from our heavenly Father, being
sealed in the elect by the Spirit of regeneration. Obvious from many passages of
Scripture, that, previous to regeneration, the human intellect is altogether
unable to comprehend the things relating to regeneration. This fully proved.
First argument. Second argument. Third argument.<br><br>21.	 Fourth argument.
Scripture ascribes the glory of our adoption and salvation to God only. The
human intellect blind as to heavenly things until it is illuminated. Disposal of
a heretical objection.<br><br>22.	 Human intellect ignorant of the true knowledge of
the divine law. This proved by the testimony of an Apostle, by an inference from
the same testimony, and from a consideration of the end and definition of the
Law of Nature. Plato obviously mistaken in attributing all sins to
ignorance.<br><br>23.	 Themistius nearer the truth in maintaining, that the delusion
of the intellect is manifested not so much in generals as in particulars.
Exception to this rule.<br><br>24.	 Themistius, however, mistaken in thinking that
the intellect is so very seldom deceived as to generals. Blindness of the human
intellect when tested by the standard of the Divine Law, in regard both to the
first and second tables. Examples.<br><br>25.	 A middle view to be taken&#8212;viz.
that all sins are not imputable to ignorance, and, at the same time, that all
sins do not imply intentional malice. All the human mind conceives and plans in
this matter is evil in the sight of God. Need of divine direction every
moment.<br><br>26.	 The will examined. The natural desire of good, which is
universally felt, no proof of the freedom of the human will. Two fallacies as to
the use of terms, <i>appetite</i> and good.<br><br>27.	 The doctrine of the
Schoolmen on this subject opposed to and refuted by Scripture. The whole man
being subject to the power of sin, it follows that the will, which is the chief
seat of sin, requires to be most strictly curbed. Nothing ours but
sin.<br><br><br><br>1. HAVING seen that the dominion of sin, ever since the first man
was brought under it, not only extends to the whole race, but has complete
possession of every soul, it now remains to consider more closely, whether from
the period of being thus enslaved, we have been deprived of all liberty; and if
any portion still remains, how far its power extends. In order to facilitate the
answer to this questions it may be proper in passing to point out the course
which our inquiry ought to take. The best method of avoiding error is to
consider the dangers which beset us on either side. Man being devoid of all
uprightness, immediately takes occasion from the fact to indulge in sloth, and
having no ability in himself for the study of righteousness, treats the whole
subject as if he had no concern in it. On the other hand, man cannot arrogate
any thing, however minute, to himself, without robbing God of his honour, and
through rash confidence subjecting himself to a fall. To keep free of both these
rocks,<sup><font size="2">15</font><a name="fnB9" href="#fn9">[1]</a></sup> our
proper course will be, first, to show that man has no remaining good in himself,
and is beset on every side by the most miserable destitution; and then teach him
to aspire to the goodness of which he is devoid, and the liberty of which he has
been deprived: thus giving him a stronger stimulus to exertion than he could
have if he imagined himself possessed of the highest virtue. How necessary the
latter point is, everybody sees. As to the former, several seem to entertain
more doubt than they ought. For it being admitted as incontrovertible that man
is not to be denied any thing that is truly his own, it ought also to be
admitted, that he is to be deprived of every thing like false boasting. If man
had no title to glory in himself, when, by the kindness of his Maker, he was
distinguished by the noblest ornaments, how much ought he to be humbled now,
when his ingratitude has thrust him down from the highest glory to extreme
ignominy? At the time when he was raised to the highest pinnacle of honour, all
which Scripture attributes to him is, that he was created in the image of God,
thereby intimating that the blessings in which his happiness consisted were not
his own, but derived by divine communication. What remains, therefore, now that
man is stript of all his glory, than to acknowledge the God for whose kindness
he failed to be grateful, when he was loaded with the riches of his grace? Not
having glorified him by the acknowledgment of his blessings, now, at least, he
ought to glorify him by the confession of his poverty. In truth, it is no less
useful for us to renounce all the praise of wisdom and virtue, than to aim at
the glory of God. Those who invest us with more than we possess only add
sacrilege to our ruin. For when we are taught to contend in our own strength,
what more is done than to lift us up, and then leave us to lean on a reed which
immediately gives way? Indeed, our strength is exaggerated when it is compared
to a reed. All that foolish men invent and prattle on this subject is mere
smoke. Wherefore, it is not without reason that Augustine so often repeats the
well-known saying, that free will is more destroyed than established by its
defenders (August. in Evang. Joann. Tract. 81). It was necessary to premise this
much for the sake of some who, when they hear that human virtue is totally
overthrown, in order that the power of God in man may be exalted, conceive an
utter dislike to the whole subject, as if it were perilous, not to say
superfluous, whereas it is manifestly both most necessary and most
useful.<sup><font size="2">15</font><a name="fnB10" href="#fn10">[2]</a></sup><br><br>2.
Having lately observed, that the faculties of the soul are seated in the mind
and the heart, let us now consider how far the power of each extends.
Philosophers generally maintain, that reason dwells in the mind like a lamp,
throwing light on all its counsels, and like a queen, governing the
will&#8212;that it is so pervaded with divine light as to be able to consult for
the best, and so endued with vigour as to be able perfectly to command; that, on
the contrary, sense is dull and short-sighted, always creeping on the ground,
grovelling among inferior objects, and never rising to true vision; that the
appetite, when it obeys reason, and does not allow itself to be subjugated by
sense, is borne to the study of virtue, holds a straight course, and becomes
transformed into will; but that when enslaved by sense, it is corrupted and
depraved so as to degenerate into lust. In a word, since, according to their
opinion, the faculties which I have mentioned above, namely, intellect, sense,
and appetite, or will (the latter being the term in ordinary use), are seated in
the soul, they maintain that the intellect is endued with reason, the best guide
to a virtuous and happy life, provided it duly avails itself of its excellence,
and exerts the power with which it is naturally endued; that, at the same time,
the inferior movement, which is termed sense, and by which the mind is led away
to error and delusion, is of such a nature, that it can be tamed and gradually
subdued by the power of reason. To the will, moreover, they give an intermediate
place between reason and sense, regarding it as possessed of full power and
freedom, whether to obey the former, or yield itself up to be hurried away by
the latter.<br><br>3. Sometimes, indeed, convinced by their own experience, they do
not deny how difficult it is for man to establish the supremacy of reason in
himself, inasmuch as he is at one time enticed by the allurements of pleasure;
at another, deluded by a false semblance of good; and, at another, impelled by
unruly passions, and pulled away (to use Plato&#8217;s expression) as by ropes
or sinews (Plato, De Legibus, lib. 1). For this reason, Cicero says, that the
sparks given forth by nature are immediately extinguished by false opinions and
depraved manners (Cicero, Tusc, Qu&#190;st. lib. 3). They confess that when once
diseases of this description have seized upon the mind, their course is too
impetuous to be easily checked, and they hesitate not to compare them to fiery
steeds, which, having thrown off the charioteer, scamper away without restraint.
At the same time, they set it down as beyond dispute, that virtue and vice are
in our own power. For (say they), If it is in our choice to do this thing or
that, it must also be in our choice not to do it: Again, If it is in our choice
not to act, it must also be in our choice to act: But both in doing and
abstaining we seem to act from free choice; and, therefore, if we do good when
we please, we can also refrain from doing it; if we commit evil, we can also
shun the commission of it (Aristot. Ethic. lib. 3 c. 5). Nay, some have gone the
length of boasting (Seneca, <i>passim</i>), that it is the gift of the gods that
we live, but our own that we live well and purely. Hence Cicero says, in the
person of Cotta, that as every one acquires virtue for himself, no wise man ever
thanked the gods for it. &#8220;We are praised,&#8221; says he, &#8220;for
virtue, and glory in virtue, but this could not be, if virtue were the gift of
God, and not from ourselves,&#8221; (Cicero, De Nat. Deorum). A little after, he
adds, &#8220;The opinion of all mankind is, that fortune must be sought from
God, wisdom from ourselves.&#8221; Thus, in short, all philosophers maintain,
that human reason is sufficient for right government; that the will, which is
inferior to it, may indeed be solicited to evil by sense, but having a free
choice, there is nothing to prevent it from following reason as its guide in all
things.<br><br>4. Among ecclesiastical writers, although there is none who did not
acknowledge that sound reason in man was seriously injured by sin, and the will
greatly entangled by vicious desires, yet many of them made too near an approach
to the philosophers. Some of the most ancient writers appear to me to have
exalted human strengths from a fear that a distinct acknowledgment of its
impotence might expose them to the jeers of the philosophers with whom they were
disputing, and also furnish the flesh, already too much disinclined to good,
with a new pretext for sloth. Therefore, to avoid teaching anything which the
majority of mankind might deem absurd, they made it their study, in some
measure, to reconcile the doctrine of Scripture with the dogmas of philosophy,
at the same time making it their special care not to furnish any occasion to
sloth. This is obvious from their words. Chrysostom says, &#8220;God having
placed good and evil in our power, has given us full freedom of choice; he does
not keep back the unwilling, but embraces the willing,&#8221; (Homil. de Prodit.
Judae). Again, &#8220;He who is wicked is often, when he so chooses, changed
into good, and he who is good falls through sluggishness, and becomes wicked.
For the Lord has made our nature free. He does not lay us under necessity, but
furnishing apposite remedies, allows the whole to depend on the views of the
patient,&#8221; (Homily. 18, in Genesis). Again, &#8220;As we can do nothing
rightly until aided by the grace of God, so, until we bring forward what is our
own, we cannot obtain favour from above,&#8221; (Homily. 52). He had previously
said, &#8220;As the whole is not done by divine assistance, we ourselves must of
necessity bring somewhat.&#8221; Accordingly, one of his common expressions is,
&#8220;Let us bring what is our own, God will supply the rest.&#8221; In unison
with this, Jerome says, &#8220;It is ours to begin, God&#8217;s to finish: it is
ours to offer what we can, his to supply what we cannot,&#8221; (Dialog. 3 Cont.
Pelag).<br><br>From these sentences, you see that they have bestowed on man more
than he possesses for the study of virtue, because they thought that they could
not shake off our innate sluggishness unless they argued that we sin by
ourselves alone. With what skill they have thus argued we shall afterwards see.
Assuredly we shall soon be able to show that the sentiments just quoted are most
inaccurate.<sup><font size="2">15</font><a name="fnB11" href="#fn11">[3]</a></sup>
Moreover although the Greek Fathers, above others, and especially Chrysostom,
have exceeded due bounds in extolling the powers of the human will, yet all
ancient theologians, with the exception of Augustine, are so confused,
vacillating, and contradictory on this subject, that no certainty can be
obtained from their writings. It is needless, therefore, to be more particular
in enumerating every separate opinion. It will be sufficient to extract from
each as much as the exposition of the subject seems to require. Succeeding
writers (every one courting applause for his acuteness in the defence of human
nature) have uniformly, one after the other, gone more widely astray, until the
common dogma came to be, that man was corrupted only in the sensual part of his
nature, that reason remained entire, and will was scarcely impaired. Still the
expression was often on their lips, that man&#8217;s natural gifts were
corrupted, and his
supernatural<sup><font size="2">15</font><a name="fnB12" href="#fn12">[4]</a></sup>
taken away. Of the thing implied by these words, however, scarcely one in a
hundred had any distinct idea. Certainly, were I desirous clearly to express
what the corruption of nature is, I would not seek for any other expression. But
it is of great importance attentively to consider what the power of man now is
when vitiated in all the parts of his nature, and deprived of supernatural
gifts. Persons professing to be the disciples of Christ have spoken too much
like the philosophers on this subject. As if human nature were still in its
integrity, the term free will has always been in use among the Latins, while the
Greeks were not ashamed to use a still more presumptuous term&#8212;viz.
aujtexouvsion, as if man had still full power in himself.<br><br>But since the
principle entertained by all, even the vulgar, is, that man is endued with free
will, while some, who would be thought more skilful, know not how far its power
extends; it will be necessary, first to consider the meaning of the term, and
afterwards ascertain, by a simple appeal to Scripture, what man&#8217;s natural
power for good or evil is. The thing meant by free will, though constantly
occurring in all writers, few have defined.
Origin,<sup><font size="2">15</font><a name="fnB13" href="#fn13">[5]</a></sup>
however, seems to have stated the common opinion when he said, It is a power of
reason to discern between good and evil; of will, to choose the one or other.
Nor does Augustine differ from him when he says, It is a power of reason and
will to choose the good, grace assisting,&#8212;to choose the bad, grace
desisting. Bernard, while aiming at greater acuteness, speaks more obscurely,
when he describes it as consent, in regard to the indestructible liberty of the
wills and the inalienable judgment of reason. Anselm&#8217;s definition is not
very intelligible to ordinary understandings. He calls it a power of preserving
rectitude on its own account. Peter Lombard, and the Schoolmen, preferred the
definition of Augustine, both because it was clearer, and did not exclude divine
grace, without which they saw that the will was not sufficient of itself. They
however add something of their own, because they deemed it either better or
necessary for clearer explanation. First, they agree that the term <i>will</i>
(arbitrium) has reference to reason, whose office it is to distinguish between
good and evil, and that the epithet <i>free</i> properly belongs to the will,
which may incline either way. Wherefore, since liberty properly belongs to the
will, Thomas Aquinas says (Part 1 Quast. 83, Art. 3), that the most congruous
definition is to call free will an elective power, combining intelligence and
appetite, but inclining more to appetite. We now perceive in what it is they
suppose the faculty of free will to consist&#8212;viz. in reason and will. It
remains to see how much they attribute to each.<br><br>5. In general, they are wont
to place under the free will of man only intermediate things&#8212;viz. those
which pertain not to the kingdom of God, while they refer true righteousness to
the special grace of God and spiritual regeneration. The author of the work,
&#8220;De Vocatione Gentium,&#8221; (On the Calling of the
Gentiles),<sup><font size="2">15</font><a name="fnB14" href="#fn14">[6]</a></sup>
wishing to show this, describes the will as threefold&#8212;viz. sensitive,
animal, and spiritual. The two former, he says, are free to man, but the last is
the work of the Holy Spirit. What truth there is in this will be considered in
its own place. Our intention at present is only to mention the opinions of
others, not to refute them. When writers treat of free will, their inquiry is
chiefly directed not to what its power is in relation to civil or external
actions, but to the obedience required by the divine law. The latter I admit to
be the great question, but I cannot think the former should be altogether
neglected; and I hope to be able to give the best reason for so thinking (sec.
12 to 18). The schools, however, have adopted a distinction which enumerates
three kinds of freedom (see Lombard, lib. 2 Dist. 25); the first, a freedom from
necessity; the second, a freedom from sin; and the third, a freedom from misery:
the first naturally so inherent in man, that he cannot possibly be deprived of
it; while through sin the other two have been lost. I willingly admit this
distinction, except in so far as it confounds <i>necessity</i> with
<i>compulsion</i>. How widely the things differ, and how important it is to
attend to the difference, will appear elsewhere.<br><br>6. All this being admitted,
it will be beyond dispute, that free will does not enable any man to perform
good works, unless he is assisted by grace; indeed, the special grace which the
elect alone receive through regeneration. For I stay not to consider the
extravagance of those who say that grace is offered equally and promiscuously to
all (Lomb. lib. 2 Dist. 26). But it has not yet been shown whether man is
entirely deprived of the power of well-doing, or whether he still possesses it
in some, though in a very feeble and limited degree&#8212;a degree so feeble and
limited, that it can do nothing of itself, but when assisted by grace, is able
also to perform its part. The Master of the Sentences (Lombard, ibid). wishing
to explain this, teaches that a twofold grace is necessary to fit for any good
work. The one he calls Operating. To it, it is owing that we effectually will
what is good. The other, which succeeds this good will, and aids it, he calls
Co-operating. My objection to this division (see <i>infra</i>, chap. 3 sec. 10,
and chap. 7 sec. 9) is, that while it attributes the effectual desire of good to
divine grace, it insinuates that man, by his own nature, desires good in some
degree, though ineffectually. Thus Bernard, while maintaining that a good will
is the work of God, concedes this much to man&#8212;viz. that of his own nature
he longs for such a good will. This differs widely from the view of Augustine,
though Lombard pretends to have taken the division from him. Besides, there is
an ambiguity in the second division, which has led to an erroneous
interpretation. For it has been thought that we co-operate with subsequent
grace, inasmuch as it pertains to us either to nullify the first grace, by
rejecting its or to confirm it, by obediently yielding to it. The author of the
work De Vocatione Gentium expresses it thus: It is free to those who enjoy the
faculty of reason to depart from grace, so that the not departing is a reward,
and that which cannot be done without the co-operation of the Spirit is imputed
as merit to those whose will might have made it otherwise (lib. 2 cap. 4). It
seemed proper to make these two observations in passing, that the reader may see
how far I differ from the sounder of the Schoolmen. Still further do I differ
from more modern sophists, who have departed even more widely than the Schoolmen
from the ancient doctrine. The division, however, shows in what respect free
will is attributed to man. For Lombard ultimately declares (lib. 2 Dist. 25),
that our freedom is not to the extent of leaving us equally inclined to good and
evil in act or in thought, but only to the extent of freeing us from compulsion.
This liberty is compatible with our being depraved, the servants of sin, able to
do nothing but sin.<br><br>7. In this way, then, man is said to have free will, not
because he has a free choice of good and evil, but because he acts voluntarily,
and not by compulsion. This is perfectly true: but why should so small a matter
have been dignified with so proud a title? An admirable freedom! that man is not
forced to be the servant of sin, while he is, however, ejthelodou'lo" (a
voluntary slave); his will being bound by the fetters of sin. I abominate mere
verbal disputes, by which the Church is harassed to no purpose; but I think we
ought religiously to eschew terms which imply some absurdity, especially in
subjects where error is of pernicious consequence. How few are there who, when
they hear free will attributed to man, do not immediately imagine that he is the
master of his mind and will in such a sense, that he can of himself incline
himself either to good or evil? It may be said that such dangers are removed by
carefully expounding the meaning to the people. But such is the proneness of the
human mind to go astray, that it will more quickly draw error from one little
word, than truth from a lengthened discourse. Of this, the very term in question
furnishes too strong a proof. For the explanation given by ancient Christian
writers having been lost sight of, almost all who have come after them, by
attending only to the etymology of the term, have been led to indulge a fatal
confidence.<br><br>8. As to the Fathers (if their authority weighs with us), they
have the term constantly in their mouths; but they, at the same time, declare
what extent of meaning they attach to it. In particular, Augustine hesitates not
to call the will <i>a
slave</i>.<sup><font size="2">15</font><a name="fnB15" href="#fn15">[7]</a></sup>
In another passages he is offended with those who deny free will; but his chief
reason for this is explained when he says, &#8220;Only lest any one should
presume so to deny freedom of will, from a desire to excuse sin.&#8221; It is
certain he elsewhere admits, that without the Spirit the will of man is not
free, inasmuch as it is subject to lusts which chain and master it. And again,
that nature began to want liberty the moment the will was vanquished by the
revolt into which it fell. Again, that man, by making a bad use of free will,
lost both himself and his will. Again, that free will having been made a
captive, can do nothing in the way of righteousness. Again, that no will is free
which has not been made so by divine grace. Again, that the righteousness of God
is not fulfilled when the law orders, and man acts, as it were, by his own
strength, but when the Spirit assists, and the will (not the free will of man,
but the will freed by God) obeys. He briefly states the ground of all these
observations, when he says, that man at his creation received a great degree of
free will, but lost it by sinning. In another place, after showing that free
will is established by grace, he strongly inveighs against those who arrogate
any thing to themselves without grace. His words are, &#8220;How much soever
miserable men presume to plume themselves on free will before they are made
free, or on their strength after they are made free, they do not consider that,
in the very expression <i>free will</i>, liberty is implied. &#8216;Where the
Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty,&#8217; (2 Cor. 3:17). If, therefore,
they are the servants of sin, why do they boast of free will? He who has been
vanquished is the servant of him who vanquished him. But if men have been made
free, why do they boast of it as of their own work? Are they so free that they
are unwilling to be the servants of Him who has said, &#8216;Without me ye can
do nothing&#8217;?&#8221; (John 15:5). In another passage he even seems to
ridicule the word, when he
says,<sup><font size="2">15</font><a name="fnB16" href="#fn16">[8]</a></sup>
&#8220;That the will is indeed free, but not freed&#8212;free of righteousness,
but enslaved to sin.&#8221; The same idea he elsewhere repeats and explains,
when he says, &#8220;That man is not free from righteousness save by the choice
of his will, and is not made free from sin save by the grace of the
Saviour.&#8221; Declaring that the freedom of man is nothing else than
emancipation or manumission from righteousness, he seems to jest at the
emptiness of the name. If any one, then, chooses to make use of this terms
without attaching any bad meaning to it, he shall not be troubled by me on that
account; but as it cannot be retained without very great danger, I think the
abolition of it would be of great advantage to the Church. I am unwilling to use
it myself; and others if they will take my advice, will do well to abstain from
it.<br><br>9. It may, perhaps, seem that I have greatly prejudiced my own view by
confessing that all the ecclesiastical writers, with the exception of Augustine,
have spoken so ambiguously or inconsistently on this subject, that no certainty
is attainable from their writings. Some will interpret this to mean, that I wish
to deprive them of their right of suffrage, because they are opposed to me.
Truly, however, I have had no other end in view than to consult, simply and in
good faith, for the advantage of pious minds, which, if they trust to those
writers for their opinion, will always fluctuate in uncertainty. At one time
they teach, that man having been deprived of the power of free Will must flee to
grace alone; at another, they equip or seem to equip him in armour of his own.
It is not difficult, however, to show, that notwithstanding of the ambiguous
manner in which those writers express themselves, they hold human virtue in
little or no account, and ascribe the whole merit of all that is good to the
Holy Spirit. To make this more manifest, I may here quote some passages from
them. What, then, is meant by Cyprian in the passage so often lauded by
Augustine,<sup><font size="2">15</font><a name="fnB17" href="#fn17">[9]</a></sup>
&#8220;Let us glory in nothing, because nothing is ours,&#8221; unless it be,
that man being utterly destitute, considered in himself, should entirely depend
on God? What is meant by Augustine and
Eucherius,<sup><font size="2">16</font><a name="fnB18" href="#fn18">[0]</a></sup>
when they expound that Christ is the tree of life, and that whose puts forth his
hand to it shall live; that the choice of the will is the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, and that he who, forsaking the grace of God, tastes of it
shall die? What is meant by Chrysostom, When he says, &#8220;That every man is
not only naturally a sinner, but is wholly sin?&#8221; If there is nothing good
in us; if man, from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot, is wholly
sin; if it is not even lawful to try how far the power of the will
extends,&#8212;how can it be lawful to share the merit of a good work between
God and man? I might quote many passages to the same effect from other writers;
but lest any caviller should say, that I select those only which serve my
purpose, and cunningly pass by those which are against me, I desist. This much,
however, I dare affirm, that though they sometimes go too far in extolling free
will, the main object which they had in view was to teach man entirely to
renounce all self-confidence, and place his strength in God alone. I now proceed
to a simple exposition of the truth in regard to the nature of man.<br><br>10. Here
however, I must again repeat what I premised at the outset of this
chapter,<sup><font size="2">16</font><a name="fnB19" href="#fn19">[1]</a></sup>
that he who is most deeply abased and alarmed, by the consciousness of his
disgrace, nakedness, want, and misery, has made the greatest progress in the
knowledge of himself. Man is in no danger of taking too much from himself,
provided he learns that whatever he wants is to be recovered in God. But he
cannot arrogate to himself one particle beyond his due, without losing himself
in vain confidence, and, by transferring divine honour to himself, becoming
guilty of the greatest impiety. And, assuredly, whenever our minds are seized
with a longing to possess a somewhat of our own, which may reside in us rather
than in God, we may rest assured that the thought is suggested by no other
counsellor than he who enticed our first parents to aspire to be like gods,
knowing good and
evil.<sup><font size="2">16</font><a name="fnB20" href="#fn20">[2]</a></sup> It
is sweet, indeed, to have so much virtue of our own as to be able to rest in
ourselves; but let the many solemn passages by which our pride is sternly
humbled, deter us from indulging this vain confidence: &#8220;Cursed be the man
that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm.&#8221; (Jer. 17:5). &#8220;He
delighteth not in the strength of the horse; he taketh not pleasure in the legs
of a man. The Lord taketh pleasure in those that fear him, in those that hope in
his mercy,&#8221; (Ps. 147:10, 11). &#8220;He giveth power to the faint; and to
them that have no might he increaseth strength. Even the youths shall faint and
be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: But they that wait upon the Lord
shall renew their strength,&#8221; (Is. 40:29&#8211;31). The scope of all these
passages is that we must not entertain any opinion whatever of our own strength,
if we would enjoy the favour of God, who &#8220;resisteth the proud, but giveth
grace unto the humble,&#8221; (James 4:6). Then let us call to mind such
promises as these, &#8220;I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods
upon the dry ground,&#8221; (Is. 44:3); &#8220;Ho, every one that thirsteth,
come ye to the waters,&#8221; (Is. 55:1). These passages declare, that none are
admitted to enjoy the blessings of God save those who are pining under a sense
of their own poverty. Nor ought such passages as the following to be omitted:
&#8220;The sun shall no more be thy light by day; neither for brightness shall
the moon give light unto thee: but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting
light, and thy God thy glory,&#8221; (Is. 60:19). The Lord certainly does not
deprive his servants of the light of the sun or moon, but as he would alone
appear glorious in them, he dissuades them from confidence even in those objects
which they deem most excellent.<br><br>11. I have always been exceedingly delighted
with the words of Chrysostom, &#8220;The foundation of our philosophy is
humility;&#8221;<sup><font size="2">16</font><a name="fnB21" href="#fn21">[3]</a></sup>
and still more with those of Augustine, &#8220;As the
orator,<sup><font size="2">16</font><a name="fnB22" href="#fn22">[4]</a></sup>
when asked, What is the first precept in eloquence? answered, Delivery: What is
the second? Delivery: What the third? Delivery: so, if you ask me in regard to
the precepts of the Christian Religion, I will answer, first, second, and third,
Humility.&#8221; By humility he means not when a man, with a consciousness of
some virtue, refrains from pride, but when he truly feels that he has no refuge
but in humility. This is clear from another
passage,<sup><font size="2">16</font><a name="fnB23" href="#fn23">[5]</a></sup>
&#8220;Let no man,&#8221; says he, &#8220;flatter himself: of himself he is a
devil: his happiness he owes entirely to God. What have you of your own but sin?
Take your sin which is your own; for righteousness is of God.&#8221; Again,
&#8220;Why presume so much on the capability of nature? It is wounded, maimed,
vexed, lost. The thing wanted is genuine confession, not false defence.&#8221;
&#8220;When any one knows that he is nothing in himself, and has no help from
himself, the weapons within himself are broken, and the war is ended.&#8221; All
the weapons of impiety must be bruised, and broken, and burnt in the fire; you
must remain unarmed, having no help in yourself. The more infirm you are, the
more the Lord will sustain you. So, in expounding the seventieth Psalm, he
forbids us to remember our own righteousness, in order that we may recognise the
righteousness of God, and shows that God bestows his grace upon us, that we may
know that we are nothing; that we stand only by the mercy of God, seeing that in
ourselves eve are altogether wicked. Let us not contend with God for our right,
as if anything attributed to him were lost to our salvation. As our
insignificance is his exaltation, so the confession of our insignificance has
its remedy provided in his mercy. I do not ask, however, that man should
voluntarily yield without being convinced, or that, if he has any powers, he
should shut his eyes to them, that he may thus be subdued to true humility; but
that getting quit of the disease of self-love and ambition, filautiva kai;
filoneikiva, under the blinding of which he thinks of himself more highly than
he ought to think, he may see himself as he really is, by looking into the
faithful mirror of Scripture.<br><br>12. I feel pleased with the well-known saying
which has been borrowed from the writings of Augustine, that man&#8217;s natural
gifts were corrupted by sin, and his supernatural gifts withdrawn; meaning by
supernatural gifts the light of faith and righteousness, which would have been
sufficient for the attainment of heavenly life and everlasting felicity. Man,
when he withdrew his allegiance to God, was deprived of the spiritual gifts by
which he had been raised to the hope of eternal salvation. Hence it follows,
that he is now an exile from the kingdom of God, so that all things which
pertain to the blessed life of the soul are extinguished in him until he recover
them by the grace of regeneration. Among these are faith, love to God, charity
towards our neighbour, the study of righteousness and holiness. All these, when
restored to us by Christ, are to be regarded as adventitious and above nature.
If so, we infer that they were previously abolished. On the other hand,
soundness of mind and integrity of heart were, at the same time, withdrawn, and
it is this which constitutes the corruption of natural gifts. For although there
is still some residue of intelligence and judgment as well as will, we cannot
call a mind sound and entire which is both weak and immersed in darkness. As to
the will, its depravity is but too well known. Therefore, since reason, by which
man discerns between good and evil, and by which he understands and judges, is a
natural gift, it could not be entirely destroyed; but being partly weakened and
partly corrupted, a shapeless ruin is all that remains. In this sense it is said
(John 1:5), that &#8220;the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness
comprehended it not;&#8221; these words clearly expressing both
points&#8212;viz. that in the perverted and degenerate nature of man there are
still some sparks which show that he is a rational animal, and differs from the
brutes, inasmuch as he is endued with intelligence, and yet, that this light is
so smothered by clouds of darkness that it cannot shine forth to any good
effect. In like manner, the will, because inseparable from the nature of man,
did not perish, but was so enslaved by depraved lusts as to be incapable of one
righteous desire. The definition now given is complete, but there are several
points which require to be explained. Therefore, proceeding agreeably to that
primary distinction (Book 1 c. 15 sec. 7 and 8), by which we divided the soul
into intellect and will, we will now inquire into the power of the
intellect.<br><br>To charge the intellect with perpetual blindness, so as to leave
it no intelligence of any description whatever, is repugnant not only to the
Word of God, but to common experience. We see that there has been implanted in
the human mind a certain desire of investigating truth, to which it never would
aspire unless some relish for truth antecedently existed. There is, therefore,
now, in the human mind, discernment to this extent, that it is naturally
influenced by the love of truth, the neglect of which in the lower animals is a
proof of their gross and irrational nature. Still it is true that this love of
truth fails before it reaches the goal, forthwith falling away into vanity. As
the human mind is unable, from dullness, to pursue the right path of
investigation, and, after various wanderings, stumbling every now and then like
one groping in darkness, at length gets completely bewildered, so its whole
procedure proves how unfit it is to search the truth and find it. Then it
labours under another grievous defect, in that it frequently fails to discern
what the knowledge is which it should study to acquire. Hence, under the
influence of a vain curiosity, it torments itself with superfluous and useless
discussions, either not adverting at all to the things necessary to be known, or
casting only a cursory and contemptuous glance at them. At all events, it
scarcely ever studies them in sober earnest. Profane writers are constantly
complaining of this perverse procedure, and yet almost all of them are found
pursuing it. Hence Solomon, throughout the Book of Ecclesiastes, after
enumerating all the studies in which men think they attain the highest wisdom,
pronounces them vain and frivolous.<br><br>13. Still, however, man&#8217;s efforts
are not always so utterly fruitless as not to lead to some result, especially
when his attention is directed to inferior objects. Nay, even with regard to
superior objects, though he is more careless in investigating them, he makes
some little progress. Here, however, his ability is more limited, and he is
never made more sensible of his weakness than when he attempts to soar above the
sphere of the present life. It may therefore be proper, in order to make it more
manifest how far our ability extends in regard to these two classes of objects,
to draw a distinction between them. The distinction is, that we have one kind of
intelligence of earthly things, and another of heavenly things. By earthly
things, I mean those which relate not to God and his kingdom, to true
righteousness and future blessedness, but have some connection with the present
life, and are in a manner confined within its boundaries. By heavenly things, I
mean the pure knowledge of God, the method of true righteousness, and the
mysteries of the heavenly kingdom. To the former belong matters of policy and
economy, all mechanical arts and liberal studies. To the latter (as to which,
see the eighteenth and following sections) belong the knowledge of God and of
his will, and the means of framing the life in accordance with them. As to the
former, the view to be taken is this: Since man is by nature a social animal, he
is disposed, from natural instinct, to cherish and preserve society; and
accordingly we see that the minds of all men have impressions of civil order and
honesty. Hence it is that every individual understands how human societies must
he regulated by laws, and also is able to comprehend the principles of those
laws. Hence the universal agreement in regard to such subjects, both among
nations and individuals, the seeds of them being implanted in the breasts of all
without a teacher or lawgiver. The truth of this fact is not affected by the
wars and dissensions which immediately arise, while some, such as thieves and
robbers, would invert the rules of justice, loosen the bonds of law, and give
free scope to their lust; and while others (a vice of most frequent occurrence)
deem that to be unjust which is elsewhere regarded as just, and, on the
contrary, hold that to be praiseworthy which is elsewhere forbidden. For such
persons do not hate the laws from not knowing that they are good and sacred,
but, inflamed with headlong passion, quarrel with what is clearly reasonable,
and licentiously hate what their mind and understanding approve. Quarrels of
this latter kind do not destroy the primary idea of justice. For while men
dispute with each other as to particular enactments, their ideas of equity agree
in substance. This, no doubt, proves the weakness of the human mind, which, even
when it seems on the right path, halts and hesitates. Still, however, it is
true, that some principle of civil order is impressed on all. And this is ample
proof, that, in regard to the constitution of the present life, no man is devoid
of the light of reason.<br><br>14. Next come manual and liberal arts, in learning
which, as all have some degree of aptitude, the full force of human acuteness is
displayed. But though all are not equally able to learn all the arts, we have
sufficient evidence of a common capacity in the fact, that there is scarcely an
individual who does not display intelligence in some particular art. And this
capacity extends not merely to the learning of the art, but to the devising of
something new, or the improving of what had been previously learned. This led
Plato to adopt the erroneous idea, that such knowledge was nothing but
recollection.<sup><font size="2">16</font><a name="fnB24" href="#fn24">[6]</a></sup>
So cogently does it oblige us to acknowledge that its principle is naturally
implanted in the human mind. But while these proofs openly attest the fact of a
universal reason and intelligence naturally implanted, this universality is of a
kind which should lead every individual for himself to recognise it as a special
gift of God. To this gratitude we have a sufficient call from the Creator
himself, when, in the case of idiots, he shows what the endowments of the soul
would be were it not pervaded with his light. Though natural to all, it is so in
such a sense that it ought to be regarded as a gratuitous gift of his
beneficence to each. Moreover, the invention, the methodical arrangement, and
the more thorough and superior knowledge of the arts, being confined to a few
individuals cannot be regarded as a solid proof of common shrewdness. Still,
however, as they are bestowed indiscriminately on the good and the bad, they are
justly classed among natural endowments.<br><br>15. Therefore, in reading profane
authors, the admirable light of truth displayed in them should remind us, that
the human mind, however much fallen and perverted from its original integrity,
is still adorned and invested with admirable gifts from its Creator. If we
reflect that the Spirit of God is the only fountain of truth, we will be
careful, as we would avoid offering insult to him, not to reject or condemn
truth wherever it appears. In despising the gifts, we insult the Giver. How,
then, can we deny that truth must have beamed on those ancient lawgivers who
arranged civil order and discipline with so much equity? Shall we say that the
philosophers, in their exquisite researches and skilful description of nature,
were blind? Shall we deny the possession of intellect to those who drew up rules
for discourse, and taught us to speak in accordance with reason? Shall we say
that those who, by the cultivation of the medical art, expended their industry
in our behalf were only raving? What shall we say of the mathematical sciences?
Shall we deem them to be the dreams of madmen? Nay, we cannot read the writings
of the ancients on these subjects without the highest admiration; an admiration
which their excellence will not allow us to withhold. But shall we deem anything
to be noble and praiseworthy, without tracing it to the hand of God? Far from us
be such ingratitude; an ingratitude not chargeable even on heathen poets, who
acknowledged that philosophy and laws, and all useful arts were the inventions
of the gods. Therefore, since it is manifest that men whom the Scriptures term
carnal, are so acute and clear-sighted in the investigation of inferior things,
their example should teach us how many gifts the Lord has left in possession of
human nature, notwithstanding of its having been despoiled of the true
good.<br><br>16. Moreover, let us not forget that there are most excellent blessings
which the Divine Spirit dispenses to whom he will for the common benefit of
mankind. For if the skill and knowledge required for the construction of the
Tabernacle behaved to be imparted to Bezaleel and Aholiab, by the Spirit of God
(Exod. 31:2; 35:30), it is not strange that the knowledge of those things which
are of the highest excellence in human life is said to be communicated to us by
the Spirit. Nor is there any ground for asking what concourse the Spirit can
have with the ungodly, who are altogether alienated from God? For what is said
as to the Spirit dwelling in believers only, is to be understood of the Spirit
of holiness by which we are consecrated to God as temples. Notwithstanding of
this, He fills, moves, and invigorates all things by the virtue of the Spirit,
and that according to the peculiar nature which each class of beings has
received by the Law of Creation. But if the Lord has been pleased to assist us
by the work and ministry of the ungodly in physics, dialectics, mathematics, and
other similar sciences, let us avail ourselves of it, lest, by neglecting the
gifts of God spontaneously offered to us, we be justly punished for our sloth.
Lest any one, however, should imagine a man to be very happy merely because,
with reference to the elements of this world, he has been endued with great
talents for the investigation of truth, we ought to add, that the whole power of
intellect thus bestowed is, in the sight of God, fleeting and vain whenever it
is not based on a solid foundation of truth. Augustine (<i>supra</i>, sec. 4 and
12), to whom, as we have observed, the Master of Sentences (lib. 2 Dist. 25),
and the Schoolmen, are forced to subscribe, says most correctly that as the
gratuitous gifts bestowed on man were withdrawn, so the natural gifts which
remained were corrupted after the fall. Not that they can be polluted in
themselves in so far as they proceed from God, but that they have ceased to be
pure to polluted man, lest he should by their means obtain any praise.<br><br>17.
The sum of the whole is this: From a general survey of the human race, it
appears that one of the essential properties of our nature is reason, which
distinguishes us from the lower animals, just as these by means of sense are
distinguished from inanimate objects. For although some individuals are born
without reason, that defect does not impair the general kindness of God, but
rather serves to remind us, that whatever we retain ought justly to be ascribed
to the Divine indulgence. Had God not so spared us, our revolt would have
carried along with it the entire destruction of nature. In that some excel in
acuteness, and some in judgment, while others have greater readiness in learning
some peculiar art, God, by this variety commends his favour toward us, lest any
one should presume to arrogate to himself that which flows from His mere
liberality. For whence is it that one is more excellent than another, but that
in a common nature the grace of God is specially displayed in passing by many
and thus proclaiming that it is under obligation to none. We may add, that each
individual is brought under particular influences according to his calling. Many
examples of this occur in the Book of Judges, in which the Spirit of the Lord is
said to have come upon those whom he called to govern his people (Judges 6:34).
In short, in every distinguished act there is a special inspiration. Thus it is
said of Saul, that &#8220;there went with him a band of men whose hearts the
Lord had touched,&#8221; (1 Sam. 10:26). And when his inauguration to the
kingdom is foretold, Samuel thus addresses him, &#8220;The Spirit of the Lord
will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into
another man,&#8221; (1 Sam. 10:6). This extends to the whole course of
government, as it is afterwards said of David, &#8220;The Spirit of the Lord
came upon David from that day forward,&#8221; (1 Sam. 16:13). The same thing is
elsewhere said with reference to particular movements. Nay, even in Homer, men
are said to excel in genius, not only according as Jupiter has distributed to
each, but according as he leads them day by day, oJion ejp e\ma" a[geisi. And
certainly experience shows when those who were most skilful and ingenious stand
stupefied, that the minds of men are entirely under the control of God, who
rules them every moment. Hence it is said, that &#8220;He poureth contempt upon
princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness where there is no
way,&#8221; (Ps. 107:40). Still, in this diversity we can trace some remains of
the divine image distinguishing the whole human race from other
creatures.<br><br>18. We must now explain what the power of human reason is, in
regard to the kingdom of God, and spiritual discernments which consists chiefly
of three things&#8212;the knowledge of God, the knowledge of his paternal favour
towards us, which constitutes our salvation, and the method of regulating of our
conduct in accordance with the Divine Law. With regard to the former two, but
more properly the second, men otherwise the most ingenious are blinder than
moles. I deny not, indeed, that in the writings of philosophers we meet
occasionally with shrewd and apposite remarks on the nature of God, though they
invariably savour somewhat of giddy imagination. As observed above, the Lord has
bestowed on them some slight perception of his Godhead that they might not plead
ignorance as an excuse for their impiety, and has, at times, instigated them to
deliver some truths, the confession of which should be their own condemnation.
Still, though seeing, they saw not. Their discernment was not such as to direct
them to the truth, far less to enable them to attain it, but resembled that of
the bewildered traveller, who sees the flash of lightning glance far and wide
for a moment, and then vanish into the darkness of the night, before he can
advance a single step. So far is such assistance from enabling him to find the
right path. Besides, how many monstrous falsehoods intermingle with those minute
particles of truth scattered up and down in their writings as if by chance. In
short, not one of them even made the least approach to that assurance of the
divine favour, without which the mind of man must ever remain a mere chaos of
confusion. To the great truths, What God is in himself, and what he is in
relation to us, human reason makes not the least approach. (See Book 3 c. 2 sec.
14, 15, 16).<br><br>19. But since we are intoxicated with a false opinion of our own
discernment, and can scarcely be persuaded that in divine things it is
altogether stupid and blind, I believe the best course will be to establish the
fact, not by argument, but by Scripture. Most admirable to this effect is the
passage which I lately quoted from John, when he says, &#8220;In him was life;
and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the
darkness comprehended it not,&#8221; (John 1:4, 5). He intimates that the human
soul is indeed irradiated with a beam of divine light, so that it is never left
utterly devoid of some small flame, or rather spark, though not such as to
enable it to comprehend God. And why so? Because its acuteness is, in reference
to the knowledge of God, mere blindness. When the Spirit describes men under the
term <i>darkness</i>, he declares them void of all power of spiritual
intelligence. For this reason, it is said that believers, in embracing Christ,
are &#8220;born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of
man, but of God,&#8221; (John 1:13); in other words, that the flesh has no
capacity for such sublime wisdom as to apprehend God, and the things of God,
unless illumined by His Spirit. In like manner our Saviour, when he was
acknowledged by Peter, declared that it was by special revelation from the
Father (Mt. 16:17).<br><br>20. If we were persuaded of a truth which ought to be
beyond dispute&#8212;viz. that human nature possesses none of the gifts which
the elect receive from their heavenly Father through the Spirit of regeneration,
there would be no room here for hesitation. For thus speaks the congregation of
the faithful, by the mouth of the prophet: &#8220;With thee is the fountain of
life: in thy light shall we see light,&#8221; (Ps. 36:9). To the same effect is
the testimony of the Apostle Paul, when he declares, that &#8220;no man can say
that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost,&#8221; (1 Cor. 12:3). And John
Baptist, on seeing the dullness of his disciples, exclaims, &#8220;A man can
receive nothing, unless it be given him from heaven,&#8221; (John 3:27). That
the gift to which he here refers must be understood not of ordinary natural
gifts, but of special illumination, appears from this&#8212;that he was
complaining how little his disciples had profited by all that he had said to
them in commendation of Christ. &#8220;I see,&#8221; says he, &#8220;that my
words are of no effect in imbuing the minds of men with divine things, unless
the Lord enlighten their understandings by His Spirit.&#8221; Nay, Moses also,
while upbraiding the people for their forgetfulness, at the same time observes,
that they could not become wise in the mysteries of God without his assistance.
&#8220;Ye have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt,
unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land; the great
temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and these great miracles: yet
the Lord has not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to
hear, unto this, day,&#8221; (Deut. 29:2, 3, 4). Would the expression have been
stronger had he called us mere blocks in regard to the contemplation of divine
things? Hence the Lord, by the mouth of the Prophet, promises to the Israelites
as a singular favour, &#8220;I will give them an heart to know me,&#8221; (Jer.
24:7); intimating, that in spiritual things the human mind is wise only in so
far as he enlightens it. This was also clearly confirmed by our Saviour when he
said, &#8220;No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw
him,&#8221; (John 6:44). Nay, is not he himself the living image of his Father,
in which the full brightness of his glory is manifested to us? Therefore, how
far our faculty of knowing God extends could not be better shown than when it is
declared, that though his image is so plainly exhibited, we have not eyes to
perceive it. What? Did not Christ descend into the world that he might make the
will of his Father manifest to men, and did he not faithfully perform the
office? True! He did; but nothing is accomplished by his preaching unless the
inner teacher, the Spirit, open the way into our minds. Only those, therefore,
come to him who have heard and learned of the Father. And in what is the method
of this hearing and learning? It is when the Spirit, with a wondrous and special
energy, forms the ear to hear and the mind to understand. Lest this should seem
new, our Saviour refers to the prophecy of Isaiah, which contains a promise of
the renovation of the Church. &#8220;For a small moment have I forsaken thee;
but with great mercies will I gather thee,&#8221; (Is. 54:7). If the Lord here
predicts some special blessing to his elect, it is plain that the teaching to
which he refers is not that which is common to them with the ungodly and
profane.<br><br>It thus appears that none can enter the kingdom of God save those
whose minds have been renewed by the enlightening of the Holy Spirit. On this
subject the clearest exposition is given by Paul, who, when expressly handling
it, after condemning the whole wisdom of the world as foolishness and vanity,
and thereby declaring man&#8217;s utter destitution, thus concludes, &#8220;The
natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are
foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, for they are spiritually
discerned,&#8221; (1 Cor. 2:14). Whom does he mean by the &#8220;natural
man&#8221;? The man who trusts to the light of nature. Such a man has no
understanding in the spiritual mysteries of God. Why so? Is it because through
sloth he neglects them? Nay, though he exert himself, it is of no avail; they
are &#8220;spiritually discerned.&#8221; And what does this mean? That
altogether hidden from human discernment, they are made known only by the
revelation of the Spirit; so that they are accounted foolishness wherever the
Spirit does not give light. The Apostle had previously declared, that &#8220;Eye
has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the
things which God has prepared for them that love him;&#8221; nay, that the
wisdom of the world is a kind of veil by which the mind is prevented from
beholding God (1 Cor. 2:9). What would we more? The Apostle declares that God
has &#8220;made foolish the wisdom of this world,&#8221; (1 Cor. 1:20); and
shall we attribute to it an acuteness capable of penetrating to God, and the
hidden mysteries of his kingdom? Far from us be such presumption!<br><br>21. What
the Apostle here denies to man, he, in another place, ascribes to God alone,
when he prays, &#8220;that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation,&#8221; (Eph.
1:17). You now hear that all wisdom and revelation is the gift of God. What
follows? &#8220;The eyes of your understanding being enlightened.&#8221; Surely,
if they require a new enlightening, they must in themselves be blind. The next
words are, &#8220;that ye may know what is the hope of his calling,&#8221; (Eph.
1:18). In other words, the minds of men have not capacity enough to know their
calling. Let no prating Pelagian here allege that God obviates this rudeness or
stupidity, when, by the doctrine of his word, he directs us to a path which we
could not have found without a guide. David had the law, comprehending in it all
the wisdom that could be desired, and yet not contented with this, he prays,
&#8220;Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy
law,&#8221; (Ps. 119:18). By this expression, he certainly intimates, that it is
like sunrise to the earth when the word of God shines forth; but that men do not
derive much benefit from it until he himself, who is for this reason called the
Father of lights (James 1:17), either gives eyes or opens them; because,
whatever is not illuminated by his Spirit is wholly darkness. The Apostles had
been duly and amply instructed by the best of teachers. Still, as they wanted
the Spirit of truth to complete their education in the very doctrine which they
had previously heard, they were ordered to wait for him (John 14:26). If we
confess that what we ask of God is lacking to us, and He by the very thing
promised intimates our want, no man can hesitate to acknowledge that he is able
to understand the mysteries of God, only in so far as illuminated by his grace.
He who ascribes to himself more understanding than this, is the blinder for not
acknowledging his blindness.<br><br>22. It remains to consider the third branch of
the knowledge of spiritual things&#8212;viz. the method of properly regulating
the conduct. This is correctly termed the knowledge of the works of
righteousness, a branch in which the human mind seems to have somewhat more
discernment than in the former two, since an Apostle declares, &#8220;When the
Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law,
these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: which show the work of the
law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their
thoughts the meantime accusing or else excusing one another&#8221; (Rom. 2:14,
15). If the Gentiles have the righteousness of the law naturally engraven on
their minds, we certainly cannot say that they are altogether blind as to the
rule of life. Nothing, indeed is more common, than for man to be sufficiently
instructed in a right course of conduct by natural law, of which the Apostle
here speaks. Let us consider, however for what end this knowledge of the law was
given to men. For from this it will forthwith appear how far it can conduct them
in the way of reason and truth. This is even plain from the words of Paul, if we
attend to their arrangement. He had said a little before, that those who had
sinned in the law will be judged by the law; and those who have sinned without
the law will perish without the law. As it might seem unaccountable that the
Gentiles should perish without any previous judgment, he immediately subjoins,
that conscience served them instead of the law, and was therefore sufficient for
their righteous condemnation. The end of the natural law, therefore, is to
render man inexcusable, and may be not improperly defined&#8212;the judgment of
conscience distinguishing sufficiently between just and unjust, and by
convicting men on their own testimony depriving them of all pretext for
ignorance. So indulgent is man towards himself, that, while doing evil, he
always endeavours as much as he can to suppress the idea of sin. It was this,
apparently, which induced Plato (in his Protagoras) to suppose that sins were
committed only through ignorance. There might be some ground for this, if
hypocrisy were so successful in hiding vice as to keep the conscience clear in
the sight of God. But since the sinner, when trying to evade the judgment of
good and evil implanted in him, is ever and anon dragged forward, and not
permitted to wink so effectually as not to be compelled at times, whether he
will or not, to open his eyes, it is false to say that he sins only through
ignorance.<br><br>23. Themistius is more accurate in teaching (Paraphr. in Lib. 3 de
Anima, cap. 46), that the intellect is very seldom mistaken in the general
definition or essence of the matter; but that deception begins as it advances
farther, namely, when it descends to particulars. That homicide, putting the
case in the abstract, is an evil, no man will deny; and yet one who is
conspiring the death of his enemy deliberates on it as if the thing was good.
The adulterer will condemn adultery in the abstract, and yet flatter himself
while privately committing it. The ignorance lies here: that man, when he comes
to the particular, forgets the rule which he had laid down in the general case.
Augustine treats most admirably on this subject in his exposition of the first
verse of the fifty-seventh Psalm. The doctrine of Themistius, however, does not
always hold true: for the turpitude of the crime sometimes presses so on the
conscience, that the sinner does not impose upon himself by a false semblance of
good, but rushes into sin knowingly and willingly. Hence the expression,&#8212;I
see the better course, and approve it: I follow the worse (Medea of Ovid). For
this reason, Aristotle seems to me to have made a very shrewd distinction
between incontinence and intemperance (Ethic. lib. 7 cap. 3) Where incontinence
(ajkrasiva) reigns, he says, that through the passion (pavtho") particular
knowledge is suppressed: so that the individual sees not in his own misdeed the
evil which he sees generally in similar cases; but when the passion is over,
repentance immediately succeeds. Intemperance (ajkolasiva), again, is not
extinguished or diminished by a sense of sin, but, on the contrary, persists in
the evil choice which it has once made.<br><br>24. Moreover, when you hear of a
universal judgment in man distinguishing between good and evil, you must not
suppose that this judgment is, in every respect, sound and entire. For if the
hearts of men are imbued with a sense of justice and injustice, in order that
they may have no pretext to allege ignorance, it is by no means necessary for
this purpose that they should discern the truth in particular cases. It is even
more than sufficient if they understand so far as to be unable to practice
evasion without being convicted by their own conscience, and beginning even now
to tremble at the judgment-seat of God. Indeed, if we would test our reason by
the Divine Law, which is a perfect standard of righteousness, we should find how
blind it is in many respects. It certainly attains not to the principal heads in
the First Table, such as, trust in God, the ascription to him of all praise in
virtue and righteousness, the invocation of his name, and the true observance of
his day of rest. Did ever any soul, under the guidance of natural sense, imagine
that these and the like constitute the legitimate worship of God? When profane
men would worship God, how often soever they may be drawn off from their vain
trifling, they constantly relapse into it. They admit, indeed, that sacrifices
are not pleasing, to God, unless accompanied with sincerity of mind; and by this
they testify that they have some conception of spiritual worship, though they
immediately pervert it by false devices: for it is impossible to persuade them
that every thing which the law enjoins on the subject is true. Shall I then
extol the discernment of a mind which can neither acquire wisdom by itself, nor
listen to
advice?<sup><font size="2">16</font><a name="fnB25" href="#fn25">[7]</a></sup>
As to the precepts of the Second Table, there is considerably more knowledge of
them, inasmuch as they are more closely connected with the preservation of civil
society. Even here, however, there is something defective. Every man of
understanding deems it most absurd to submit to unjust and tyrannical
domination, provided it can by any means be thrown off, and there is but one
opinion among men, that it is the part of an abject and servile mind to bear it
patiently, the part of an honourable and high-spirited mind to rise up against
it. Indeed, the revenge of injuries is not regarded by philosophers as a vice.
But the Lord condemning this too lofty spirit, prescribes to his people that
patience which mankind deem infamous. In regard to the general observance of the
law, concupiscence altogether escapes our animadversion. For the natural man
cannot bear to recognise diseases in his lusts. The light of nature is stifled
sooner than take the first step into this profound abyss. For, when philosophers
class immoderate movements of the mind among vices, they mean those which break
forth and manifest themselves in grosser forms. Depraved desires, in which the
mind can quietly indulge, they regard as nothing (see <i>infra</i>, chap. 8
sect. 49).<br><br>25. As we have above animadverted on Plato&#8217;s error, in
ascribing all sins to ignorance, so we must repudiate the opinion of those who
hold that all sins proceed from preconceived gravity and malice. We know too
well from experience how often we fall, even when our intention is good. Our
reason is exposed to so many forms of delusion, is liable to so many errors,
stumbles on so many obstacles, is entangled by so many snares, that it is ever
wandering from the right direction. Of how little value it is in the sight of
God, in regard to all the parts of life, Paul shows, when he says, that we are
not &#8220;sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves,&#8221; (2
Cor. 3:5). He is not speaking of the will or affection; he denies us the power
of thinking aright how any thing cam be duly performed. Is it, indeed, true,
that all thought, intelligence, discernment, and industry, are so defective,
that, in the sight of the Lord, we cannot think or aim at any thing that is
right? To us, who can scarcely bear to part with acuteness of intellect (in our
estimation a most precious endowment), it seems hard to admit this, whereas it
is regarded as most just by the Holy Spirit, who &#8220;knoweth the thoughts of
man, that they are vanity,&#8221; (Ps. 94:11), and distinctly declares, that
&#8220;every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
continually,&#8221; (Gen. 6:5; 8:21). If every thing which our mind conceives,
meditates plans, and resolves, is always evil, how can it ever think of doing
what is pleasing to God, to whom righteousness and holiness alone are
acceptable? It is thus plain, that our mind, in what direction soever it turns,
is miserably exposed to vanity. David was conscious of its weakness when he
prayed, &#8220;Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law,&#8221; (Ps.
119:34). By desiring to obtain a new understanding, he intimates that his own
was by no means sufficient. This he does not once only, but in one psalm repeats
the same prayer almost ten times, the repetition intimating how strong the
necessity which urged him to pray. What he thus asked for himself alone, Paul
prays for the churches in general. &#8220;For this cause,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to
desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and
spiritual understanding; that you might walk worthy of the Lord,&#8221; &amp;c.
(Col. 1:9, 10). Whenever he represents this as a blessing from God, we should
remember that he at the same time testifies that it is not in the power of man.
Accordingly, Augustine, in speaking of this inability of human reason to
understand the things of God, says, that he deems the grace of illumination not
less necessary to the mind than the light of the sun to the eye (<i>August. de
Peccat. Merit. et Remiss</i>. lib. 2 cap. 5). And, not content with this, he
modifies his expression, adding, that we open our eyes to behold the light,
whereas the mental eye remains shut, until it is opened by the Lord. Nor does
Scripture say that our minds are illuminated in a single day, so as afterwards
to see of themselves. The passage, which I lately quoted from the Apostle Paul,
refers to continual progress and increase. David, too, expresses this distinctly
in these words: &#8220;With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not
wander from thy commandments,&#8221; (Ps. 119:10). Though he had been
regenerated, and so had made no ordinary progress in true piety, he confesses
that he stood in need of direction every moment, in order that he might not
decline from the knowledge with which he had been endued. Hence, he elsewhere
prays for a renewal of a right spirit, which he had lost by his
sin,<sup><font size="2">16</font><a name="fnB26" href="#fn26">[8]</a></sup> (Ps.
51:12). For that which God gave at first, while temporarily withdrawn, it is
equally his province to restore.<br><br>26. We must now examine the will, on which
the question of freedom principally turns, the power of choice belonging to it
rather than the intellect, as we have already seen (<i>supra</i>, sect. 4). And
at the outset, to guard against its being thought that the doctrine taught by
philosophers, and generally received&#8212;viz. that all things by natural
instinct have a desire of good, is any proof of the rectitude of the human
will,&#8212;let us observe, that the power of free will is not to be considered
in any of those desires which proceed more from instinct than mental
deliberation. Even the schoolmen admit (<i>Thomas</i>, Part 1,
<i>Qu&#190;st</i>. 83, art. 3), that there is no act of free will, unless when
reason looks at opposites. By this they mean, that the things desired must be
such as may be made the object of choice, and that to pave the way for choice,
deliberation must precede. And, undoubtedly, if you attend to what this natural
desire of good in man is, you will find that it is common to him with the
brutes. They, too, desire what is good; and when any semblance of good capable
of moving the sense appears, they follow after it. Here, however, man does not,
in accordance with the excellence of his immortal nature, rationally choose, and
studiously pursue, what is truly for his good. He does not admit reason to his
counsel, nor exert his intellect; but without reason, without counsel, follows
the bent of his nature like the lower animals. The question of freedom,
therefore, has nothing to do with the fact of man&#8217;s being led by natural
instinct to desire good. The question is, Does man, after determining by right
reason what is good, choose what he thus knows, and pursue what he thus chooses?
Lest any doubt should be entertained as to this, we must attend to the double
misnomer. For this <i>appetite</i> is not properly a movement of the will, but
natural inclination; and this <i>good</i> is not one of virtue or righteousness,
but of condition&#8212;viz. that the individual may feel comfortable. In fine,
how much soever man may desire to obtain what is good, he does not follow it.
There is no man who would not be pleased with eternal blessedness; and yet,
without the impulse of the Spirit, no man aspires to it. Since, then, the
natural desire of happiness in man no more proves the freedom of the will, than
the tendency in metals and stones to attain the perfection of their nature, let
us consider, in other respects, whether the will is so utterly vitiated and
corrupted in every part as to produce nothing but evil, or whether it retains
some portion uninjured, and productive of good desires.<br><br> 27. Those who
ascribe our willing effectually, to the primary grace of Gods (<i>supra</i>,
sect. 6), seem conversely to insinuate that the soul has in itself a power of
aspiring to good, though a power too feeble to rise to solid affection or active
endeavour. There is no doubt that this opinion, adopted from Origin and certain
of the ancient Fathers, has been generally embraced by the schoolmen, who are
wont to apply to man in his natural state (<i>in puris naturalibus</i>, as they
express it) the following description of the apostle:&#8212;&#8220;For that
which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that
do I.&#8221; &#8220;To will is present with me; but how to perform that which is
good I find not,&#8221; (Rom. 7:15, 18). But, in this way, the whole scope of
Paul&#8217;s discourse is inverted. He is speaking of the Christian struggle
(touched on more briefly in the Epistle to the Galatians), which believers
constantly experience from the conflict between the flesh and the Spirit. But
the Spirit is not from nature, but from regeneration. That the apostle is
speaking of the regenerate is apparent from this, that after saying, &#8220;in
me dwells no good thing,&#8221; he immediately adds the explanation, &#8220;in
my flesh.&#8221; Accordingly, he declares, &#8220;It is no more I that do it,
but sin that dwelleth in me.&#8221; What is the meaning of the correction,
&#8220;in me (that is, in my flesh?)&#8221; It is just as if he had spoken in
this way, No good thing dwells in me, of myself, for in my flesh nothing good
can be found. Hence follows the species of excuse, It is not I myself that do
evil, but sin that dwelleth in me. This applies to none but the regenerate, who,
with the leading powers of the soul, tend towards what is good. The whole is
made plain by the conclusion, &#8220;I delight in the law of God after the
inward man: but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my
mind,&#8221; (Rom. 7:22, 23). Who has this struggle in himself, save those who,
regenerated by the Spirit of God, bear about with them the remains of the flesh?
Accordingly, Augustine, who had at one time thought that the discourse related
to the natural man (August. ad Bonifac. lib. 1 c. 10), afterwards retracted his
exposition as unsound and inconsistent. And, indeed if we admit that men,
without grace, have any motions to good, however feeble, what answer shall we
give to the apostles who declares that &#8220;we are incapable of thinking a
good thought?&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:6). What answer shall we give to the Lord, who
declares, by Moses, that &#8220;every imagination of man&#8217;s heart is only
evil continually?&#8221; (Gen. 8:21). Since the blunder has thus arisen from an
erroneous view of a single passage, it seems unnecessary to dwell upon it. Let
us rather give due weight to our Saviour&#8217;s words, &#8220;Whosoever
committeth sin is the servant of sin,&#8221; (John 8:34). We are all sinners by
nature, therefore we are held under the yoke of sin. But if the whole man is
subject to the dominion of sin, surely the will, which is its principal seat,
must be bound with the closest chains. And, indeed, if divine grace were
preceded by any will of ours, Paul could not have said that &#8220;it is God
which worketh in us both to will and to do&#8221; (Phil. 2:13). Away, then, with
all the absurd trifling which many have indulged in with regard to preparation.
Although believers sometimes ask to have their heart trained to the obedience of
the divine law, as David does in several passages (Ps. 51:12), it is to be
observed, that even this longing in prayer is from God. This is apparent from
the language used. When he prays, &#8220;Create in me a clean heart,&#8221; he
certainly does not attribute the beginning of the creation to himself. Let us
therefore rather adopt the sentiment of Augustine, &#8220;God will prevent you
in all things, but do you sometimes prevent his anger. How? Confess that you
have all these things from God, that all the good you have is from him, all the
evil from yourself,&#8221; (August. De Verbis Apost. Serm. 10). Shortly after he

<div><i>The principal matters in this chapter are&#8212;I. A recapitulation of
the former chapter, proving, from passages of Scriptures that the intellect and
will of man are so corrupted, that no integrity, no knowledge or fear of God,
can now be found in him, sect. 1 and 2. II. Objections to this doctrine, from
the virtues which shone in some of the heathen, refuted, sect. 3 and 4. III.
What kind of will remains in man, the slave of sin, sect. 5. The remedy and
cure, sect. 6. IV. The opinion of Neo-Pelagian sophists concerning the
preparation and efficacy of the will, and also concerning perseverance and
co-operating grace, refuted, both by reason and Scripture, sect. 7&#8211;12. V.

14.</i><br><br><br><br></div>
<div align="center">Sections.<br><br><br><br></div>
<div>1.	 The intellect and will of the whole man corrupt. The term <i>flesh</i>
applies not only to the sensual, but also to the higher part of the soul. This
demonstrated from Scripture.<br><br>2.	 The heart also involved in corruption, and
hence in no part of man can integrity, or knowledge or the fear of God, be
found.<br><br>3.	 Objection, that some of the heathen were possessed of admirable
endowments, and, therefore, that the nature of man is not entirely corrupt.
Answer, Corruption is not entirely removed, but only inwardly restrained.
Explanation of this answer.<br><br>4.	 Objection still urged, that the virtuous and
vicious among the heathen must be put upon the same level, or the virtuous prove
that human nature, properly cultivated, is not devoid of virtue. Answer, That
these are not ordinary properties of human nature, but special gifts of God.
These gifts defiled by ambition, and hence the actions proceeding from them,
however esteemed by man, have no merit with God.<br><br>5.	 Though man has still the
faculty of willing there is no soundness in it. He falls under the bondage of
sin necessarily, and yet voluntarily. Necessity must be distinguished from
compulsion. The ancient Theologians acquainted with this necessity. Some
passages condemning the vacillation of Lombard.<br><br>6.	 Conversion to God
constitutes the remedy or soundness of the human will. This not only begun, but
continued and completed; the beginning, continuance, and completion, being
ascribed entirely to God. This proved by Ezekiel&#8217;s description of the
stony heart, and from other passages of Scripture.<br><br>7.	 Various
Objections.&#8212;1. The will is converted by God, but, when once prepared, does
its part in the work of conversion. Answer from Augustine. 2. Grace can do
nothing without will, nor the will without grace.  Answer. Grace itself produces
will. God prevents the unwilling, making him willing, and follows up this
preventing grace that he may not will in vain. Another answer gathered from
various passages of Augustine.<br><br>8.	 Answer to the second Objection continued.
No will inclining to good except in the elect. The cause of election out of man.
Hence right will, as well as election, are from the good pleasure of God. The
beginning of willing and doing well is of faith; faith again is the gift of God;
and hence mere grace is the cause of our beginning to will well. This proved by
Scripture.<br><br>9.	 Answer to second Objection continued. That good will is merely
of grace proved by the prayers of saints. Three axioms 1. God does not prepare
man&#8217;s heart, so that he can afterwards do some good of himself, but every
desire of rectitude, every inclination to study, and every effort to pursue it,
is from Him. 2. This desire, study, and effort, do not stop short, but continue
to effect. 3. This progress is constant. The believer perseveres to the end. A
third Objection, and three answers to it.<br><br>10.	 A fourth Objection. Answer.
Fifth Objection. Answer. Answer confirmed by many passages of Scripture, and
supported by a passage from Augustine.<br><br>11.	 Perseverance not of ourselves,
but of God. Objection. Two errors in the objection. Refutation of both.<br><br>12.	
An objection founded on the distinction of co-operating grace. Answer. Answer
confirmed by the testimony of Augustine and Bernard.<br><br>13. 	 Last part of the
chapter, in which it is proved by many passages of Augustine, that he held the
doctrine here taught.<br><br>14.	 An objection, representing Augustine at variance
with himself and other Theologians, removed. A summary of Augustine&#8217;s
doctrine on free will.<br><br><br><br>1. THE nature of man, in both parts of his
soul&#8212;viz. intellect and will&#8212;cannot be better ascertained than by
attending to the epithets applied to him in Scripture. If he is fully depicted
(and it may easily be proved that he is) by the words of our Saviour,
&#8220;that which is born of the flesh is flesh,&#8221; (John 3:6), he must be a
very miserable creature. For, as an apostle declares, &#8220;to be carnally
minded is death,&#8221; (Rom. 8:8), &#8220;It is enmity against God, and is not
subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.&#8221; Is it true that the
flesh is so perverse, that it is perpetually striving with all its might against
God? that it cannot accord with the righteousness of the divine law? that, in
short, it can beget nothing but the materials of death? Grant that there is
nothing in human nature but flesh, and then extract something good out of it if
you can. But it will be said, that the word <i>flesh</i> applies only to the
sensual, and not to the higher part of the soul. This, however, is completely
refuted by the words both of Christ and his apostle. The statement of our Lord
is, that a man must be born again, because he is flesh. He requires not to be
born again, with reference to the body. But a mind is not born again merely by
having some portion of it reformed. It must be totally renewed. This is
confirmed by the antithesis used in both passages. In the contrast between the
Spirit and the flesh, there is nothing left of an intermediate nature. In this
way, everything in man, which is not spiritual, falls under the denomination of
carnal. But we have nothing of the Spirit except through regeneration.
Everything, therefore, which we have from nature is flesh. Any possible doubt
which might exist on the subject is removed by the words of Paul (Eph. 4:23),
where, after a description of the old man, who, he says, &#8220;is corrupt
according to the deceitful lusts,&#8221; he bids us &#8220;be renewed in the
spirit&#8221; of our mind. You see that he places unlawful and depraved desires
not in the sensual part merely, but in the mind itself, and therefore requires
that it should be renewed. Indeed, he had a little before drawn a picture of
human nature, which shows that there is no part in which it is not perverted and
corrupted. For when he says that the &#8220;Gentiles walk in the vanity of their
mind, having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God
through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their
heart,&#8221; (Eph. 4:17, 18), there can be no doubt that his words apply to all
whom the Lord has not yet formed anew both to wisdom and righteousness. This is
rendered more clear by the comparison which immediately follows, and by which he
reminds believers that they &#8220;have not so learned Christ&#8221; these words
implying that the grace of Christ is the only remedy for that blindness and its
evil consequences. Thus, too, had Isaiah prophesied of the kingdom of Christ,
when the Lord promised to the Church, that though darkness should &#8220;cover
the earth, and gross darkness the people,&#8221; yet that he should
&#8220;arise&#8221; upon it, and &#8220;his glory&#8221; should be seen upon it
(Isaiah 40:2). When it is thus declared that divine light is to arise on the
Church alone, all without the Church is left in blindness and darkness. I will
not enumerate all that occurs throughout Scripture, and particularly in the
Psalms and Prophetical writings, as to the vanity of man. There is much in what
David says, &#8220;Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree
are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than
vanity,&#8221; (Ps. 62:10). The human mind receives a humbling blow when all the
thoughts which proceed from it are derided as foolish, frivolous, perverse, and
insane.<br><br>2. In no degree more lenient is the condemnation of the heart, when
it is described as &#8220;deceitful above all things, and desperately
wicked,&#8221; (Jer. 17:9). But as I study brevity, I will be satisfied with a
single passage, one, however, in which as in a bright mirror, we may behold a
complete image of our nature. The Apostle, when he would humble man&#8217;s
pride, uses these words: &#8220;There is none righteous no, not one: there is
none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are all gone
out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that does
good, no, not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they
have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: Whose mouth is full of
cursing and bitterness: their feet are swift to shed blood: destruction and
misery are in their ways: and the way of peace have they not known: there is no
fear of God before their eyes,&#8221; (Rom. 3:10&#8211;18). Thus he thunders not
against certain individuals, but against the whole posterity of Adam&#8212;not
against the depraved manners of any single age, but the perpetual corruption of
nature. His object in the passage is not merely to upbraid men in order that
they may repent, but to teach that all are overwhelmed with inevitable calamity,
and can be delivered from it only by the mercy of God. As this could not be
proved without previously proving the overthrow and destruction of nature, he
produced those passages to show that its ruin is complete.<br><br>Let it be a fixed
point, then, that men are such as is here described, not by vicious custom, but
by depravity of nature. The reasoning of the Apostle, that there is no salvation
for man, save in the mercy of God, because in himself he is desperate and
undone, could not otherwise stand. I will not here labour to prove that the
passages apply, with the view of removing the doubts of any who might think them
quoted out of place. I will take them as if they had been used by Paul for the
first time, and not taken from the Prophets. First, then, he strips man of
righteousness, that is, integrity and purity; and, secondly, he strips him of
sound intelligence. He argues, that defect of intelligence is proved by apostasy
from God. To seek Him is the beginning of wisdom, and, therefore, such defect
must exist in all who have revolted from Him. He subjoins, that all have gone
astray, and become as it were mere corruption; that there is none that does
good. He then enumerates the crimes by which those who have once given loose to
their wickedness pollute every member of their bodies. Lastly, he declares that
they have no fear of God, according to whose rule all our steps should be
directed. If these are the hereditary properties of the human race, it is vain
to look for anything good in our nature. I confess indeed, that all these
iniquities do not break out in every individual. Still it cannot be denied that
the hydra lurks in every breast. For as a body, while it contains and fosters
the cause and matter of disease, cannot be called healthy, although pain is not
actually felt; so a soul, while teeming with such seeds of vice, cannot be
called sound. This similitude, however, does not apply throughout. In a body
however morbid the functions of life are performed; but the soul, when plunged
into that deadly abyss, not only labours under vice, but is altogether devoid of
good.<br><br>3. Here, again we are met with a question very much the same as that
which was previously solved. In every age there have been some who, under the
guidance of nature, were all their lives devoted to virtue. It is of no
consequence, that many blots may be detected in their conduct; by the mere study
of virtue, they evinced that there was somewhat of purity in their nature. The
value which virtues of this kind have in the sight of God will be considered
more fully when we treat of the merit of works. Meanwhile however, it will be
proper to consider it in this place also, in so far as necessary for the
exposition of the subject in hand. Such examples, then, seem to warn us against
supposing that the nature of man is utterly vicious, since, under its guidance,
some have not only excelled in illustrious deeds, but conducted themselves most
honourably through the whole course of their lives. But we ought to consider,
that, notwithstanding of the corruption of our nature, there is some room for
divine grace, such grace as, without purifying it, may lay it under internal
restraint. For, did the Lord let every mind loose to wanton in its lusts,
doubtless there is not a man who would not show that his nature is capable of
all the crimes with which Paul charges it (Rom. 3 compared with Ps. 14:3,
&amp;c). What? Can you exempt yourself from the number of those whose feet are
swift to shed blood; whose hands are foul with rapine and murder; whose throats
are like open sepulchres; whose tongues are deceitful; whose lips are venomous;
whose actions are useless, unjust, rotten, deadly; whose soul is without God;
whose inward parts are full of wickedness; whose eyes are on the watch for
deception; whose minds are prepared for insult; whose every part, in short, is
framed for endless deeds of wickedness? If every soul is capable of such
abominations (and the Apostle declares this boldly), it is surely easy to see
what the result would be, if the Lord were to permit human passion to follow its
bent. No ravenous beast would rush so furiously, no stream, however rapid and
violent, so impetuously burst its banks. In the elect, God cures these diseases
in the mode which will shortly be explained; in others, he only lays them under
such restraint as may prevent them from breaking forth to a degree incompatible
with the preservation of the established order of things. Hence, how much soever
men may disguise their impurity, some are restrained only by shame, others by a
fear of the laws, from breaking out into many kinds of wickedness. Some aspire
to an honest life, as deeming it most conducive to their interest, while others
are raised above the vulgar lot, that, by the dignity of their station, they may
keep inferiors to their duty. Thus God, by his providence, curbs the
perverseness of nature, preventing it from breaking forth into action, yet
without rendering it inwardly pure.<br><br>4. The objection, however, is not yet
solved. For we must either put Cataline on the same footing with Camillus, or
hold Camillus to be an example that nature, when carefully cultivated, is not
wholly void of goodness. I admit that the specious qualities which Camillus
possessed were divine gifts, and appear entitled to commendation when viewed in
themselves. But in what way will they be proofs of a virtuous nature? Must we
not go back to the mind, and from it begin to reason thus? If a natural man
possesses such integrity of manners, nature is not without the faculty of
studying virtue. But what if his mind was depraved and perverted, and followed
anything rather than rectitude? Such it undoubtedly was, if you grant that he
was only a natural man. How then will you laud the power of human nature for
good, if, even where there is the highest semblance of integrity, a corrupt bias
is always detected? Therefore, as you would not commend a man for virtue whose
vices impose upon you by a show of virtue, so you will not attribute a power of
choosing rectitude to the human will while rooted in depravity (see August. lib.
4, Cont. Julian). Still, the surest and easiest answer to the objection is, that
those are not common endowments of nature, but special gifts of God, which he
distributes in divers forms, and, in a definite measure, to men otherwise
profane. For which reason, we hesitate not, in common language, to say, that one
is of a good, another of a vicious nature; though we cease not to hold that both
are placed under the universal condition of human depravity. All we mean is that
God has conferred on the one a special grace which he has not seen it meet to
confer on the other. When he was pleased to set Saul over the kingdom, he made
him as it were a new man. This is the thing meant by Plato, when, alluding to a
passage in the Iliad, he says, that the children of kings are distinguished at
their birth by some special qualities&#8212;God, in kindness to the human race,
often giving a spirit of heroism to those whom he destines for empire. In this
way, the great leaders celebrated in history were formed. The same judgment must
be given in the case of private individuals. But as those endued with the
greatest talents were always impelled by the greatest ambitions (a stain which
defiles all virtues and makes them lose all favour in the sight of God), so we
cannot set any value on anything that seems praiseworthy in ungodly men. We may
add, that the principal part of rectitude is wanting, when there is no zeal for
the glory of God, and there is no such zeal in those whom he has not regenerated
by his Spirit. Nor is it without good cause said in Isaiah, that on Christ
should rest &#8220;the spirit of knowledge, and of the fear of the Lord,&#8221;
(Isa. 11:2); for by this we are taught that all who are strangers to Christ are
destitute of that fear of God which is the beginning of wisdom (Ps. 111:10). The
virtues which deceive us by an empty show may have their praise in civil society
and the common intercourse of life, but before the judgment-seat of God they
will be of no value to establish a claim of righteousness.<br><br>5. When the will
is enchained as the slave of sin, it cannot make a movement towards goodness,
far less steadily pursue it. Every such movement is the first step in that
conversion to God, which in Scripture is entirely ascribed to divine grace. Thus
Jeremiah prays, &#8220;Turn thou me, and I shall be turned,&#8221; (Jer. 31:18).
Hence, too, in the same chapter, describing the spiritual redemption of
believers, the Prophet says, &#8220;The Lord has redeemed Jacob, and ransomed
him from the hand of him that was stronger than he,&#8221; (Jer. 31:11);
intimating how close the fetters are with which the sinner is bound, so long as
he is abandoned by the Lord, and acts under the yoke of the devil. Nevertheless,
there remains a will which both inclines and hastens on with the strongest
affection towards sin; man, when placed under this bondage, being deprived not
of will, but of soundness of will. Bernard says not improperly, that all of us
have a will; but to will well is proficiency, to will ill is defect. Thus simply
to will is the part of man, to will ill the part of corrupt nature, to will well
the part of grace. Moreover, when I say that the will, deprived of liberty, is
led or dragged by necessity to evil, it is strange that any should deem the
expression harsh, seeing there is no absurdity in it, and it is not at variance
with pious use. It does, however, offend those who know not how to distinguish
between necessity and compulsion. Were any one to ask them, Is not God
necessarily good, is not the devil necessarily wicked, what answer would they
give? The goodness of God is so connected with his Godhead, that it is not more
necessary to be God than to be good; whereas the devil, by his fall, was so
estranged from goodness, that he can do nothing but evil. Should any one give
utterance to the profane jeer (see Calvin Adv. Pighium), that little praise is
due to God for a goodness to which he is forced, is it not obvious to every man
to reply, It is owing not to violent impulse, but to his boundless goodness,
that he cannot do evil? Therefore, if the free will of God in doing good is not
impeded, because he necessarily must do good; if the devil, who can do nothing
but evil, nevertheless sins voluntarily; can it be said that man sins less
voluntarily because he is under a necessity of sinning? This necessity is
uniformly proclaimed by Augustine, who, even when pressed by the invidious cavil
of Celestius, hesitated not to assert it in the following terms: &#8220;Man
through liberty became a sinner, but corruption, ensuing as the penalty, has
converted liberty into necessity,&#8221; (August. lib. de Perf. Justin).
Whenever mention is made of the subject, he hesitates not to speak in this way
of the necessary bondage of sin (August. de Nature et Gratia, et alibi). Let
this, then, be regarded as the sum of the distinction. Man, since he was
corrupted by the fall, sins not forced or unwilling, but voluntarily, by a most
forward bias of the mind; not by violent compulsion, or external force, but by
the movement of his own passion; and yet such is the depravity of his nature,
that he cannot move and act except in the direction of evil. If this is true,
the thing not obscurely expressed is, that he is under a necessity of sinning.
Bernard, assenting to Augustine, thus writes: &#8220;Among animals, man alone is
free, and yet sin intervening, he suffers a kind of violence, but a violence
proceeding from his will, not from nature, so that it does not even deprive him
of innate liberty,&#8221; (Bernard, Sermo. super Cantica, 81). For that which is
voluntary is also free. A little after he adds, &#8220;Thus, by some means
strange and wicked, the will itself, being deteriorated by sin, makes a
necessity; but so that the necessity, in as much as it is voluntary, cannot
excuse the will, and the will, in as much as it is enticed, cannot exclude the
necessity.&#8221; For this necessity is in a manner voluntary. He afterwards
says that &#8220;we are under a yoke, but no other yoke than that of voluntary
servitude; therefore, in respect of servitude, we are miserable, and in respect
of will, inexcusable; because the will, when it was free, made itself the slave
of sin.&#8221; At length he concludes, &#8220;Thus the soul, in some strange and
evil way, is held under this kind of voluntary, yet sadly free necessity, both
bond and free; bond in respect of necessity, free in respect of will: and what
is still more strange, and still more miserable, it is guilty because free, and
enslaved because guilty, and therefore enslaved because free.&#8221; My readers
hence perceive that the doctrine which I deliver is not new, but the doctrine
which of old Augustine delivered with the consent of all the godly, and which
was afterwards shut up in the cloisters of monks for almost a thousand years.
Lombard, by not knowing how to distinguish between necessity and compulsion,
gave occasion to a pernicious
error.<sup><font size="2">16</font><a name="fnB27" href="#fn27">[9]</a></sup><br><br>6.
On the other hand, it may be proper to consider what the remedy is which divine
grace provides for the correction and cure of natural corruption. Since the
Lord, in bringing assistance, supplies us with what is lacking, the nature of
that assistance will immediately make manifest its converse&#8212;viz. our
penury. When the Apostle says to the Philippians, &#8220;Being confident of this
very thing, that he which has begun a good work in you, will perform it until
the day of Jesus Christ,&#8221; (Phil. 1:6), there cannot be a doubt, that by
the good work thus begun, he means the very commencement of conversion in the
will. God, therefore, begins the good work in us by exciting in our hearts a
desire, a love, and a study of righteousness, or (to speak more correctly) by
turning, training, and guiding our hearts unto righteousness; and he completes
this good work by confirming us unto perseverance. But lest any one should cavil
that the good work thus begun by the Lord consists in aiding the will, which is
in itself weak, the Spirit elsewhere declares what the will, when left to
itself, is able to do. His words are, &#8220;A new heart also will I give you,
and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out
of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit
within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my
judgments, and do them,&#8221; (Ezek. 36:26, 27). How can it be said that the
weakness of the human will is aided so as to enable it to aspire effectually to
the choice of good, when the fact is, that it must be wholly transformed and
renovated? If there is any softness in a stone; if you can make it tender, and
flexible into any shape, then it may be said, that the human heart may be shaped
for rectitude, provided that which is imperfect in it is supplemented by divine
grace. But if the Spirit, by the above similitude, meant to show that no good
can ever be extracted from our heart until it is made altogether new, let us not
attempt to share with Him what He claims for himself alone. If it is like
turning a stone into flesh when God turns us to the study of rectitude,
everything proper to our own will is abolished, and that which succeeds in its
place is wholly of God. I say the will is abolished, but not in so far as it is
will, for in conversion everything essential to our original nature remains: I
also say, that it is created anew, not because the will then begins to exist,
but because it is turned from evil to good. This, I maintains is wholly the work
of God, because, as the Apostle testifies, we are not &#8220;sufficient of
ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves,&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:5). Accordingly,
he elsewhere says, not merely that God assists the weak or corrects the depraved
will, but that he worketh in us to will (Phil. 2:13). From this it is easily
inferred, as I have said, that everything good in the will is entirely the
result of grace. In the same sense, the Apostle elsewhere says, &#8220;It is the
same God which worketh all in all,&#8221; (I Cor. 12:6). For he is not there
treating of universal government, but declaring that all the good qualities
which believers possess are due to God. In using the term &#8220;all,&#8221; he
certainly makes God the author of spiritual life from its beginning to its end.
This he had previously taught in different terms, when he said that there is
&#8220;one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him,&#8221; (1
Cor. 8:6); thus plainly extolling the new creation, by which everything of our
common nature is destroyed. There is here a tacit antithesis between Adam and
Christ, which he elsewhere explains more clearly when he says, &#8220;We are his
workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God has before
ordained that we should walk in them,&#8221; (Eph. 2:10). His meaning is to show
in this way that our salvation is gratuitous because the beginning of goodness
is from the second creation which is obtained in Christ. If any, even the
minutest, ability were in ourselves, there would also be some merit. But to show
our utter destitution, he argues that we merit nothing, because we are created
in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God has prepared; again intimating by
these words, that all the fruits of good works are originally and immediately
from God. Hence the Psalmist, after saying that the Lord &#8220;has made
us,&#8221; to deprive us of all share in the work, immediately adds, &#8220;not
we ourselves.&#8221; That he is speaking of regeneration, which is the
commencement of the spiritual life, is obvious from the context, in which the
next words are, &#8220;we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture,&#8221;
(Psalm 100:3). Not contented with simply giving God the praise of our salvation,
he distinctly excludes us from all share in it, just as if he had said that not
one particle remains to man as a ground of boasting. The whole is of God.<br><br>7.
But perhaps there will be some who, while they admit that the will is in its own
nature averse to righteousness, and is converted solely by the power of God,
will yet hold that, when once it is prepared, it performs a part in acting. This
they found upon the words of Augustine, that grace precedes every good work; the
will accompanying, not leading; a handmaid, and not a guide (August. ad Bonifac.
Ep. 106). The words thus not improperly used by this holy writer, Lombard
preposterously wrests to the above effect (Lombard, lib. 2, Dist. 25). But I
maintain, that as well in the words of the Psalmist which I have quoted, as in
other passages of Scripture, two things are clearly taught&#8212;viz. that the
Lord both corrects, or rather destroys, our depraved will, and also substitutes
a good will from himself. In as much as it is prevented by grace, I have no
objection to your calling it a handmaid; but in as much as when formed again, it
is the work of the Lord, it is erroneous to say, that it accompanies preventing
grace as a voluntary attendant. Therefore, Chrysostom is inaccurate in saying,
that grace cannot do any thing without will, nor will any thing without grace
(Serm. de Invent. Sanct. Crucis); as if grace did not, in terms of the passage
lately quoted from Paul, produce the very will itself. The intention of
Augustine, in calling the human will the handmaid of grace, was not to assign it
a kind of second place to grace in the performance of good works. His object
merely was to refute the pestilential dogma of Pelagius, who made human merit
the first cause of salvation. As was sufficient for his purpose at the time, he
contends that grace is prior to all merit, while, in the meantime, he says
nothing of the other question as to the perpetual effect of grace, which,
however, he handles admirably in other places. For in saying, as he often does,
that the Lord prevents the unwilling in order to make him willing, and follows
after the willing that he may not will in vain, he makes Him the sole author of
good works. Indeed, his sentiments on this subject are too clear to need any
lengthened illustration. &#8220;Men,&#8221; says he, &#8220;labour to find in
our will something that is our own, and not God&#8217;s; how they can find it, I
wot not,&#8221; (August. de Remiss. Peccat., lib. 2 c. 18). In his First Book
against Pelagius and Celestius, expounding the saying of Christ, &#8220;Every
man therefore that has heard, and has learned of the Father, cometh unto
me,&#8221; (John 6:45), he says, &#8220;The will is aided not only so as to know
what is to be done, but also to do what it knows.&#8221; And thus, when God
teaches not by the letter of the Law, but by the grace of the Spirit, he so
teaches, that every one who has learned, not only knowing, sees, but also
willing, desires, and acting, performs.<br><br>8. Since we are now occupied with the
chief point on which the controversy turns, let us give the reader the sum of
the matter in a few, and those most unambiguous, passages of Scripture;
thereafter, lest any one should charge us with distorting Scripture, let us show
that the truth, which we maintain to be derived from Scripture, is not
unsupported by the testimony of this holy man (I mean Augustine). I deem it
unnecessary to bring forward every separate passage of Scripture in confirmation
of my doctrine. A selection of the most choice passages will pave the way for
the understanding of all those which lie scattered up and down in the sacred
volume. On the other hand, I thought it not out of place to show my accordance
with a man whose authority is justly of so much weight in the Christian world.
It is certainly easy to prove that the commencement of good is only with God,
and that none but the elect have a will inclined to good. But the cause of
election must be sought out of man; and hence it follows that a right will is
derived not from man himself, but from the same good pleasure by which we were
chosen before the creation of the world. Another argument much akin to this may
be added. The beginning of right will and action being of faith, we must see
whence faith itself is. But since Scripture proclaims throughout that it is the
free gift of God, it follows, that when men, who are with their whole soul
naturally prone to evil, begin to have a good will, it is owing to mere grace.
Therefore, when the Lord, in the conversion of his people, sets down these two
things as requisite to be done&#8212;viz. to take away the heart of stone, and
give a heart of flesh, he openly declares, that, in order to our conversion to
righteousness, what is ours must be taken away, and that what is substituted in
its place is of himself. Nor does he declare this in one passage only. For he
says in Jeremiah &#8220;I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may
fear me for ever;&#8221; and a little after he says, &#8220;I will put my fear
in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me,&#8221; (Jer. 32:39, 40).
Again, in Ezekiel, &#8220;I will give them one heart, and I will put a new
spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will
give them an heart of flesh,&#8221; (Ezek. 11:19). He could not more clearly
claim to himself, and deny to us, everything good and right in our will, than by
declaring, that in our conversion there is the creation of a new spirit and a
new heart. It always follows, both that nothing good can proceed from our will
until it be formed again, and that after it is formed again in so far as it is
good, it is of God, and not of us.<br><br>9. With this view, likewise the prayers of
the saints correspond. Thus Solomon prays that the Lord may &#8220;incline our
hearts unto him, to walk in his ways, and keep his commandments&#8221; (1 Kings
8:58); intimating that our heart is perverse, and naturally indulges in
rebellion against the Divine law, until it be turned. Again, it is said in the
Psalms, &#8220;Incline my heart unto thy testimonies,&#8221; (Ps. 119:36). For
we should always note the antithesis between the rebellious movement of the
heart, and the correction by which it is subdued to obedience. David feeling for
the time that he was deprived of directing grace, prays, &#8220;Create in me a
clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me,&#8221; (Ps. 51:10). Is
not this an acknowledgment that all the parts of the heart are full of impurity,
and that the soul has received a twist, which has turned it from straight to
crooked? And then, in describing the cleansing, which he earnestly demands as a
thing to be created by God, does he not ascribe the work entirely to Him? If it
is objected, that the prayer itself is a symptom of a pious and holy affection,
it is easy to reply, that although David had already in some measure repented,
he was here contrasting the sad fall which he had experienced with his former
state. Therefore, speaking in the person of a man alienated from God, he
properly prays for the blessings which God bestows upon his elect in
regeneration. Accordingly, like one dead, he desires to be created anew, so as
to become, instead of a slave of Satan, an instrument of the Holy Spirit.
Strange and monstrous are the longings of our pride. There is nothing which the
Lord enjoins more strictly than the religious observance of his Sabbath, in
other words resting from our works; but in nothing do we show greater reluctance
than to renounce our own works, and give due place to the works of God. Did not
arrogance stand in the way, we could not overlook the clear testimony which
Christ has borne to the efficacy of his grace. &#8220;I,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;am the true vine, and my Father is the husband man.&#8221; &#8220;As the
branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye,
except ye abide in me,&#8221; (John 15:1, 4). If we can no more bear fruit of
ourselves than a vine can bud when rooted up and deprived of moisture, there is
no longer any room to ask what the aptitude of our nature is for good. There is
no ambiguity in the conclusion, &#8220;For without me ye can do nothing.&#8221;
He says not that we are too weak to suffice for ourselves; but, by reducing us
to nothing, he excludes the idea of our possessing any, even the least ability.
If, when engrafted into Christ, we bear fruit like the vine, which draws its
vegetative power from the moisture of the ground, and the dew of heaven, and the
fostering warmth of the sun, I see nothing in a good work, which we can call our
own, without trenching upon what is due to God. It is vain to have recourse to
the frivolous cavil, that the sap and the power of producing are already
contained in the vine, and that, therefore, instead of deriving everything from
the earth or the original root, it contributes something of its own. Our
Saviour&#8217;s words simply mean, that when separated from him, we are nothing
but dry, useless wood, because, when so separated, we have no power to do good,
as he elsewhere says, &#8220;Every plant which my heavenly Father has not
planted, shall be rooted up,&#8221; (Mt. 15:13). Accordingly, in the passage
already quoted from the Apostle Paul, he attributes the whole operation to God,
&#8220;It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good
pleasure,&#8221; (Phil. 2:13). The first part of a good work is the will, the
second is vigorous effort in the doing of
it.<sup><font size="2">17</font><a name="fnB28" href="#fn28">[0]</a></sup> God
is the author of both. It is, therefore, robbery from God to arrogate anything
to ourselves, either in the will or the act. Were it said that God gives
assistance to a weak will, something might be left us; but when it is said that
he makes the will, every thing good in it is placed without us. Moreover, since
even a good will is still weighed down by the burden of the flesh, and prevented
from rising, it is added, that, to meet the difficulties of the contest, God
supplies the persevering effort until the effect is obtained. Indeed, the
Apostle could not otherwise have said, as he elsewhere does, that &#8220;it is
the same God which worketh all in all,&#8221; (1 Cor. 12:6); words
comprehending, as we have already observed (sec. 6), the whole course of the
spiritual life. For which reason, David, after praying, &#8220;Teach me thy way,
O Lord, I will walk in thy truths&#8221; adds, &#8220;unite my heart to fear thy
name,&#8221; (Ps. 86:11); by these words intimating, that even those who are
well-affected are liable to so many distractions that they easily become vain,
and fall away, if not strengthened to persevere. And hence, in another passage,
after praying, &#8220;Order my steps in thy word,&#8221; he requests that
strength also may be given him to carry on the war, &#8220;Let not any iniquity
have dominion over me,&#8221; (Ps. 119:133). In this way, the Lord both begins
and perfects the good work in us, so that it is due to Him, first, that the will
conceives a love of rectitude, is inclined to desire, is moved and stimulated to
pursue it; secondly, that this choice, desire, and endeavour fail not, but are
carried forward to effect; and, lastly, that we go on without interruption, and
persevere even to the end.<br><br>10. This movement of the will is not of that
description which was for many ages taught and believed&#8212;viz. a movement
which thereafter leaves us the choice to obey or resist it, but one which
affects us efficaciously. We must, therefore, repudiate the oft-repeated
sentiment of Chrysostom, &#8220;Whom he draws, he draws willingly;&#8221;
insinuating that the Lord only stretches out his hand, and waits to see whether
we will be pleased to take his aid. We grant that, as man was originally
constituted, he could incline to either side, but since he has taught us by his
example how miserable a thing free will is if God works not in us to will and to
do, of what use to us were grace imparted in such scanty measure? Nay, by our
own ingratitude, we obscure and impair divine grace. The Apostle&#8217;s
doctrine is not, that the grace of a good will is offered to us if we will
accept of it, but that God himself is pleased so to work in us as to guide,
turn, and govern our heart by his Spirit, and reign in it as his own possession.
Ezekiel promises that a new spirit will be given to the elect, not merely that
they may be able to walk in his precepts, but that they may really walk in them
(Ezek. 11:19; 36:27). And the only meaning which can be given to our
Saviour&#8217;s words, &#8220;Every man, therefore, that has heard and learned
of the Father, cometh unto me,&#8221; (John 6:45), is, that the grace of God is
effectual in itself. This Augustine maintains in his book De
Pr&#190;destinatione Sancta. This grace is not bestowed on all promiscuously,
according to the common brocard (of Occam, if I mistake not), that it is not
denied to any one who does what in him lies. Men are indeed to be taught that
the favour of God is offered, without exception, to all who ask it; but since
those only begin to ask whom heaven by grace inspires, even this minute portion
of praise must not be withheld from him. It is the privilege of the elect to be
regenerated by the Spirit of God, and then placed under his guidance and
government. Wherefore Augustine justly derides some who arrogate to themselves a
certain power of willing, as well as censures others who imagine that that which
is a special evidence of gratuitous election is given to all (August. de Verbis
Apost. Serm. 21). He says, &#8220;Nature is common to all, but not grace;&#8221;
and he calls it a showy acuteness &#8220;which shines by mere vanity, when that
which God bestows, on whom he will is attributed generally to all.&#8221;
Elsewhere he says, &#8220;How came you? By believing. Fear, lest by arrogating
to yourself the merit of finding the right way, you perish from the right way. I
came, you say, by free choice, came by my own will. Why do you boast? Would you
know that even this was given you? Hear Christ exclaiming, &#8216;No man comets
unto me, except the Father which has sent me draw him.&#8217; &#8221; And from
the words of John (6:44), he infers it to be an incontrovertible fact, that the
hearts of believers are so effectually governed from above, that they follow
with undeviating affection. &#8220;Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin;
for his seed remaineth in him&#8221; (I John 3:9). That intermediate movement
which the sophists imagine, a movement which every one is free to obey or to
reject, is obviously excluded by the doctrine of effectual
perseverance.<sup><font size="2">17</font><a name="fnB29" href="#fn29">[1]</a></sup><br><br>11.
As to perseverance, it would undoubtedly have been regarded as the gratuitous
gift of God, had not the very pernicious error prevailed, that it is bestowed in
proportion to human merit, according to the reception which each individual
gives to the first grace. This having given rise to the idea that it was
entirely in our own power to receive or reject the offered grace of God, that
idea is no sooner exploded than the error founded on it must fall. The error,
indeed, is twofold. For, besides teaching that our gratitude for the first grace
and our legitimate use of it is rewarded by subsequent supplies of grace, its
abettors add that, after this, grace does not operate alone, but only
co-operates with ourselves. As to the former, we must hold that the Lord, while
he daily enriches his servants, and loads them with new gifts of his grace,
because he approves of and takes pleasure in the work which he has begun, finds
that in them which he may follow up with larger measures of grace. To this
effect are the sentences, &#8220;To him that has shall be given.&#8221;
&#8220;Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few
things, I will make thee ruler over many things,&#8221; (Mt. 25:21, 23, 29; Luke
19:17, 26). But here two precautions are necessary. It must not be said that the
legitimate use of the first grace is rewarded by subsequent measures of grace,
as if man rendered the grace of God effectual by his own industry, nor must it
be thought that there is any such remuneration as to make it cease to be the
gratuitous grace of God. I admit, then, that believers may expect as a blessing
from God, that the better the use they make of previous, the larger the supplies
they will receive of future grace; but I say that even this use is of the Lord,
and that this remuneration is bestowed freely of mere good will. The trite
distinction of operating and co-operating grace is employed no less sinistrously
than unhappily. Augustine, indeed, used it, but softened it by a suitable
definition&#8212;viz. that God, by co-operating, perfects what he begins by
operating,&#8212;that both graces are the same, but obtain different names from
the different manner in which they produce their effects. Whence it follows,
that he does not make an apportionment between God and man, as if a proper
movement on the part of each produced a mutual concurrence. All he does is to
mark a multiplication of grace. To this effect, accordingly, he elsewhere says,
that in man good will precedes many gifts from God; but among these gifts is
this good will itself. (<i>August. Enchiridion ad Laurent</i>. cap. 32). Whence
it follows, that nothing is left for the will to arrogate as its own. This Paul
has expressly stated. For, after saying, &#8220;It is God which worketh in you
both to will and to do,&#8221; he immediately adds, &#8220;of his good
pleasure,&#8221; (Phil. 2:13); indicating by this expression, that the blessing
is gratuitous. As to the common saying, that after we have given admission to
the first grace, our efforts co-operate with subsequent grace, this is my
answer:&#8212;If it is meant that after we are once subdued by the power of the
Lord to the obedience of righteousness, we proceed voluntarily, and are inclined
to follow the movement of grace, I have nothing to object. For it is most
certain, that where the grace of God reigns, there is also this readiness to
obey. And whence this readiness, but just that the Spirit of God being
everywhere consistent with himself, after first begetting a principle of
obedience, cherishes and strengthens it for perseverance? If, again, it is meant
that man is able of himself to be a fellow-labourer with the grace of God, I
hold it to be a most pestilential delusion.<br><br>12. In support of this view, some
make an ignorant and false application of the Apostle&#8217;s words: &#8220;I
laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which
was with me,&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:10). The meaning they give them is, that as Paul
might have seemed to speak somewhat presumptuously in preferring himself to all
the other apostles, he corrects the expression so far by referring the praise to
the grace of God, but he, at the same time, calls himself a co-operator with
grace. It is strange that this should have proved a stumbling-block to so many
writers, otherwise respectable. The Apostle says not that the grace of God
laboured with him so as to make him a co-partner in the labour. He rather
transfers the whole merit of the labour to grace alone, by thus modifying his
first expression, &#8220;It was not I,&#8221; says he, &#8220;that laboured, but
the grace of God that was present with me.&#8221; Those who have adopted the
erroneous interpretation have been misled by an ambiguity in the expression, or
rather by a preposterous translation, in which the force of the Greek article is
overlooked. For to take the words literally, the Apostle does not say that grace
was a fellow-worker with him, but that the grace which was with him was sole
worker. And this is taught not obscurely, though briefly, by Augustine when he
says, &#8220;Good will in man precedes many gifts from God, but not all gifts,
seeing that the will which precedes is itself among the number.&#8221; He adds
the reason, &#8220;for it is written, &#8216;the God of my mercy shall prevent
me,&#8217; (Ps. 59:10), and &#8216;Surely goodness and mercy shall follow
me,&#8217; (Ps. 23:6); it prevents him that is unwilling, and makes him willing;
it follows him that is willing, that he may not will in vain.&#8221; To this
Bernard assents, introducing the Church as praying thus, &#8220;Draw me, who am
in some measure unwilling, and make me willing; draw me, who am sluggishly
lagging, and make me run,&#8221; (Serm. 2 in Cantic).<br><br>13. Let us now hear
Augustine in his own words, lest the Pelagians of our age, I mean the sophists
of the Sorbonne, charge us after their wont with being opposed to all antiquity.
In this indeed they imitate their father Pelagius, by whom of old a similar
charge was brought against Augustine. In the second chapter of his Treatise De
Correptione et Gratis, addressed to Valentinus, Augustine explains at length
what I will state briefly, but in his own words, that to Adam was given the
grace of persevering in goodness if he had the will; to us it is given to will,
and by will overcome concupiscence: that Adam, therefore, had the power if he
had the will, but did not will to have the power, whereas to us is given both
the will and the power; that the original freedom of man was to be able not to
sin, but that we have a much greater freedom&#8212;viz. not to be able to sin.
And lest it should be supposed, as Lombard erroneously does (lib. 2 Dist. 25),
that he is speaking of the perfection of the future state, he shortly after
removes all doubt when he says, &#8220;For so much is the will of the saints
inflamed by the Holy Spirit, that they are able, because they are willing; and
willing, because God worketh in them so to will.&#8221; For if, in such weakness
(in which, however, to suppress pride, &#8220;strength&#8221; must be made
&#8220;perfect,&#8221;) their own will is left to them, in such sense that, by
the help of God, they are able, if they will, while at the same time God does
not work in them so as to make them will; among so many temptations and
infirmities the will itself would give way, and, consequently, they would not be
able to persevere. Therefore, to meet the infirmity of the human will, and
prevent it from failing, how weak soever it might be, divine grace was made to
act on it inseparably and uninterruptedly. Augustine (ibid. cap. 14). next
entering fully into the question, how our hearts follow the movement when God
affects them, necessarily says, indeed, that the Lord draws men by their own
wills; wills, however, which he himself has produced. We have now an attestation
by Augustine to the truth which we are specially desirous to maintain&#8212;viz.
that the grace offered by the Lord is not merely one which every individual has
full liberty of choosing to receive or reject, but a grace which produces in the
heart both choice and will: so that all the good works which follow after are
its fruit and effect; the only will which yields obedience being the will which
grace itself has made. In another place, Augustine uses these words,
&#8220;Every good work in us is performed only by grace,&#8221; (August. Ep.
105).<br><br>14. In saying elsewhere that the will is not taken away by grace, but
out of bad is changed into good, and after it is good is assisted,&#8212;he only
means, that man is not drawn as if by an extraneous
impulse<sup><font size="2">17</font><a name="fnB30" href="#fn30">[2]</a></sup>
without the movement of the heart, but is inwardly affected so as to obey from
the heart. Declaring that grace is given specially and gratuitously to the
elect, he writes in this way to Boniface: &#8220;We know that Divine grace is
not given to all men, and that to those to whom it is given, it is not given
either according to the merit of works, or according to the merit of the will,
but by free grace: in regard to those to whom it is not given, we know that the
not giving of it is a just judgment from God,&#8221; (August. ad Bonifac. Ep.
106). In the same epistle, he argues strongly against the opinion of those who
hold that subsequent grace is given to human merit as a reward for not rejecting
the first grace. For he presses Pelagius to confess that gratuitous grace is
necessary to us for every action, and that merely from the fact of its being
truly grace, it cannot be the recompense of works. But the matter cannot be more
briefly summed up than in the eighth chapter of his Treatise De Correptione et
Gratia, where he shows, <i>First</i>, that human will does not by liberty obtain
grace, but by grace obtains liberty. <i>Secondly</i>, that by means of the same
grace, the heart being impressed with a feeling of delight, is trained to
persevere, and strengthened with invincible fortitude. <i>Thirdly</i>, that
while grace governs the will, it never falls; but when grace abandons it, it
falls forthwith. <i>Fourthly</i>, that by the free mercy of God, the will is
turned to good, and when turned, perseveres. <i>Fifthly</i>, that the direction
of the will to good, and its constancy after being so directed, depend entirely
on the will of God, and not on any human merit. Thus the will (free will, if you
choose to call it so), which is left to man, is, as he in another place (Ep. 46)
describes it, a will which can neither be turned to God, nor continue in God,
unless by grace; a will which, whatever its ability may be, derives all that
ability from grace.<br><br><br><br></div>

<div>1.	 Connection of this chapter with the preceding. Augustine&#8217;s
similitude of a good and bad rider. Question answered in respect to the
devil.<br><br>2.	 Question answered in respect to God and man. Example from the
history of Job. The works of God distinguished from the works of Satan and
wicked men. 1. By the design or end of acting. How Satan acts in the reprobate.
2. How God acts in them.<br><br>3.	 Old Objection, that the agency of God in such
cases is referable to prescience or permission, not actual operation. Answer,
showing that God blinds and hardens the reprobate, and this in two ways; 1. By
deserting them; 2. By delivering them over to Satan.<br><br>4.	 Striking passages of
Scripture, proving that God acts in both ways, and disposing of the objection
with regard to prescience. Confirmation from Augustine.<br><br>5.	 A modification of
the former answer, proving that God employs Satan to instigate the reprobate,
but, at the same time, is free from all taint.<br><br>6.	 How God works in the
hearts of men in indifferent matters. Our will in such matters not so free as to
be exempt from the overruling providence of God. This confirmed by various
examples.<br><br>7.	 Objection, that these examples do not form the rule. An answer,
fortified by the testimony of universal experience, by Scripture, and a passage
of Augustine.<br><br>8.	 Some, in arguing against the error of free will, draw an
argument from the event. How this is to be understood.<br><br><br><br>1. THAT man is so
enslaved by the yoke of sin, that he cannot of his own nature aim at good either
in wish or actual pursuit, has, I think, been sufficiently proved. Moreover, a
distinction has been drawn between compulsion and necessity, making it clear
that man, though he sins necessarily, nevertheless sins voluntarily. But since,
from his being brought into bondage to the devil, it would seem that he is
actuated more by the devil&#8217;s will than his own, it is necessary, first, to
explain what the agency of each is, and then solve the
question,<sup><font size="2">17</font><a name="fnB31" href="#fn31">[3]</a></sup>
Whether in bad actions anything is to be attributed to God, Scripture intimating
that there is some way in which he interferes? Augustine (in Psalm 31 and 33)
compares the human will to a horse preparing to start, and God and the devil to
riders. &#8220;If God mounts, he, like a temperate and skilful rider, guides it
calmly, urges it when too slow, reins it in when too fast, curbs its forwardness
and over-action, checks its bad temper, and keeps it on the proper course; but
if the devil has seized the saddle, like an ignorant and rash rider, he hurries
it over broken ground, drives it into ditches, dashes it over precipices, spurs
it into obstinacy or fury.&#8221; With this simile, since a better does not
occur, we shall for the present be contented. When it is said, then, that the
will of the natural man is subject to the power of the devil, and is actuated by
him, the meaning is not that the wills while reluctant and resisting, is forced
to submit (as masters oblige unwilling slaves to execute their orders), but
that, fascinated by the impostures of Satan, it necessarily yields to his
guidance, and does him homage. Those whom the Lord favours not with the
direction of his Spirit, he, by a righteous judgment, consigns to the agency of
Satan. Wherefore, the Apostle says, that &#8220;the god of this world has
blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious
gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine into them.&#8221; And,
in another passage, he describes the devil as &#8220;the spirit that now worketh
in the children of disobedience,&#8221; (Eph. 2:2). The blinding of the wicked,
and all the iniquities consequent upon it, are called the works of Satan; works
the cause of which is not to be Sought in anything external to the will of man,
in which the root of the evil lies, and in which the foundation of Satan&#8217;s
kingdom, in other words, sin, is fixed.<br><br>2. The nature of the divine agency in
such cases is very different. For the purpose of illustration, let us refer to
the calamities brought upon holy Job by the Chaldeans. They having slain his
shepherds, carry off his flocks. The wickedness of their deed is
manifest,<sup><font size="2">17</font><a name="fnB32" href="#fn32">[4]</a></sup>
as is also the hand of Satan, who, as the history informs us, was the instigator
of the whole. Job, however, recognises it as the work of God, saying, that what
the Chaldeans had plundered, &#8220;the Lord&#8221; had &#8220;taken
away.&#8221; How can we attribute the same work to God, to Satan, and to man,
without either excusing Satan by the interference of God, or making God the
author of the crime? This is easily done, if we look first to the end, and then
to the mode of acting. The Lord designs to exercise the patience of his servant
by adversity; Satan&#8217;s plan is to drive him to despair; while the Chaldeans
are bent on making unlawful gain by plunder. Such diversity of purpose makes a
wide distinction in the act. In the mode there is not less difference. The Lord
permits Satan to afflict his servant; and the Chaldeans, who had been chosen as
the ministers to execute the deed, he hands over to the impulses of Satan, who,
pricking on the already depraved Chaldeans with his poisoned darts, instigates
them to commit the crime. They rush furiously on to the unrighteous deed, and
become its guilty perpetrators. Here Satan is properly said to act in the
reprobate, over whom he exercises his sway, which is that of wickedness. God
also is said to act in his own way; because even Satan when he is the instrument
of divine wrath, is completely under the command of God, who turns him as he
will in the execution of his just judgments. I say nothing here of the universal
agency of God, which, as it sustains all the creatures, also gives them all
their power of acting. I am now speaking only of that special agency which is
apparent in every act. We thus see that there is no inconsistency in attributing
the same act to God, to Satan, and to man, while, from the difference in the end
and mode of action, the spotless righteousness of God shines forth at the same
time that the iniquity of Satan and of man is manifested in all its
deformity.<br><br>3. Ancient writers sometimes manifest a superstitious dread of
making a simple confession of the truth in this matter, from a fear of
furnishing impiety with a handle for speaking irreverently of the works of God.
While I embrace such soberness with all my heart, I cannot see the least danger
in simply holding what Scripture delivers. when Augustine was not always free
from this superstition, as when he says, that blinding and hardening have
respect not to the operation of God, but to prescience (Lib. de Predestina. et
Gratia). But this subtilty is repudiated by many passages of Scriptures which
clearly show that the divine interference amounts to something more than
prescience. And Augustine himself, in his book against
Julian,<sup><font size="2">17</font><a name="fnB33" href="#fn33">[5]</a></sup>
contends at length that sins are manifestations not merely of divine permission
or patience, but also of divine power, that thus former sins may be punished. In
like manner, what is said of permission is too weak to stand. God is very often
said to blind and harden the reprobate, to turn their hearts, to incline and
impel them, as I have elsewhere fully explained (Book 1 c. 18). The extent of
this agency can never be explained by having recourse to prescience or
permission. We, therefore, hold that there are two methods in which God may so
act. When his light is taken away, nothing remains but blindness and darkness:
when his Spirit is taken away, our hearts become hard as stones: when his
guidance is withdrawn, we immediately turn from the right path: and hence he is
properly said to incline, harden, and blind those whom he deprives of the
faculty of seeing, obeying, and rightly executing. The second method, which
comes much nearer to the exact meaning of the words, is when executing his
judgments by Satan as the minister of his anger, God both directs men&#8217;s
counsels, and excites their wills, and regulates their efforts as he pleases.
Thus when Moses relates that Simon, king of the Amorites, did not give the
Israelites a passage, because the Lord &#8220;had hardened his spirit, and made
his heart obstinate,&#8221; he immediately adds the purpose which God had in
view&#8212;viz. that he might deliver him into their hand (Deut. 2:30). As God
had resolved to destroy him, the hardening of his heart was the divine
preparation for his ruin.<br><br>4. In accordance with the former methods it seems
to be
said,<sup><font size="2">17</font><a name="fnB34" href="#fn34">[6]</a></sup>
&#8220;The law shall perish from the priests and counsel from the
ancients.&#8221; &#8220;He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to
wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.&#8221; Again &#8220;O Lord, why
hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened our heart from thy
fear?&#8221; These passages rather indicate what men become when God deserts
them, than what the nature of his agency is when he works in them. But there are
other passages which go farther, such as those concerning the hardening of
Pharaoh: &#8220;I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people
go.&#8221; The same thing is afterwards repeated in stronger terms. Did he
harden his heart by not softening it? This is, indeed, true; but he did
something more: he gave it in charge to Satan to confirm him in his obstinacy.
Hence he had previously said, &#8220;I am sure he will not let you go.&#8221;
The people come out of Egypt, and the inhabitants of a hostile region come forth
against them. How were they instigated? Moses certainly declares of Sihon, that
it was the Lord who &#8220;had hardened his spirit, and made his heart
obstinate,&#8221; (Deut. 2:30). The Psalmists relating the same history says,
&#8220;He turned their hearts to hate his people,&#8221; (Psalm 105:25). You
cannot now say that they stumbled merely because they were deprived of divine
counsel. For if they are <i>hardened</i> and <i>turned</i>, they are purposely
bent to the very end in view. Moreover, whenever God saw it meet to punish the
people for their transgression, in what way did he accomplish his purpose by the
reprobate? In such a way as shows that the efficacy of the action was in him,
and that they were only ministers. At one time he declares, &#8220;that he will
lift an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of
the earth;&#8221; at another, that he will take a net to ensnare them; and at
another, that he will be like a hammer to strike them. But he specially declared
that he was not inactive among theme when he called Sennacherib an axe, which
was formed and destined to be wielded by his own
hand.<sup><font size="2">17</font><a name="fnB35" href="#fn35">[7]</a></sup>
Augustine is not far from the mark when he states the matter thus, That men sin,
is attributable to themselves: that in sinning they produce this or that result,
is owing to the mighty power of God, who divides the darkness as he pleases
(August. de Pr&#190;dest. Sanct).<br><br>5. Moreover, that the ministry of Satan is
employed to instigate the reprobate, whenever the Lord, in the course of his
providence, has any purpose to accomplish in them, will sufficiently appear from
a single passage. It is repeatedly said in the First Book of Samuel, that an
evil spirit from the Lord came upon Saul, and troubled him (1 Sam. 16:14; 18:10;
19:9). It were impious to apply this to the Holy Spirit. An impure spirit must
therefore be called a spirit from the Lord, because completely subservient to
his purpose, being more an instrument in acting than a proper agent. We should
also add what Paul says, &#8220;God shall send them strong delusion, that they
should believe a lie: that they all might be damned who believed not the
truth,&#8221; (2 Thess. 2:11, 12). But in the same transaction there is always a
wide difference between what the Lord does, and what Satan and the ungodly
design to do. The wicked instruments which he has under his hand and can turn as
he pleases, he makes subservient to his own justice. They, as they are wicked,
give effect to the iniquity conceived in their wicked minds. Every thing
necessary to vindicate the majesty of God from calumny, and cut off any
subterfuge on the part of the ungodly, has already been expounded in the
Chapters on Providence (Book 1 Chapter 16&#8211;18). Here I only meant to show,
in a few words, how Satan reigns in the reprobate, and how God works in
both.<br><br>6. In those actions, which in themselves are neither good nor bad, and
concern the corporeal rather than the spiritual life, the liberty which man
possesses, although we have above touched upon it (<i>supra</i>, Chap. 2 sect.
13&#8211;17), has not yet been explained. Some have conceded a free choice to
man in such actions; more, I suppose, because they were unwilling to debate a
matter of no great moment, than because they wished positively to assert what
they were prepared to concede. While I admit that those who hold that man has no
ability in himself to do righteousness, hold what is most necessary to be known
for salvation, I think it ought not to be overlooked that we owe it to the
special grace of God, whenever, on the one hand, we choose what is for our
advantage, and whenever our will inclines in that direction; and on the other,
whenever with heart and soul we shun what would otherwise do us harm. And the
interference of Divine Providence goes to the extent not only of making events
turn out as was foreseen to be expedient, but of giving the wills of men the
same direction. If we look at the administration of human affairs with the eye
of sense, we will have no doubt that, so far, they are placed at man&#8217;s
disposal; but if we lend an ear to the many passages of Scripture which proclaim
that even in these matters the minds of men are ruled by God, they will compel
us to place human choice in subordination to his special influence. Who gave the
Israelites such favour in the eyes of the Egyptians, that they lent them all
their most valuable commodities? (Exod. 11:3). They never would have been so
inclined of their own accord. Their inclinations, therefore, were more overruled
by God than regulated by themselves. And surely, had not Jacob been persuaded
that God inspires men with divers affections as seemeth to him good, he would
not have said of his son Joseph (whom he thought to be some heathen Egyptian),
&#8220;God Almighty give you mercy before the man,&#8221; (Gen. 43:14). In like
manner, the whole Church confesses that when the Lord was pleased to pity his
people, he made them also to be pitied of all them that carried them captives
(Ps. 106:46). In like manner, when his anger was kindled against Saul, so that
he prepared himself for battle, the cause is stated to have been, that a spirit
from God fell upon him (1 Sam. 11:6). who dissuaded Absalom from adopting the
counsel of Ahithophel, which was wont to be regarded as an oracle? (2 Sam.
17:14). Who disposed Rehoboam to adopt the counsel of the young men? (1 Kings
12:10). Who caused the approach of the Israelites to strike terror into nations
formerly distinguished for valour? Even the harlot Rahab recognised the hand of
the Lord. Who, on the other hand, filled the hearts of the Israelites with fear
and dread (Lev. 26:36), but He who threatened in the Law that he would give them
a nn &#8220;trembling heart&#8221;? (Deut. 28:65).<br><br>7. It may be objected,
that these are special examples which cannot be regarded as a general rule. They
are sufficient, at all events, to prove the point for which I contend&#8212;viz.
that whenever God is pleased to make way for his providence, he even in external
matters so turns and bends the wills of men, that whatever the freedom of their
choice may be, it is still subject to the disposal of God. That your mind
depends more on the agency of God than the freedom of your own choice, daily
experience teaches. Your judgment often fails, and in matters of no great
difficulty, your courage flags; at other times, in matters of the greatest
obscurity, the mode of explicating them at once suggests itself, while in
matters of moment and danger, your mind rises superior to every
difficulty.<sup><font size="2">17</font><a name="fnB36" href="#fn36">[8]</a></sup>
In this way, I interpret the words of Solomon, &#8220;The hearing ear, and the
seeing eye, the Lord hath made even both of them,&#8221; (Prov. 20:12). For they
seem to me to refer not to their creation, but to peculiar grace in the use of
them, when he says, &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is in the hand of the Lord as
the rivers of water; he turneth it whithersoever he will,&#8221; (Prov. 21:1),
he comprehends the whole race under one particular class. If any will is free
from subjection, it must be that of one possessed of regal power, and in a
manner exercising dominion over other wills. But if it is under the hand of God,
ours surely cannot be exempt from it. On this subject there is an admirable
sentiment of Augustine, &#8220;Scripture, if it be carefully examined, will show
not only that the good wills of men are made good by God out of evil, and when
so made, are directed to good acts, even to eternal life, but those which retain
the elements of the world are in the power of God, to turn them whither he
pleases, and when he pleases, either to perform acts of kindness, or by a
hidden, indeed, but, at the same time, most just judgment to inflict
punishment,&#8221; (August. De Gratia et Lib. Arb. ad Valent. cap. 20).<br><br>8.
Let the reader here remember, that the power of the human will is not to be
estimated by the event, as some unskilful persons are absurdly wont to do. They
think it an elegant and ingenious proof of the bondage of the human will, that
even the greatest monarchs are sometimes thwarted in their wishes. But the
ability of which we speak must be considered as within the man, not measured by
outward success. In discussing the subject of free will, the question is not,
whether external obstacles will permit a man to execute what he has internally
resolved, but whether, in any matter whatever, he has a free power of judging
and of willing. If men possess both of these, Attilius Regulus, shut up in a
barrel studded with sharp nails, will have a will no less free than Augustus
Caesar ruling with imperial sway over a large portion of the
globe.<sup><font size="2">17</font><a name="fnB37" href="#fn37">[9]</a></sup><br><br><br><br></div>

into three sorts. The first of these considered in this and the following
section.<br><br>7.	 This general argument from the Law of no avail to the patrons of
free will. Promises conjoined with precepts, prove that our sal vation is to be
found in the grace of God. Objection, that the Law was given to the persons
living at the time. Answer, confirmed by passages from Augustine.<br><br>8.	 A
special consideration of the three classes of precepts of no avail to the

which simply speak of the observance of the Law. 3. Precepts which enjoin us to
persevere in the grace of God.<br><br>9.	 Objection. Answer. Confirmation of the
answer from Jeremiah. Another objection refuted.<br><br>10.	 A second class of
arguments in defence of free will drawn from the promises of God&#8212;viz. that
the promises which God makes to those who seek him are vain if it is not in our
power to do, or not do, the thing required. Answer, which explains the use of
promises, and removes the supposed inconsistency.<br><br>11.	 Third class of
arguments drawn from the divine upbraidings,&#8212;that it is in vain to upbraid
us for evils which it is not in our power to avoid. Answer. Sinners are
condemned by their own consciences, and, therefore, the divine upbraidings are
just. Moreover, there is a twofold use in these upbraidings. Various passages of
Scripture explained by means of the foregoing answers.<br><br>12.	 Objection founded
on the words of Moses. Refutation by the words of an Apostle. Confirmation by

A third explanation. A fourth from Augustine. Conclusion and summary of the
whole discussion concerning free will.<br><br><br><br>1. ENOUGH would seem to have been
said on the subject of man&#8217;s will, were there not some who endeavour to
urge him to his ruin by a false opinion of liberty, and at the same time, in
order to support their own opinion, assail ours. First, they gather together
some absurd inferences, by which they endeavour to bring odium upon our
doctrine, as if it were abhorrent to common sense, and then they oppose it with
certain passages of Scripture (<i>infra</i>, sec. 6). Both devices we shall
dispose of in their order. If sin, say they, is necessary, it ceases to be sin;
if it is voluntary, it may be avoided. Such, too, were the weapons with which
Pelagius assailed Augustine. But we are unwilling to crush them by the weight of
his name, until we have satisfactorily disposed of the objections themselves. I
deny, therefore, that sin ought to be the less imputed because it is necessary;
and, on the other hand, I deny the inference, that sin may be avoided because it
is voluntary. If any one will dispute with God, and endeavour to evade his
judgment, by pretending that he could not have done otherwise, the answer
already given is sufficient, that it is owing not to creation, but the
corruption of nature, that man has become the slave of sin, and can will nothing
but evil. For whence that impotence of which the wicked so readily avail
themselves as an excuse, but just because Adam voluntarily subjected himself to
the tyranny of the devil? Hence the corruption by which we are held bound as
with chains, originated in the first man&#8217;s revolt from his Maker. If all
men are justly held guilty of this revolt, let them not think themselves excused
by a necessity in which they see the clearest cause of their condemnation. But
this I have fully explained above; and in the case of the devil himself, have
given an example of one who sins not less voluntarily that he sins necessarily.
I have also shown, in the case of the elect angels, that though their will
cannot decline from good, it does not therefore cease to be will. This Bernard
shrewdly explains when he says (Serm. 81, in Cantica), that we are the more
miserable in this, that the necessity is voluntary; and yet this necessity so
binds us who are subject to it, that we are the slaves of sin, as we have
already observed. The second step in the reasoning is vicious, because it leaps
from <i>voluntary</i> to <i>free</i>; whereas we have proved above, that a thing
may be done voluntarily, though not subject to free choice.<br><br>2. They add, that
unless virtue and vice proceed from free choice, it is absurd either to punish
man or reward him. Although this argument is taken from Aristotle, I admit that
it is also used by Chrysostom and Jerome. Jerome, however, does not disguise
that it was familiar to the Pelagians. He even quotes their words, &#8220;If
grace acts in us, grace, and not we who do the work, will be crowned,&#8221;
(<i>Hieron. in Ep. ad Ctesiphont. et Dialog. 1</i>) With regard to punishment, I
answer, that it is properly inflicted on those by whom the guilt is contracted.
What matters it whether you sin with a free or an enslaved judgment, so long as
you sin voluntarily, especially when man is proved to be a sinner because he is
under the bondage of sin? In regard to the rewards of righteousness, is there
any great absurdity in acknowledging that they depend on the kindness of God
rather than our own merits? How often do we meet in Augustine with this
expression,&#8212;&#8220;God crowns not our merits but his own gifts; and the
name of reward is given not to what is due to our merits, but to the recompense
of grace previously bestowed?&#8221; Some seem to think there is acuteness in
the remark, that there is no place at all for the mind, if good works do not
spring from free will as their proper source; but in thinking this so very
unreasonable they are widely mistaken. Augustine does not hesitate uniformly to
describe as necessary the very thing which they count it impious to acknowledge.
Thus he asks, &#8220;What is human merit? He who came to bestow not due
recompense but free grace, though himself free from sin, and the giver of
freedom, found all men sinners,&#8221; (Augustin. in Psal. 31). Again, &#8220;If
you are to receive your due, you must be punished. What then is done? God has
not rendered you due punishment, but bestows upon you unmerited grace. If you
wish to be an alien from grace, boast your merits,&#8221; (in Psal. 70). Again,
&#8220;You are nothing in yourself, sin is yours, merit God&#8217;s. Punishment
is your due; and when the reward shall come, God shall crown his own gifts, not
your merits,&#8221; (Ep. 52). To the same effect he elsewhere says (De Verb.
Apostol. Serm. 15), that grace is not of merit, but merit of grace. And shortly
after he concludes, that God by his gifts anticipates all our merit, that he may
thereby manifest his own merit, and give what is absolutely free, because he
sees nothing in us that can be a ground of salvation. But why extend the list of
quotations, when similar sentiments are ever and anon recurring in his works?
The abettors of this error would see a still better refutation of it, if they
would attend to the source from which the apostle derives the glory of the
saints,&#8212;&#8220;Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called;
and whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he justified, them he also
glorified,&#8221; (Rom. 8:30). On what ground, then, the apostle being judge (2
Tim. 4:8), are believers crowned? Because by the mercy of God, not their own
exertions, they are predestinated, called, and justified. Away, then, with the
vain fear, that unless free will stand, there will no longer be any merit! It is
most foolish to take alarm, and recoil from that which Scripture inculcates.
&#8220;If thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not
received it?&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:7). You see how every thing is denied to free
will, for the very purpose of leaving no room for merit. And yet, as the
beneficence and liberality of God are manifold and inexhaustible, the grace
which he bestows upon us, inasmuch as he makes it our own, he recompenses as if
the virtuous acts were our own.<br><br>3. But it is added, in terms which seem to be
borrowed from Chrysostom (Homil. 22, in Genes.), that if our will possesses not
the power of choosing good or evil, all who are partakers of the same nature
must be alike good or alike bad. A sentiment akin to this occurs in the work De
Vocatione Gentium (lib. 4 c. 4), usually attributed to Ambrose, in which it is
argued, that no one would ever decline from faith, did not the grace of God
leave us in a mutable state. It is strange that such men should have so
blundered. How did it fail to occur to Chrysostom, that it is divine election
which distinguishes among men? We have not the least hesitation to admit what
Paul strenuously maintains, that all, without exception, are depraved and given
over to wickedness; but at the same time we add, that through the mercy of God
all do not continue in wickedness. Therefore, while we all labour naturally
under the same disease, those only recover health to whom the Lord is pleased to
put forth his healing hand. The others whom, in just judgment, he passes over,
pine and rot away till they are consumed. And this is the only reason why some
persevere to the end, and others, after beginning their course, fall away.
Perseverance is the gift of God, which he does not lavish promiscuously on all,
but imparts to whom he pleases. If it is asked how the difference
arises&#8212;why some steadily persevere, and others prove deficient in
steadfastness, we can give no other reason than that the Lord, by his mighty
power, strengthens and sustains the former, so that they perish not, while he
does not furnish the same assistance to the latter, but leaves them to be
monuments of instability.<br><br>4. Still it is insisted, that exhortations are
vain, warnings superfluous, and rebukes absurd, if the sinner possesses not the
power to obey. When similar objections were urged against Augustine, he was
obliged to write his book, De Correptione et Gratia, where he has fully disposed
of them. The substance of his answer to his opponents is this: &#8220;O, man!
learn from the precept what you ought to do; learn from correction, that it is
your own fault you have not the power; and learn in prayer, whence it is that
you may receive the power.&#8221; Very similar is the argument of his book, De
Spiritu et Litera, in which he shows that God does not measure the precepts of
his law by human strength, but, after ordering what is right, freely bestows on
his elect the power of fulfilling it. The subject, indeed, does not require a
long discussion. For we are not singular in our doctrine, but have Christ and
all his apostles with us. Let our opponents, then, consider how they are to come
off victorious in a contest which they wage with such antagonists. Christ
declares, &#8220;without me ye can do nothing,&#8221; (John 20:5). Does he the
less censure and chastise those who, without him, did wickedly? Does he the less
exhort every man to be intent on good works? How severely does Paul inveigh
against the Corinthians for want of charity (1 Cor. 3:3); and yet at the same
time, he prays that charity may be given them by the Lord. In the Epistle to the
Romans, he declares that &#8220;it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that
runneth, but of God that showeth mercy,&#8221; (Rom. 9:16). Still he ceases not
to warn, exhort, and rebuke them. Why then do they not expostulate with God for
making sport with men, by demanding of them things which he alone can give, and
chastising them for faults committed through want of his grace? Why do they not
admonish Paul to spare those who have it not in their power to will or to run,
unless the mercy of God, which has forsaken them, precede? As if the doctrine
were not founded on the strongest reason&#8212;reason which no serious inquirer
can fail to perceive. The extent to which doctrine, and exhortation, and rebuke,
are in themselves able to change the mind, is indicated by Paul when he says,
&#8220;Neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God
that giveth the increase,&#8221; (1 Cor 3:7) in like manner, we see that Moses
delivers the precepts of the Law under a heavy sanction, and that the prophets
strongly urge and threaten transgressors though they at the same time confess,
that men are wise only when an understanding heart is given them; that it is the
proper work of God to circumcise the heart, and to change it from stone into
flesh; to write his law on their inward parts; in short, to renew souls so as to
give efficacy to doctrine.<br><br>5. What purpose, then, is served by exhortations?
It is this: As the wicked, with obstinate heart, despise them, they will be a
testimony against them when they stand at the judgment-seat of God; nay, they
even now strike and lash their consciences. For, however they may petulantly
deride, they cannot disapprove them. But what, you will ask, can a miserable
mortal do, when softness of heart, which is necessary to obedience, is denied
him? I ask, in reply, Why have recourse to evasion, since hardness of heart
cannot be imputed to any but the sinner himself? The ungodly, though they would
gladly evade the divine admonitions, are forced, whether they will or not, to
feel their power. But their chief use is to be seen in the case of believers, in
whom the Lord, while he always acts by his Spirit, also omits not the
instrumentality of his word, but employs it, and not without effect. Let this,
then, be a standing truth, that the whole strength of the godly consists in the
grace of God, according to the words of the prophet, &#8220;I will give them one
heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart
out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh, that they may walk in
my statutes,&#8221; (Ezek. 11:19, 20). But it will be asked, why are they now
admonished of their duty, and not rather left to the guidance of the Spirit? Why
are they urged with exhortations when they cannot hasten any faster than the
Spirit impels them? and why are they chastised, if at any time they go astray,
seeing that this is caused by the necessary infirmity of the flesh? &#8220;O,
man! who art thou that replies against God?&#8221; If, in order to prepare us
for the grace which enables us to obey exhortation, God sees meet to employ
exhortation, what is there in such an arrangement for you to carp and scoff at?
Had exhortations and reprimands no other profit with the godly than to convince
them of sin, they could not be deemed altogether useless. Now, when, by the
Spirit of God acting within, they have the effect of inflaming their desire of
good, of arousing them from lethargy, of destroying the pleasure and honeyed
sweetness of sin, making it hateful and loathsome, who will presume to cavil at
them as superfluous?<br><br>Should any one wish a clearer reply, let him take the
following:&#8212;God works in his elect in two ways: inwardly, by his Spirit;
outwardly, by his Word. By his Spirit illuminating their minds, and training
their hearts to the practice of righteousness, he makes them new creatures,
while, by his Word, he stimulates them to long and seek for this renovation. In
both, he exerts the might of his hand in proportion to the measure in which he
dispenses them. The Word, when addressed to the reprobate, though not effectual
for their amendment, has another use. It urges their consciences now, and will
render them more inexcusable on the day of judgment. Thus, our Saviour, while
declaring that none can come to him but those whom the Father draws, and that
the elect come after they have heard and learned of the Father (John 6:44, 45),
does not lay aside the office of teacher, but carefully invites those who must
be taught inwardly by the Spirit before they can make any profit. The reprobate,
again, are admonished by Paul, that the doctrine is not in vain; because, while
it is in them a savour of death unto death, it is still a sweet savour unto God
(2 Cor. 2:16).<br><br>6. The enemies of this doctrine are at great pains in
collecting passages of Scripture, as if, unable to accomplish any thing by their
weight, they were to overwhelm us by their number. But as in battle, when it is
come to close quarters, an unwarlike multitude, how great soever the pomp and
show they make, give way after a few blows, and take to
flight,<sup><font size="2">18</font><a name="fnB38" href="#fn38">[0]</a></sup>
so we shall have little difficulty here in disposing of our opponents and their
host. All the passages which they pervert in opposing us are very similar in
their import; and hence, when they are arranged under their proper heads, one
answer will suffice for several; it is not necessary to give a separate
consideration to each. Precepts seem to be regarded as their stronghold. These
they think so accommodated to our abilities, as to make it follow as a matter of
course, that whatever they enjoin we are able to perform. Accordingly, they run
over all the precepts, and by them fix the measure of our power. For, say they,
when God enjoins meekness, submission, love, chastity, piety, and holiness, and
when he forbids anger, pride, theft, uncleanness, idolatry, and the like, he
either mocks us, or only requires things which are in our power.<br><br>All the
precepts which they thus heap together may be divided into three classes. Some
enjoin a first conversion unto God, others speak simply of the observance of the
law, and others inculcate perseverance in the grace which has been received. We
shall first treat of precepts in general, and then proceed to consider each
separate class. That the abilities of man are equal to the precepts of the
divine law, has long been a common idea, and has some show of plausibility. It
is founded, however, on the grossest ignorance of the law. Those who deem it a
kind of sacrilege to say, that the observance of the law is impossible, insist,
as their strongest argument, that, if it is so, the Law has been given in vain
(<i>infra</i>, Chap. 7 sec. 5). For they speak just as if Paul had never said
anything about the Law. But what, pray, is meant by saying, that the Law
&#8220;was added because of transgressions;&#8221; &#8220;by the law is the
knowledge of sin;&#8221; &#8220;I had not known sin but by the law;&#8221;
&#8220;the law entered that the offence might abound?&#8221; (Gal. 3:19; Rom.
3:20; 7:7; 5:20). Is it meant that the Law was to be limited to our strength,
lest it should be given in vain? Is it not rather meant that it was placed far
above us, in order to convince us of our utter feebleness? Paul indeed declares,
that charity is the end and fulfilling of the Law (1 Tim. 1:5). But when he
prays that the minds of the Thessalonians may be filled with it, he clearly
enough acknowledges that the Law sounds in our ears without profit, if God do
not implant it thoroughly in our hearts (1 Thess. 3:12).<br><br>7. I admit, indeed,
that if the Scripture taught nothing else on the subject than that the Law is a
rule of life by which we ought to regulate our pursuits, I should at once assent
to their opinion; but since it carefully and clearly explains that the use of
the Law is manifold, the proper course is to learn from that explanation what
the power of the Law is in man. In regard to the present question, while it
explains what our duty is it teaches that the power of obeying it is derived
from the goodness of God, and it accordingly urges us to pray that this power
may be given us. If there were merely a command and no promise, it would be
necessary to try whether our strength were sufficient to fulfil the command; but
since promises are annexed, which proclaim not only that aid, but that our whole
power is derived from divine grace, they at the same time abundantly testify
that we are not only unequal to the observance of the Law, but mere fools in
regard to it. Therefore, let us hear no more of a proportion between our ability
and the divine precepts, as if the Lord had accommodated the standard of justice
which he was to give in the Law to our feeble capacities. We should rather
gather from the promises hove ill provided we are, having in everything so much
need of grace. But say they, Who will believe that the Lord designed his Law for
blocks and stones? There is no wish to make any one believe this. The ungodly
are neither blocks nor stones, when, taught by the Law that their lusts are
offensive to God, they are proved guilty by their own confession; nor are the
godly blocks or stones, when admonished of their powerlessness, they take refuge
in grace. To this effect are the pithy sayings of Augustine, &#8220;God orders
what we cannot do, that we may know what we ought to ask of him. There is a
great utility in precepts, if all that is given to free will is to do greater
honour to divine grace. Faith acquires what the Law requires; nay, the Law
requires, in order that faith may acquire what is thus required; nay, more, God
demands of us faith itself, and finds not what he thus demands, until by giving
he makes it possible to find it.&#8221; Again, he says, &#8220;Let God give what
he orders, and order what he
wills.&#8221;<sup><font size="2">18</font><a name="fnB39" href="#fn39">[1]</a></sup><br><br>8.
This will be more clearly seen by again attending to the three classes of
precepts to which we above referred. Both in the Law and in the Prophets, God
repeatedly calls upon us to turn to
him.<sup><font size="2">18</font><a name="fnB40" href="#fn40">[2]</a></sup> But,
on the other hand, a prophet exclaims, &#8220;Turn thou me, and I shall be
turned; for thou art the Lord my God. Surely after that I was turned, I
repented.&#8221; He orders us to circumcise the foreskins of our hearts; but
Moses declares, that that circumcision is made by his own hand. In many passages
he demands a new heart, but in others he declares that he gives it. As Augustine
says, &#8220;What God promises, we ourselves do not through choice or nature,
but he himself does by grace.&#8221; The same observation is made, when, in
enumerating the rules of Tichonius, he states the third in effect to
be&#8212;that we distinguish carefully between the Law and the promises, or
between the commands and grace (Augustin. de Doctrine Christiana, lib. 3). Let
them now go and gather from precepts what man&#8217;s power of obedience is,
when they would destroy the divine grace by which the precepts themselves are
accomplished. The precepts of the second class are simply those which enjoin us
to worship God, to obey and adhere to his will, to do his pleasure, and follow
his teaching. But innumerable passages testify that every degree of purity,
piety, holiness, and justices which we possess, is his gift. Of the third class
of precepts is the exhortation of Paul and Barnabas to the proselytes, as
recorded by Luke; they &#8220;persuaded them to continue in the grace of
God,&#8221; (Acts 13:43). But the source from which this power of continuance
must be sought is elsewhere explained by Paul, when he says, &#8220;Finally, my
brethren, be strong in the Lord,&#8221; (Eph. 6:10). In another passage he says,
&#8220;Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
redemption,&#8221; (Eph. 4:30). But as the thing here enjoined could not be
performed by man, he prays in behalf of the Thessalonians, that God would count
them &#8220;worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his
goodness, and the work of faith with power,&#8221; (2 Thess. 1:11). In the same
way, in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, when treating of alms, he
repeatedly commends their good and pious inclination. A little farther on,
however, he exclaims, &#8220;Thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care
into the heart of Titus for you. For indeed he accepted the exhortation,&#8221;
(2 Cor. 8:16, 17). If Titus could not even perform the office of being a mouth
to exhort others, except in so far as God suggested, how could the others have
been voluntary agents in acting, if the Lord Jesus had not directed their
hearts?<br><br>9. Some, who would be thought more acute, endeavour to evade all
these passages, by the quibble, that there is nothing to hinder us from
contributing our part, while God, at the same time, supplies our deficiencies.
They, moreover, adduce passages from the Prophets, in which the work of our
conversion seems to be shared between God and ourselves; &#8220;Turn ye unto me,
saith the Lord of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the Lord of
hosts,&#8221; (Zech. 1:3). The kind of assistance which God gives us has been
shown above (sect. 7, 8), and need not now be repeated. One thing only I ask to
be conceded to me, that it is vain to think we have a power of fulfilling the
Law, merely because we are enjoined to obey it. Since, in order to our
fulfilling the divine precepts, the grace of the Lawgiver is both necessary, and
has been promised to us, this much at least is clear, that more is demanded of
us than we are able to pay. Nor can any cavil evade the declaration in Jeremiah,
that the covenant which God made with his ancient people was broken, because it
was only of the letter&#8212;that to make it effectual, it was necessary for the
Spirit to interpose and train the heart to obedience (Jer. 31:32). The opinion
we now combat is not aided by the words, &#8220;Turn unto me, and I will turn
unto you.&#8221; The turning there spoken of is not that by which God renews the
heart unto repentance; but that in which, by bestowing prosperity, he manifests
his kindness and favour, just in the same way as he sometimes expresses his
displeasure by sending adversity. The people complaining under the many
calamities which befell them, that they were forsaken by God, he answers, that
his kindness would not fail them, if they would return to a right course, and to
himself, the standard of righteousness. The passage, therefore, is wrested from
its proper meaning when it is made to countenance the idea that the work of
conversion is divided between God and man (<i>supra</i>, Chap. 2 sec. 27). We
have only glanced briefly at this subject, as the proper place for it will occur
when we come to treat of the Law (Chap. 7 sec. 2 and 3).<br><br>10. The second class
of objections is akin to the former. They allege the promises in which the Lord
makes a paction with our will. Such are the following: &#8220;Seek good, and not
evil, that ye may live,&#8221; (Amos 5:14). &#8220;If ye be willing and
obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: but if ye refuse and rebel, ye
shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken
it,&#8221; (Isaiah 1:19, 20). &#8220;If thou wilt put away thine abominations
out of my sight, then thou shalt not remove,&#8221; (Jer. 4:1). &#8220;It shall
come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy
God, to observe and do all the commandments which I command thee this days that
the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth,&#8221;
(Deut. 28:1). There are other similar passages (Lev. 26:3, &amp;c). They think
that the blessings contained in these promises are offered to our will absurdly
and in mockery, if it is not in our power to secure or reject them. It is,
indeed, an easy matter to indulge in declamatory complaint on this subject, to
say that we are cruelly
mocked<sup><font size="2">18</font><a name="fnB41" href="#fn41">[3]</a></sup> by
the Lord, when he declares that his kindness depends on our wills if we are not
masters of our wills&#8212;that it would be a strange liberality on the part of
God to set his blessings before us, while we have no power of enjoying
them,&#8212;a strange certainty of promises, which, to prevent their ever being
fulfilled, are made to depend on an impossibility. Of promises of this
description, which have a condition annexed to them, we shall elsewhere speak,
and make it plain that there is nothing absurd in the impossible fulfilment of
them. In regard to the matter in hand, I deny that God cruelly mocks us when he
invites us to merit blessings which he knows we are altogether unable to merit.
The promises being offered alike to believers and to the ungodly, have their use
in regard to both. As God by his precepts stings the consciences of the ungodly,
so as to prevent them from enjoying their sins while they have no remembrance of
his judgments, so, in his promises, he in a manner takes them to witness how
unworthy they are of his kindness. Who can deny that it is most just and most
becoming in God to do good to those who worship him, and to punish with due
severity those who despise his majesty? God, therefore, proceeds in due order,
when, though the wicked are bound by the fetters of sin, he lays down the law in
his promises, that he will do them good only if they depart from their
wickedness. This would be right, though His only object were to let them
understand that they are deservedly excluded from the favour due to his true
worshipers. On the other hand, as he desires by all means to stir up believers
to supplicate his grace, it surely should not seem strange that he attempts to
accomplish by promises the same thing which, as we have shown, he to their great
benefit accomplishes by means of precepts. Being taught by precepts what the
will of God is, we are reminded of our wretchedness in being so completely at
variance with that will, and, at the same time, are stimulated to invoke the aid
of the Spirit to guide us into the right path. But as our indolence is not
sufficiently aroused by precepts, promises are added, that they may attract us
by their sweetness, and produce a feeling of love for the precept. The greater
our desire of righteousness, the greater will be our earnestness to obtain the
grace of God. And thus it is, that in the protestations, <i>if we be
willing</i>, <i>if thou shalt hearken</i>, the Lord neither attributes to us a
full power of willing and hearkening, nor yet mocks us for our
impotence.<sup><font size="2">18</font><a name="fnB42" href="#fn42">[4]</a></sup><br><br>11.
The third class of objections is not unlike the other two. For they produce
passages in which God upbraids his people for their ingratitude, intimating that
it was not his fault that they did not obtain all kinds of favour from his
indulgence. Of such passages, the following are examples: &#8220;The Amalekites
and the Canaanites are before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye
are turned away from the Lord, therefore the Lord will not be with you,&#8221;
(Num. 14:43). &#8220;Because ye have done all these works, saith the Lord, and I
spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called
you, but ye answered not; therefore will I do unto this house, which is called
by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your
fathers, as I have done to Shiloh,&#8221; (Jer. 7:13, 14). &#8220;They obeyed
not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that
thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come
upon them,&#8221; (Jer. 32:23). How, they ask, can such upbraiding be directed
against those who have it in their power immediately to reply,&#8212;Prosperity
was dear to us: we feared adversity; that we did not, in order to obtain the one
and avoid the other, obey the Lord, and listen to his voice, is owing to its not
being free for us to do so in consequence of our subjection to the dominion of
sin; in vain, therefore, are we upbraided with evils which it was not in our
power to escape. But to say nothing of the pretext of necessity, which is but a
feeble and flimsy defence of their conduct, can they, I ask, deny their guilt?
If they are held convicted of any fault, the Lord is not unjust in upbraiding
them for having, by their own perverseness, deprived themselves of the
advantages of his kindness. Let them say, then, whether they can deny that their
own will is the depraved cause of their rebellion. If they find within
themselves a fountain of wickedness, why do they stand declaiming about
extraneous causes, with the view of making it appear that they are not the
authors of their own destruction? If it be true that it is not for
another&#8217;s faults that sinners are both deprived of the divine favour, and
visited with punishment, there is good reason why they should hear these rebukes
from the mouth of God. If they obstinately persist in their vices, let them
learn in their calamities to accuse and detest their own wickedness, instead of
charging God with cruelty and injustice. If they have not manifested docility,
let them, under a feeling of disgust at the sins which they see to be the cause
of their misery and ruin, return to the right path, and, with serious
contrition, confess the very thing of which the Lord by his rebuke reminds them.
Of what use those upbraidings of the prophets above quoted are to believers,
appears from the solemn prayer of Daniel, as given in his ninth chapter. Of
their use in regard to the ungodly, we see an example in the Jews, to whom
Jeremiah was ordered to explain the cause of their miseries, though the event
could not be otherwise than the Lord had foretold. &#8220;Therefore thou shalt
speak these words unto them; but they will not hearken unto thee: thou shalt
also call unto them; but they will not answer thee,&#8221; (Jer. 7:27). Of what
use, then, was it to talk to the deaf? It was, that even against their will they
might understand that what they heard was true, and that it was impious
blasphemy to transfer the blame of their wickedness to God, when it resided in
themselves.<br><br>These few explanations will make it very easy for the reader to
disentangle himself from the immense heap of passages (containing both precepts
and reprimands) which the enemies of divine grace are in the habit of piling up,
that they may thereon erect their statue of free will. The Psalmist upbraids the
Jews as &#8220;a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not
their heart aright,&#8221; (Psalm 78:8); and in another passage, he exhorts the
men of his time, &#8220;Harden not your heart,&#8221; (Psalm 95:8). This implies
that the whole blame of the rebellion lies in human depravity. But it is foolish
thence to infer, that the heart, the preparation of which is from the Lord, may
be equally bent in either direction. The Psalmist says, &#8220;I have inclined
my heart to perform thy statutes alway,&#8221; (Psalm 119:112); meaning, that
with willing and cheerful readiness of mind he had devoted himself to God. He
does not boast, however, that he was the author of that disposition, for in the
same psalm he acknowledges it to be the gift of God. We must, therefore, attend
to the admonition of Paul, when he thus addresses believers, &#8220;Work out
your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you
both to will and to do of his good pleasure,&#8221; (Phil. 2:12, 13). He
ascribes to them a part in acting that they may not indulge in carnal sloth, but
by enjoining fear and trembling, he humbles them so as to keep them in
remembrance, that the very thing which they are ordered to do is the proper work
of God&#8212;distinctly intimating, that believers act (if I may so speak)
<i>passively</i> in as much as the power is given them from heaven, and cannot
in any way be arrogated to themselves. Accordingly, when Peter exhorts us to
&#8220;add to faith virtue,&#8221; (2 Pet. 1:5), he does not concede to us the
possession of a second place, as if we could do anything separately. He only
arouses the sluggishness of our flesh, by which faith itself is frequently
stifled. To the same effect are the words of Paul. He says, &#8220;Quench not
the Spirit,&#8221; (1 Thess. 5:19); because a spirit of sloth, if not guarded
against, is ever and anon creeping in upon believers. But should any thence
infer that it is entirely in their own power to foster the offered light, his
ignorance will easily be refuted by the fact, that the very diligence which Paul
enjoins is derived only from God (2 Cor. 7:1). We are often commanded to purge
ourselves of all impurity, though the Spirit claims this as his peculiar office.
In fine, that what properly belongs to God is transferred to us only by way of
concession, is plain from the words of John, &#8220;He that is begotten of God
keepeth himself,&#8221; (1 John 5:18). The advocates of free will fasten upon
the expression as if it implied, that we are kept partly by the power of God,
partly by our own, whereas the very keeping of which the Apostle speaks is
itself from heaven. Hence, Christ prays his Father to keep us from evil (John
17:15), and we know that believers, in their warfare against Satan, owe their
victory to the armour of God. Accordingly, Peter, after saying, &#8220;Ye have
purified your souls in obeying the truth,&#8221; immediately adds by way of
correction, &#8220;through the Spirit,&#8221; (1 Pet. 1:22). In fine, the
nothingness of human strength in the spiritual contest is briefly shown by John,
when he says, that &#8220;Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his
seed remaineth in him&#8221; (1 John 3:9). He elsewhere gives the reasons
&#8220;This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith,&#8221; (1
John 5:4).<br><br>12. But a passage is produced from the Law of Moses, which seems
very adverse to the view now given. After promulgating the Law, he takes the
people to witness in these terms: &#8220;This commandment which I command thee
this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. It is not in
heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it
unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? But the word is very nigh unto thee, in
thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it,&#8221; (Deut. 30:11, 12,
14). Certainly, if this is to be understood of mere precepts, I admit that it is
of no little importance to the matter in hand. For, though it were easy to evade
the difficulty by saying, that the thing here treated of is not the observance
of the law, but the facility and readiness of becoming acquainted with it, some
scruple, perhaps, would still remain. The Apostle Paul, however, no mean
interpreter, removes all doubt when he affirms, that Moses here spoke of the
doctrine of the Gospel (Rom. 10:8). If any one is so refractory as to contend
that Paul violently wrested the words in applying them to the Gospel, though his
hardihood is chargeable with impiety, we are still able, independently of the
authority of the Apostle, to repel the objection. For, if Moses spoke of
precepts merely, he was only inflating the people with vain confidence. Had they
attempted the observance of the law in their own strength, as a matter in which
they should find no difficulty, what else could have been the result than to
throw them headlong? Where, then, was that easy means of observing the law, when
the only access to it was over a fatal
precipice?<sup><font size="2">18</font><a name="fnB43" href="#fn43">[5]</a></sup>
Accordingly, nothing is more certain than that under these words is comprehended
the covenant of mercy, which had been promulgated along with the demands of the
law. A few verses before, he had said, &#8220;The Lord thy God will circumcise
thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine
heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live,&#8221; (Deut. 30:6).
Therefore, the readiness of which he immediately after speaks was placed not in
the power of man, but in the protection and help of the Holy Spirit, who
mightily performs his own work in our weakness. The passage, however, is not to
be understood of precepts simply, but rather of the Gospel promises, which, so
far from proving any power in us to fulfil righteousness, utterly disprove it.
This is confirmed by the testimony of Paul, when he observes that the Gospel
holds forth salvation to us, not under the harsh arduous, and impossible terms
on which the law treats with us (namely, that those shall obtain it who fulfil
all its demands), but on terms easy, expeditious, and readily obtained. This
passage, therefore, tends in no degree to establish the freedom of the human
will.<br><br>13. They are wont also to adduce certain passages in which God is said
occasionally to try men, by withdrawing the assistance of his grace, and to wait
until they turn to him, as in Hosea, &#8220;I will go and return to my place,
till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face,&#8221; (Hosea 5:15). It
were absurd (say they), that the Lord should wait till Israel should seek his
face, if their minds were not flexible, so as to turn in either direction of
their own accord. As if anything were more common in the prophetical writings
than for God to put on the semblance of rejecting and casting off his people
until they reform their lives. But what can our opponents extract from such
threats? If they mean to maintain that a people, when abandoned by God, are able
of themselves to think of turning unto him, they will do it in the very face of
Scripture. On the other hand, if they admit that divine grace is necessary to
conversion, why do they dispute with us? But while they admit that grace is so
far necessary, they insist on reserving some ability for man. How do they prove
it? Certainly not from this nor any similar passage; for it is one thing to
withdraw from man, and look to what he will do when thus abandoned and left to
himself, and another thing to assist his powers (whatever they may be), in
proportion to their weakness. What, then, it will be asked, is meant by such
expressions? I answer, just the same as if God were to say, Since nothing is
gained by admonishing, exhorting, rebuking this stubborn people, I will withdraw
for a little, and silently leave them to be afflicted; I shall see whether,
after long calamity, any remembrance of me will return, and induce them to seek
my face. But by the departure of the Lord to a distance is meant the withdrawal
of prophecy. By his waiting to see what men will do is meant that he, while
silent, and in a manner hiding himself, tries them for a season with various
afflictions. Both he does that he may humble us the more; for we shall sooner be
broken than corrected by the strokes of adversity, unless his Spirit train us to
docility. Moreover, when the Lord, offended and, as it were, fatigued with our
obstinate perverseness, leaves us for a while (by withdrawing his word, in which
he is wont in some degree to manifest his presence), and makes trial of what we
will do in his absence, from this it is erroneously inferred, that there is some
power of free will, the extent of which is to be considered and tried, whereas
the only end which he has in view is to bring us to an acknowledgment of our
utter nothingness.<br><br>14. Another objection is founded on a mode of speaking
which is constantly observed both in Scripture and in common discourse. God
works are said to be ours, and we are said to do what is holy and acceptable to
God, just as we are said to commit sin. But if sins are justly imputed to us, as
proceeding from ourselves, for the same reason (say they) some share must
certainly be attributed to us in works of righteousness. It could not be
accordant with reason to say, that we do those things which we are incapable of
doing of our own motion, God moving us, as if we were stones. These expressions,
therefore, it is said, indicate that while, in the matter of grace, we give the
first place to God, a secondary place must be assigned to our agency. If the
only thing here insisted on were, that good works are termed <i>ours</i>, I, in
my turn, would reply, that the bread which we ask God to give us is also termed
<i>ours</i>. What, then, can be inferred from the title of possession, but
simply that, by the kindness and free gift of Gods that becomes ours which in
other respects is by no means due to us? Therefore let them either ridicule the
same absurdity in the Lord&#8217;s Prayer, or let them cease to regard it as
absurd, that good works should be called ours, though our only property in them
is derived from the liberality of God. But there is something stronger in the
fact, that we are often said in Scripture to worship God, do justice, obey the
law, and follow good works. These being proper offices of the mind and will, how
can they be consistently referred to the Spirit, and, at the same time,
attributed to us, unless there be some concurrence on our part with the divine
agency? This difficulty will be easily disposed of if we attend to the manner in
which the Holy Spirit acts in the righteous. The similitude with which they
invidiously assail us is foreign to the purpose; for who is so absurd as to
imagine that movement in man differs in nothing from the impulse given to a
stone? Nor can anything of the kind be inferred from our doctrine. To the
natural powers of man we ascribe approving and rejecting, willing and not
willing, striving and resisting&#8212;viz. approving vanity, rejecting solid
good, willing evil and not willing good, striving for wickedness and resisting
righteousness. What then does the Lord do? If he sees meet to employ depravity
of this description as an instrument of his anger, he gives it whatever aim and
direction he pleases, that, by a guilty hand, he may accomplish his own good
work. A wicked man thus serving the power of God, while he is bent only on
following his own lust, can we compare to a stone, which, driven by an external
impulse, is borne along without motion, or sense, or will of its own? We see how
wide the difference is. But how stands the case with the godly, as to whom
chiefly the question is raised? When God erects his kingdom in them, he, by
means of his Spirit, curbs their will, that it may not follow its natural bent,
and be carried hither and thither by vagrant lusts; bends, frames trains, and
guides it according to the rule of his justice, so as to incline it to
righteousness and holiness, and establishes and strengthens it by the energy of
his Spirit, that it may not stumble or fall. For which reason Augustine thus
expresses himself (De Corrept. et Gratia, cap. 2), &#8220;It will be said we are
therefore acted upon, and do not act. Nay, you act and are acted upon, and you
then act well when you are acted upon by one that is good. The Spirit of God who
actuates you is your helper in acting, and bears the name of helper, because
you, too, do something.&#8221; In the former member of this sentence, he reminds
us that the agency of man is not destroyed by the motion of the Holy Spirit,
because nature furnishes the will which is guided so as to aspire to good. As to
the second member of the sentence, in which he says that the very idea of help
implies that we also do something, we must not understand it as if he were
attributing to us some independent power of action; but not to foster a feeling
of sloth, he reconciles the agency of God with our own agency, by saying, that
to wish is from nature, to wish well is from grace. Accordingly, he had said a
little before, &#8220;Did not God assist us, we should not only not be able to
conquer, but not able even to fight.&#8221;<br><br>15. Hence it appears that the
grace of God (as this name is used when regeneration is spoken of) is the rule
of the Spirit, in directing and governing the human will. Govern he cannot,
without correcting, reforming, renovating (hence we say that the beginning of
regeneration consists in the abolition of what is ours); in like manner, he
cannot govern without moving, impelling, urging, and restraining. Accordingly,
all the actions which are afterwards done are truly said to be wholly his.
Meanwhile, we deny not the truth of Augustine&#8217;s doctrine, that the will is
not destroyed, but rather repaired, by grace&#8212;the two things being
perfectly consistent&#8212;viz. that the human will may be said to be renewed
when its vitiosity and perverseness being corrected, it is conformed to the true
standard of righteousness and that, at the same time, the will may be said to be
made new, being so vitiated and corrupted that its nature must be entirely
changed. There is nothing then to prevent us from saying, that our will does
what the Spirit does in us, although the will contributes nothing of itself
apart from grace. We must, therefore, remember what we quoted from Augustine,
that some men labour in vain to find in the human will some good quality
properly belonging to it. Any intermixture which men attempt to make by
conjoining the effort of their own will with divine grace is corruption, just as
when unwholesome and muddy water is used to dilute wine. But though every thing
good in the will is entirely derived from the influence of the Spirit, yet,
because we have naturally an innate power of willing, we are not improperly said
to do the things of which God claims for himself all the praise; first, because
every thing which his kindness produces in us is our own (only we must
understand that it is not of ourselves); and, secondly, because it is our mind,
our will, our study which are guided by him to what is good.<br><br>16. The other
passages which they gather together from different quarters will not give much
trouble to any person of tolerable understanding, who pays due attention to the
explanations already given. They adduce the passage of Genesis, &#8220;Unto thee
shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him,&#8221; (Gen. 4:7). This they
interpret of sin, as if the Lord were promising Cain that the dominion of sin
should not prevail over his mind, if he would labour in subduing it. We,
however, maintain that it is much more agreeable to the context to understand
the words as referring to Abel, it being there the purpose of God to point out
the injustice of the envy which Cain had conceived against his brother. And this
He does in two ways, by showing, first, that it was vain to think he could, by
means of wickedness, surpass his brother in the favour of God, by whom nothing
is esteemed but righteousness; and, secondly, how ungrateful he was for the
kindness he had already received, in not being able to bear with a brother who
had been subjected to his authority. But lest it should be thought that we
embrace this interpretation because the other is contrary to our view, let us
grant that God does here speak of sin. If so, his words contain either an order
or a promise. If an order, we have already demonstrated that this is no proof of
man&#8217;s ability; if a promise, where is the fulfilment of the promise when
Cain yielded to the sin over which he ought to have prevailed? They will allege
a tacit condition in the promise, as if it were said that he would gain the
victory if he contended. This subterfuge is altogether unavailing. For, if the
dominion spoken of refers to sin, no man can have any doubt that the form of
expression is imperative, declaring not what we are able, but what it is our
duty to do, even if beyond our ability. Although both the nature of the case,
and the rule of grammatical construction, require that it be regarded as a
comparison between Cain and Abel, we think the only preference given to the
younger brother was, that the elder made himself inferior by his own
wickedness.<br><br>17. They appeal, moreover, to the testimony of the Apostle Paul,
because he says, &#8220;It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,
but of God that showeth mercy,&#8221; (Rom. 9:15). From this they infer, that
there is something in will and endeavour, which, though weak in themselves,
still, being mercifully aided by God, are not without some measure of success.
But if they would attend in sober earnest to the subject there handled by Paul,
they would not so rashly pervert his meaning. I am aware they can quote Origin
and
Jerome<sup><font size="2">18</font><a name="fnB44" href="#fn44">[6]</a></sup> in
support of this exposition. To these I might, in my turn, oppose Augustine. But
it is of no consequence what they thought, if it is clear what Paul meant. He
teaches that salvation is prepared for those only on whom the Lord is pleased to
bestow his mercy&#8212;that ruin and death await all whom he has not chosen. He
had proved the condition of the reprobate by the example of Pharaoh, and
confirmed the certainty of gratuitous election by the passage in Moses, &#8220;I
will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.&#8221; Thereafter he concludes, that
it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth
mercy. If these words are understood to mean that the will or endeavour are not
sufficient, because unequal to such a task, the Apostle has not used them very
appropriately. We must therefore abandon this absurd mode of arguing, &#8220;It
is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth;&#8221; therefore, there is
some will, some running. Paul&#8217;s meaning is more simple&#8212;there is no
will nor running by which we can prepare the way for our salvation&#8212;it is
wholly of the divine mercy. He indeed says nothing more than he says to Titus,
when he writes, &#8220;After that the kindness and love of God our Saviour
toward man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
according to his mercy he saved us,&#8221; (Titus 3:4, 5). Those who argue that
Paul insinuated there was some will and some running when he said, &#8220;It is
not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,&#8221; would not allow me to
argue after the same fashion, that we have done some righteous works, because
Paul says that we have attained the divine favour, &#8220;not by works of
righteousness which we have done.&#8221; But if they see a flaw in this mode of
arguing, let them open their eyes, and they will see that their own mode is not
free from a similar fallacy. The argument which Augustine uses is well founded,
&#8220;If it is said, &#8216;It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that
runneth,&#8217; because neither will nor running are sufficient; it may, on the
other hand, be retorted, it is not &#8216;of God that showeth mercy,&#8217;
because mercy does not act alone,&#8221; (August. Ep. 170, ad Vital. See also
Enchirid. ad Laurent. cap. 32). This second proposition being absurd, Augustine
justly concludes the meaning of the words to be, that there is no good will in
man until it is prepared by the Lord; not that we ought not to will and run, but
that both are produced in us by God. Some, with equal unskilfulness, wrest the
saying of Paul, &#8220;We are labourers together with God,&#8221; (1 Cor. 3:9).
There cannot be a doubt that these words apply to ministers only, who are called
&#8220;labourers with God,&#8221; not from bringing any thing of their own, but
because God makes use of their instrumentality after he has rendered them fit,
and provided them with the necessary endowments.<br><br>18. They appeal also to
Ecclesiasticus, who is well known to be a writer of doubtful authority. But,
though we might justly decline his testimony, let us see what he says in support
of free will. His words are, &#8220;He himself made man from the beginning, and
left him in the hand of his counsel; If thou wilt, to keep the commandments, and
perform acceptable faithfulness. He has set fire and water before thee: stretch
forth thy hand unto whether thou wilt. Before man is life and death; and whether
him liketh shall be given him,&#8221; (Ecclesiasticus 15:14&#8211;17). Grant
that man received at his creation a power of acquiring life or death; what,
then, if we, on the other hand, can reply that he has lost it? Assuredly I have
no intention to contradict Solomon, who asserts that &#8220;God has made man
upright;&#8221; that &#8220;they have sought out many inventions,&#8221; (Eccl.
7:29). But since man, by degenerating, has made shipwreck of himself and all his
blessings, it certainly does not follow, that every thing attributed to his
nature, as originally constituted, applies to it now when vitiated and
degenerate. Therefore, not only to my opponents, but to the author of
Ecclesiasticus himself (whoever he may have been), this is my answer: If you
mean to tell man that in himself there is a power of acquiring salvation, your
authority with us is not so great as, in the least degree, to prejudice the
undoubted word of God; but if only wishing to curb the malignity of the fleshy
which by transferring the blame of its own wickedness to God, is wont to catch
at a vain defence, you say that rectitude was given to man, in order to make it
apparent he was the cause of his own destruction, I willingly assent. Only agree
with me in this, that it is by his own fault he is stript of the ornaments in
which the Lord at first attired him, and then let us unite in acknowledging that
what he now wants is a physician, and not a defender.<br><br>19. There is nothing
more frequent in their mouths than the parable of the traveller who fell among
thieves, and was left half dead (Luke 10:32). I am aware that it is a common
idea with almost all writers, that under the figure of the traveller is
represented the calamity of the human race. Hence our opponents argue that man
was not so mutilated by the robbery of sin and the devil as not to preserve some
remains of his former endowments; because it is said he was left half dead. For
where is the half living, unless some portion of right will and reason remain?
First, were I to deny that there is any room for their allegory, what could they
say? There can be no doubt that the Fathers invented it contrary to the genuine
sense of the parable. Allegories ought to be carried no further than Scripture
expressly sanctions: so far are they from forming a sufficient basis to found
doctrines upon. And were I so disposed I might easily find the means of tearing
up this fiction by the roots. The Word of God leaves no half life to man, but
teaches, that, in regard to life and happiness, he has utterly perished. Paul,
when he speaks of our redemption, says not that the half dead are cured (Eph.
2:5, 6; 5:14) but that those who were dead are raised up. He does not call upon
the half dead to receive the illumination of Christ, but upon those who are
asleep and buried. In the same way our Lord himself says, &#8220;The hour is
coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God,&#8221;
(John 5:25). How can they presume to set up a flimsy allegory in opposition to
so many clear statements? But be it that this allegory is good evidence, what
can they extort out of it? Man is half dead, therefore there is some soundness
in him. True! he has a mind capable of understanding, though incapable of
attaining to heavenly and spiritual wisdom; he has some discernment of what is
honourable; he has some sense of the Divinity, though he cannot reach the true
knowledge of God. But to what do these amount? They certainly do not refute the
doctrine of Augustine&#8212;a doctrine confirmed by the common suffrages even of
the Schoolmen, that after the fall, the free gifts on which salvation depends
were withdrawn, and natural gifts corrupted and defiled (<i>supra</i>, chap. 2
sec. 2). Let it stand, therefore, as an indubitable truth, which no engines can
shake, that the mind of man is so entirely alienated from the righteousness of
God that he cannot conceive, desire, or design any thing but what is wicked,
distorted, foul, impure, and iniquitous; that his heart is so thoroughly
envenomed by sin that it can breathe out nothing but corruption and rottenness;
that if some men occasionally make a show of goodness, their mind is ever
interwoven with hypocrisy and deceit, their soul inwardly bound with the fetters
of wickedness.<br><br><br><br></div>

faith, requires to be explained and modified. Conclusion of this discussion
concerning Christ. No saving knowledge of God in the heathen.<br><br><br><br>1. THE
whole human race having been undone in the person of Adam, the excellence and
dignity of our origin, as already described, is so far from availing us, that it
rather turns to our greater disgrace, until God, who does not acknowledge man
when defiled and corrupted by sin as his own work, appear as a Redeemer in the
person of his only begotten Son. Since our fall from life unto death, all that
knowledge of God the Creator, of which we have discoursed, would be useless,
were it not followed up by faith, holding forth God to us as a Father in Christ.
The natural course undoubtedly was, that the fabric of the world should be a
school in which we might learn piety, and from it pass to eternal life and
perfect felicity. But after looking at the perfection beheld wherever we turn
our eye, above and below, we are met by the divine malediction, which, while it
involves innocent creatures in our fault, of necessity fills our own souls with
despair. For although God is still pleased in many ways to manifest his paternal
favour towards us, we cannot, from a mere survey of the world, infer that he is
a Father. Conscience urging us within, and showing that sin is a just ground for
our being forsaken, will not allow us to think that God accounts or treats us as
sons. In addition to this are our sloth and ingratitude. Our minds are so
blinded that they cannot perceive the truth, and all our senses are so corrupt
that we wickedly rob God of his glory. Wherefore, we must conclude with Paul,
&#8220;After that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it
pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe,&#8221; (1
Cor. 1:21). By the &#8220;wisdom of God,&#8221; he designates this magnificent
theatre of heaven and earth replenished with numberless wonders, the wise
contemplation of which should have enabled us to know God. But this we do with
little profit; and, therefore, he invites us to faith in Christ,&#8212;faith
which, by a semblance of foolishness, disgusts the unbeliever. Therefore,
although the preaching of the cross is not in accordance with human wisdom, we
must, however, humbly embrace it if we would return to God our Maker, from whom
we are estranged, that he may again become our Father. It is certain that after
the fall of our first parent, no knowledge of God without a Mediator was
effectual to salvation. Christ speaks not of his own age merely, but embraces
all ages, when he says &#8220;This is life eternal that they might know thee the
only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent,&#8221; (John 17:3). The
more shameful therefore is the presumption of those who throw heaven open to the
unbelieving and profane, in the absence of that grace which Scripture uniformly
describes as the only door by which we enter into life. Should any confine our
Saviour&#8217;s words to the period subsequent to the promulgation of the
Gospel, the refutation is at hand; since on a ground common to all ages and
nations, it is declared, that those who are estranged from God, and as such, are
under the curse, the children of wrath, cannot be pleasing to God until they are
reconciled. To this we may add the answer which our Saviour gave to the
Samaritan woman &#8220;Ye worship ye know not what; we know what we worship: for
salvation is of the Jews,&#8221; (John 4:22). By these words, he both charges
every Gentile religion with falsehood, and assigns the reason&#8212;viz. that
under the Law the Redeemer was promised to the chosen people only, and that,
consequently, no worship was ever pleasing to God in which respect was not had
to Christ. Hence also Paul affirms, that all the Gentiles were &#8220;without
God,&#8221; and deprived of the hope of life. Now, since John teaches that there
was life in Christ from the beginning, and that the whole world had lost it
(John 1:4), it is necessary to return to that fountain; And, accordingly, Christ
declares that inasmuch as he is a propitiator, he is life. And, indeed, the
inheritance of heaven belongs to none but the sons of God (John 15:6). Now, it
were most incongruous to give the place and rank of sons to any who have not
been engrafted into the body of the only begotten Son. And John distinctly
testifies that those become the sons of God who believe in his name. But as it
is not my intention at present formally to discuss the subject of faith in
Christ, it is enough to have thus touched on it in passing.<br><br>2. Hence it is
that God never showed himself propitious to his ancient people, nor gave them
any hope of grace without a Mediator. I say nothing of the sacrifices of the
Law, by which believers were plainly and openly taught that salvation was not to
be found anywhere but in the expiation which Christ alone completed. All I
maintain is that the prosperous and happy state of the Church was always founded
in the person of Christ. For although God embraced the whole posterity of
Abraham in his covenant, yet Paul properly argues (Gal. 3:16), that Christ was
truly the seed in which all the nations of the earth were to be blessed, since
we know that all who were born of Abraham, according to the flesh, were not
accounted the seed. To omit Ishmael and others, how came it that of the two sons
of Isaac, the twin brothers, Esau and Jacob, while yet in the womb, the one was
chosen and the other rejected? Nay, how came it that the first-born was
rejected, and the younger alone admitted? Moreover, how happens it that the
majority are rejected? It is plain, therefore, that the seed of Abraham is
considered chiefly in one head, and that the promised salvation is not attained
without coming to Christ, whose office it is to gather together those which were
scattered abroad. Thus the primary adoption of the chosen people depended on the
grace of the Mediator. Although it is not expressed in very distinct terms in
Moses, it, however, appears to have been commonly known to all the godly. For
before a king was appointed over the Israelites, Hannah, the mother of Samuel,
describing the happiness of the righteous, speaks thus in her song, &#8220;He
shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed;&#8221;
meaning by these words, that God would bless his Church. To this corresponds the
prediction, which is afterwards added, &#8220;I will raise me up a faithful
priest, and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever,&#8221; (1 Sam. 2:10,
35). And there can be no doubt that our heavenly Father intended that a living
image of Christ should be seen in David and his posterity. Accordingly,
exhorting the righteous to fear Him, he bids them &#8220;Kiss the Son,&#8221;
(Psalm 2:12). Corresponding to this is the passage in the Gospel, &#8220;He that
honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father,&#8221; (John 5:23). Therefore,
though the kingdom was broken up by the revolt of the ten tribes, yet the
covenant which God had made in David and his successors behaved to stand, as is
also declared by his Prophets, &#8220;Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom
out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David
my servant&#8217;s sake,&#8221; (1 Kings 11:34). The same thing is repeated a
second and third time. It is also expressly said, &#8220;I will for this afflict
the seed of David, but not for ever,&#8221; (1 Kings 11:39). Some time
afterwards it was said, &#8220;Nevertheless, for David&#8217;s sake did the Lord
his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to
establish Jerusalem,&#8221; (1 Kings 15:4). And when matters were bordering on
destruction, it was again said, &#8220;Yet the Lord would not destroy Judah for
David his servant&#8217;s sake, as he had promised to give him alway a light,
and to his children,&#8221; (2 Kings 8:19).<br><br>The sum of the whole comes to
this&#8212;David, all others being excluded, was chosen to be the person in whom
the good pleasure of the Lord should dwell; as it is said elsewhere, &#8220;He
forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh;&#8221; &#8220;Moreover, he refused the
tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;&#8221; &#8220;But
chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved;&#8221; &#8220;He chose
David also his servant, and took him from the sheep folds: from following the
ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his
inheritance,&#8221; (Ps. 78:60, 67, 70, 71). In fine, God, in thus preserving
his Church, intended that its security and salvation should depend on Christ as
its head. Accordingly, David exclaims, &#8220;The Lord is their strength, and he
is the saving strength of his anointed;&#8221; and then prays &#8220;Save thy
people, and bless thine inheritance;&#8221; intimating, that the safety of the
Church was indissolubly connected with the government of Christ. In the same
sense he elsewhere says, &#8220;Save, Lord: let the king hear us when we
call,&#8221; (Ps. 20:9). These words plainly teach that believers, in applying
for the help of God, had their sole confidence in this&#8212;that they were
under the unseen government of the King. This may be inferred from another
psalm, &#8220;Save now, I beseech thee O Lord: Blessed be he that cometh in the
name of the Lord,&#8221; (Ps. 118:25, 26). Here it is obvious that believers are
invited to Christ, in the assurance that they will be safe when entirely in his
hand. To the same effect is another prayer, in which the whole Church implores
the divine mercy &#8220;Let thy hand be upon the Man of thy right hand, upon the
Son of man, whom thou madest strong (or best fitted) for thyself,&#8221; (Ps.
80:17). For though the author of the psalm laments the dispersion of the whole
nations he prays for its revival in him who is sole Head. After the people were
led away into captivity, the land laid waste, and matters to appearance
desperate, Jeremiah, lamenting the calamity of the Church, especially complains,
that by the destruction of the kingdom the hope of believers was cut off;
&#8220;The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the Lord, was taken in their
pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen,&#8221;
(Lam. 4:20). From all this it is abundantly plain, that as the Lord cannot be
propitious to the human race without a Mediator, Christ was always held forth to
the holy Fathers under the Law as the object of their faith.<br><br>3. Moreover when
comfort is promised in affliction, especially when the deliverance of the Church
is described, the banner of faith and hope in Christ is unfurled. &#8220;Thou
wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for salvation with thine
anointed,&#8221; says Habakkuk (3:13). And whenever mention is made in the
Prophets of the renovation of the Church, the people are directed to the promise
made to David, that his kingdom would be for ever. And there is nothing strange
in this, since otherwise there would have been no stability in the covenant. To
this purpose is the remarkable prophecy in Isaiah 7:14. After seeing that the
unbelieving king Ahab repudiated what he had testified regarding the deliverance
of Jerusalem from siege and its immediate safety, he passes as it were abruptly
to the Messiah, &#8220;Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall
call his name Emmanuel;&#8221; intimating indirectly, that though the king and
his people wickedly rejected the promise offered to them, as if they were bent
on causing the faith of God to fail, the covenant would not be
defeated&#8212;the Redeemer would come in his own time. In fine, all the
prophets, to show that God was placable, were always careful to bring forward
that kingdom of David, on which redemption and eternal salvation depended. Thus
in Isaiah it is said, &#8220;I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even
the sure mercies of David. Behold, I have given him for a witness to the
people,&#8221; (Isa. 55:3, 4); intimating, that believers, in calamitous
circumstances, could have no hope, had they not this testimony that God would be
ready to hear them. In the same way, to revive their drooping spirits, Jeremiah
says, &#8220;Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David
a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute
judgment and justice in the earth. In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel
shall dwell safely,&#8221; (Jer. 23:5, 6). In Ezekiel also it is said, &#8220;I
will set up one Shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant
David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd. And I the Lord will
be their God, and my servant David a prince among them: I the Lord have spoken
it. And I will make with them a covenant of peace,&#8221; (Ezek. 34:23, 24, 25).
And again, after discoursing of this wondrous renovation, he says, &#8220;David
my servant shall be king over them: and they all shall have one shepherd.&#8221;
&#8220;Moreover, I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an
everlasting covenant with them,&#8221; (Ezek. 37:24&#8211;26). I select a few
passages out of many, because I merely wish to impress my readers with the fact,
that the hope of believers was ever treasured up in Christ alone. All the other
prophets concur in this. Thus Hosea, &#8220;Then shall the children of Judah and
the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one
head,&#8221; (Hosea 1:11). This he afterwards explains in clearer terms,
&#8220;Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the Lord their
God, and David their king,&#8221; (Hosea 3:5). Micas, also speaking of the
return of the people, says expressly, &#8220;Their king shall pass before them,
and the Lord on the head of them,&#8221; (Micah 2:13). So Amos, in predicting
the renovation of the people, says &#8220;In that day will I raise up the
tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I
will raise up the ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old,&#8221; (Amos
9:11); in other words, the only banner of salvation was, the exaltation of the
family of David to regal splendour, as fulfilled in Christ. Hence, too,
Zechariah, as nearer in time to the manifestation of Christ, speaks more
plainly, &#8220;Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of
Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having
salvation,&#8221; (Zech. 9:9). This corresponds to the passage already quoted
from the Psalms, &#8220;The Lord is their strength, and he is the saving health
of their anointed.&#8221; Here salvation is extended from the head to the whole
body.<br><br>4. By familiarising the Jews with these prophecies, God intended to
teach them, that in seeking for deliverance, they should turn their eyes
directly towards Christ. And though they had sadly degenerated, they never
entirely lost the knowledge of this general principle, that God, by the hand of
Christ, would be the deliverer of the Church, as he had promised to David; and
that in this way only the free covenant by which God had adopted his chosen
people would be fulfilled. Hence it was, that on our Saviour&#8217;s entry into
Jerusalem, shortly before his death, the children shouted, &#8220;Hosannah to
the son of David,&#8221; (Mt. 21:9). For there seems to have been a hymn known
to all, and in general use, in which they sung that the only remaining pledge
which they had of the divine mercy was the promised advent of a Redeemer. For
this reason, Christ tells his disciples to believe in him, in order that they
might have a distinct and complete belief in God, &#8220;Ye believe in God,
believe also in me,&#8221; (John 14:1). For although, properly speaking, faith
rises from Christ to the Father, he intimates, that even when it leans on God,
it gradually vanishes away, unless he himself interpose to give it solid
strength. The majesty of God is too high to be scaled up to by mortals, who
creep like worms on the earth. Therefore, the common saying that God is the
object of faith (Lactantius, lib. 4 c. 16), requires to be received with some
modification. When Christ is called the image of the invisible God (Col. 1:15),
the expression is not used without cause, but is designed to remind us that we
can have no knowledge of our salvation, until we behold God in Christ. For
although the Jewish scribes had by their false glosses darkened what the
Prophets had taught concerning the Redeemer, yet Christ assumed it to be a fact,
received, as it were, with public consent, that there was no other remedy in
desperate circumstances, no other mode of delivering the Church than the
manifestation of the Mediator. It is true, that the fact adverted to by Paul was
not so generally known as it ought to have been&#8212;viz. that Christ is the
end of the Law (Rom. 10:4), though this is both true, and clearly appears both
from the Law and the Prophets. I am not now, however, treating of faith, as we
shall elsewhere have a fitter place (Book 3 Chap. 2), but what I wish to impress
upon my readers in this way is, that the first step in piety is, to acknowledge
that God is a Father, to defend, govern, and cherish us, until he brings us to
the eternal inheritance of his kingdom; that hence it is plain, as we lately
observed, there is no saving knowledge of God without Christ, and that,
consequently, from the beginning of the world Christ was held forth to all the
elect as the object of their faith and confidence. In this sense, Iren&#190;us
says, that the Father, who is boundless in himself, is bounded in the Son,
because he has accommodated himself to our capacity, lest our minds should be
swallowed up by the immensity of his glory (Irenaeus, lib. 4 cap. 8). Fanatics,
not attending to this, distort a useful sentiment into an impious
dream,<sup><font size="2">18</font><a name="fnB45" href="#fn45">[7]</a></sup> as
if Christ had only a share of the Godhead, as a part taken from a whole; whereas
the meaning merely is, that God is comprehended in Christ alone. The saying of
John was always true, &#8220;whosoever denieth the Son, the same has not the
Father,&#8221; (1 John 2:23). For though in old time there were many who boasted
that they worshipped the Supreme Deity, the Maker of heaven and earth, yet as
they had no Mediator, it was impossible for them truly to enjoy the mercy of
God, so as to feel persuaded that he was their Father. Not holding the head,
that is, Christ, their knowledge of God was evanescent; and hence they at length
fell away to gross and foul superstitions betraying their ignorance, just as the
Turks in the present day, who, though proclaiming, with full throat, that the
Creator of heaven and earth is their God, yet by their rejection of Christ,
substitute an idol in his place.<br><br><br><br></div>

<div align="center">Sections.<br><br><br><br></div>
<div>1.	 The whole system of religion delivered by the hand of Moses, in many
ways pointed to Christ. This exemplified in the case of sacrifices, ablutions,
and an endless series of ceremonies. This proved, 1. By the declared purpose of
God; 2. By the nature of the ceremonies themselves; 3. From the nature of God;
4. From the grace offered to the Jews; 5. From the consecration of the
priests.<br><br>2.	 Proof continued. 6. From a consideration of the kingdom erected
in the family of David. 7. From the end of the ceremonies. 8. From the end of
the Moral Law.<br><br>3.	 A more ample exposition of the last proof. The Moral Law
leads believers to Christ. Showing the perfect righteousness required by God, it
convinces us of our inability to fulfil it. It thus denies us life, adjudges us
to death, and so urges us to seek deliverance in Christ.<br><br>4.	 The promises of
the Law, though conditional, founded on the best reason. This reason
explained.<br><br>5.	 No inconsistency in giving a law, the observance of which is
impossible. This proved from reason, and confirmed by Scripture. Another
confirmation from Augustine.<br><br>6.	 A consideration of the office and use of the
Moral Law shows that it leads to Christ. The Law, while it describes the
righteousness which is acceptable to God, proves that every man is
unrighteous.<br><br>7.	 The Law fitly compared to a mirror, which shows us our
wretchedness. This derogates not in any degree from its excellence.<br><br>8.	 When
the Law discloses our guilt, we should not despond, but flee to the mercy of
God. How this may be done.<br><br>9.	 Confirmation of the first use of the Moral Law
from various passages in Augustine.<br><br>10.	 A second use of the Law is to curb
sinners. This most necessary for the good of the community at large; and this in
respect not only of the reprobate, but also of the elect, previous to
regeneration. This confirmed by the authority of an Apostle.<br><br>11.	 The Law
showing our wretchedness, disposes us to admit the remedy. It also tends to keep
us in our duty. Confirmation from general experience.<br><br>12.	 The third and most
appropriate use of the Law respects the elect. 1. It instructs and teaches them
to make daily progress in doing the will of God. 2. Urges them by exhortation to
obedience. Testimony of David. How he is to be reconciled with the
Apostle.<br><br>13.	 The profane heresy of the Antinomians must be exploded.
Argument founded on a passage in David, and another in Moses.<br><br>14.	 Last part
of the chapter treating of the abrogation of the Law. In what respect any part
of the Moral Law abrogated.<br><br>15.	 The curse of the Law how abrogated.<br><br>16.	
Of the abrogation of the Ceremonial Law in regard to the observance
only.<br><br>17.	 The reason assigned by the Apostle applicable not to the Moral
Law, but to ceremonial observances only. These abrogated, not only because they
separated the Jews from the Gentiles, but still more because they were a kind of
formal instruments to attest our guilt and impunity. Christ, by destroying
these, is justly said to have taken away the handwriting that was against us,
and nailed it to his cross.<br><br><br><br>1. FROM the whole course of the observations
now made, we may infer, that the Law was not superadded about four hundred years
after the death of Abraham in order that it might lead the chosen people away
from Christ, but, on the contrary, to keep them in suspense until his advent; to
inflame their desire, and confirm their expectation, that they might not become
dispirited by the long delay. By the Law, I understand not only the Ten
Commandments, which contain a complete rule of life, but the whole system of
religion delivered by the hand of Moses. Moses was not appointed as a Lawgiver,
to do away with the blessing promised to the race of Abraham; nay, we see that
he is constantly reminding the Jews of the free covenant which had been made
with their fathers, and of which they were heirs; as if he had been sent for the
purpose of renewing it. This is most clearly manifested by the ceremonies. For
what could be more vain or frivolous than for men to reconcile themselves to
God, by offering him the foul odour produced by burning the fat of beasts? or to
wipe away their own impurities by be sprinkling themselves with water or blood?
In short, the whole legal worship (if considered by itself apart from the types
and shadows of corresponding truth) is a mere mockery. Wherefore, both in
Stephen&#8217;s address (Acts 7:44), and in the Epistle to the Hebrews, great
weight is justly given to the passage in which God says to Moses, &#8220;Look
that thou make them after the pattern which was showed thee in the mount,&#8221;
(Exod. 25:40). Had there not been some spiritual end to which they were
directed, the Jews, in the observance of them, would have deluded themselves as
much as the Gentiles in their vanities. Profane men, who have never made
religion their serious study, cannot bear without disgust to hear of such a
multiplicity of rites. They not merely wonder why God fatigued his ancient
people with such a mass of ceremonies, but they despise and ridicule them as
childish toys. This they do, because they attend not to the end; from which, if
the legal figures are separated, they cannot escape the charge of vanity. But
the type shows that God did not enjoin sacrifice, in order that he might occupy
his worshippers with earthly exercises, but rather that he might raise their
minds to something higher. This is clear even from His own nature. Being a
spirit, he is delighted only with spiritual worship. The same thing is testified
by the many passages in which the Prophets accuse the Jews of stupidity, for
imagining that mere sacrifices have any value in the sight of God. Did they by
this mean to derogate in any respect from the Law? By no means; but as
interpreters of its true meaning, they wished in this way to turn the attention
of the people to the end which they ought to have had in view, but from which
they generally wandered. From the grace offered to the Jews we may certainly
infer, that the law was not a stranger to Christ. Moses declared the end of the
adoption of the Israelites to be, that they should be &#8220;a kingdom of
priests, and an holy nation,&#8221; (Exod. 19:6). This they could not attain,
without a greater and more excellent atonement than the blood of beasts. For
what could be less in accordance with reason, than that the sons of Adams who,
from hereditary taint, are all born the slaves of sin, should be raised to royal
dignity, and in this way made partakers of the glory of God, if the noble
distinction were not derived from some other source? How, moreover, could the
priestly office exist in vigour among those whose vices rendered them abominable
in the sight of God, if they were not consecrated in a holy head? Wherefore,
Peter elegantly transposes the words of Moses, teaching that the fulness of
grace, of which the Jews had a foretaste under the Law, is exhibited in Christ,
&#8220;Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood,&#8221; (1 Pet. 2:9). The
transposition of the words intimates that those to whom Christ has appeared in
the Gospel, have obtained more than their fathers, inasmuch as they are all
endued with priestly and royal honour, and can, therefore, trusting to their
Mediator, appear with boldness in the presence of God.<br><br>2. And it is to be
observed, by the way, that the kingdom, which was at length erected in the
family of David, is part of the Law, and is comprehended under the dispensation
of Moses; whence it follows, that, as well in the whole tribe of Levi as in the
posterity of David, Christ was exhibited to the eyes of the Israelites as in a
double mirror. For, as I lately observed (sec. 1), in no other way could those
who were the slaves of sin and death, and defiled with corruption, be either
kings or priests. Hence appears the perfect truth of Paul&#8217;s statement,
&#8220;The law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ,&#8221; &#8220;till
the seed should come to whom the promise was made&#8221; (Gal. 3:24, 19). For
Christ not yet having been made familiarly known to the Jews, they were like
children whose weakness could not bear a full knowledge of heavenly things. How
they were led to Christ by the ceremonial law has already been adverted to, and
may be made more intelligible by several passages in the Prophets. Although they
were required, in order to appease God, to approach him daily with new
sacrifices, yet Isaiah promises, that all their sins would be expiated by one
single sacrifice, and with this Daniel concurs (Isa. 53:5; Dan. 9:26, 27). The
priests appointed from the tribe of Levi entered the sanctuary, but it was once
said of a single priest, &#8220;The Lord has sworn, and will not repent, Thou
art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek,&#8221; (Ps. 110:4). The
unction of oil was then visible, but Daniel in vision declares that there will
be another unction. Not to dwell on this, the author of the Epistle to the
Hebrews proves clearly, and at length, from the fourth to the eleventh chapter,
that ceremonies were vain, and of no value, unless as bringing us to Christ. In
regard to the Ten Commandments, we must, in like manner, attend to the statement
of Paul, that &#8220;Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one
that believeth,&#8221; (Rom. 10:4); and, again, that ministers of the new
testament were &#8220;not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter
killeth, but the split giveth life,&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:6). The former passage
intimates, that it is in vain to teach righteousness by precept, until Christ
bestow it by free imputation, and the regeneration of the Spirit. Hence he
properly calls Christ the end or fulfilling of the Law, because it would avail
us nothing to know what God demands did not Christ come to the succour of those
who are labouring, and oppressed under an intolerable yoke and burden. In
another place, he says that the Law &#8220;was added because of
transgressions,&#8221; (Gal. 3:19), that it might humble men under a sense of
their condemnation. Moreover, inasmuch as this is the only true preparation for
Christ, the statements, though made in different words, perfectly agree with
each other. But because he had to dispute with perverse teachers, who pretended
that men merited justification by the works of the Law, he was sometimes
obliged, in refuting their error, to speak of the Law in a more restricted
sense, merely as law, though, in other respects, the covenant of free adoption
is comprehended under it.<br><br>3. But in order that a sense of guilt may urge us
to seek for pardon, it is of importance to know how our being instructed in the
Moral Law renders us more inexcusable. If it is true, that a perfect
righteousness is set before us in the Law, it follows, that the complete
observance of it is perfect righteousness in the sight of God; that is, a
righteousness by which a man may be deemed and pronounced righteous at the
divine tribunal. Wherefore Moses, after promulgating the Law, hesitates not to
call heaven and earth to witness, that he had set life and death, good and evil,
before the people. Nor can it be denied, that the reward of eternal salvation,
as promised by the Lord, awaits the perfect obedience of the Law (Deut. 30:19).
Again, however, it is of importance to understand in what way we perform that
obedience for which we justly entertain the hope of that reward. For of what use
is it to see that the reward of eternal life depends on the observance of the
Law, unless it moreover appears whether it be in our power in that way to attain
to eternal life? Herein, then, the weakness of the Law is manifested; for, in
none of us is that righteousness of the Law manifested, and, therefore, being
excluded from the promises of life, we again fall under the curse. I state not
only what happens, but what must necessarily happen. The doctrine of the Law
transcending our capacity, a man may indeed look from a distance at the promises
held forth, but he cannot derive any benefit from them. The only thing,
therefore, remaining for him is, from their excellence to form a better estimate
of his own misery, while he considers that the hope of salvation is cut off, and
he is threatened with certain death. On the other hand, those fearful
denunciations which strike not at a few individuals, but at every individual
without exceptions rise up; rise up, I say, and, with inexorable severity,
pursue us; so that nothing but instant death is presented by the Law.<br><br> 4.
Therefore, if we look merely to the Law, the result must be despondency,
confusion, and despair, seeing that by it we are all cursed and condemned, while
we are kept far away from the blessedness which it holds forth to its observers.
Is the Lord, then, you will ask, only sporting with us? Is it not the next thing
to mockery, to hold out the hope of happiness, to invite and exhort us to it, to
declare that it is set before us, while all the while the entrance to it is
precluded and quite shut up? I answer, Although the promises, in so far as they
are conditional, depend on a perfect obedience of the Law, which is nowhere to
be found, they have not, however, been given in vain. For when we have learned,
that the promises would be fruitless and unavailing, did not God accept us of
his free goodness, without any view to our works, and when, having so learned,
we, by faith, embrace the goodness thus offered in the gospel, the promises,
with all their annexed conditions, are fully accomplished. For God, while
bestowing all things upon us freely, crowns his goodness by not disdaining our
imperfect obedience; forgiving its deficiencies, accepting it as if it were
complete, and so bestowing upon us the full amount of what the Law has promised.
But as this point will be more fully discussed in treating of justification by
faith, we shall not follow it further at present.<br><br>5. What has been said as to
the impossible observance of the Law, it will be proper briefly to explain and
confirm, the general opinion being, that nothing can be more absurd. Hence
Jerome has not hesitated to denounce anathema against
it.<sup><font size="2">18</font><a name="fnB46" href="#fn46">[8]</a></sup> What
Jerome thought, I care not; let us inquire what is the truth. I will not here
enter into a long and intricate discussion on the various kinds of possibility.
By impossible, I mean, that which never was, and, being prevented by the
ordination and decree of God, never will be. I say, that if we go back to the
remotest period, we shall not find a single saint who, clothed with a mortal
body, ever attained to such perfection as to love the Lord with all his heart,
and soul, and mind, and strength; and, on the other hand, not one who has not
felt the power of concupiscence. Who can deny this? I am aware, indeed of a kind
of saints whom a foolish superstition imagines, and whose purity the angels of
heaven scarcely equal. This, however, is repugnant both to Scripture and
experience. But I say further, that no saint ever will attain to perfection, so
long as he is in the body. Scripture bears clear testimony to this effect:
&#8220;There is no man that sinneth not,&#8221; saith Solomon (1 Kings 8:46).
David says, &#8220;In thy sight shall no man living be justified,&#8221; (Psalm
143:2). Job also, in numerous passages, affirms the same thing. But the clearest
of all is Paul, who declares that &#8220;the flesh lusteth against the Spirit,
and the Spirit against the flesh,&#8221; (Gal. 5:17). And he proves, that
&#8220;as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse,&#8221; for
the simple reason, that it is written, &#8220;Cursed is every one that
continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do
them,&#8221; (Gal. 3:10; Deut. 27:26); intimating, or rather assuming it as
confessed, that none can so continue. But whatever has been declared by
Scripture must be regarded as perpetual, and hence necessary. The Pelagians
annoyed Augustine with the sophism, that it was insulting to God to hold, that
he orders more than believers are able, by his grace, to perform; and he, in
order to evade it, acknowledged that the Lord was able, if he chose, to raise a
mortal man to angelic purity; but that he had never done, and never would do it,
because so the Scripture had declared (Augustine, lib. de Nat. et Grat). This I
deny not: but I add, that there is no use in absurdly disputing concerning the
power of God in opposition to his truth; and therefore there is no ground for
cavilling, when it is said that that thing cannot be, which the Scriptures
declare will never be. But if it is the word that is objected to, I refer to the
answer which our Saviour gave to his disciples when they asked, &#8220;Who then
can be saved?&#8221; &#8220;With men,&#8221; said he, &#8220;this is impossible;
but with God all things are possible&#8221; (Mt. 19:25). Augustine argues in the
most convincing manner, that while in the flesh, we never can give God the love
which we owe him. &#8220;Love so follows knowledge, that no man can perfectly
love God who has not previously a full comprehension of his goodness,&#8221;
(Augustin. de Spiritu et Litera, towards the end, and elsewhere). So long as we
are pilgrims in the world, we see through a glass darkly, and therefore our love
is imperfect. Let it therefore be held incontrovertible, that, in consequence of
the feebleness of our nature, it is impossible for us, so long as we are in the
flesh, to fulfil the law. This will also be proved elsewhere from the writings
of Paul (Rom.
8:3).<sup><font size="2">18</font><a name="fnB47" href="#fn47">[9]</a></sup><br><br>6.
That the whole matter may be made clearer, let us take a succinct view of the
office and use of the Moral Law. Now this office and use seems to me to consist
of three parts. First, by exhibiting the righteousness of God,&#8212;in other
words, the righteousness which alone is acceptable to God,&#8212;it admonishes
every one of his own unrighteousness, certiorates, convicts, and finally
condemns him. This is necessary, in order that man, who is blind and intoxicated
with self-love, may be brought at once to know and to confess his weakness and
impurity. For until his vanity is made perfectly manifest, he is puffed up with
infatuated confidence in his own powers, and never can be brought to feel their
feebleness so long as he measures them by a standard of his own choice. So soon,
however, as he begins to compare them with the requirements of the Law, he has
something to tame his presumption. How high soever his opinion of his own powers
may be, he immediately feels that they pant under the heavy load, then totter
and stumble, and finally fall and give way. He, then, who is schooled by the
Law, lays aside the arrogance which formerly blinded him. In like manner must he
be cured of pride, the other disease under which we have said that he labours.
So long as he is permitted to appeal to his own judgment, he substitutes a
hypocritical for a real righteousness, and, contented with this, sets up certain
factitious observances in opposition to the grace of God. But after he is forced
to weigh his conduct in the balance of the Law, renouncing all dependence on
this fancied righteousness, he sees that he is at an infinite distance from
holiness, and, on the other hand, that he teems with innumerable vices of which
he formerly seemed free. The recesses in which concupiscence lies hid are so
deep and tortuous that they easily elude our view; and hence the Apostle had
good reason for saying, &#8220;I had not known lust, except the law had said,
Thou shalt not covet.&#8221; For, if it be not brought forth from its
lurkingplaces, it miserably destroys in secret before its fatal sting is
discerned.<br><br>7. Thus the Law is a kind of mirror. As in a mirror we discover
any stains upon our face, so in the Law we behold, first, our impotence; then,
in consequence of it, our iniquity; and, finally, the curse, as the consequence
of both. He who has no power of following righteousness is necessarily plunged
in the mire of iniquity, and this iniquity is immediately followed by the curse.
Accordingly, the greater the transgression of which the Law convicts us, the
severer the judgment to which we are exposed. To this effect is the
Apostle&#8217;s declaration, that &#8220;by the law is the knowledge of
sin,&#8221; (Rom. 3:20). By these words, he only points out the first office of
the Law as experienced by sinners not yet regenerated. In conformity to this, it
is said, &#8220;the law entered that the offence might abound;&#8221; and,
accordingly, that it is &#8220;the ministration of death;&#8221; that it
&#8220;worketh wrath&#8221; and kills (Rom. 5:20; 2 Cor. 3:7; Rom. 4:15). For
there cannot be a doubt that the clearer the consciousness of guilt, the greater
the increase of sin; because then to transgression a rebellious feeling against
the Lawgiver is added. All that remains for the Law, is to arm the wrath of God
for the destruction of the sinner; for by itself it can do nothing but accuse,
condemn, and destroy him. Thus Augustine says, &#8220;If the Spirit of grace be
absent, the law is present only to convict and slay
us.&#8221;<sup><font size="2">19</font><a name="fnB48" href="#fn48">[0]</a></sup>
But to say this neither insults the law, nor derogates in any degree from its
excellence. Assuredly, if our whole will were formed and disposed to obedience,
the mere knowledge of the law would be sufficient for salvation; but since our
carnal and corrupt nature is at enmity with the Divine law, and is in no degree
amended by its discipline, the consequence is, that the law which, if it had
been properly attended to, would have given life, becomes the occasion of sin
and death. When all are convicted of transgression, the more it declares the
righteousness of God, the more, on the other hand, it discloses our iniquity;
the more certainly it assures us that life and salvation are treasured up as the
reward of righteousness, the more certainly it assures us that the unrighteous
will perish. So far, however are these qualities from throwing disgrace on the
Law, that their chief tendency is to give a brighter display of the divine
goodness. For they show that it is only our weakness and depravity that prevents
us from enjoying the blessedness which the law openly sets before us. Hence
additional sweetness is given to divine grace, which comes to our aid without
the law, and additional loveliness to the mercy which confers it, because they
proclaim that God is never weary in doing good, and in loading us with new
gifts.<br><br>8. But while the unrighteousness and condemnation of all are attested
by the law, it does not follow (if we make the proper use of it) that we are
immediately to give up all hope and rush headlong on despair. No doubt, it has
some such effect upon the reprobate, but this is owing to their obstinacy. With
the children of God the effect is different. The Apostle testifies that the law
pronounces its sentence of condemnation in order &#8220;that every mouth may be
stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God,&#8221; (Rom. 3:19). In
another place, however, the same Apostle declares, that &#8220;God has concluded
them all in unbelief;&#8221; not that he might destroy all, or allow all to
perish, but that &#8220;he might have mercy upon all,&#8221; (Rom. 11:32); in
other words, that divesting themselves of an absurd opinion of their own virtue,
they may perceive how they are wholly dependent on the hand of God; that feeling
how naked and destitute they are, they may take refuge in his mercy, rely upon
it, and cover themselves up entirely with it; renouncing all righteousness and
merit, and clinging to mercy alone, as offered in Christ to all who long and
look for it in true faith. In the precepts of the law, God is seen as the
rewarder only of perfect righteousness (a righteousness of which all are
destitute), and, on the other hand, as the stern avenger of wickedness. But in
Christ his countenance beams forth full of grace and gentleness towards poor
unworthy sinners.<br><br>9. There are many passages in Augustine, as to the utility
of the law in leading us to implore Divine assistance. Thus he writes to
Hilary,<sup><font size="2">19</font><a name="fnB49" href="#fn49">[1]</a></sup>
&#8220;The law orders, that we, after attempting to do what is ordered and so
feeling our weakness under the law, may learn to implore the help of
grace.&#8221; In like manner, he writes to Asellius, &#8220;The utility of the
law is, that it convinces man of his weakness, and compels him to apply for the
medicine of grace, which is in Christ.&#8221; In like manner, he says to
Innocentius Romanus, &#8220;The law orders; grace supplies the power of
acting.&#8221; Again, to Valentinus, &#8220;God enjoins what we cannot do, in
order that we may know what we have to ask of him.&#8221; Again, &#8220;The law
was given, that it might make you guilty&#8212;being made guilty might fear;
fearing, might ask indulgence, not presume on your own strength.&#8221; Again,
&#8220;The law was given, in order to convert a great into a little man&#8212;to
show that you have no power of your own for righteousness; and might thus, poor,
needy, and destitute, flee to grace.&#8221; He afterwards thus addresses the
Almighty, &#8220;So do, O Lord, so do, O merciful Lord; command what cannot be
fulfilled; nay, command what cannot be fulfilled, unless by thy own grace: so
that when men feel they have no strength in themselves to fulfil it, every mouth
may be stopped, and no man seem great in his own eyes. Let all be little ones;
let the whole world become guilty before God.&#8221; But I am forgetting myself
in producing so many passages, since this holy man wrote a distinct treatise,
which he entitled <i>De Spiritu et Litera</i>. The other branch of this first
use he does not describe so distinctly, either because he knew that it depended
on the former, or because he was not so well aware of it, or because he wanted
words in which he might distinctly and clearly explain its proper meaning. But
even in the reprobate themselves, this first office of the law is not altogether
wanting. They do not, indeed, proceed so far with the children of God as, after
the flesh is cast down, to be renewed in the inner man, and revive again, but
stunned by the first terror, give way to despair. Still it tends to manifest the
equity of the Divine judgment, when their consciences are thus heaved upon the
waves. They would always willingly carp at the judgment of God; but now, though
that judgment is not manifested, still the alarm produced by the testimony of
the law and of their conscience bespeaks their deserts.<br><br>10. The second office
of the Law is, by means of its fearful denunciations and the consequent dread of
punishment, to curb those who, unless forced, have no regard for rectitude and
justice. Such persons are curbed not because their mind is inwardly moved and
affected, but because, as if a bridle were laid upon them, they refrain their
hands from external acts, and internally check the depravity which would
otherwise petulantly burst forth. It is true, they are not on this account
either better or more righteous in the sight of God. For although restrained by
terror or shame, they dare not proceed to what their mind has conceived, nor
give full license to their raging lust, their heart is by no means trained to
fear and obedience. Nay, the more they restrain themselves, the more they are
inflamed, the more they rage and boil, prepared for any act or outbreak
whatsoever were it not for the terror of the law. And not only so, but they
thoroughly detest the law itself, and execrate the Lawgiver; so that if they
could, they would most willingly annihilate him, because they cannot bear either
his ordering what is right, or his avenging the despisers of his Majesty. The
feeling of all who are not yet regenerate, though in some more, in others less
lively, is, that in regard to the observance of the law, they are not led by
voluntary submission, but dragged by the force of fear. Nevertheless, this
forced and extorted righteousness is necessary for the good of society, its
peace being secured by a provision but for which all things would be thrown into
tumult and confusion. Nay, this tuition is not without its use, even to the
children of God, who, previous to their effectual calling, being destitute of
the Spirit of holiness, freely indulge the lusts of the flesh. When, by the fear
of Divine vengeance, they are deterred from open outbreakings, though, from not
being subdued in mind, they profit little at present, still they are in some
measure trained to bear the yoke of righteousness, so that when they are called,
they are not like mere novices, studying a discipline of which previously they
had no knowledge. This office seems to be especially in the view of the Apostle,
when he says, &#8220;That the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the
lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and
profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for
whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for men-stealers,
for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is
contrary to sound doctrine,&#8221; (1 Tim. 1:9, 10). He thus indicates that it
is a restraint on unruly lusts that would otherwise burst all bonds.<br><br>11. To
both may be applied the declaration of the Apostle in another place, that
&#8220;The law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ,&#8221; (Gal. 3:24);
since there are two classes of persons, whom by its training it leads to Christ.
Some (of whom we spoke in the first place), from excessive confidence in their
own virtue or righteousness, are unfit to receive the grace of Christ, until
they are completely humbled. This the law does by making them sensible of their
misery, and so disposing them to long for what they previously imagined they did
not want. Others have need of a bridle to restrain them from giving full scope
to their passions, and thereby utterly losing all desire after righteousness.
For where the Spirit of God rules not, the lusts sometimes so burst forth, as to
threaten to drown the soul subjected to them in forgetfulness and contempt of
God; and so they would, did not God interpose with this remedy. Those,
therefore, whom he has destined to the inheritance of his kingdom, if he does
not immediately regenerate, he, through the works of the law, preserves in fear,
against the time of his visitation, not, indeed, that pure and chaste fear which
his children ought to have, but a fear useful to the extent of instructing them
in true piety according to their capacity. Of this we have so many proofs, that
there is not the least need of an example. For all who have remained for some
time in ignorance of God will confess, as the result of their own experience,
that the law had the effect of keeping them in some degree in the fear and
reverence of God, till, being regenerated by his Spirit, they began to love him
from the heart.<br><br>12. The third use of the Law (being also the principal use,
and more closely connected with its proper end) has respect to believers in
whose hearts the Spirit of God already flourishes and reigns. For although the
Law is written and engraven on their hearts by the finger of God, that is,
although they are so influenced and actuated by the Spirit, that they desire to
obey God, there are two ways in which they still profit in the Law. For it is
the best instrument for enabling them daily to learn with greater truth and
certainty what that will of the Lord is which they aspire to follow, and to
confirm them in this knowledge; just as a servant who desires with all his soul
to approve himself to his master, must still observe, and be careful to
ascertain his master&#8217;s dispositions, that he may comport himself in
accommodation to them. Let none of us deem ourselves exempt from this necessity,
for none have as yet attained to such a degree of wisdom, as that they may not,
by the daily instruction of the Law, advance to a purer knowledge of the Divine
will. Then, because we need not doctrine merely, but exhortation also, the
servant of God will derive this further advantage from the Law: by frequently
meditating upon it, he will be excited to obedience, and confirmed in it, and so
drawn away from the slippery paths of sin. In this way must the saints press
onward, since, however great the alacrity with which, under the Spirit, they
hasten toward righteousness, they are retarded by the sluggishness of the flesh,
and make less progress than they ought. The Law acts like a whip to the flesh,
urging it on as men do a lazy sluggish ass. Even in the case of a spiritual man,
inasmuch as he is still burdened with the weight of the flesh, the Law is a
constant stimulus, pricking him forward when he would indulge in sloth. David
had this use in view when he pronounced this high eulogium on the Law,
&#8220;The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the
Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the Lord are right,
rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the
eyes,&#8221; (Ps. 19:7, 8). Again, &#8220;Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a
light unto my path,&#8221; (Ps. 119:105). The whole psalm abounds in passages to
the same effect. Such passages are not inconsistent with those of Paul, which
show not the utility of the law to the regenerate, but what it is able of itself
to bestow. The object of the Psalmist is to celebrate the advantages which the
Lord, by means of his law, bestows on those whom he inwardly inspires with a
love of obedience. And he adverts not to the mere precepts, but also to the
promise annexed to them, which alone makes that sweet which in itself is bitter.
For what is less attractive than the law, when, by its demands and threatening,
it overawes the soul, and fills it with terror? David specially shows that in
the law he saw the Mediator, without whom it gives no pleasure or
delight.<br><br>13. Some unskilful persons, from not attending to this, boldly
discard the whole law of Moses, and do away with both its Tables, imagining it
unchristian to adhere to a doctrine which contains the ministration of death.
Far from our thoughts be this profane notion. Moses has admirably shown that the
Law, which can produce nothing but death in sinners, ought to have a better and
more excellent effect upon the righteous. When about to die, he thus addressed
the people, &#8220;Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you
this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words
of this law. For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life,&#8221;
(Deut. 32:46, 47). If it cannot be denied that it contains a perfect pattern of
righteousness, then, unless we ought not to have any proper rule of life, it
must be impious to discard it. There are not various rules of life, but one
perpetual and inflexible rule; and, therefore, when David describes the
righteous as spending their whole lives in meditating on the Law (Psalm 1:2), we
must not confine to a single age, an employment which is most appropriate to all
ages, even to the end of the world. Nor are we to be deterred or to shun its
instructions, because the holiness which it prescribes is stricter than we are
able to render, so long as we bear about the prison of the body. It does not now
perform toward us the part of a hard taskmaster, who will not be satisfied
without full payment; but, in the perfection to which it exhorts us, points out
the goal at which, during the whole course of our lives, it is not less our
interest than our duty to aim. It is well if we thus press onward. Our whole
life is a race, and after we have finished our course, the Lord will enable us
to reach that goal to which, at present, we can only aspire in wish.<br><br>14.
Since, in regard to believers, the law has the force of exhortation, not to bind
their consciences with a curse, but by urging them, from time to time, to shake
off sluggishness and chastise imperfection,&#8212;many, when they would express
this exemption from the curse, say, that in regard to believers the Law (I still
mean the Moral Law) is abrogated: not that the things which it enjoins are no
longer right to be observed, but only that it is not to believers what it
formerly was; in other words, that it does not, by terrifying and confounding
their consciences, condemn and destroy. It is certainly true that Paul shows, in
clear terms, that there is such an abrogation of the Law. And that the same was
preached by our Lord appears from this, that he would not have refuted the
opinion of his destroying the Law, if it had not been prevalent among the Jews.
Since such an opinion could not have arisen at random without some pretext,
there is reason to presume that it originated in a false interpretation of his
doctrine, in the same way in which all errors generally arise from a perversion
of the truth. But lest we should stumble against the same stone, let us
distinguish accurately between what has been abrogated in the Law, and what
still remains in force. When the Lord declares, that he came not to destroy the
Law, but to fulfil (Mt. 5:17); that until heaven and earth pass away, not one
jot or little shall remain unfulfilled; he shows that his advent was not to
derogate, in any degree, from the observance of the Law. And justly, since the
very end of his coming was to remedy the transgression of the Law. Therefore,
the doctrine of the Law has not been infringed by Christ, but remains, that, by
teaching, admonishing, rebuking, and correcting, it may fit and prepare us for
every good work.<br><br>15. What Paul says, as to the abrogation of the Law,
evidently applies not to the Law itself, but merely to its power of constraining
the conscience. For the Law not only teaches, but also imperiously demands. If
obedience is not yielded, nay, if it is omitted in any degree, it thunders forth
its curse. For this reason, the Apostle says, that &#8220;as many as are of the
works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one
that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do
them,&#8221; (Gal. 3:10; Deut. 27:26). Those he describes as under the works of
the Law, who do not place righteousness in that forgiveness of sins by which we
are freed from the rigour of the Law. He therefore shows, that we must be freed
from the fetters of the Law, if we would not perish miserably under them. But
what fetters? Those of rigid and austere exaction, which remits not one iota of
the demand, and leaves no transgression unpunished. To redeem us from this
curse, Christ was made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one
that hangeth on a tree (Deut. 21:23, compared with Gal. 3:13, 4:4). In the
following chapter, indeed, he says, that &#8220;Christ was made under the law,
in order that he might redeem those who are under the law;&#8221; but the
meaning is the same. For he immediately adds, &#8220;That we might receive the
adoption of sons.&#8221; What does this mean? That we might not be, all our
lifetime, subject to bondage, having our consciences oppressed with the fear of
death. Meanwhile, it must ever remain an indubitable truth, that the Law has
lost none of its authority, but must always receive from us the same respect and
obedience.<br><br>16. The case of ceremonies is different, these having been
abrogated not in effect but in use only. Though Christ by his advent put an end
to their use, so far is this from derogating from their sacredness, that it
rather commends and illustrates it. For as these ceremonies would have given
nothing to God&#8217;s ancient people but empty show, if the power of
Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection had not been prefigured by them,&#8212;so,
if the use of them had not ceased, it would, in the present day, be impossible
to understand for what purpose they were instituted. Accordingly, Paul, in order
to prove that the observance of them was not only superfluous, but pernicious
also, says that they &#8220;are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of
Christ,&#8221; (Col. 2:17). We see, therefore, that the truth is made clearer by
their abolition than if Christ, who has been openly manifested, were still
figured by them as at a distance, and as under a veil. By the death of Christ,
the veil of the temple was rent in vain, the living and express image of
heavenly things, which had begun to be dimly shadowed forth, being now brought
fully into view, as is described by the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews
(Heb. 10:1). To the same effect, our Saviour declares, that &#8220;the law and
the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached,
and every man presseth into it,&#8221; (Luke 16:16); not that the holy fathers
were left without the preaching of the hope of salvation and eternal life, but
because they only saw at a distance, and under a shadow, what we now behold in
full light. Why it behaved the Church to ascend higher than these elements, is
explained by John the Baptist, when he says, &#8220;The law was given by Moses,
but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ,&#8221; (John 1:17). For though it is
true that expiation was promised in the ancient sacrifices, and the ark of the
covenant was a sure pledge of the paternal favour of God, the whole would have
been delusory had it not been founded on the grace of Christ, wherein true and
eternal stability is found. It must be held as a fixed point, that though legal
rites ceased to be observed, their end serves to show more clearly how great
their utility was before the advent of Christ, who, while he abolished the use,
sealed their force and effect by his death.<br><br>17. There is a little more
difficulty in the following passage of Paul: &#8220;You, being dead in your sins
and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having
forgiven you all trespasses; blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was
against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to
his cross,&#8221; &amp;c. (Col. 2:13, 14). He seems to extend the abolition of
the Law considerably farther, as if we had nothing to do with its injunctions.
Some err in interpreting this simply of the Moral Law, as implying the abolition
not of its injunctions, but of its inexorable rigour. Others examining
Paul&#8217;s words more carefully, see that they properly apply to the
Ceremonial Law, and show that Paul repeatedly uses the term <i>ordinance</i> in
this sense. He thus writes to the Ephesians: &#8220;He is our peace, who has
made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;
having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained
in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man,&#8221; (Eph. 2:14).
There can be no doubt that he is there treating of ceremonies, as he speaks of
&#8220;the middle wall of partition&#8221; which separated Jews and Gentiles. I
therefore hold that the former view is erroneous; but, at the same time, it does
not appear to me that the latter comes fully up to the Apostle&#8217;s meaning.
For I cannot admit that the two passages are perfectly parallel. As his object
was to assure the Ephesians that they were admitted to fellowship with the Jews,
he tells them that the obstacle which formerly stood in the way was removed.
This obstacle was in the ceremonies. For the rites of ablution and sacrifice, by
which the Jews were consecrated to the Lord, separated them from the Gentiles.
But who sees not that, in the Epistle to the Colossians, a sublimer mystery is
adverted to? No doubt, a question is raised there as to the Mosaic observances,
to which false apostles were endeavouring to bind the Christian people. But as
in the Epistle to the Galatians he takes a higher view of this controversy, and
in a manner traces it to its fountain, so he does in this passage also. For if
the only thing considered in rites is the necessity of observing them, of what
use was it to call it a handwriting which was contrary to us? Besides, how could
the bringing in of it be set down as almost the whole sum of redemption?
Wherefore, the very nature of the case clearly shows that reference is here made
to something more internal. I cannot doubt that I have ascertained the genuine
interpretation, provided I am permitted to assume what Augustine has somewhere
most truly affirmed, nay, derived from the very words of the Apostle&#8212;viz.
that in the Jewish ceremonies there was more a confession than an expiation of
sins. For what more was done in sacrifice by those who substituted purifications
instead of themselves, than to confess that they were conscious of deserving
death? What did these purifications testify but that they themselves were
impure? By these means, therefore, the handwriting both of their guilt and
impurity was ever and anon renewed. But the attestation of these things was not
the removal of them. Wherefore, the Apostle says that Christ is &#8220;the
mediator of the new testament,&#8212;by means of death, for the redemption of
the transgressions that were under the first testament,&#8221; (Heb. 9:15).
Justly, therefore, does the Apostle describe these handwritings as against the
worshipers, and contrary to them, since by means of them their impurity and
condemnation were openly sealed. There is nothing contrary to this in the fact
that they were partakers of the same grace with ourselves. This they obtained
through Christ, and not through the ceremonies which the Apostle there contrasts
with Christ, showing that by the continued use of them the glory of Christ was
obscured. We perceive how ceremonies, considered in themselves, are elegantly
and appositely termed handwritings, and contrary to the salvation of man, in as
much as they were a kind of formal instruments which attested his liability. On
the other hand, when false apostles wished to bind them on the Christian Church,
Paul, entering more deeply into their signification, with good reason warned the
Colossians how seriously they would relapse if they allowed a yoke to be in that
way imposed upon them. By so doing, they, at the same time, deprived themselves
of all benefit from Christ, who, by his eternal sacrifice once offered, had
abolished those daily sacrifices, which were indeed powerful to attest sin, but
could do nothing to destroy it.<br><br><br><br></div>

<div>1.	 The Law was committed to writing, in order that it might teach more
fully and perfectly that knowledge, both of God and of ourselves, which the law
of nature teaches meagrely and obscurely. Proof of this, from an enumeration of
the principal parts of the Moral Law; and also from the dictate of natural law,
written on the hearts of all, and, in a manner, effaced by sin.<br><br>2.	 Certain
general maxims. 1. From the knowledge of God, furnished by the Law, we learn
that God is our Father and Ruler. Righteousness is pleasing, iniquity is an
abomination in his sight. Hence, how weak soever we may be, our duty is to
cultivate the one, and shun the other.<br><br>3.	 From the knowledge of ourselves,
furnished by the Law, we learn to discern our own utter powerlessness, we are
ashamed; and seeing it is in vain to seek for righteousness in ourselves, are
induced to seek it elsewhere.<br><br>4.	 Hence, God has annexed promises and
threatening to his promises. These not limited to the present life, but embrace
things heavenly and eternal. They, moreover, attest the spotless purity of God,
his love of righteousness, and also his kindness towards us.<br><br>5.	 The Law
shows, moreover, that there is nothing more acceptable to God than obedience.
Hence, all superstitious and hypocritical modes of worship are condemned. A
remedy against superstitious worship and human presumption.<br><br>6.	 The second
part of the chapter, containing three observations or rules. First rule, Our
life must be formed by the Law, not only to external honesty, but to inward and
spiritual righteousness. In this respect, the Law of God differs from civil
laws, he being a spiritual Lawgiver, man not. This rule of great extent, and not
sufficiently attended to.<br><br>7.	 This first rule confirmed by the authority of
Christ, and vindicated from the false dogma of Sophists, who say that Christ is
only another Moses.<br><br>8.	 Second observation or rule to be carefully attended
to&#8212;viz. that the end of the command must be inquired into, until it is
ascertained what the Lawgiver approves or disapproves. Example. Where the Law
approves, its opposite is condemned, and <i>vice versa</i>.<br><br>9.	 Full
explanation of this latter point. Example.<br><br>10.	 The Law states what is most
impious in each transgression, in order to show how heinous the transgression
is. Example.<br><br>11.	 Third observation or rule regards the division of the Law
into Two Tables: the former comprehending our duty to God; the latter, our duty
to our neighbour. The connection between these necessary and inseparable. Their
invariable order. Sum of the Law.<br><br>12.	 Division of the Law into Ten
Commandments. Various distinctions made with regard to them, but the best
distinction that which divides them into Two Tables. Four commandments belong to
the First, and six to the Second Table.<br><br>13.	 The third part of the chapter,
containing an exposition of the Decalogue. The preface vindicates the authority
of the Law. This it does in three ways. First, by a declaration of its
majesty.<br><br>14.	 The preface to the Law vindicates its authority. Secondly, by
calling to mind God&#8217;s paternal kindness.<br><br>15.	 Thirdly, by calling to
mind the deliverance out of the land of Egypt. Why God distinguishes himself by
certain epithets. Why mention is made of the deliverance from Egypt. In what
way, and how far, the remembrance of this deliverance should still affect
us.<br><br>16.	 Exposition of the First Commandment. Its end. What it is to have
God, and to have strange gods. Adoration due to God, trust, invocation,
thanksgiving, and also true religion, required by the Commandment. Superstition,
Polytheism, and Atheism, forbidden. What meant by the words, &#8220;before
me.&#8221;<br><br>17.	 Exposition of the Second Commandment. The end and sum of it.
Two parts. Short enumeration of forbidden shapes.<br><br>18.	 Why a threatening is
added. Four titles applied to God, to make a deeper impression. He is called
Mighty, Jealous, an Avenger, Merciful. Why said to be jealous. Reason drawn from
analogy.<br><br>19.	 Exposition of the threatening which is added. First, as to
visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children. A misinterpretation on
this head refuted, and the genuine meaning of the threatening explained.<br><br>20.	
Whether this visiting of the sins of parents inconsistent with the divine
justice. Apparently conflicting passages reconciled.<br><br>21.	 Exposition of the
latter part&#8212;viz. the showing mercy to thousands. The use of this promise.
Consideration of an exception of frequent occurrence. The extent of this
blessing.<br><br>22.	 Exposition of the Third Commandment. The end and sum of it.
Three parts. These considered. What it is to use the name of God in vain.
Swearing. Distinction between this commandment and the Ninth.<br><br>23.	 An oath
defined. It is a species of divine worship. This explained.<br><br>24.	 Many modes
in which this commandment is violated. 1. By taking God to witness what we know
is false. The insult thus offered.<br><br>25.	 Modes of violation continued. 2.
Taking God to witness in trivial matters. Contempt thus shown. When and how an
oath should be used. 3. Substituting the servants of God instead of himself when
taking an oath.<br><br>26.	 The Anabaptists, who condemn all oaths, refuted. 1. By
the authority of Christ, who cannot be opposed in anything to the Father. A
passage perverted by the Anabaptists explained. The design of our Saviour in the
passage. What meant by his there prohibiting oaths.<br><br>27.	 The lawfulness of
oaths confirmed by Christ and the apostles. Some approve of public, but not of
private oaths. The lawfulness of the latter proved both by reason and example.
Instances from Scripture.<br><br>28.	 Exposition of the Fourth Commandment. Its end.
Three purposes.<br><br>29.	 Explanation of the first purpose&#8212;viz. a shadowing
forth of spiritual rest. This the primary object of the precept. God is therein
set forth as our sanctifier; and hence we must abstain from work, that the work
of God in us may not be hindered.<br><br>30.	 The number seven denoting perfection
in Scripture, this commandment may, in that respect, denote the perpetuity of
the Sabbath, and its completion at the last day.<br><br>31.	 Taking a simpler view
of the commandment, the number is of no consequence, provided we maintain the
doctrine of a perpetual rest from all our works, and, at the same time, avoid a
superstitious observance of days. The ceremonial part of the commandment
abolished by the advent of Christ.<br><br>32.	 The second and third purposes of the
Commandment explained. These twofold and perpetual. This confirmed. Of religious
assemblies.<br><br>33.	 Of the observance of the Lord&#8217;s day, in answer to
those who complain that the Christian people are thus trained to Judaism.
Objection.<br><br>34.	 Ground of this institution. There is no kind of superstitious
necessity. The sum of the Commandment.<br><br>35.	 The Fifth Commandment (the first
of the Second Table), expounded. Its end and substance. How far honour due to
parents. To whom the term <i>father</i> applies.<br><br>36.	 It makes no difference
whether those to whom this honour is required are worthy or unworthy. The honour
is claimed especially for parents. It consists of three parts. 1.
Reverence.<br><br>37.	 Honour due to parents continued. 2. Obedience. 3. Gratitude.
Why a promise added. In what sense it is to be taken. The present life a
testimony of divine blessing. The reservation considered and explained.<br><br>38.	
Conversely a curse denounced on disobedient children. How far obedience due to
parents, and those in the place of parents.<br><br>39.	 Sixth Commandment expounded.
Its end and substance. God, as a spiritual Lawgiver, forbids the murder of the
heart, and requires a sincere desire to preserve the life of our
neighbour.<br><br>40.	 A twofold ground for this Commandment. 1. Man is the image of
God. 2. He is our flesh.<br><br>41.	 Exposition of the Seventh Command. The end and
substance of it. Remedy against fornication.<br><br>42.	 Continence an excellent
gift, when under the control of God only. Altogether denied to some; granted
only for a time to others. Argument in favour of celibacy refuted.<br><br>43.	 Each
individual may refrain from marriage so long as he is fit to observe celibacy.
True celibacy, and the proper use of it. Any man not gifted with continence wars
with God and with nature, as constituted by him, in remaining unmarried.
Chastity defined.<br><br>44.	 Precautions to be observed in married life. Everything
repugnant to chastity here condemned.<br><br>45.	 Exposition of the Eighth
Commandment. Its end and substance. Four kinds of theft. The bad acts condemned
by this Commandment. Other peculiar kinds of theft.<br><br>46.	 Proper observance of
this Commandment. Four heads. Application. 1. To the people and the magistrate.
2. To the pastors of the Church and their flocks. 3. To parents and children. 4.
To the old and the young. 5. To servants and masters. 6. To individuals.<br><br>47.	
Exposition of the ninth Commandment. Its end and substance. The essence of the
Commandment&#8212;detestation of falsehood, and the pursuit of truth. Two kinds
of falsehood. Public and private testimony. The equity of this
Commandment.<br><br>48.	 How numerous the violations of this Commandment. 1. By
detraction. 2. By evil speaking&#8212;a thing contrary to the offices of
Christian charity. 3. By scurrility or irony. 4. By prying curiosity, and
proneness to harsh judgments.<br><br>49.	 Exposition of the Tenth Commandment. Its
end and substance. What meant by the term <i>Covetousness</i>. Distinction
between counsel and the covetousness here condemned.<br><br>50.	 Why God requires so
much purity. Objection. Answer. Charity toward our neighbour here principally
commended. Why house, wife, man-servant, maid-servant, ox, and ass, &amp;c., are
mentioned. Improper division of this Commandment into two.<br><br>51.	 The last part
of the chapter. The end of the Law. Proof. A summary of the Ten Commandments.
The Law delivers not merely rudiments and first principles, but a perfect
standard of righteousness, modelled on the divine purity.<br><br>52.	 Why, in the
Gospels and Epistles, the latter table only mentioned, and not the first. The
same thing occurs in the Prophets.<br><br>53.	 An objection to what is said in the
former section removed.<br><br>54.	 A conduct duly regulated by the divine Law,
characterised by charity toward our neighbour. This subverted by those who give
the first place to self-love. Refutation of their opinion.<br><br>55.	 Who our
neighbour. Double error of the Schoolmen on this point.<br><br>56.	 This error
consists, I. In converting precepts into counsels to be observed by
monks.<br><br>57.	 Refutation of this error from Scripture and the ancient
Theologians. Sophistical objection obviated.<br><br>58.	 Error of the Schoolmen
consists, II. In calling hidden impiety and covetousness venial sins. Refutation
drawn, 1. From a consideration of the whole Decalogue. 2. The testimony of an
Apostle. 3. The authority of Christ. 4. The nature and majesty of God. 5. The
sentence pronounced against sin. Conclusion.<br><br>59.	 Refutation drawn, 1. From a
consideration of the whole Decalogue. 2. The testimony of an Apostle. 3. The
authority of Christ. 4. The nature and majesty of God. 5. The sentence
pronounced against sin. Conclusion.<br><br><br><br>1. I BELIEVE it will not be out of
place here to introduce the Ten Commandments of the Law, and give a brief
exposition of them. In this way it will be made more clear, that the worship
which God originally prescribed is still in force (a point to which I have
already adverted); and then a second point will be confirmed&#8212;viz. that the
Jews not only learned from the law wherein true piety consisted, but from
feeling their inability to observe it were overawed by the fear of judgments and
so drawn, even against their will, towards the Mediator. In giving a summary of
what constitutes the true knowledge of
God,<sup><font size="2">19</font><a name="fnB50" href="#fn50">[2]</a></sup> we
showed that we cannot form any just conception of the character of God, without
feeling overawed by his majesty, and bound to do him service. In regard to the
knowledge of ourselves, we showed that it principally consists in renouncing all
idea of our own strength, and divesting ourselves of all confidence in our own
righteousness, while, on the other hand, under a full consciousness of our
wants, we learn true humility and self-abasement. Both of these the Lord
accomplishes by his Law, first, when, in assertion of the right which he has to
our obedience, he calls us to reverence his majesty, and prescribes the conduct
by which this reverence is manifested; and, secondly, when, by promulgating the
rule of his justice (a rule, to the rectitude of which our nature, from being
depraved and perverted, is continually opposed, and to the perfection of which
our ability, from its infirmity and nervelessness for good, is far from being
able to attain), he charges us both with impotence and unrighteousness.
Moreover, the very things contained in the two tables are, in a manner, dictated
to us by that internal law, which, as has been already said, is in a manner
written and stamped on every heart. For conscience, instead of allowing us to
stifle our perceptions, and sleep on without interruption, acts as an inward
witness and monitor, reminds us of what we owe to God, points out the
distinction between good and evil, and thereby convicts us of departure from
duty. But man, being immured in the darkness of error, is scarcely able, by
means of that natural law, to form any tolerable idea of the worship which is
acceptable to God. At all events, he is very far from forming any correct
knowledge of it. In addition to this, he is so swollen with arrogance and
ambition, and so blinded with self-love, that he is unable to survey, and, as it
were, descend into himself, that he may so learn to humble and abase himself,
and confess his misery. Therefore, as a necessary remedy, both for our dullness
and our contumacy, the Lord has given us his written Law, which, by its sure
attestations, removes the obscurity of the law of nature, and also, by shaking
off our lethargy, makes a more lively and permanent impression on our
minds.<br><br>2. It is now easy to understand the doctrine of the law&#8212;viz.
that God, as our Creator, is entitled to be regarded by us as a Father and
Master, and should, accordingly, receive from us fear, love, reverence, and
glory; nay, that we are not our own, to follow whatever course passion dictates,
but are bound to obey him implicitly, and to acquiesce entirely in his good
pleasure. Again, the Law teaches, that justice and rectitude are a delight,
injustice an abomination to him, and, therefore, as we would not with impious
ingratitude revolt from our Maker, our whole life must be spent in the
cultivation of righteousness. For if we manifest becoming reverence only when we
prefer his will to our own, it follows, that the only legitimate service to him
is the practice of justice, purity, and holiness. Nor can we plead as an excuse,
that we want the power, and, like debtors, whose means are exhausted, are unable
to pay. We cannot be permitted to measure the glory of God by our ability;
whatever we may be, he ever remains like himself, the friend of righteousness,
the enemy of unrighteousness, and whatever his demands from us may be, as he can
only require what is right, we are necessarily under a natural obligation to
obey. Our inability to do so is our own fault. If lust, in which sin has its
dominion, so enthrals us, that we are not free to obey our Father, there is no
ground for pleading necessity as a defence, since this evil necessity is within,
and must be imputed to ourselves.<br><br>3. When, under the guidance of the Law, we
have advanced thus far, we must, under the same guidance, proceed to descend
into ourselves. In this way, we at length arrive at two results: First,
contrasting our conduct with the righteousness of the Law, we see how very far
it is from being in accordance with the will of God, and, therefore, how
unworthy we are of holding our place among his creatures, far less of being
accounted his sons; and, secondly, taking a survey of our powers, we see that
they are not only unequal to fulfil the Law, but are altogether null. The
necessary consequence must be, to produce distrust of our own ability, and also
anxiety and trepidation of mind. Conscience cannot feel the burden of its guilt,
without forthwith turning to the judgment of God, while the view of this
judgment cannot fail to excite a dread of death. In like manner, the proofs of
our utter powerlessness must instantly beget despair of our own strength. Both
feelings are productive of humility and abasement, and hence the sinner,
terrified at the prospect of eternal death (which he sees justly impending over
him for his iniquities), turns to the mercy of God as the only haven of safety.
Feeling his utter inability to pay what he owes to the Law, and thus despairing
of himself, he rethinks him of applying and looking to some other quarter for
help.<br><br>4. But the Lord does not count it enough to inspire a reverence for his
justice. To imbue our hearts with love to himself, and, at the same time, with
hatred to iniquity, he has added promises and threatening. The eye of our mind
being too dim to be attracted by the mere beauty of goodness, our most merciful
Father has been pleased, in his great indulgence, to allure us to love and long
after it by the hope of reward. He accordingly declares that rewards for virtue
are treasured up with him, that none who yield obedience to his commands will
labour in vain. On the other hand, he proclaims not only that iniquity is
hateful in his sight, but that it will not escape with impunity, because he will
be the avenger of his insulted majesty. That he may encourage us in every way,
he promises present blessings, as well as eternal felicity, to the obedience of
those who shall have kept his commands, while he threatens transgressors with
present suffering, as well as the punishment of eternal death. The promise,
&#8220;Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments; which if a man do,
he shall live in them,&#8221; (Lev. 18:5), and corresponding to this the
threatening, &#8220;The souls that sinneth, it shall die,&#8221; (Ezek. 18:4,
20); doubtless point to a future life and death, both without end. But though in
every passage where the favour or anger of God is mentioned, the former
comprehends eternity of life and the latter eternal destruction, the Law, at the
same time, enumerates a long catalogue of present blessings and curses (Lev.
26:4; Deut. 28:1). The threatening attest the spotless purity of God, which
cannot bear iniquity, while the promises attest at once his infinite love of
righteousness (which he cannot leave unrewarded), and his wondrous kindness.
Being bound to do him homage with all that we have, he is perfectly entitled to
demand everything which he requires of us as a debt; and as a debt, the payment
is unworthy of reward. He therefore foregoes his right, when he holds forth
reward for services which are not offered spontaneously, as if they were not
due. The amount of these services, in themselves, has been partly described and
will appear more clearly in its own place. For the present, it is enough to
remember that the promises of the Law are no mean commendation of righteousness
as they show how much God is pleased with the observance of them, while the
threatening denounced are intended to produce a greater abhorrence of
unrighteousness, lest the sinner should indulge in the blandishments of vice,
and forget the judgment which the divine Lawgiver has prepared for him.<br><br>5.
The Lord, in delivering a perfect rule of righteousness, has reduced it in all
its parts to his mere will, and in this way has shown that there is nothing more
acceptable to him than obedience. There is the more necessity for attending to
this, because the human mind, in its wantonness, is ever and anon inventing
different modes of worship as a means of gaining his favour. This irreligious
affectation of religion being innate in the human mind, has betrayed itself in
every age, and is still doing so, men always longing to devise some method of
procuring righteousness without any sanction from the Word of
God.<sup><font size="2">19</font><a name="fnB51" href="#fn51">[3]</a></sup>
Hence in those observances which are generally regarded as good works, the
precepts of the Law occupy a narrow space, almost the whole being usurped by
this endless host of human inventions. But was not this the very license which
Moses meant to curb, when, after the promulgation of the Law, he thus addressed
the people: &#8220;Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that
it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou
does that which is good and right in the sight of the Lord thy God.&#8221;
&#8220;What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add
thereto, nor diminish from it,&#8221; (Deut 12:28&#8211;32). Previously, after
asking &#8220;what nation is there so great, that has statutes and judgments so
righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?&#8221; he had added,
&#8220;Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget
the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all
the days of thy life,&#8221; (Deut. 4:8, 9). God foreseeing that the Israelites
would not rest, but after receiving the Law, would, unless sternly prohibited
give birth to new kinds of righteousness, declares that the Law comprehended a
perfect righteousness. This ought to have been a most powerful restraint, and
yet they desisted not from the presumptuous course so strongly prohibited. How
do we act? We are certainly under the same obligation as they were; for there
cannot be a doubt that the claim of absolute perfection which God made for his
Law is perpetually in force. Not contented with it, however, we labour
prodigiously in feigning and coining an endless variety of good works, one after
another. The best cure for this vice would be a constant and deep-seated
conviction that the Law was given from heaven to teach us a perfect
righteousness; that the only righteousness so taught is that which the divine
will expressly enjoins; and that it is, therefore, vain to attempt, by new forms
of worship, to gain the favour of God, whose true worship consists in obedience
alone; or rather, that to go a wandering after good works which are not
prescribed by the Law of God, is an intolerable violation of true and divine
righteousness. Most truly does Augustine say in one place, that the obedience
which is rendered to God is the parent and guardian; in another, that it is the
source of all the
virtues.<sup><font size="2">19</font><a name="fnB52" href="#fn52">[4]</a></sup><br><br>6.
After we shall have expounded the Divine Law, what has been previously said of
its office and use will be understood more easily, and with greater benefit. But
before we proceed to the consideration of each separate commandment, it will be
proper to take a general survey of the whole. At the outset, it was proved that
in the Law human life is instructed not merely in outward decency but in inward
spiritual righteousness. Though none can deny this, yet very few duly attend to
it, because they do not consider the Lawgiver, by whose character that of the
Law must also be determined. Should a king issue an edict prohibiting murder,
adultery, and theft, the penalty, I admit, will not be incurred by the man who
has only felt a longing in his mind after these vices, but has not actually
committed them. The reason is, that a human lawgiver does not extend his care
beyond outward order, and, therefore, his injunctions are not violated without
outward acts. But God, whose eye nothing escapes, and who regards not the
outward appearance so much as purity of heart, under the prohibition of murder,
adultery, and thefts includes wrath, hatred, lust, covetousness, and all other
things of a similar nature. Being a spiritual Lawgiver, he speaks to the soul
not less than the body. The murder which the soul commits is wrath and hatred;
the theft, covetousness and avarice; and the adultery, lust. It may be alleged
that human laws have respect to intentions and wishes, and not fortuitous
events. I admit this but then these must manifest themselves externally. They
consider the <i>animus</i> with which the act was done, but do not scrutinise
the secret thoughts. Accordingly, their demand is satisfied when the hand merely
refrains from transgression. On the contrary, the law of heaven being enacted
for our minds, the first thing necessary to a due observance of the Law is to
put them under restraint. But the generality of men, even while they are most
anxious to conceal their disregard of the Law, only frame their hands and feet
and other parts of their body to some kind of observance, but in the meanwhile
keep the heart utterly estranged from everything like obedience. They think it
enough to have carefully concealed from man what they are doing in the sight of
God. Hearing the commandments, &#8220;Thou shalt not kill,&#8221; &#8220;Thou
shalt not commit adultery,&#8221; &#8220;Thou shalt not steal,&#8221; they do
not unsheathe their sword for slaughter, nor defile their bodies with harlots,
nor put forth their hands to other men&#8217;s goods. So far well; but with
their whole soul they breathe out slaughter, boil with lust, cast a greedy eye
at their neighbour&#8217;s property, and in wish devour it. Here the principal
thing which the Law requires is wanting. Whence then, this gross stupidity, but
just because they lose sight of the Lawgiver, and form an idea of righteousness
in accordance with their own disposition? Against this Paul strenuously
protests, when he declares that the &#8220;<i>law is spiritual</i>&#8221; (Rom.
7:14); intimating that it not only demands the homage of the soul, and mind, and
will, but requires an angelic purity, which, purified from all filthiness of the
flesh, savours only of the Spirit.<br><br>7. In saying that this is the meaning of
the Law, we are not introducing a new interpretation of our own; we are
following Christ, the best interpreter of the Law (Mt. 5:22, 28, 44). The
Pharisees having instilled into the people the erroneous idea that the Law was
fulfilled by every one who did not in external act do anything against the Law,
he pronounces this a most dangerous delusion, and declares that an immodest look
is adultery, and that hatred of a brother is murder. &#8220;Whosoever is angry
with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of the judgment;&#8221;
whosoever by whispering or murmuring gives indication of being offended,
&#8220;shall be in danger of the council;&#8221; whosoever by reproaches and
evil-speaking gives way to open anger, &#8220;shall be in danger of
hell-fire.&#8221; Those who have not perceived this, have pretended that Christ
was only a second Moses, the giver of an evangelical, to supply the deficiency
of the Mosaic Law. Hence the common axiom as to the perfection of the
Evangelical Law, and its great superiority to that of Moses. This idea is in
many ways most pernicious. For it will appear from Moses himself, when we come
to give a summary of his precepts, that great indignity is thus done to the
Divine Law. It certainly insinuates, that the holiness of the fathers under the
Law was little else than hypocrisy, and leads us away from that one unvarying
rule of righteousness. It is very easy, however, to confute this error, which
proceeds on the supposition that Christ added to the Law, whereas he only
restored it to its integrity by maintaining and purifying it when obscured by
the falsehood, and defiled by the leaven of the Pharisees.<br><br>8. The next
observation we would make is, that there is always more in the requirements and
prohibitions of the Law than is expressed in words. This, however, must be
understood so as not to convert it into a kind of Lesbian
code;<sup><font size="2">19</font><a name="fnB53" href="#fn53">[5]</a></sup> and
thus, by licentiously wresting the Scriptures, make them assume any meaning that
we please. By taking this excessive liberty with Scripture, its authority is
lowered with some, and all hope of understanding it abandoned by others. We
must, therefore, if possible, discover some path which may conduct us with
direct and firm step to the will of God. We must consider, I say, how far
interpretation can be permitted to go beyond the literal meaning of the words,
still making it apparent that no appending of human glosses is added to the
Divine Law, but that the pure and genuine meaning of the Lawgiver is faithfully
exhibited. It is true that, in almost all the commandments, there are elliptical
expressions, and that, therefore, any man would make himself ridiculous by
attempting to restrict the spirit of the Law to the strict letter of the words.
It is plain that a sober interpretation of the Law must go beyond these, but how
far is doubtful, unless some rule be adopted. The best rule, in my opinion,
would be, to be guided by the principle of the commandment&#8212;viz. to
consider in the case of each what the purpose is for which it was given. For
example, every commandment either requires or prohibits; and the nature of each
is instantly discerned when we look to the principle of the commandment as its
end. Thus, the end of the Fifth Commandment is to render honour to those on whom
God bestows it. The sum of the commandment, therefore, is, that it is right in
itself, and pleasing to God, to honour those on whom he has conferred some
distinction; that to despise and rebel against such persons is offensive to Him.
The principle of the First Commandment is, that God only is to be worshipped.
The sum of the commandment, therefore is that true piety, in other words, the
worship of the Deity, is acceptable, and impiety is an abomination, to him. So
in each of the commandments we must first look to the matter of which it treats,
and then consider its end, until we discover what it properly is that the
Lawgiver declares to be pleasing or displeasing to him. Only, we must reason
from the precept to its contrary in this way: If this pleases God, its opposite
displeases; if that displeases, its opposite pleases: if God commands this, he
forbids the opposite; if he forbids that, he commands the opposite.<br><br>9. What
is now touched on somewhat obscurely will become perfectly clear as we proceed
and get accustomed to the exposition of the Commandments. It is sufficient thus
to have adverted to the subject; but perhaps our concluding statement will
require to be briefly confirmed, as it might otherwise not be understood, or,
though understood mighty perhaps, at the outset appear unsound. There is no need
of proving, that when good is ordered the evil which is opposed to it is
forbidden. This every one admits. It will also be admitted, without much
difficulty, that when evil is forbidden, its opposite is enjoined. Indeed, it is
a common saying, that censure of vice is commendation of virtue. We, however,
demand somewhat more than is commonly understood by these expressions. When the
particular virtue opposed to a particular vice is spoken of, all that is usually
meant is abstinence from that vice. We maintain that it goes farther, and means
opposite duties and positive acts. Hence the commandment, &#8220;Thou shalt not
kill,&#8221; the generality of men will merely consider as an injunction to
abstain from all injury and all wish to inflict injury. I hold that it moreover
means, that we are to aid our neighbour&#8217;s life by every means in our
power. And not to assert without giving my reasons I prove it thus: God forbids
us to injure or hurt a brother, because he would have his life to be dear and
precious to us; and, therefore, when he so forbids, he, at the same time,
demands all the offices of charity which can contribute to his
preservation.<br><br>10. But why did God thus deliver his commandments, as it were,
by halves, using elliptical expressions with a larger meaning than that actually
expressed? Other reasons are given, but the following seems to me the
best:&#8212;As the flesh is always on the alert to extenuate the heinousness of
sin (unless it is made, as it were, perceptible to the touch), and to cover it
with specious pretexts, the Lord sets forth, by way of example, whatever is
foulest and most iniquitous in each species of transgression, that the delivery
of it might produce a shudder in the hearer, and impress his mind with a deeper
abhorrence of sin. In forming an estimate of sins, we are often imposed upon by
imagining that the more hidden the less heinous they are. This delusion the Lord
dispels by accustoming us to refer the whole multitude of sins to particular
heads, which admirably show how great a degree of heinousness there is in each.
For example, wrath and hatred do not seem so very bad when they are designated
by their own names; but when they are prohibited under the name of murder, we
understand better how abominable they are in the sight of God, who puts them in
the same class with that horrid crime. Influenced by his judgment, we accustom
ourselves to judge more accurately of the heinousness of offences which
previously seemed trivial.<br><br>11. It will now be proper to consider what is
meant by the division of the divine Law into Two Tables. It will be judged by
all men of sense from the formal manner in which these are sometimes mentioned,
that it has not been done at random, or without reason. Indeed, the reason is so
obvious as not to allow us to remain in doubt with regard to it. God thus
divided his Law into two parts, containing a complete rule of righteousness,
that he might assign the first place to the duties of religion which relate
especially to His worship, and the second to the duties of charity which have
respect to man. The first foundation of righteousness undoubtedly is the worship
of God. When it is subverted, all the other parts of righteousness, like a
building rent asunder, and in ruins, are racked and scattered. What kind of
righteousness do you call it, not to commit theft and rapine, if you, in the
meantime, with impious sacrilege, rob God of his glory? or not to defile your
body with fornication, if you profane his holy name with blasphemy? or not to
take away the life of man, if you strive to cut off and destroy the remembrance
of God? It is vain, therefore, to talk of righteousness apart from religion.
Such righteousness has no more beauty than the trunk of a body deprived of its
head.<sup><font size="2">19</font><a name="fnB54" href="#fn54">[6]</a></sup> Nor
is religion the principal part merely: it is the very soul by which the whole
lives and breathes. Without the fear of God, men do not even observe justice and
charity among themselves. We say, then, that the worship of God is the beginning
and foundation of righteousness; and that wherever it is wanting, any degree of
equity, or continence, or temperance, existing among men themselves, is empty
and frivolous in the sight of God. We call it the source and soul of
righteousness, in as much as men learn to live together temperately, and without
injury, when they revere God as the judge of right and wrong. In the First
Table, accordingly, he teaches us how to cultivate piety, and the proper duties
of religion in which his worship consists; in the second, he shows how, in the
fear of his name, we are to conduct ourselves towards our fellow-men. Hence, as
related by the Evangelists (Mt. 22:37; Luke 10:27), our Saviour summed up the
whole Law in two heads&#8212;viz. to love the Lord with all our heart, with all
our soul, and with all our strength, and our neighbour as ourselves. You see
how, of the two parts under which he comprehends the whole Law, he devotes the
one to God, and assigns the other to mankind.<br><br>12. But although the whole Law
is contained in two heads, yet, in order to remove every pretext for excuse, the
Lord has been pleased to deliver more fully and explicitly in Ten Commandments,
every thing relating to his own honour, fear, and love, as well as every thing
relating to the charity which, for his sake, he enjoins us to have towards our
fellowmen. Nor is it an unprofitable study to consider the division of the
commandments, provided we remember that it is one of those matters in which
every man should have full freedom of judgment, and on account of which,
difference of opinion should not lead to contention. We are, indeed, under the
necessity of making this observation, lest the division which we are to adopt
should excite the surprise or derision of the reader, as novel or of recent
invention.<br><br>There is no room for controversy as to the fact, that the Law is
divided into ten heads since this is repeatedly sanctioned by divine authority.
The question, therefore, is not as to the number of the parts, but the method of
dividing them. Those who adopt a division which gives three commandments to the
First Table, and throws the remaining seven into the Second Table, expunge the
commandment concerning images from the list, or at least conceal it under the
first, though there cannot be a doubt that it was distinctly set down by the
Lord as a separate commandment; whereas the tenth, which prohibits the coveting
of what belongs to our neighbour, they absurdly break down into two. Moreover,
it will soon appear, that this method of dividing was unknown in a purer age.
Others count four commandments in the First Table as we do, but for the first
set down the introductory promise, without adding the precept. But because I
must hold, unless I am convinced by clear evidence to the contrary, that the
&#8220;ten words&#8221; mentioned by Moses are Ten Commandments and because I
see that number arranged in most admirable order, I must, while I leave them to
hold their own opinion, follow what appears to me better established&#8212;viz.
that what they make to be the first commandment is of the nature of a preface to
the whole Law, that thereafter follow four commandments in the First Table, and
six in the Second, in the order in which they will here be reviewed. This
division Origin adopts without discussion, as if it had been every where
received in his
day.<sup><font size="2">19</font><a name="fnB55" href="#fn55">[7]</a></sup> It
is also adopted by Augustine, in his book addressed to Boniface, where, in
enumerating the commandments, he follows this order, Let one God be religiously
obeyed, let no idol be worshipped, let the name of God be not used in vain;
while previously he had made separate mention of the typical commandment of the
Sabbath. Elsewhere, indeed, he expresses approbation of the first division, but
on too slight grounds, because, by the number three (making the First Table
consist of three commandments), the mystery of the Trinity would be better
manifested. Even here, however, he does not disguise his opinion, that in other
respects, our division is more to his mind. Besides these, we are supported by
the author of an unfinished work on
Matthew.<sup><font size="2">19</font><a name="fnB56" href="#fn56">[8]</a></sup>
Josephus, no doubt with the general consent of his age, assigns five
commandments to each table. This, while repugnant to reason, inasmuch as it
confounds the distinction between piety and charity, is also refuted by the
authority of our Saviour, who in Matthew places the command to honour parents in
the list of those belonging to the Second Table (Mt. 19:19). Let us now hear God
speaking in his own words.<br><br><br><br></div>
<h3 align="center">
<a name="Heading456"></a><font size="4"><b>First Commandment.</b></font></h3>
<div><br><br>I AM THE LORD THY GOD, WHICH BROUGHT THEE OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT, OUT
OF THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE. THOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE ME.<br><br><br><br>13.
Whether you take the former sentence as a part of the commandment, or read it
separately is to me a matter of indifference, provided you grant that it is a
kind of preface to the whole Law. In enacting laws, the first thing to be
guarded against is their being forthwith abrogated by contempt. The Lord,
therefore, takes care, in the first place, that this shall not happen to the Law
about to be delivered, by introducing it with a triple sanction. He claims to
himself power and authority to command, that he may impress the chosen people
with the necessity of obedience; he holds forth a promise of favour, as a means
of alluring them to the study of holiness; and he reminds them of his kindness,
that he may convict them of ingratitude, if they fail to make a suitable return.
By the name, Lord, are denoted power and lawful dominion. If all things are from
him, and by him consist, they ought in justice to bear reference to him, as Paul
says (Rom. 11:36). This name, therefore, is in itself sufficient to bring us
under the authority of the divine majesty: for it were monstrous for us to wish
to withdraw from the dominion of him, out of whom we cannot even exist.<br><br>14.
After showing that he has a right to command, and to be obeyed, he next, in
order not to seem to drag men by mere necessity, but to allure them, graciously
declares, that he is the God of the Church. For the mode of expression implies,
that there is a mutual relation included in the promise, &#8220;I will be their
God, and they shall be my people,&#8221; (Jer. 31:33). Hence Christ infers the
immortality of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, from the fact that God had declared
himself to be their God (Mt. 22:32). It is, therefore, the same as if he had
said, I have chosen you to myself, as a people to whom I shall not only do good
in the present life, but also bestow felicity in the life to come. The end
contemplated in this is adverted to in the Law, in various passages. For when
the Lord condescends in mercy to honour us so far as to admit us to partnership
with his chosen people, he chooses us, as Moses says, &#8220;to be a holy
people,&#8221; &#8220;a peculiar people unto himself,&#8221; to &#8220;keep all
his commandments,&#8221; (Deut. 7:6; 14:2; 26:18). Hence the exhortation,
&#8220;Ye shall be holy; for I the Lord your God am holy,&#8221; (Lev. 19:2).
These two considerations form the ground of the remonstrance, &#8220;A son
honoureth his father, and a servant his master; if then I be a father, where is
mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the Lord of
hosts,&#8221; (Mal. 1:6).<br><br>15. Next follows a commemoration of his kindness,
which ought to produce upon us an impression strong in proportion to the
detestation in which ingratitude is held even among men. It is true, indeed, he
was reminding Israel of a deliverance then recent, but one which, on account of
its wondrous magnitude, was to be for ever memorable to the remotest posterity.
Moreover, it is most appropriate to the matter in
hand.<sup><font size="2">19</font><a name="fnB57" href="#fn57">[9]</a></sup> For
the Lord intimates that they were delivered from miserable bondage, that they
might learn to yield prompt submission and obedience to him as the author of
their freedom. In like manners to keep us to his true worship, he often
describes himself by certain epithets which distinguish his sacred Deity from
all idols and fictitious gods. For, as I formerly observed, such is our
proneness to vanity and presumption, that as soon as God is named, our minds,
unable to guard against error, immediately fly off to some empty delusion. In
applying a remedy to this disease, God distinguishes his divinity by certain
titles, and thus confines us, as it were, within distinct boundaries, that we
may not wander hither and thither, and feign some new deity for ourselves,
abandoning the living God, and setting up an idol. For this reason, whenever the
Prophets would bring him properly before us, they invest, and, as it were,
surround him with those characters under which he had manifested himself to the
people of Israel. When he is called the God of Abraham, or the God of Israel,
when he is stationed in the temple of Jerusalem, between the Cherubim, these,
and similar modes of
expression,<sup><font size="2">20</font><a name="fnB58" href="#fn58">[0]</a></sup>
do not confine him to one place or one people, but are used merely for the
purpose of fixing our thoughts on that God who so manifested himself in the
covenant which he made with Israel, as to make it unlawful on any account to
deviate from the strict view there given of his character. Let it be understood,
then, that mention is made of deliverance, in order to make the Jews submit with
greater readiness to that God who justly claims them as his own. We again,
instead of supposing that the matter has no reference to us, should reflect that
the bondage of Israel in Egypt was a type of that spiritual bondage, in the
fetters of which we are all bound, until the heavenly avenger delivers us by the
power of his own arm, and transports us into his free kingdom. Therefore, as in
old times, when he would gather together the scattered Israelites to the worship
of his name, he rescued them from the intolerable tyranny of Pharaoh, so all who
profess him now are delivered from the fatal tyranny of the devil, of which that
of Egypt was only a type. There is no man, therefore, whose mind ought not to be
aroused to give heed to the Law, which, as he is told, proceeded from the
supreme King, from him who, as he gave all their being, justly destines and
directs them to himself as their proper end. There is no man, I say, who should
not hasten to embrace the Lawgiver, whose commands, he knows, he has been
specially appointed to obey, from whose kindness he anticipates an abundance of
all good, and even a blessed immortality, and to whose wondrous power and mercy
he is indebted for deliverance from the jaws of
death.<sup><font size="2">20</font><a name="fnB59" href="#fn59">[1]</a></sup><br><br>16.
The authority of the Law being founded and established, God delivers his First
Commandment&#8212;<br><br><br><br></div>
<div align="center">THOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE ME.<br><br><br><br></div>
<div>The purport of this commandment is, that the Lord will have himself alone
to be exalted in his people, and claims the entire possession of them as his
own. That it may be so, he orders us to abstain from ungodliness and
superstition of every kind, by which the glory of his divinity is diminished or
obscured; and, for the same reason, he requires us to worship and adore him with
truly pious zeal. The simple terms used obviously amount to this. For seeing we
cannot have God without embracing everything which belongs to him, the
prohibition against having strange gods means, that nothing which belongs to him
is to be transferred to any other. The duties which we owe to God are
innumerable, but they seem to admit of being not improperly reduced to four
heads: Adoration, with its accessory spiritual submission of conscience, Trust,
Invocation,
Thanksgiving.<sup><font size="2">20</font><a name="fnB60" href="#fn60">[2]</a></sup>
By Adoration, I mean the veneration and worship which we render to him when we
do homage to his majesty; and hence I make part of it to consist in bringing our
consciences into subjection to his
Law.<sup><font size="2">20</font><a name="fnB61" href="#fn61">[3]</a></sup>
Trust, is secure resting in him under a recognition of his perfections, when,
ascribing to him all power, wisdom, justice, goodness, and truth, we consider
ourselves happy in having been brought into intercourse with him. Invocation,
may be defined the retaking of ourselves to his promised aid as the only
resource in every case of need. Thanksgiving, is the gratitude which ascribes to
him the praise of all our blessings. As the Lord does not allow these to be
derived from any other quarter, so he demands that they shall be referred
entirely to himself. It is not enough to refrain from other gods. We must, at
the same time, devote ourselves wholly to him, not acting like certain impious
despisers, who regard it as the shortest method, to hold all religious
observance in derision. But here precedence must be given to true religion,
which will direct our minds to the living God. When duly imbued with the
knowledge of him, the whole aim of our lives will be to revere, fear, and
worship his majesty, to enjoy a share in his blessings, to have recourse to him
in every difficulty, to acknowledge, laud, and celebrate the magnificence of his
works, to make him, as it were, the sole aim of all our actions. Next, we must
beware of superstition, by which our minds are turned aside from the true God,
and carried to and fro after a multiplicity of gods. Therefore, if we are
contented with one God, let us call to mind what was formerly observed, that all
fictitious gods are to be driven far away, and that the worship which he claims
for himself is not to be mutilated. Not a particle of his glory is to be
withheld: everything belonging to him must be reserved to him entire. The words,
&#8220;before me,&#8221; go to increase the indignity, God being provoked to
jealousy whenever we substitute our fictions in his stead; just as an unfaithful
wife stings her husband&#8217;s heart more deeply when her adultery is committed
openly before his eyes. Therefore, God having by his present power and grace
declared that he had respect to the people whom he had chosen, now, in order to
deter them from the wickedness of revolt, warns them that they cannot adopt
strange gods without his being witness and spectator of the sacrilege. To the
audacity of so doing is added the very great impiety of supposing that they can
mock the eye of God with their evasions. Far from this the Lord proclaims that
everything which we design, plan, or execute, lies open to his sight. Our
conscience must, therefore, keep aloof from the most distant thought of revolt,
if we would have our worship approved by the Lord. The glory of his Godhead must
be maintained entire and incorrupt, not merely by external profession, but as
under his eye, which penetrates the inmost recesses of his heart.<br><br><br><br></div>
<h3 align="center">
<a name="Heading474"></a><font size="4"><b>Second Commandment</b></font></h3>
<div><br><br>THOU SHALT NOT MAKE UNTO THEE ANY GRAVEN IMAGE, OR ANY LIKENESS
OFANYTHING THAT IS IN HEAVEN ABOVE, OR THAT IS IN THE EARTH BENEATH, OR THAT IS
IN THE WATER UNDER THE EARTH: THOU SHALT NOT BOW DOWN THYSELF TO THEM, NOR SERVE
THEM.<br><br><br><br>17. As in the first commandment the Lord declares that he is one,
and that besides him no gods must be either worshipped or imagined, so he here
more plainly declares what his nature is, and what the kind of worship with
which he is to be honoured, in order that we may not presume to form any carnal
idea of him. The purport of the commandment, therefore, is, that he will not
have his legitimate worship profaned by superstitious rites. Wherefore, in
general, he calls us entirely away from the carnal frivolous observances which
our stupid minds are wont to devise after forming some gross idea of the divine
nature, while, at the same time, he instructs us in the worship which is
legitimate, namely, spiritual worship of his own appointment. The grossest vice
here prohibited is external idolatry. This commandment consists of two parts.
The former curbs the licentious daring which would subject the incomprehensible
God to our senses, or represent him under any visible shape. The latter forbids
the worship of images on any religious ground. There is, moreover, a brief
enumeration of all the forms by which the Deity was usually represented by
heathen and superstitious nations. By &#8220;any thing which is in heaven
above&#8221; is meant the sun, the moon, and the stars, perhaps also birds, as
in Deuteronomy, where the meaning is explained, there is mention of birds as
well as stars (Deut. 4:15). I would not have made this observation, had I not
seen that some absurdly apply it to the angels. The other particulars I pass, as
requiring no explanation. We have already shown clearly enough (Book 1. chap.
11, 12) that every visible shape of Deity which man devises is diametrically
opposed to the divine nature; and, therefore, that the moment idols appear, true
religion is corrupted and adulterated.<br><br>18. The threatening subjoined ought to
have no little effect in shaking off our lethargy. It is in the following
terms:&#8212;<br><br><br><br>I THE LORD THY GOD AM A
JEALOUS<sup><font size="2">20</font><a name="fnB62" href="#fn62">[4]</a></sup>
GOD, VISITING THE INIQUITY OF THE FATHERS UPON THE CHILDREN UNTO THE THIRD AND
FOURTH GENERATION OF THEM THAT HATE ME; AND SHEWING MERCY UNTO THOUSANDS OF THEM
THAT LOVE ME, AND KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS.<br><br><br><br>The meaning here is the same as
if he had said, that our duty is to cleave to him alone. To induce us to this,
he proclaims his authority which he will not permit to be impaired or despised
with impunity. It is true, the word used is <i>El</i>, which means God; but as
it is derived from a word meaning <i>strength</i>, I have had no hesitations in
order to express the sense more fully, so to render it as inserted on the
margin. Secondly, he calls himself <i>jealous</i>, because he cannot bear a
partner. Thirdly, he declares that he will vindicate his majesty and glory, if
any transfer it either to the creatures or to graven images; and that not by a
simple punishment of brief duration, but one extending to the third and fourth
generation of such as imitate the impiety of their progenitors. In like manner,
he declares his constant mercy and kindness to the remote posterity of those who
love him, and keep his Law. The Lord very frequently addresses us in the
character of a
husband;<sup><font size="2">20</font><a name="fnB63" href="#fn63">[5]</a></sup>
the union by which he connects us with himself, when he receives us into the
bosom of the Church, having some resemblance to that of holy wedlock, because
founded on mutual faith. As he performs all the offices of a true and faithful
husband, so he stipulates for love and conjugal chastity from us; that is, that
we do not prostitute our souls to Satan, to be defiled with foul carnal lusts.
Hence, when he rebukes the Jews for their apostasy, he complains that they have
cast off chastity, and polluted themselves with adultery. Therefore, as the
purer and chaster the husband is, the more grievously is he offended when he
sees his wife inclining to a rival; so the Lord, who has betrothed us to himself
in truth, declares that he burns with the hottest jealousy whenever, neglecting
the purity of his holy marriage, we defile ourselves with abominable lusts, and
especially when the worship of his Deity, which ought to have been most
carefully kept unimpaired, is transferred to another, or adulterated with some
superstition; since, in this way, we not only violate our plighted troth, but
defile the nuptial couch, by giving access to adulterers.<br><br>19. In the
threatening we must attend to what is meant when God declares that he will visit
the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
generation. It seems inconsistent with the equity of the divine procedure to
punish the innocent for another&#8217;s fault; and the Lord himself declares,
that &#8220;the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father,&#8221; (Ezek.
18:20). But still we meet more than once with a declaration as to the postponing
of the punishment of the sins of fathers to future generations. Thus Moses
repeatedly addresses the Lord as &#8220;visiting the iniquity of the fathers
upon the children unto the third and fourth generation,&#8221; (Num. 14:18). In
like manner, Jeremiah, &#8220;Thou showest loving-kindness unto thousands, and
recompenses the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after
them,&#8221; (Jer. 32:18). Some feeling sadly perplexed how to solve this
difficulty, think it is to be understood of temporal punishments only, which it
is said sons may properly bear for the sins of their parents, because they are
often inflicted for their own safety. This is indeed true; for Isaiah declared
to Hezekiah, that his children should be stript of the kingdom, and carried away
into captivity, for a sin which he had committed (Isa. 39:7); and the households
of Pharaoh and Abimelech were made to suffer for an injury done to Abraham (Gen.
12:17; 20:3&#8211;18). But the attempt to solve the question in this way is an
evasion rather than a true interpretation. For the punishment denounced here and
in similar passages is too great to be confined within the limits of the present
life. We must therefore understand it to mean, that a curse from the Lord
righteously falls not only on the head of the guilty individual, but also on all
his lineage. When it has fallen, what can be anticipated but that the father,
being deprived of the Spirit of God, will live most flagitiously; that the son,
being in like manner forsaken of the Lord, because of his father&#8217;s
iniquity, will follow the same road to destruction; and be followed in his turn
by succeeding generations, forming a seed of evil-doers?<br><br>20. First, let us
examine whether such punishment is inconsistent with the divine justice. If
human nature is universally condemned, those on whom the Lord does not bestow
the communication of his grace must be doomed to destruction; nevertheless, they
perish by their own iniquity, not by unjust hatred on the part of God. There is
no room to expostulate, and ask why the grace of God does not forward their
salvation as it does that of others. Therefore, when God punishes the wicked and
flagitious for their crimes, by depriving their families of his grace for many
generations, who will dare to bring a charge against him for this most righteous
vengeance? But it will be said, the Lord, on the contrary, declares, that the
son shall not suffer for the father&#8217;s sin (Ezek. 18:20). Observe the scope
of that passage. The Israelites, after being subjected to a long period of
uninterrupted calamities, had begun to say, as a proverb, that their fathers had
eaten the sour grape, and thus set the children&#8217;s teeth on edge; meaning
that they, though in themselves righteous and innocent, were paying the penalty
of sins committed by their parents, and this more from the implacable anger than
the duly tempered severity of God. The prophet declares it was not so: that they
were punished for their own wickedness; that it was not in accordance with the
justice of God that a righteous son should suffer for the iniquity of a wicked
father; and that nothing of the kind was exemplified in what they suffered. For,
if the visitation of which we now speak is accomplished when God withdraws from
the children of the wicked the light of his truth and the other helps to
salvation, the only way in which they are accursed for their fathers&#8217;
wickedness is in being blinded and abandoned by God, and so left to walk in
their parents&#8217; steps. The misery which they suffer in time, and the
destruction to which they are finally doomed, are thus punishments inflicted by
divine justice, not for the sins of others, but for their own iniquity.<br><br>21.
On the other hand, there is a promise of mercy to thousands&#8212;a promise
which is frequently mentioned in Scripture, and forms an article in the solemn
covenant made with the Church&#8212;I will be &#8220;a God unto thee, and to thy
seed after thee,&#8221; (Gen. 17:7). With reference to this, Solomon says,
&#8220;The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after
him,&#8221; (Prov. 20:7); not only in consequence of a religious education
(though this certainly is by no means unimportant), but in consequence of the
blessing promised in the covenant&#8212;viz. that the divine favour will dwell
for ever in the families of the righteous. Herein is excellent consolation to
believers, and great ground of terror to the wicked; for if, after death, the
mere remembrance of righteousness and iniquity have such an influence on the
divine procedure, that his blessing rests on the posterity of the righteous, and
his curse on the posterity of the wicked, much more must it rest on the heads of
the individuals themselves. Notwithstanding of this, however, the offspring of
the wicked sometimes amends, while that of believers degenerates; because the
Almighty has not here laid down an inflexible rule which might derogate from his
free election. For the consolation of the righteous, and the dismay of the
sinner, it is enough that the threatening itself is not vain or nugatory,
although it does not always take effect. For, as the temporal punishments
inflicted on a few of the wicked are proofs of the divine wrath against sin, and
of the future judgment that will ultimately overtake all sinners, though many
escape with impunity even to the end of their lives, so, when the Lord gives one
example of blessing a son for his father&#8217;s sake, by visiting him in mercy
and kindness, it is a proof of constant and unfailing favour to his worshipers.
On the other hand, when, in any single instance, he visits the iniquity of the
father on the son, he gives intimation of the judgment which awaits all the
reprobate for their own iniquities. The certainty of this is the principal thing
here taught. Moreover, the Lord, as it were by the way, commends the riches of
his mercy by extending it to thousands, while he limits his vengeance to four
generations.<br><br></div>
<h3 align="center">
<a name="Heading489"></a><font size="4"><b>Third Commandment.</b></font></h3>
<div><br><br>THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD THY GOD IN VAIN.<br><br><br><br>22.
The purport of this Commandment is, that the majesty of the name of God is to be
held sacred. In sum, therefore, it means, that we must not profane it by using
it irreverently or contemptuously. This prohibition implies a corresponding
precept&#8212;viz. that it be our study and care to treat his name with
religious veneration. Wherefore it becomes us to regulate our minds and our
tongues, so as never to think or speak of God and his mysteries without
reverence and great soberness, and never, in estimating his works, to have any
feeling towards him but one of deep veneration. We must, I say, steadily observe
the three following things:&#8212;<i>First</i>, Whatever our mind conceives of
him, whatever our tongue utters, must bespeak his excellence, and correspond to
the sublimity of his sacred name; in short, must be fitted to extol its
greatness. <i>Secondly</i>, We must not rashly and preposterously pervert his
sacred word and adorable mysteries to purposes of ambition, or avarice, or
amusement, but, according as they bear the impress of his dignity, must always
maintain them in due honour and esteem. <i>Lastly</i>, We must not detract from
or throw obloquy upon his works, as miserable men are wont insultingly to do,
but must laud every action which we attribute to him as wise, and just, and
good. This is to sanctify the name of God. When we act otherwise, his name is
profaned with vain and wicked abuse, because it is applied to a purpose foreign
to that to which it is consecrated. Were there nothing worse, in being deprived
of its dignity it is gradually brought into contempt. But if there is so much
evil in the rash and unseasonable employment of the divine name, there is still
more evil in its being employed for nefarious purposes, as is done by those who
use it in necromancy, cursing, illicit exorcisms, and other impious
incantations. But the Commandment refers especially to the case of oaths, in
which a perverse employment of the divine name is particularly detestable; and
this it does the more effectually to deter us from every species of profanation.
That the thing here commanded relates to the worship of God, and the reverence
due to his name, and not to the equity which men are to cultivate towards each
other, is apparent from this, that afterwards, in the Second Table, there is a
condemnation of the perjury and false testimony by which human society is
injured, and that the repetition would be superfluous, if, in this Commandment,
the duty of charity were handled. Moreover, this is necessary even for
distinction, because, as was observed, God has, for good reason, divided his Law
into two tables. The inference then is, that God here vindicates his own right,
and defends his sacred name, but does not teach the duties which men owe to
men.<br><br>23. In the first place, we must consider what an oath is. An oath, then,
is calling God to witness that what we say is true. Execrations being manifestly
insulting to God, are unworthy of being classed among oaths. That an oath, when
duly taken, is a species of divine worship, appears from many passages of
Scripture, as when Isaiah prophesies of the admission of the Assyrians and
Egyptians to a participation in the covenant, he says, &#8220;In that day shall
five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the
Lord of hosts,&#8221; (Isaiah 19:18). Swearing by the name of the Lord here
means, that they will make a profession of religion. In like manner, speaking of
the extension of the Redeemer&#8217;s kingdom, it is said, &#8220;He who
blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth: and he
that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth,&#8221; (Isaiah
65:16). In Jeremiah it is said, &#8220;If they will diligently learn the ways of
my people, to swear by my name, The Lord liveth; as they taught my people to
swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people,&#8221; (Jer.
12:16). By appealing to the name of the Lord, and calling him to witness, we are
justly said to declare our own religious veneration of him. For we thus
acknowledge that he is eternal and unchangeable truth, inasmuch as we not only
call upon him, in preference to others, as a fit witness to the truth, but as
its only assertor, able to bring hidden things to light, a discerner of the
hearts. When human testimony fails, we appeal to God as witness, especially when
the matter to be proved lies hid in the conscience. For which reason, the Lord
is grievously offended with those who swear by strange gods, and construes such
swearing as a proof of open revolt, &#8220;Thy children have forsaken me, and
sworn by them that are no gods,&#8221; (Jer. 5:7). The heinousness of the
offence is declared by the punishment denounced against it, &#8220;I will cut
off them that swear by the Lord, and that swear by Malcham,&#8221; (Zeph. 1:4,
5).<br><br>24. Understanding that the Lord would have our oaths to be a species of
divine worship, we must be the more careful that they do not, instead of
worship, contain insult, or contempt, and vilification. It is no slight insult
to swear by him and do it falsely: hence in the Law this is termed profanation
(Lev. 19:12). For if God is robbed of his truth, what is it that remains?
Without truth he could not be God. But assuredly he is robbed of his truth, when
he is made the approver and attester of what is false. Hence, when Joshua is
endeavouring to make Achan confess the truth, he says, &#8220;My son, give, I
pray thee, glory to the Lord God of Israel,&#8221; (Joshua 7:19); intimating,
that grievous dishonour is done to God when men swear by him falsely. And no
wonder; for, as far as in them lies, his sacred name is in a manner branded with
falsehood. That this mode of expression was common among the Jews whenever any
one was called upon to take an oath, is evident from a similar obtestation used
by the Pharisees, as given in John (John 9:24); Scripture reminds us of the
caution which we ought to use by employing such expressions as the
following:&#8212;&#8220;As the Lord liveth;&#8221; &#8220;God do so and more
also;&#8221; &#8220;I call God for a record upon my
soul.&#8221;<sup><font size="2">20</font><a name="fnB64" href="#fn64">[6]</a></sup>
Such expressions intimate, that we cannot call God to witness our statement,
without imprecating his vengeance for perjury if it is false.<br><br>25. The name of
God is vulgarised and vilified when used in oaths, which, though true, are
superfluous. This, too, is to take his name in vain. Wherefore, it is not
sufficient to abstain from perjury, unless we, at the same time, remember that
an oath is not appointed or allowed for passion or pleasure, but for necessity;
and that, therefore, a licentious use is made of it by him who uses it on any
other than necessary occasions. Moreover, no case of necessity can be pretended,
unless where some purpose of religion or charity is to be served. In this
matter, great sin is committed in the present day&#8212;sin the more intolerable
in this, that its frequency has made it cease to be regarded as a fault, though
it certainly is not accounted trivial before the judgment-seat of God. The name
of God is everywhere profaned by introducing it indiscriminately in frivolous
discourse; and the evil is disregarded, because it has been long and audaciously
persisted in with impunity. The commandment of the Lord, however, stands; the
penalty also stands, and will one day receive effect. Special vengeance will be
executed on those who have taken the name of God in vain. Another form of
violation is exhibited, when, with manifest impiety, we, in our oaths,
substitute the holy servants of God for God
himself,<sup><font size="2">20</font><a name="fnB65" href="#fn65">[7]</a></sup>
thus conferring upon them the glory of his Godhead. It is not without cause the
Lord has, by a special commandment, required us to swear by his name, and, by a
special prohibition, forbidden us to swear by other
gods.<sup><font size="2">20</font><a name="fnB66" href="#fn66">[8]</a></sup> The
Apostle gives a clear attestation to the same effect, when he says, that
&#8220;men verily swear by the greater;&#8221; but that &#8220;when God made
promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by
himself;&#8221; (Heb. 6:16, 13).<br><br>26. The Anabaptists, not content with this
moderate use of oaths, condemn all, without exception, on the ground of our
Saviour&#8217;s general prohibition, &#8220;I say unto you, Swear not at
all:&#8221; &#8220;Let your speech be Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more
than these cometh of evil,&#8221; (Mt. 5:34; James 5:12). In this way, they
inconsiderately make a stumbling-stone of Christ, setting him in opposition to
the Father, as if he had descended into the world to annul his decrees. In the
Law, the Almighty not only permits an oath as a thing that is lawful (this were
amply sufficient), but, in a case of necessity, actually commands it (Exod.
22:11). Christ again declares, that he and his Father are one; that he only
delivers what was commanded of his Father; that his doctrine is not his own, but
his that sent him (John 10:18, 30; 7:16). What then? Will they make God
contradict himself, by approving and commanding at one time, what he afterwards
prohibits and condemns? But as there is some difficulty in what our Saviour says
on the subject of swearing, it may be proper to consider it a little. Here,
however, we shall never arrive at the true meaning, unless we attend to the
design of Christ, and the subject of which he is treating. His purpose was,
neither to relax nor to curtail the Law, but to restore the true and genuine
meaning, which had been greatly corrupted by the false glosses of the Scribes
and Pharisees. If we attend to this we shall not suppose that Christ condemned
all oaths but those only which transgressed the rule of the Law. It is evident,
from the oaths themselves, that the people were accustomed to think it enough if
they avoided perjury, whereas the Law prohibits not perjury merely, but also
vain and superfluous oaths. Therefore our Lord, who is the best interpreter of
the Law, reminds them that there is a sin not only in perjury, but in swearing.
How in swearing? Namely, by swearing vainly. Those oaths, however, which are
authorised by the Law, he leaves safe and free. Those who condemn oaths think
their argument invincible when they fasten on the expression, <i>not at all</i>.
The expression applies not to the word <i>swear</i>, but to the subjoined forms
of oaths. For part of the error consisted in their supposing, that when they
swore by the heaven and the earth, they did not touch the name of God. The Lord,
therefore, after cutting off the principal source of prevarication, deprives
them of all subterfuges, warning them against supposing that they escape guilt
by suppressing the name of God, and appealing to heaven and earth. For it ought
here to be observed in passing, that although the name of God is not expressed,
yet men swear by him in using indirect forms, as when they swear by the light of
life, by the bread they eat, by their baptism, or any other pledges of the
divine liberality towards them. Some erroneously suppose that our Saviour, in
that passage, rebukes superstition, by forbidding men to swear by heaven and
earth, and Jerusalem. He rather refutes the sophistical subtilty of those who
thought it nothing vainly to utter indirect oaths, imagining that they thus
spared the holy name of God, whereas that name is inscribed on each of his
mercies. The case is different, when any mortal living or dead, or an angel, is
substituted in the place of God, as in the vile form devised by flattery in
heathen nations, &#8220;<i>By the life or genius of the king</i>&#8221;; for, in
this case, the false apotheosis obscures and impairs the glory of the one God.
But when nothing else is intended than to confirm what is said by an appeal to
the holy name of God, although it is done indirectly, yet his majesty is
insulted by all frivolous oaths. Christ strips this abuse of every vain pretext
when he says &#8220;Swear not at all&#8221;. To the same effect is the passage
in which James uses the words of our Saviour above quoted (James 5:12). For this
rash swearing has always prevailed in the world, notwithstanding that it is a
profanation of the name of God. If you refer the words, &#8220;<i>not at
all</i>&#8221;, to the act itself, as if every oath, without exception, were
unlawful, what will be the use of the explanation which immediately
follows&#8212;Neither by heaven, neither by the earth, &amp;c.? These words make
it clear, that the object in view was to meet the cavils by which the Jews
thought they could extenuate their fault.<br><br>27. Every person of sound judgment
must now see that in that passage our Lord merely condemned those oaths which
were forbidden by the Law. For he who in his life exhibited a model of the
perfection which he taught, did not object to oaths whenever the occasion
required them; and the disciples, who doubtless in all things obeyed their
Master, followed the same rule. Who will dare to say that Paul would have sworn
(Rom. 1:9; 2 Cor. 1:23) if an oath had been altogether forbidden? But when the
occasion calls for it, he adjures without any scruple, and sometimes even
imprecates. The question, however, is not yet disposed of. For some think that
the only oaths exempted from the prohibition are public oaths, such as those
which are administered to us by the magistrate, or independent states employ in
ratifying treaties, or the people take when they swear allegiance to their
sovereign, or the soldier in the case of the military oath, and others of a
similar description. To this class they refer (and justly) those protestations
in the writings of Paul, which assert the dignity of the Gospel; since the
Apostles, in discharging their office, were not private individuals, but the
public servants of God. I certainly deny not that such oaths are the safest
because they are most strongly supported by passages of Scripture. The
magistrate is enjoined, in a doubtful matter, to put the witness upon oath; and
he in his turn to answer upon oath; and an Apostle says, that in this way there
is an end of all strife (Heb. 6:16). In this commandment, both parties are fully
approved. Nay, we may observe, that among the ancient heathens a public and
solemn oath was held in great reverence, while those common oaths which were
indiscriminately used were in little or no estimation, as if they thought that,
in regard to them, the Deity did not interpose. Private oaths used soberly,
sacredly, and reverently, on necessary occasions, it were perilous to condemn,
supported as they are by reason and example. For if private individuals are
permitted, in a grave and serious matter, to appeal to God as a judge, much more
may they appeal to him as a witness. Your brother charges you with perfidy. You,
as bound by the duties of charity, labour to clear yourself from the charge. He
will on no account be satisfied. If, through his obstinate malice, your good
name is brought into jeopardy, you can appeal, without offence, to the judgment
of God, that he may in time manifest your innocence. If the terms are weighed,
it will be found that it is a less matter to call upon him to be witness; and I
therefore see not how it can be called unlawful to do so. And there is no want
of examples. If it is pretended that the oath which Abraham and Isaac made with
Abimelech was of a public nature, that by which Jacob and Laban bound themselves
in mutual league was private. Boaz, though a private man, confirmed his promise
of marriage to Ruth in the same way. Obadiah, too, a just man, and one that
feared God, though a private individual, in seeking to persuade Elijah,
asseverates with an
oath.<sup><font size="2">20</font><a name="fnB67" href="#fn67">[9]</a></sup> I
hold, therefore, that there is no better rule than so to regulate our oaths that
they shall neither be rash, frivolous, promiscuous, nor passionate, but be made
to serve a just necessity; in other words, to vindicate the glory of God, or
promote the edification of a brother. This is the end of the
Commandment.<br><br></div>
<h3 align="center">
<a name="Heading503"></a><font size="4"><b>Fourth Commandment.</b></font></h3>
<div><br><br>REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY TO KEEP IT HOLY. SIX DAYS SHALT THOU LABOUR
AND DO ALL THY WORK: BUT THE SEVENTH DAY IS THE SABBATH OF THE LORD THY GOD. IN
IT THOU SHALT NOT DO ANY WORK, &amp;C.<br><br><br><br>28. The purport of the commandment
is, that being dead to our own affections and works, we meditate on the kingdom
of God, and in order to such meditation, have recourse to the means which he has
appointed. But as this commandment stands in peculiar circumstances apart from
the others, the mode of exposition must be somewhat different. Early Christian
writers are wont to call it typical, as containing the external observance of a
day which was abolished with the other types on the advent of Christ. This is
indeed true; but it leaves the half of the matter untouched. Wherefore, we must
look deeper for our exposition, and attend to three cases in which it appears to
me that the observance of this commandment consists. First, under the rest of
the seventh days the divine Lawgiver meant to furnish the people of Israel with
a type of the spiritual rest by which believers were to cease from their own
works, and allow God to work in them. Secondly he meant that there should be a
stated day on which they should assemble to hear the Law, and perform religious
rites, or which, at least, they should specially employ in meditating on his
works, and be thereby trained to piety. Thirdly, he meant that servants, and
those who lived under the authority of others, should be indulged with a day of
rest, and thus have some intermission from labour.<br><br>29. We are taught in many
passages<sup><font size="2">21</font><a name="fnB68" href="#fn68">[0]</a></sup>
that this adumbration of spiritual rest held a primary place in the Sabbath.
Indeed, there is no commandment the observance of which the Almighty more
strictly enforces. When he would intimate by the Prophets that religion was
entirely subverted, he complains that his sabbaths were polluted, violated, not
kept, not hallowed; as if, after it was neglected, there remained nothing in
which he could be honoured. The observance of it he eulogises in the highest
terms, and hence, among other divine privileges, the faithful set an
extraordinary value on the revelation of the Sabbath. In Nehemiah, the Levites,
in the public assembly, thus speak: &#8220;Thou madest known unto them thy holy
sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses
thy servant.&#8221; You see the singular honour which it holds among all the
precepts of the Law. All this tends to celebrate the dignity of the mystery,
which is most admirably expressed by Moses and Ezekiel. Thus in Exodus:
&#8220;Verily my sabbaths shall ye keep: for it is a sign between me and you
throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that does
sanctify you. Ye shall keep my sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every
one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever does any work
therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. Six days may work be
done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord: whosoever
does any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. Wherefore the
children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout
their generations, for a perpetual covenant. It is a sign between me and the
children of Israel for ever,&#8221; (Exodus 31:13&#8211;17). Ezekiel is still
more full, but the sum of what he says amounts to this: that the sabbath is a
sign by which Israel might know that God is their sanctifier. If our
sanctification consists in the mortification of our own will, the analogy
between the external sign and the thing signified is most appropriate. We must
rest entirely, in order that God may work in us; we must resign our own will,
yield up our heart, and abandon all the lusts of the flesh. In short, we must
desist from all the acts of our own mind, that God working in us, we may rest in
him, as the Apostle also teaches (Heb. 3:13; 4:3, 9).<br><br>30. This complete
cessation was represented to the Jews by the observance of one day in seven,
which, that it might be more religiously attended to, the Lord recommended by
his own example. For it is no small incitement to the zeal of man to know that
he is engaged in imitating his Creator. Should any one expect some secret
meaning in the number seven, this being in Scripture the number for perfection,
it may have been selected, not without cause, to denote perpetuity. In
accordance with this, Moses concludes his description of the succession of day
and night on the same day on which he relates that the Lord rested from his
works. Another probable reason for the number may be, that the Lord intended
that the Sabbath never should be completed before the arrival of the last day.
We here begin our blessed rest in him, and daily make new progress in it; but
because we must still wage an incessant warfare with the flesh, it shall not be
consummated until the fulfilment of the prophecy of Isaiah: &#8220;From one new
moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to
worship before me, saith the Lord,&#8221; (Isaiah 66:23); in other words, when
God shall be &#8220;all in all,&#8221; (I Cor. 15:28). It may seem, therefore,
that by the seventh day the Lord delineated to his people the future perfection
of his sabbath on the last day, that by continual meditation on the sabbath,
they might throughout their whole lives aspire to this perfection.<br><br>31. Should
these remarks on the number seem to any somewhat far-fetched, I have no
objection to their taking it more simply: that the Lord appointed a certain day
on which his people might be trained, under the tutelage of the Law, to meditate
constantly on the spiritual rest, and fixed upon the seventh, either because he
foresaw it would be sufficient, or in order that his own example might operate
as a stronger stimulus; or, at least to remind men that the Sabbath was
appointed for no other purpose than to render them conformable to their Creator.
It is of little consequence which of these be adopted, provided we lose not
sight of the principal thing delineated&#8212;viz. the mystery of perpetual
resting from our works. To the contemplation of this, the Jews were every now
and then called by the prophets, lest they should think a carnal cessation from
labour sufficient. Beside the passages already quoted, there is the following:
&#8220;If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on
my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable;
and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure,
nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself in the
Lord,&#8221; (Isaiah 58:13, 14). Still there can be no doubt, that, on the
advent of our Lord Jesus Christ, the ceremonial part of the commandment was
abolished. He is the truth, at whose presence all the emblems vanish; the body,
at the sight of which the shadows disappear. He, I say, is the true completion
of the sabbath: &#8220;We are buried with him by baptism unto death: that like
as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we
should walk in newness of life,&#8221; (Rom. 6:4). Hence, as the Apostle
elsewhere says, &#8220;Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or
in respect of an holiday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days; which are
a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ,&#8221; (Col. 2:16, 17);
meaning by body the whole essence of the truth, as is well explained in that
passage. This is not contented with one day, but requires the whole course of
our lives, until being completely dead to ourselves, we are filled with the life
of God. Christians, therefore, should have nothing to do with a superstitious
observance of days.<br><br>32. The two other cases ought not to be classed with
ancient shadows, but are adapted to every age. The sabbath being abrogated,
there is still room among us, first, to assemble on stated days for the hearing
of the Word, the breaking of the mystical bread, and public prayer; and,
secondly, to give our servants and labourers relaxation from labour. It cannot
be doubted that the Lord provided for both in the commandment of the Sabbath.
The former is abundantly evinced by the mere practice of the Jews. The latter
Moses has expressed in Deuteronomy in the following terms: &#8220;The seventh
day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou,
nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy
maid-servant;&#8212;that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well
as thou,&#8221; (Deut. 5:14). Likewise in Exodus, &#8220;That thine ox and thine
ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be
refreshed,&#8221; (Exod. 23:12). Who can deny that both are equally applicable
to us as to the Jews? Religious meetings are enjoined us by the word of God;
their necessity, experience itself sufficiently demonstrates. But unless these
meetings are stated, and have fixed days allotted to them, how can they be held?
We must, as the apostle expresses it, do all things decently and in orders (1
Cor. 14:40). So impossible, however, would it be to preserve decency and order
without this politic arrangements that the dissolution of it would instantly
lead to the disturbance and ruin of the Church. But if the reason for which the
Lord appointed a sabbath to the Jews is equally applicable to us, no man can
assert that it is a matter with which we have nothing to do. Our most provident
and indulgent Parent has been pleased to provide for our wants not less than for
the wants of the Jews. Why, it may be asked, do we not hold daily meetings, and
thus avoid the distinction of days? Would that we were privileged to do so!
Spiritual wisdom undoubtedly deserves to have some portion of every day devoted
to it. But if, owing to the weakness of many, daily meetings cannot be held, and
charity will not allow us to exact more of them, why should we not adopt the
rule which the will of God has obviously imposed upon us?<br><br>33. I am obliged to
dwell a little longer on this because some restless spirits are now making an
outcry about the observance of the Lord&#8217;s day. They complain that
Christian people are trained in Judaism, because some observance of days is
retained. My reply is, That those days are observed by us without Judaism,
because in this matter we differ widely from the Jews. We do not celebrate it
with most minute formality, as a ceremony by which we imagine that a spiritual
mystery is typified, but we adopt it as a necessary remedy for preserving order
in the Church. Paul informs us that Christians are not to be judged in respect
of its observance, because it is a shadow of something to come (Col. 2:16); and,
accordingly, he expresses a fear lest his labour among the Galatians should
prove in vain, because they still observed days (Gal. 4:10, 11). And he tells
the Romans that it is superstitious to make one day differ from another (Rom.
14:5). But who, except those restless men, does not see what the observance is
to which the Apostle refers? Those persons had no regard to that politic and
ecclesiastical
arrangement,<sup><font size="2">21</font><a name="fnB69" href="#fn69">[1]</a></sup>
but by retaining the days as types of spiritual things, they in so far obscured
the glory of Christ, and the light of the Gospel. They did not desist from
manual labour on the ground of its interfering with sacred study and meditation,
but as a kind of religious observance; because they dreamed that by their
cessation from labour, they were cultivating the mysteries which had of old been
committed to them. It was, I say, against this preposterous observance of days
that the Apostle inveighs, and not against that legitimate selection which is
subservient to the peace of Christian society. For in the churches established
by him, this was the use for which the Sabbath was retained. He tells the
Corinthians to set the first day apart for collecting contributions for the
relief of their brethren at Jerusalem (1 Cor. 16:2). If superstition is dreaded,
there was more danger in keeping the Jewish sabbath than the Lord&#8217;s day as
Christians now do. It being expedient to overthrow superstition, the Jewish holy
day was abolished; and as a thing necessary to retain decency, orders and peace,
in the Church, another day was appointed for that purpose.<br><br>34. It was not,
however, without a reason that the early Christians substituted what we call the
Lord&#8217;s day for the Sabbath. The resurrection of our Lord being the end and
accomplishment of that true rest which the ancient sabbath typified, this day,
by which types were abolished serves to warn Christians against adhering to a
shadowy ceremony. I do not cling so to the number seven as to bring the Church
under bondage to it, nor do I condemn churches for holding their meetings on
other solemn days, provided they guard against superstition. This they will do
if they employ those days merely for the observance of discipline and regular
order. The whole may be thus summed up: As the truth was delivered typically to
the Jews, so it is imparted to us without figure; first, that during our whole
lives we may aim at a constant rest from our own works, in order that the Lord
may work in us by his Spirit; secondly that every individual, as he has
opportunity, may diligently exercise himself in private, in pious meditation on
the works of God, and, at the same time, that all may observe the legitimate
order appointed by the Church, for the hearing of the word, the administration
of the sacraments, and public prayer: And, thirdly, that we may avoid oppressing
those who are subject to us. In this way, we get quit of the trifling of the
false prophets, who in later times instilled Jewish ideas into the people,
alleging that nothing was abrogated but what was ceremonial in the
commandment,<sup><font size="2">21</font><a name="fnB70" href="#fn70">[2]</a></sup>
(this they term in their language the taxation of the seventh day), while the
moral part remains&#8212;viz. the observance of one day in
seven.<sup><font size="2">21</font><a name="fnB71" href="#fn71">[3]</a></sup>
But this is nothing else than to insult the Jews, by changing the day, and yet
mentally attributing to it the same sanctity; thus retaining the same typical
distinction of days as had place among the Jews. And of a truth, we see what
profit they have made by such a doctrine. Those who cling to their constitutions
go thrice as far as the Jews in the gross and carnal superstition of sabbatism;
so that the rebukes which we read in Isaiah (Isa. 1:13; 58:13) apply as much to
those of the present
day,<sup><font size="2">21</font><a name="fnB72" href="#fn72">[4]</a></sup> as
to those to whom the Prophet addressed them. We must be careful, however, to
observe the general doctrine&#8212;viz. in order that religion may neither be
lost nor languish among us, we must diligently attend on our religious
assemblies, and duly avail ourselves of those external aids which tend to
promote the worship of God.<br><br></div>
<h3 align="center">
<a name="Heading519"></a><font size="4"><b>Fifth Commandment.</b></font></h3>
<div><br><br>HONOUR THY FATHER AND THY MOTHER: THAT THY DAYS MAY BE LONG UPON THE
LAND WHICH THE LORD THY GOD GIVETH THEE.<br><br><br><br>35. The end of this commandment
is, that since the Lord takes pleasure in the preservation of his own ordinance,
the degrees of dignity appointed by him must be held inviolable. The sum of the
commandment, therefore, will be, that we are to look up to those whom the Lord
has set over us, yielding them honour, gratitude, and obedience. Hence it
follows, that every thing in the way of contempt, ingratitude, or disobedience,
is forbidden. For the term <i>honour</i> has this extent of meaning in
Scripture. Thus when the Apostle says, &#8220;Let the elders that rule well be
counted worthy of double honour,&#8221; (1 Tim. 5:17), he refers not only to the
reverence which is due to them, but to the recompense to which their services
are entitled. But as this command to submit is very repugnant to the perversity
of the human mind (which, puffed up with ambitious longings will scarcely allow
itself to be subject), that superiority which is most attractive and least
invidious is set forth as an example calculated to soften and bend our minds to
habits of submission. From that subjection which is most easily endured, the
Lord gradually accustoms us to every kind of legitimate subjection, the same
principle regulating all. For to those whom he raises to eminences he
communicates his authority, in so far as necessary to maintain their station.
The titles of Father, God, and Lord, all meet in him alone and hence whenever
any one of them is mentioned, our mind should be impressed with the same feeling
of reverence. Those, therefore, to whom he imparts such titles, he distinguishes
by some small spark of his refulgence, so as to entitle them to honour, each in
his own place. In this way, we must consider that our earthly father possesses
something of a divine nature in him, because there is some reason for his
bearing a divine title, and that he who is our prince and ruler is admitted to
some communion of honour with God.<br><br>36. Wherefore, we ought to have no doubt
that the Lord here lays down this universal rule&#8212;viz. that knowing how
every individual is set over us by his appointment, we should pay him reverence,
gratitude, obedience, and every duty in our power. And it makes no difference
whether those on whom the honour is conferred are deserving or not. Be they what
they may, the Almighty, by conferring their station upon them, shows that he
would have them honoured. The commandment specifies the reverence due to those
to whom we owe our being. This Nature herself should in some measure teach us.
For they are monsters, and not men, who petulantly and contumeliously violate
the paternal authority. Hence, the Lord orders all who rebel against their
parents to be put to death, they being, as it where, unworthy of the light in
paying no deference to those to whom they are indebted for beholding it. And it
is evident, from the various appendices to the Law, that we were correct in
stating, that the honour here referred to consists of three parts, reverence,
obedience, and gratitude. The first of these the Lord enforces, when he commands
that whose curseth his father or his mother shall be put to death. In this way
he avenges insult and contempt. The second he enforces, when he denounces the
punishment of death on disobedient and rebellious children. To the third belongs
our Saviour&#8217;s declaration, that God requires us to do good to our parents
(Mt. 15). And whenever Paul mentions this commandment, he interprets it as
enjoining
obedience.<sup><font size="2">21</font><a name="fnB73" href="#fn73">[5]</a></sup><br><br>37.
A promise is added by way of recommendation, the better to remind us how
pleasing to God is the submission which is here required. Paul applies that
stimulus to rouse us from our lethargy, when he calls this the first commandment
with promise; the promise contained in the First Table not being specially
appropriated to any one commandment, but extended to the whole law. Moreover,
the sense in which the promise is to be taken is as follows:&#8212;The Lord
spoke to the Israelites specially of the land which he had promised them for an
inheritance. If, then, the possession of the land was an earnest of the divine
favour, we cannot wonder if the Lord was pleased to testify his favour, by
bestowing long life, as in this way they were able long to enjoy his kindness.
The meaning therefore is: Honour thy father and thy mother, that thou may be
able, during the course of a long life, to enjoy the possession of the land
which is to be given thee in testimony of my favour. But, as the whole earth is
blessed to believers, we justly class the present life among the number of
divine blessings. Whence this promise has, in like manner, reference to us also,
inasmuch as the duration of the present life is a proof of the divine
benevolence toward us. It is not promised to us, nor was it promised to the
Jews, as if in itself it constituted happiness, but because it is an ordinary
symbol of the divine favour to the pious. Wherefore, if any one who is obedient
to parents happens to be cut off before mature age (a thing which not
infrequently happens), the Lord nevertheless adheres to his promise as steadily
as when he bestows a hundred acres of land where he had promised only one. The
whole lies in this: We must consider that long life is promised only in so far
as it is a blessing from God, and that it is a blessing only in so far as it is
a manifestation of divine favour. This, however, he testifies and truly
manifests to his servants more richly and substantially by death.<br><br>38.
Moreover, while the Lord promises the blessing of present life to children who
show proper respect to their parents, he, at the same time, intimates that an
inevitable curse is impending over the rebellious and disobedient; and, that it
may not fail of execution, he, in his Law, pronounces sentence of death upon
theme and orders it to be inflicted. If they escape the judgment, he, in some
way or other, will execute vengeance. For we see how great a number of this
description of individuals fall either in battle or in brawls; others of them
are overtaken by unwonted disasters, and almost all are a proof that the
threatening is not used in vain. But if any do escape till extreme old age, yet,
because deprived of the blessing of God in this life, they only languish on in
wickedness, and are reserved for severer punishment in the world to come, they
are far from participating in the blessing promised to obedient children. It
ought to be observed by the way, that we are ordered to obey parents only in the
Lord. This is clear from the principle already laid down: for the place which
they occupy is one to which the Lord has exalted them, by communicating to them
a portion of his own honour. Therefore the submission yielded to them should be
a step in our ascent to the Supreme Parent, and hence, if they instigate us to
transgress the law, they deserve not to be regarded as parents, but as strangers
attempting to seduce us from obedience to our true Father. The same holds in the
case of rulers, masters, and superiors of every description. For it were
unbecoming and absurd that the honour of God should be impaired by their
exaltation&#8212;an exaltation which, being derived from him, ought to lead us
up to
him.<sup><font size="2">21</font><a name="fnB74" href="#fn74">[6]</a></sup><br><br></div>
<h3 align="center">
<a name="Heading529"></a><font size="4"><b>Sixth Commandment.</b></font></h3>
<div><br><br></div>
<div align="center">THOU SHALT NOT KILL.<br><br><br><br></div>
<div>39. The purport of this commandment is that since the Lord has bound the
whole human race by a kind of unity, the safety of all ought to be considered as
entrusted to each. In general, therefore, all violence and injustice, and every
kind of harm from which our neighbour&#8217;s body suffers, is prohibited.
Accordingly, we are required faithfully to do what in us lies to defend the life
of our neighbour; to promote whatever tends to his tranquillity, to be vigilant
in warding off harm, and, when danger comes, to assist in removing it.
Remembering that the Divine Lawgiver thus speaks, consider, moreover, that he
requires you to apply the same rule in regulating your mind. It were ridiculous,
that he, who sees the thoughts of the heart, and has special regard to them,
should train the body only to rectitude. This commandment, therefore, prohibits
the murder of the heart, and requires a sincere desire to preserve our
brother&#8217;s life. The hand, indeed, commits the murder, but the mind, under
the influence of wrath and hatred, conceives it. How can you be angry with your
brother, without passionately longing to do him harm? If you must not be angry
with him, neither must you hate him, hatred being nothing but inveterate anger.
However you may disguise the fact, or endeavour to escape from it by vain
pretexts. Where either wrath or hatred is, there is an inclination to do
mischief. If you still persist in tergiversation, the mouth of the Spirit has
declared, that &#8220;whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer,&#8221; (1 John
3:15); and the mouth of our Saviour has declared, that &#8220;whosoever is angry
with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and
whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but
whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire,&#8221; (Mt.
5:22).<br><br>40. Scripture notes a twofold equity on which this commandment is
founded. Man is both the image of God and our flesh. Wherefore, if we would not
violate the image of God, we must hold the person of man sacred&#8212;if we
would not divest ourselves of humanity we must cherish our own flesh. The
practical inference to be drawn from the redemption and gift of Christ will be
elsewhere
considered.<sup><font size="2">21</font><a name="fnB75" href="#fn75">[7]</a></sup>
The Lord has been pleased to direct our attention to these two natural
considerations as inducements to watch over our neighbour&#8217;s
preservation&#8212;viz. to revere the divine image impressed upon him, and
embrace our own flesh. To be clear of the crime of murder, it is not enough to
refrain from shedding man&#8217;s blood. If in act you perpetrate, if in
endeavour you plot, if in wish and design you conceive what is adverse to
another&#8217;s safety, you have the guilt of murder. On the other hand, if you
do not according to your means and opportunity study to defend his safety, by
that inhumanity you violate the law. But if the safety of the body is so
carefully provided for, we may hence infer how much care and exertion is due to
the safety of the soul, which is of immeasurably higher value in the sight of
God.<br><br></div>
<h3 align="center">
<a name="Heading536"></a><font size="4"><b>Seventh Commandment.</b></font></h3>
<div><br><br></div>
<div align="center">THOU SHALT NOT COMMIT ADULTERY.<br><br><br><br></div>
<div>41. The purport of this commandment is, that as God loves chastity and
purity, we ought to guard against all uncleanness. The substance of the
commandment therefore is, that we must not defile ourselves with any impurity or
libidinous excess. To this corresponds the affirmative, that we must regulate
every part of our conduct chastely and continently. The thing expressly
forbidden is adultery, to which lust naturally tends, that its filthiness (being
of a grosser and more palpable form, in as much as it casts a stain even on the
body) may dispose us to abominate every form of lust. As the law under which man
was created was not to lead a life of solitude, but enjoy a help meet for him,
and ever since he fell under the curse the necessity for this mode of life is
increased; the Lord made the requisite provision for us in this respect by the
institution of marriage, which, entered into under his authority, he has also
sanctified with his blessing. Hence, it is evident, that any mode of
cohabitation different from marriage is cursed in his sight, and that the
conjugal relation was ordained as a necessary means of preventing us from giving
way to unbridled lust. Let us beware, therefore, of yielding to indulgence,
seeing we are assured that the curse of God lies on every man and woman
cohabiting without marriage.<br><br>42. Now, since natural feeling and the passions
unnamed by the fall make the marriage tie doubly necessary, save in the case of
those whom God has by special grace exempted, let every individual consider how
the case stands with himself. Virginity, I admit, is a virtue not to be
despised; but since it is denied to some, and to others granted only for a
season, those who are assailed by incontinence, and unable successfully to war
against it, should retake themselves to the remedy of marriage, and thus
cultivate chastity in the way of their calling. Those incapable of
self-restraint, if they apply not to the remedy allowed and provided for
intemperance, war with God and resist his ordinance. And let no man tell me (as
many in the present day do) that he can do all things, God helping! The help of
God is present with those only who walk in his ways (Ps. 91:14), that is, in his
callings from which all withdraw themselves who, omitting the remedies provided
by God, vainly and presumptuously strive to struggle with and surmount their
natural feelings. That continence is a special gift from God, and of the class
of those which are not bestowed indiscriminately on the whole body of the
Church, but only on a few of its members, our Lord affirms (Mt. 19:12). He first
describes a certain class of individuals who have made themselves eunuchs for
the kingdom of heavenly sake; that is, in order that they may be able to devote
themselves with more liberty and less restraint to the things of heaven. But
lest any one should suppose that such a sacrifice was in every man&#8217;s
power, he had shown a little before that all are not capable, but those only to
whom it is specially given from above. Hence he concludes, &#8220;He that is
able to receive it, let him receive it.&#8221; Paul asserts the same thing still
more plainly when he says, &#8220;Every man has his proper gift of God, one
after this manner, and another after that,&#8221; (1 Cor. 7:7).<br><br>43. Since we
are reminded by an express declaration, that it is not in every man&#8217;s
power to live chaste in celibacy although it may be his most strenuous study and
aim to do so&#8212;that it is a special grace which the Lord bestows only on
certain individuals, in order that they may be less encumbered in his service,
do we not oppose God, and nature as constituted by him, if we do not accommodate
our mode of life to the measure of our ability? The Lord prohibits fornication,
therefore he requires purity and chastity. The only method which each has of
preserving it is to measure himself by his capacity. Let no man rashly despise
matrimony as a thing useless or superfluous to him; let no man long for celibacy
unless he is able to dispense with the married state. Nor even here let him
consult the tranquillity or convenience of the flesh, save only that, freed from
this tie, he may be the readier and more prepared for all the offices of piety.
And since there are many on whom this blessing is conferred only for a time, let
every one, in abstaining from marriage, do it so long as he is fit to endure
celibacy. If he has not the power of subduing his passion, let him understand
that the Lord has made it obligatory on him to marry. The Apostle shows this
when he enjoins: &#8220;Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have
his own wife and let every woman have her own husband.&#8221; &#8220;If they
cannot contain, let them marry.&#8221; He first intimates that the greater part
of men are liable to incontinence; and then of those so liable, he orders all,
without exception, to have recourse to the only remedy by which unchastity may
be obviated. The incontinent, therefore, neglecting to cure their infirmity by
this means, sin by the very circumstance of disobeying the Apostle&#8217;s
command. And let not a man flatter himself, that because he abstains from the
outward act he cannot be accused of unchastity. His mind may in the meantime be
inwardly inflamed with lust. For Paul&#8217;s definition of chastity is purity
of mind, combined with purity of body. &#8220;The unmarried woman careth for the
things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit,&#8221; (1 Cor.
7:34). Therefore when he gives a reason for the former precept, he not only says
that it is better to marry than to live in fornication, but that it is better to
marry than to burn.<br><br>44. Moreover, when spouses are made aware that their
union is blessed by the Lord, they are thereby reminded that they must not give
way to intemperate and unrestrained indulgence. For though honourable wedlock
veils the turpitude of incontinence, it does not follow that it ought forthwith
to become a stimulus to it. Wherefore, let spouses consider that all things are
not lawful for them. Let there be sobriety in the behaviour of the husband
toward the wife, and of the wife in her turn toward the husband; each so acting
as not to do any thing unbecoming the dignity and temperance of married life.
Marriage contracted in the Lord ought to exhibit measure and modesty&#8212;not
run to the extreme of wantonness. This excess Ambrose censured gravely, but not
undeservedly, when he described the man who shows no modesty or comeliness in
conjugal intercourse, as committing adultery with his
wife.<sup><font size="2">21</font><a name="fnB76" href="#fn76">[8]</a></sup>
Lastly let us consider who the Lawgiver is that thus condemns fornication: even
He who, as he is entitled to possess us entirely, requires integrity of body,
soul, and spirit. Therefore, while he forbids fornication, he at the same time
forbids us to lay snares for our neighbour&#8217;s chastity by lascivious
attire, obscene gestures, and impure conversation. There was reason in the
remark made by Archelaus to a youth clothed effeminately and over-luxuriously,
that it mattered not in what part his wantonness appeared. We must have respect
to God, who abhors all contaminations whatever be the part of soul or body in
which it appears. And that there may be no doubt about it, let us remember, that
what the Lord here commends is chastity. If he requires chastity, he condemns
every thing which is opposed to it. Therefore, if you aspire to obedience, let
not your mind burn within with evil concupiscence, your eyes wanton after
corrupting objects, nor your body be decked for allurement; let neither your
tongue by filthy speeches, nor your appetite by intemperance, entice the mind to
corresponding thoughts. All vices of this description are a kind of stains which
despoil chastity of its purity.<br><br></div>
<h3 align="center">
<a name="Heading545"></a><font size="4"><b>Eighth Commandment.</b></font></h3>
<div><br><br></div>
<div align="center">THOU SHALT NOT STEAL.<br><br><br><br></div>
<div>45. The purport is, that injustice being an abomination to God, we must
render to every man his due. In substance, then, the commandment forbids us to
long after other men&#8217;s goods, and, accordingly, requires every man to
exert himself honestly in preserving his own. For we must consider, that what
each individual possesses has not fallen to him by chance, but by the
distribution of the sovereign Lord of all, that no one can pervert his means to
bad purposes without committing a fraud on a divine dispensation. There are very
many kinds of theft. One consists in violence, as when a man&#8217;s goods are
forcibly plundered and carried off; another in malicious imposture, as when they
are fraudulently intercepted; a third in the more hidden craft which takes
possession of them with a semblance of justice; and a fourth in sycophancy,
which wiles them away under the pretence of donation. But not to dwell too long
in enumerating the different classes, we know that all the arts by which we
obtain possession of the goods and money of our neighbours, for sincere
affection substituting an eagerness to deceive or injure them in any way, are to
be regarded as thefts. Though they may be obtained by an action at law, a
different decision is given by God. He sees the long train of deception by which
the man of craft begins to lay nets for his more simple neighbour, until he
entangles him in its meshes&#8212;sees the harsh and cruel laws by which the
more powerful oppresses and crushes the feeble&#8212;sees the enticements by
which the more wily baits the hook for the less wary, though all these escape
the judgment of man, and no cognisance is taken of them. Nor is the violation of
this commandment confined to money, or merchandise, or lands, but extends to
every kind of right; for we defraud our neighbours to their hurt if we decline
any of the duties which we are bound to perform towards them. If an agent or an
indolent steward wastes the substance of his employer, or does not give due heed
to the management of his property; if he unjustly squanders or luxuriously
wastes the means entrusted to him; if a servant holds his master in derision,
divulges his secrets, or in any way is treacherous to his life or his goods; if,
on the other hand, a master cruelly torments his household, he is guilty of
theft before God; since every one who, in the exercise of his calling, performs
not what he owes to others, keeps back, or makes away with what does not belong
to him.<br><br>46. This commandment, therefore, we shall duly obey, if, contented
with our own lot, we study to acquire nothing but honest and lawful gain; if we
long not to grow rich by injustice, nor to plunder our neighbour of his goods,
that our own may thereby be increased; if we hasten not to heap up wealth
cruelly wrung from the blood of others; if we do not, by means lawful and
unlawful, with excessive eagerness scrape together whatever may glut our avarice
or meet our prodigality. On the other hand, let it be our constant aim
faithfully to lend our counsel and aid to all so as to assist them in retaining
their property; or if we have to do with the perfidious or crafty, let us rather
be prepared to yield somewhat of our right than to contend with them. And not
only so, but let us contribute to the relief of those whom we see under the
pressure of difficulties, assisting their want out of our abundance. Lastly, let
each of us consider how far he is bound in duty to others, and in good faith pay
what we owe. In the same way, let the people pay all due honour to their rulers,
submit patiently to their authority, obey their laws and orders, and decline
nothing which they can bear without sacrificing the favour of God. Let rulers,
again, take due charge of their people, preserve the public peace, protect the
good, curb the bad, and conduct themselves throughout as those who must render
an account of their office to God, the Judge of all. Let the ministers of
churches faithfully give heed to the ministry of the word, and not corrupt the
doctrine of salvation, but deliver it purely and sincerely to the people of God.
Let them teach not merely by doctrine, but by example; in short, let them act
the part of good shepherds towards their flocks. Let the people, in their turn,
receive them as the messengers and apostles of God, render them the honour which
their Supreme Master has bestowed on them, and supply them with such things as
are necessary for their livelihood. Let parents be careful to bring up, guide,
and teach their children as a trust committed to them by God. Let them not
exasperate or alienate them by cruelty, but cherish and embrace them with the
levity and indulgence which becomes their character. The regard due to parents
from their children has already been adverted to. Let the young respect those
advanced in years as the Lord has been pleased to make that age honourable. Let
the aged also, by their prudence and their experience (in which they are far
superior), guide the feebleness of youth, not assailing them with harsh and
clamorous invectives but tempering strictness with ease and affability. Let
servants show themselves diligent and respectful in obeying their masters, and
this not with eye-service, but from the heart, as the servants of God. Let
masters also not be stern and disobliging to their servants, nor harass them
with excessive asperity, nor treat them with insult, but rather let them
acknowledge them as brethren and fellow-servants of our heavenly Master, whom,
therefore, they are bound to treat with mutual love and kindness. Let every one,
I say, thus consider what in his own place and order he owes to his neighbours,
and pay what he owes. Moreover, we must always have a reference to the Lawgiver,
and so remember that the law requiring us to promote and defend the interest and
convenience of our fellow-men, applies equally to our minds and our
hands.<br><br></div>
<h3 align="center">
<a name="Heading551"></a><font size="4"><b>Ninth Commandment.</b></font></h3>
<div><br><br></div>
<div align="center">THOU SHALT NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS AGAINST THY
NEIGHBOUR.<br><br><br><br></div>
<div>47. The purport of the commandment is, since God, who is truth, abhors
falsehood, we must cultivate unfeigned truth towards each other. The sum,
therefore, will be, that we must not by calumnies and false accusations injure
our neighbour&#8217;s name, or by falsehood impair his fortunes; in fine, that
we must not injure any one from petulance, or a love of evil-speaking. To this
prohibition corresponds the command, that we must faithfully assist every one,
as far as in us lies, in asserting the truth, for the maintenance of his good
name and his estate. The Lord seems to have intended to explain the commandment
in these words: &#8220;Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand
with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.&#8221; &#8220;Keep thee far from a
false matter,&#8221; (Exod. 23:1, 7). In another passage, he not only prohibits
that species of falsehood which consists in acting the part of tale-bearers
among the people, but says, &#8220;Neither shalt thou stand against the blood of
thy neighbour,&#8221; (Lev. 19:16). Both transgressions are distinctly
prohibited. Indeed, there can be no doubt, that as in the previous commandment
he prohibited cruelty unchastity, and avarice, so here he prohibits falsehood,
which consists of the two parts to which we have adverted. By malignant or
vicious detraction, we sin against our neighbour&#8217;s good name: by lying,
sometimes even by casting a slur upon him, we injure him in his estate. It makes
no difference whether you suppose that formal and judicial testimony is here
intended, or the ordinary testimony which is given in private conversation. For
we must always recur to the consideration, that for each kind of transgression
one species is set forth by way of example, that to it the others may be
referred, and that the species chiefly selected, is that in which the turpitude
of the transgression is most apparent. It seems proper, however, to extend it
more generally to calumny and sinister insinuations by which our neighbours are
unjustly aggrieved. For falsehood in a court of justice is always accompanied
with perjury. But against perjury, in so far as it profanes and violates the
name of God, there is a sufficient provision in the third commandment. Hence the
legitimate observance of this precept consists in employing the tongue in the
maintenance of truth, so as to promote both the good name and the prosperity of
our neighbour. The equity of this is perfectly clear. For if a good name is more
precious than riches, a man, in being robbed of his good name, is no less
injured than if he were robbed of his goods; while, in the latter case, false
testimony is sometimes not less injurious than rapine committed by the
hand.<br><br>48. And yet it is strange, with what supine security men everywhere sin
in this respect. Indeed, very few are found who do not notoriously labour under
this disease: such is the envenomed delight we take both in prying into and
exposing our neighbour&#8217;s faults. Let us not imagine it is a sufficient
excuse to say that on many occasions our statements are not false. He who
forbids us to defame our neighbour&#8217;s reputation by falsehood, desires us
to keep it untarnished in so far as truth will permit. Though the commandment is
only directed against falsehood, it intimates that the preservation of our
neighbour&#8217;s good name is recommended. It ought to be a sufficient
inducement to us to guard our neighbour&#8217;s good name, that God takes an
interest in it. Wherefore, evil-speaking in general is undoubtedly condemned.
Moreover, by evil-speaking, we understand not the rebuke which is administered
with a view of correcting; not accusation or judicial decision, by which evil is
sought to be remedied; not public censure, which tends to strike terror into
other offenders; not the disclosure made to those whose safety depends on being
forewarned, lest unawares they should be brought into danger, but the odious
crimination which springs from a malicious and petulant love of slander. Nay,
the commandment extends so far as to include that scurrilous affected urbanity,
instinct with invective, by which the failings of others, under an appearance of
sportiveness, are bitterly assailed, as some are wont to do, who court the
praise of wit, though it should call forth a blush, or inflict a bitter pang. By
petulance of this description, our brethren are sometimes grievously
wounded.<sup><font size="2">21</font><a name="fnB77" href="#fn77">[9]</a></sup>
But if we turn our eye to the Lawgiver, whose just authority extends over the
ears and the mind, as well as the tongue, we cannot fail to perceive that
eagerness to listen to slander, and an unbecoming proneness to censorious
judgments are here forbidden. It were absurd to suppose that God hates the
disease of evil-speaking in the tongue, and yet disapproves not of its malignity
in the mind. Wherefore, if the true fear and love of God dwell in us, we must
endeavour, as far as is lawful and expedient, and as far as charity admits,
neither to listen nor give utterance to bitter and acrimonious charges, nor
rashly entertain sinister suspicions. As just interpreters of the words and the
actions of other men, let us candidly maintain the honour due to them by our
judgment, our ear, and our tongue.<br><br></div>

<a name="Heading558"></a><font size="4"><b>Tenth Commandment.</b></font></h3>
<div><br><br>THOU SHALT NOT COVET THY NEIGHBOUR&#8217;S HOUSE, THOU SHALT NOT COVET
THY NEIGHBOUR&#8217;S WIFE NOR HIS MAN-SERVANT, NOR HIS MAID-SERVANT, NOR HIS OX
NOR HIS ASS, NOR ANYTHING THAT IS THY NEIGHBOUR&#8217;S.<br><br><br><br>49. The purport
is: Since the Lord would have the whole soul pervaded with love, any feeling of
an adverse nature must be banished from our minds. The sum, therefore, will be,
that no thought be permitted to insinuate itself into our minds, and inhale them
with a noxious concupiscence tending to our neighbour&#8217;s loss. To this
corresponds the contrary precept, that every thing which we conceive,
deliberate, will, or design, be conjoined with the good and advantage of our
neighbour. But here it seems we are met with a great and perplexing difficulty.
For if it was correctly said above, that under the words adultery and theft,
lust and an intention to injure and deceive are prohibited, it may seem
superfluous afterwards to employ a separate commandment to prohibit a covetous
desire of our neighbour&#8217;s goods. The difficulty will easily be removed by
distinguishing between <i>design</i> and
<i>covetousness</i>.<sup><font size="2">22</font><a name="fnB78" href="#fn78">[0]</a></sup>
Design, such as we have spoken of in the previous commandments, is a deliberate
consent of the will, after passion has taken possession of the mind.
Covetousness may exist without such deliberation and assent, when the mind is
only stimulated and tickled by vain and perverse objects. As, therefore, the
Lord previously ordered that charity should regulate our wishes, studies, and
actions, so he now orders us to regulate the thoughts of the mind in the same
way, that none of them may be depraved and distorted, so as to give the mind a
contrary bent. Having forbidden us to turn and incline our mind to wrath,
hatred, adultery, theft, and falsehood, he now forbids us to give our thoughts
the same direction.<br><br>50. Nor is such rectitude demanded without reason. For
who can deny the propriety of occupying all the powers of the mind with charity?
If it ceases to have charity for its aim, who can question that it is diseased?
How comes it that so many desires of a nature hurtful to your brother enter your
mind, but just because, disregarding him, you think only of yourself? Were your
mind wholly imbued with charity, no portion of it would remain for the entrance
of such thoughts. In so far, therefore, as the mind is devoid of charity, it
must be under the influence of concupiscence. Some one will object that those
fancies which casually rise up in the mind, and forthwith vanish away, cannot
properly be condemned as concupiscences, which have their seat in the heart. I
answer, That the question here relates to a description of fancies which while
they present themselves to our thoughts, at the same time impress and stimulate
the mind with cupidity, since the mind never thinks of making some choice, but
the heart is excited and tends towards it. God therefore commands a strong and
ardent affection, an affection not to be impeded by any portion, however minute,
of concupiscence. He requires a mind so admirably arranged as not to be prompted
in the slightest degree contrary to the law of love. Lest you should imagine
that this view is not supported by any grave authority, I may mention that it
was first suggested to me by
Augustine.<sup><font size="2">22</font><a name="fnB79" href="#fn79">[1]</a></sup>
But although it was the intention of God to prohibit every kind of perverse
desire, he, by way of example, sets before us those objects which are generally
regarded as most attractive: thus leaving no room for cupidity of any kind, by
the interdiction of those things in which it especially delights and loves to
revel.<br><br>Such, then, is the Second Table of the Law, in which we are
sufficiently instructed in the duties which we owe to man for the sake of God,
on a consideration of whose nature the whole system of love is founded. It were
vain, therefore, to inculcate the various duties taught in this table, without
placing your instructions on the fear and reverence to God as their proper
foundation. I need not tell the considerate reader, that those who make two
precepts out of the prohibition of covetousness, perversely split one thing into
two. There is nothing in the repetition of the words, &#8220;Thou shalt not
covet.&#8221; The &#8220;house&#8221; being first put down, its different parts
are afterwards enumerated, beginning with the &#8220;wife;&#8221; and hence it
is clear, that the whole ought to be read consecutively, as is properly done by
the Jews. The sum of the whole commandment, therefore, is, that whatever each
individual possesses remain entire and secure, not only from injury, or the wish
to injure, but also from the slightest feeling of covetousness which can spring
up in the mind.<br><br>51. It will not now be difficult to ascertain the general end
contemplated by the whole Law&#8212;viz. the fulfilment of righteousness, that
man may form his life on the model of the divine purity. For therein God has so
delineated his own character, that any one exhibiting in action what is
commanded, would in some measure exhibit a living image of God. Wherefore Moses,
when he wished to fix a summary of the whole in the memory of the Israelites,
thus addressed them, &#8220;And now, Israel, what does the Lord thy God require
of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him,
and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, to keep
the commandments of the Lord and his statutes which I command thee this day for
thy good?&#8221; (Deut. 10:12, 13). And he ceased not to reiterate the same
thing, whenever he had occasion to mention the end of the Law. To this the
doctrine of the Law pays so much regard, that it connects man, by holiness of
life, with his God; and, as Moses elsewhere expresses it (Deut. 6:5; 11:13), and
makes him cleave to him. Moreover, this holiness of life is comprehended under
the two heads above mentioned. &#8220;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy
strength, and thy neighbour as thyself.&#8221; First, our mind must be
completely filled with love to God, and then this love must forthwith flow out
toward our neighbour. This the Apostle shows when he says, &#8220;The end of the
commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and of faith
unfeigned,&#8221; (1 Tim. 1:5). You see that conscience and faith unfeigned are
placed at the head, in other words, true piety; and that from this charity is
derived. It is a mistake then to suppose, that merely the rudiments and first
principles of righteousness are delivered in the Law, to form, as it were, a
kind of introduction to good works, and not to guide to the perfect performance
of them. For complete perfection, nothing more can be required than is expressed
in these passages of Moses and Paul. How far, pray, would he wish to go, who is
not satisfied with the instruction which directs man to the fear of God, to
spiritual worship, practical obedience; in fine, purity of conscience, faith
unfeigned, and charity? This confirms that interpretation of the Law which
searches out, and finds in its precepts, all the duties of piety and charity.
Those who merely search for dry and meagre elements, as if it taught the will of
God only by halves, by no means understand its end, the Apostle being
witness.<br><br>52. As, in giving a summary of the Law, Christ and the Apostles
sometimes omit the First Table, very many fall into the mistake of supposing
that their words apply to both tables. In Matthew, Christ calls &#8220;judgment,
mercy, and faith,&#8221; the &#8220;weightier matters of the Law.&#8221; I think
it clear, that by <i>faith</i> is here meant veracity towards men. But in order
to extend the words to the whole Law, some take it for piety towards God. This
is surely to no purpose. For Christ is speaking of those works by which a man
ought to approve himself as just. If we attend to this, we will cease to wonder
why, elsewhere, when asked by the young man, &#8220;What good thing shall I do,
that I may have eternal life?&#8221; he simply answers, that he must keep the
commandments, &#8220;Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery,
Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and
thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,&#8221; (Mt. 19:16,
18). For the obedience of the First Table consisted almost entirely either in
the internal affection of the heart, or in ceremonies. The affection of the
heart was not visible, and hypocrites were diligent in the observance of
ceremonies; but the works of charity were of such a nature as to be a solid
attestation of righteousness. The same thing occurs so frequently in the
Prophets, that it must be familiar to every one who has any tolerable
acquaintance with
them.<sup><font size="2">22</font><a name="fnB80" href="#fn80">[2]</a></sup>
For, almost on every occasion, when they exhort men to repentance, omitting the
First Table, they insist on faith, judgment, mercy, and equity. Nor do they, in
this way, omit the fear of God. They only require a serious proof of it from its
signs. It is well known, indeed, that when they treat of the Law, they generally
insist on the Second Table, because therein the cultivation of righteousness and
integrity is best manifested. There is no occasion to quote passages. Every one
can easily for himself perceive the truth of my observation.<br><br>53. Is it then
true, you will ask, that it is a more complete summary of righteousness to live
innocently with men, than piously towards God? By no means; but because no man,
as a matter of course, observes charity in all respects, unless he seriously
fear God, such observance is a proof of piety also. To this we may add, that the
Lord, well knowing that none of our good deeds can reach him (as the Psalmist
declares, Psalm 16:2), does not demand from us duties towards himself, but
exercises us in good works towards our neighbour. Hence the Apostle, not without
cause, makes the whole perfection of the saints to consist in charity (Eph.
3:19; Col. 3:14). And in another passage, he not improperly calls it the
&#8220;fulfilling of the law,&#8221; adding, that &#8220;he that loveth another
has fulfilled the law,&#8221; (Rom. 13:8). And again, &#8220;All the law is
fulfilled in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,&#8221; (Gal. 5:14).
For this is the very thing which Christ himself teaches when he says, &#8220;All
things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for
this is the law and the prophets,&#8221; (Mt. 7:12). It is certain that, in the
law and the prophets, faith, and whatever pertains to the due worship of God,
holds the first place, and that to this charity is made subordinate; but our
Lord means, that in the Law the observance of justice and equity towards men is
prescribed as the means which we are to employ in testifying a pious fear of
God, if we truly possess it.<br><br>54. Let us therefore hold, that our life will be
framed in best accordance with the will of God, and the requirements of his Law,
when it is, in every respect, most advantageous to our brethren. But in the
whole Law, there is not one syllable which lays down a rule as to what man is to
do or avoid for the advantage of his own carnal nature. And, indeed, since men
are naturally prone to excessive self-love, which they always retain, how great
soever their departure from the truth may be, there was no need of a law to
inflame a love already existing in excess. Hence it is perfectly
plain,<sup><font size="2">22</font><a name="fnB81" href="#fn81">[3]</a></sup>
that the observance of the Commandments consists not in the love of ourselves,
but in the love of God and our neighbour; and that he leads the best and holiest
life who as little as may be studies and lives for himself; and that none lives
worse and more unrighteously than he who studies and lives only for himself, and
seeks and thinks only of his own. Nay, the better to express how strongly we
should be inclined to love our neighbour, the Lord has made self-love as it were
the standard, there being no feeling in our nature of greater strength and
vehemence. The force of the expression ought to be carefully weighed. For he
does not (as some sophists have stupidly dreamed) assign the first place to
self-love, and the second to charity. He rather transfers to others the love
which we naturally feel for ourselves. Hence the Apostle declares, that charity
&#8220;seeketh not her own,&#8221; (1 Cor. 13:5). Nor is the argument worth a
straw, That the thing regulated must always be inferior to the rule. The Lord
did not make self-love the rule, as if love towards others was subordinate to
it; but whereas, through natural gravity, the feeling of love usually rests on
ourselves, he shows that it ought to diffuse itself in another
direction&#8212;that we should be prepared to do good to our neighbour with no
less alacrity, ardour, and solicitude, than to ourselves.<br><br>55. Our Saviour
having shown, in the parable of the Samaritan (Luke 10:36), that the term
<i>neighbour</i> comprehends the most remote stranger, there is no reason for
limiting the precept of love to our own connections. I deny not that the closer
the relation the more frequent our offices of kindness should be. For the
condition of humanity requires that there be more duties in common between those
who are more nearly connected by the ties of relationship, or friendship, or
neighbourhood. And this is done without any offence to God, by whose providence
we are in a manner impelled to do it. But I say that the whole human race,
without exception, are to be embraced with one feeling of charity: that here
there is no distinction of Greek or Barbarian, worthy or unworthy, friend or
foe, since all are to be viewed not in themselves, but in God. If we turn aside
from this view, there is no wonder that we entangle ourselves in error.
Wherefore, if we would hold the true course in love, our first step must be to
turn our eyes not to man, the sight of whom might oftener produce hatred than
love, but to God, who requires that the love which we bear to him be diffused
among all mankind, so that our fundamental principle must ever be, Let a man be
what he may, he is still to be loved, because God is loved.<br><br>56. Wherefore,
nothing could be more pestilential than the ignorance or wickedness of the
Schoolmen in converting the precepts respecting revenge and the love of enemies
(precepts which had formerly been delivered to all the Jews, and were then
delivered universally to all Christians) into counsels which it was free to obey
or disobey, confining the necessary observance of them to the monks, who were
made more righteous than ordinary Christians, by the simple circumstance of
voluntarily binding themselves to obey counsels. The reason they assign for not
receiving them as laws is, that they seem too heavy and burdensome, especially
to Christians, who are under the law of grace. Have they, indeed, the hardihood
to remodel the eternal law of God concerning the love of our neighbour? Is there
a page of the Law in which any such distinction exists; or rather do we not meet
in every page with commands which, in the strictest terms, require us to love
our enemies? What is meant by commanding us to feed our enemy if he is hungry,
to bring back his ox or his ass if we meet it going astray, or help it up if we
see it lying under its burden? (Prov. 25:21; Exod. 23:4). Shall we show kindness
to cattle for man&#8217;s sake, and have no feeling of good will to himself?
What? Is not the word of the Lord eternally true: &#8220;Vengeance is mine, I
will repay?&#8221; (Deut. 32:35). This is elsewhere more explicitly stated:
&#8220;Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy
people,&#8221; (Lev. 19:18). Let them either erase these passages from the Law,
or let them acknowledge the Lord as a Lawgiver, not falsely feign him to be
merely a counsellor.<br><br>57. And what, pray, is meant by the following passage,
which they have dared to insult with this absurd gloss? &#8220;Love yourenemies,
bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them
which despitefully use you, and persecute you; that ye may be the children of
your Father which is in heaven,&#8221; (Mt. 5:44, 45). Who does not here concur
in the reasoning of Chrysostom (lib. de Compunctione Cordis, et ad Rom. 7), that
the nature of the motive makes it plain that these are not exhortations, but
precepts? For what is left to us if we are excluded from the number of the
children of God? According to the Schoolmen, monks alone will be the children of
our Father in heaven&#8212;monks alone will dare to invoke God as their Father.
And in the meantime, how will it fare with the Church? By the same rule, she
will be confined to heathens and publicans. For our Saviour says, &#8220;If ye
love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the
same?&#8221; It will truly be well with us if we are left only the name of
Christians, while we are deprived of the inheritance of the kingdom of heaven!
Nor is the argument of Augustine less forcible: &#8220;When the Lord forbids
adultery, he forbids it in regard to the wife of a foe not less than the wife of
a friend; when he forbids theft, he does not allow stealing of any description,
whether from a friend or an enemy,&#8221; (August. Lib. de Doctr. Christ). Now,
these two commandments, &#8220;Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not commit
adultery,&#8221; Paul brings under the rule of love; nay, he says that they are
briefly comprehended in this saying, &#8220;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself,&#8221; (Rom. 13:9). Therefore, Paul must either be a false interpreter
of the Law, or we must necessarily conclude, that under this precept we are
bound to love our enemies just as our friends. Those, then, show themselves to
be in truth the children of Satan who thus licentiously shake off a yoke common
to the children of God. It may be doubted whether, in promulgating this dogma,
they have displayed greater stupidity or impudence. There is no ancient writer
who does not hold it as certain that these are pure precepts. It was not even
doubted in the age of Gregory, as is plain from his decided assertion; for he
holds it to be incontrovertible that they are precepts. And how stupidly they
argue! The burden, say they, were too difficult for Christians to hear! As if
any thing could be imagined more difficult than to love the Lord with all the
heart, and soul, and strength. Compared with this Law, there is none which may
not seem easy, whether it be to love our enemy, or to banish every feeling of
revenge from our minds. To our weakness, indeed, every thing, even to the
minutest tittle of the Law, is arduous and difficult. In the Lord we have
strength. It is his to give what he orders, and to order what he wills. That
Christians are under the law of grace, means not that they are to wander
unrestrained without law, but that they are engrafted into Christ, by whose
grace they are freed from the curse of the Law, and by whose Spirit they have
the Law written in their hearts. This grace Paul has termed, but not in the
proper sense of the term, a law, alluding to the Law of God, with which he was
contrasting it. The Schoolmen, laying hold of the term <i>Law</i>, make it the
ground-work of their vain
speculations.<sup><font size="2">22</font><a name="fnB82" href="#fn82">[4]</a></sup><br><br>58.
The same must be said of their application of the term, venial sin, both to the
hidden impiety which violates the First Table, and the direct transgression of
the last commandment of the Second
Table.<sup><font size="2">22</font><a name="fnB83" href="#fn83">[5]</a></sup>
They define venial sin to be, desire unaccompanied with deliberate assent, and
not remaining long in the heart. But I maintain that it cannot even enter the
heart unless through a want of those things which are required in the Law. We
are forbidden to have strange gods. When the mind, under the influence of
distrust, looks elsewhere or is seized with some sudden desire to transfer its
blessedness to some other quarter, whence are these movements, however
evanescent, but just because there is some empty corner in the soul to receive
such temptations? And, not to lengthen out the discussion, there is a precept to
love God with the whole heart, and mind, and soul; and, therefore, if all the
powers of the soul are not directed to the love of God, there is a departure
from the obedience of the Law; because those internal enemies which rise up
against the dominion of God, and countermand his edicts prove that his throne is
not well established in our consciences. It has been shown that the last
commandment goes to this extent. Has some undue longing sprung up in our mind?
Then we are chargeable with covetousness, and stand convicted as transgressors
of the Law. For the Law forbids us not only to meditate and plan our
neighbour&#8217;s loss, but to be stimulated and inflamed with covetousness. But
every transgression of the Law lays us under the curse, and therefore even the
slightest desires cannot be exempted from the fatal sentence. &#8220;In weighing
our sins,&#8221; says Augustine, &#8220;let us not use a deceitful balance,
weighing at our own discretion what we will, and how we will, calling this heavy
and that light: but let us use the divine balance of the Holy Scriptures, as
taken from the treasury of the Lord, and by it weigh every offence, nay, not
weigh, but rather recognise what has been already weighed by the Lord,&#8221;
(August. De Bapt. cont. Donatist. Lib. 2 chap. 6). And what saith the Scripture?
Certainly when Paul says, that &#8220;the wages of sin is death,&#8221; (Rom.
6:23), he shows that he knew nothing of this vile distinction. As we are but too
prone to hypocrisy, there was very little occasion for this sop to soothe our
torpid consciences.<br><br>59. I wish they would consider what our Saviour meant
when he said, &#8220;Whosoever shall break one of these least commandments, and
shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of
heaven,&#8221; (Mt. 5:19). Are they not of this number when they presume to
extenuate the transgression of the Law, as if it were unworthy of death? The
proper course had been to consider not simply what is commanded, but who it is
that commands, because every least transgression of his Law derogates from his
authority. Do they count it a small matter to insult the majesty of God in any
one respect? Again, since God has explained his will in the Law, every thing
contrary to the Law is displeasing to him. Will they feign that the wrath of God
is so disarmed that the punishment of death will not forthwith follow upon it?
He has declared plainly (if they could be induced to listen to his voice,
instead of darkening his clear truth by their insipid subtleties), &#8220;The
soul that sinneth it shall die,&#8221; (Ezek. 18:20). Again, in the passage
lately quoted, &#8220;The wages of sin is death.&#8221; What these men
acknowledge to be sin, because they are unable to deny it, they contend is not
mortal. Having already indulged this madness too long, let them learn to repent;
or, if they persist in their infatuation, taking no further notice of them, let
the children of God remember that all sin is mortal, because it is rebellion
against the will of God, and necessarily provokes his anger; and because it is a
violation of the Law, against every violation of which, without exception, the
judgment of God has been pronounced. The faults of the saints are indeed venial,
not, however, in their own nature, but because, through the mercy of God, they
obtain pardon.<br><br><br><br></div>

(and not in vain) to testify in ancient times by means of expiations and
sacrifices that he was a Father, and to set apart for himself a chosen people,
he was doubtless known even then in the same character in which he is now fully
revealed to us. Accordingly Malachi, having enjoined the Jews to attend to the
Law of Moses (because after his death there was to be an interruption of the
prophetical office), immediately after declares that the Sun of righteousness
should arise (Mal. 4:2); thus intimating, that though the Law had the effect of
keeping the pious in expectation of the coming Messiah, there was ground to hope
for much greater light on his advent. For this reason, Peter, speaking of the
ancient prophets, says, &#8220;Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto
themselves, but unto us, they did minister the things which are now reported
unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you, with the Holy Ghost
sent down from heaven,&#8221; (1 Pet. 1:12). Not that the prophetical doctrine
was useless to the ancient people, or unavailing to the prophets themselves, but
that they did not obtain possession of the treasure which God has transmitted to
us by their hands. The grace of which they testified is now set familiarly
before our eyes. They had only a slight foretaste; to us is given a fuller
fruition. Our Saviour, accordingly, while he declares that Moses testified of
him, extols the superior measure of grace bestowed upon us (John 5:46).
Addressing his disciples, he says, &#8220;Blessed are your eyes, for they see,
and your ears, for they hear. For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and
righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen
them, and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them,&#8221;
(Mt. 13:16; Luke 10:23). It is no small commendation of the gospel revelation,
that God has preferred us to holy men of old, so much distinguished for piety.
There is nothing in this view inconsistent with another passage, in which our
Saviour says, &#8220;Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day, and he saw it
and was glad,&#8221; (John 8:56). For though the event being remote, his view of
it was obscure, he had full assurance that it would one day be accomplished; and
hence the joy which the holy patriarch experienced even to his death. Nor does
John Baptist, when he says, &#8220;No man has seen God at any time; the only
begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him,&#8221;
(John 1:18), exclude the pious who had previously died from a participation in
the knowledge and light which are manifested in the person of Christ; but
comparing their condition with ours, he intimates that the mysteries which they
only beheld dimly under shadows are made clear to us; as is well explained by
the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, in these words, &#8220;God, who at
sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the
prophets, has in these last days spoken unto us by his Son,&#8221; (Heb. 1:1,
2). Hence, although this only begotten Son, who is now to us the brightness of
his Father&#8217;s glory and the express image of his person, was formerly made
known to the Jews, as we have elsewhere shown from Paul, that he was the
Deliverer under the old dispensation; it is nevertheless true, as Paul himself
elsewhere declares, that &#8220;God, who commanded the light to shine out of
darkness, has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the
glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ,&#8221; (2 Cor. 4:6); because, when he
appeared in this his image, he in a manner made himself visible, his previous
appearance having been shadowy and obscure. More shameful and more detestable,
therefore, is the ingratitude of those who walk blindfold in this meridian
light. Accordingly, Paul says that &#8220;the god of this world has blinded
their minds, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ should shine unto
them,&#8221; (2 Cor. 4:4).<br><br> 2. By the Gospel, I understand the clear
manifestation of the mystery of Christ. I confess, indeed, that inasmuch as the
term Gospel is applied by Paul to the doctrine of faith (2 Tim. 4:10), it
includes all the promises by which God reconciles men to himself, and which
occur throughout the Law. For Paul there opposes faith to those terrors which
vex and torment the conscience when salvation is sought by means of works. Hence
it follows that <i>Gospel</i>, taken in a large sense, comprehends the evidences
of mercy and paternal favour which God bestowed on the Patriarchs. Still, by way
of excellence, it is applied to the promulgation of the grace manifested in
Christ. This is not only founded on general use, but has the sanction of our
Saviour and his Apostles. Hence it is described as one of his peculiar
characteristics, that he preached the Gospel of the kingdom (Mt. 4:23; 9:35;
Mark 1:14). Mark, in his preface to the Gospel, calls it &#8220;<i>The beginning
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</i>&#8221; There is no use of collecting passages
to prove what is already perfectly known. Christ at his advent &#8220;brought
life and immortality to light through the Gospel,&#8221; (2 Tim. 1:10). Paul
does not mean by these words that the Fathers were plunged in the darkness of
death before the Son of God became incarnate; but he claims for the Gospel the
honourable distinction of being a new and extraordinary kind of embassy, by
which God fulfilled what he had promised, these promises being realised in the
person of the Son. For though believers have at all times experienced the truth
of Paul&#8217;s declaration, that &#8220;all the promises of God in him are yea
and amen,&#8221; inasmuch as these promises were sealed upon their hearts; yet
because he has in his flesh completed all the parts of our salvation, this vivid
manifestation of realities was justly entitled to this new and special
distinction. Accordingly, Christ says, &#8220;Hereafter ye shall see heaven
open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.&#8221;
For though he seems to allude to the ladder which the Patriarch Jacob saw in
vision, he commends the excellence of his advent in this, that it opened the
gate of heaven, and gave us familiar access to it.<br><br>3. Here we must guard
against the diabolical imagination of Servetus, who, from a wish, or at least
the pretence of a wish, to extol the greatness of Christ, abolishes the promises
entirely, as if they had come to an end at the same time with the Law. He
pretends, that by the faith of the Gospel all the promises have been fulfilled;
as if there was no distinction between us and Christ. I lately observed that
Christ had not left any part of our salvation incomplete; but from this it is
erroneously inferred, that we are now put in possession of all the blessings
purchased by him; thereby implying, that Paul was incorrect in saying, &#8220;We
are saved by hope,&#8221; (Rom. 3:24). I admit, indeed, that by believing in
Christ we pass from death unto life; but we must at the same time remember the
words of John, that though we know we are &#8220;the sons of God,&#8221;
&#8220;it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall
appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is,&#8221; (1 John
3:2). Therefore, although Christ offers us in the Gospel a present fulness of
spiritual blessings, fruition remains in the keeping of
hope,<sup><font size="2">22</font><a name="fnB84" href="#fn84">[6]</a></sup>
until we are divested of corruptible flesh, and transformed into the glory of
him who has gone before us. Meanwhile, in leaning on the promises, we obey the
command of the Holy Spirit, whose authority ought to have weight enough with us
to silence all the barkings of that impure dog. We have it on the testimony of
Paul, that &#8220;Godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the
life that now is, and of that which is to come,&#8221; (1 Tim. 4:8); for which
reason, he glories in being &#8220;an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the
promise of life which is in Christ Jesus&#8221; (2 Tim. 1:1). And he elsewhere
reminds us, that we have the same promises which were given to the saints in
ancient time (2 Cor. 7:1). In fine, he makes the sum of our felicity consist in
being sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise. Indeed we have no enjoyment of
Christ, unless by embracing him as clothed with his own promises. Hence it is
that he indeed dwells in our hearts and yet we are as pilgrims in regard to him,
because &#8220;we walk by faith, not by sight,&#8221; (2 Cor. 5:6, 7). There is
no inconsistency in the two things&#8212;viz. that in Christ we possess every
thing pertaining to the perfection of the heavenly life, and yet that faith is
only a vision &#8220;of things not seen,&#8221; (Heb. 11:1). Only there is this
difference to be observed in the nature or quality of the promises, that the
Gospel points with the finger to what the Law shadowed under types.<br><br>4. Hence,
also, we see the error of those who, in comparing the Law with the Gospel,
represent it merely as a comparison between the merit of works, and the
gratuitous imputation of righteousness. The contrast thus made is by no means to
be rejected, because, by the term Law, Paul frequently understands that rule of
holy living in which God exacts what is his due, giving no hope of life unless
we obey in every respect; and, on the other hand, denouncing a curse for the
slightest failure. This Paul does when showing that we are freely accepted of
God, and accounted righteous by being pardoned, because that obedience of the
Law to which the reward is promised is nowhere to be found. Hence he
appropriately represents the righteousness of the Law and the Gospel as opposed
to each other. But the Gospel has not succeeded the whole Law in such a sense as
to introduce a different method of salvation. It rather confirms the Law, and
proves that every thing which it promised is fulfilled. What was shadow, it has
made substance. When Christ says that the Law and the Prophets were until John,
he does not consign the fathers to the curse, which, as the slaves of the Law,
they could not escape. He intimates that they were only imbued with the
rudiments, and remained far beneath the height of the Gospel doctrine.
Accordingly Paul, after calling the Gospel &#8220;the power of God unto
salvation to every one that believeth,&#8221; shortly after adds, that it was
&#8220;witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,&#8221; (Rom. 1:16; 3:21). And in
the end of the same Epistle, though he describes &#8220;the preaching of Jesus
Christ&#8221; as &#8220;the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret
since the world began,&#8221; he modifies the expression by adding, that it is
&#8220;now made manifest&#8221; &#8220;by the scriptures of the prophets,&#8221;
(Rom. 16:25, 26). Hence we infer, that when the whole Law is spoken of, the
Gospel differs from it only in respect of clearness of manifestation. Still, on
account of the inestimable riches of grace set before us in Christ, there is
good reason for saying, that by his advent the kingdom of heaven was erected on
the earth (Mt. 12:28).<br><br>5. John stands between the Law and the Gospel, holding
an intermediate office allied to both. For though he gave a summary of the
Gospel when he pronounced Christ to be &#8220;the Lamb of God who taketh away
the sin of the world,&#8221; yet, inasmuch as he did not unfold the incomparable
power and glory which shone forth in his resurrection, Christ says that he was
not equal to the Apostles. For this is the meaning of the words: &#8220;Among
them that are born of woman, there has not risen a greater than John the
Baptist: notwithstanding, he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater
than he,&#8221; (Mt. 11:28). He is not there commending the persons of men, but
after preferring John to all the Prophets, he gives the first place to the
preaching of the Gospel, which is elsewhere designated by the kingdom of heaven.
When John himself, in answer to the Jews, says that he is only &#8220;a
voice,&#8221; (John 1:23), as if he were inferior to the Prophets it is not in
pretended humility but he means to teach that the proper embassy was not
entrusted to him, that he only performed the office of a messenger, as had been
foretold by Malachi, &#8220;Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophets before
the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord,&#8221; (Mal. 4:5). And,
indeed, during the whole course of his ministry, he did nothing more than
prepare disciples for Christ. He even proves from Isaiah that this was the
office to which he was divinely appointed. In this sense, he is said by Christ
to have been &#8220;a burning and a shining light,&#8221; (John 5:35), because
full day had not yet appeared. And yet this does not prevent us from classing
him among the preachers of the gospel, since he used the same baptism which was
afterwards committed to the Apostles. Still, however, he only began that which
had freer course under the Apostles, after Christ was taken up into the heavenly
glory.<br><br><br><br></div>

<div align="center">Sections.<br><br><br><br></div>
<div>1.	 Introduction, showing the necessity of proving the similarity of both
dispensations in opposition to Servetus and the Anabaptists.<br><br>2.	 This
similarity in general. Both covenants truly one, though differently
administered. Three things in which they entirely agree.<br><br>3.	 First general
similarity, or agreement&#8212;viz. that the Old Testament, equally with the
New, extended its promises beyond the present life, and held out a sure hope of
immortality. Reason for this resemblance. Objection answered.<br><br>4.	 The other
two points of resemblance&#8212;viz. that both covenants were established in the
mercy of God, and confirmed by the mediation of Christ.<br><br>5.	 The first of
these points of resemblance being the foundation of the other two, a lengthened
proof is given of it. The first argument taken from a passage, in which Paul,
showing that the sacraments of both dispensations had the same meaning, proves
that the condition of the ancient church was similar to ours.<br><br>6.	 An
objection from John 6:49&#8212;viz. that the Israelites ate manna in the
wilderness, and are dead, whereas Christians eat the flesh of Christ, and die
not. Answer reconciling this passage of the Evangelist with that of the
Apostle.<br><br>7.	 Another proof from the Law and the Prophets&#8212;viz. the power
of the divine word in quickening souls before Christ was manifested. Hence the
believing Jews were raised to the hope of eternal life.<br><br>8.	 Third proof from
the form of the covenant, which shows that it was in reality one both before and
after the manifestation of Christ in the flesh.<br><br>9.	 Confirmation of the
former proof from the clear terms in which the form is expressed. Another
confirmation derived from the former and from the nature of God.<br><br>10.	 Fourth
proof from examples. Adam, Abel, and Noah, when tried with various temptations,
neglecting the present, aspired with living faith and invincible hope to a
better life. They, therefore, had the same aim as believers under the
Gospel.<br><br>11.	 Continuation of the fourth proof from the example of Abraham,
whose call and whole course of life shows that he ardently aspired to eternal
felicity. Objection disposed of.<br><br>12.	 Continuation of the fourth proof from
the examples of Isaac and Jacob.<br><br>13.	 Conclusion of the fourth proof. Adam,
Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and others under the Law, looked for the
fulfilment of the divine promises not on the earth, but in heaven. Hence they
termed this life an earthly pilgrimage, and desired to be buried in the land of
Canaan, which was a figure of eternal happiness.<br><br>14.	 A fifth proof from
Jacob&#8217;s earnestness to obtain the birth-right. This shows a prevailing
desire of future life. This perceived in some degree by Balaam.<br><br>15.	 A sixth
proof from David, who expects such great things from the Lord, and yet declares
the present life to be mere vanity.<br><br>16.	 A seventh proof also from David. His
descriptions of the happiness of believers could only be realised in a future
state.<br><br>17.	 An eighth proof from the common feeling and confession of all the
pious who sought by faith and hope to obtain in heaven what they did not see in
the present shadowy life.<br><br>18.	 A continuation and confirmation of the former
proof from the exultation of the righteous, even amid the destruction of the
world.<br><br>19.	 A ninth proof from Job, who spoke most distinctly of this hope.
Two objections disposed of.<br><br>20.	 A tenth proof from the later Prophets, who
taught that the happiness of the righteous was placed beyond the limits of the
present life.<br><br>21.	 This clearly established by Ezekiel&#8217;s vision of the
dry bones, and a passage in Isaiah.<br><br>22.	Last proof from certain passages in
the Prophets, which clearly show the future immortality of the righteous in the
kingdom of heaven.<br><br>23.	 Conclusion of the whole discussion concerning the
similarity of both dispensations. For fuller confirmation, four passages of
Scripture produced. Refutation of the error of the Sadducees and other Jews, who
denied eternal salvation and the sure hope of the Church.<br><br><br><br>1. FROM what
has been said above, it must now be clear, that all whom, from the beginning of
the world, God adopted as his peculiar people, were taken into covenant with him
on the same conditions, and under the same bond of doctrine, as ourselves; but
as it is of no small importance to establish this point, I will here add it by
way of appendix, and show, since the Fathers were partakers with us in the same
inheritance, and hoped for a common salvation through the grace of the same
Mediator, how far their condition in this respect was different from our own.
For although the passages which we have collected from the Law and the Prophets
for the purpose of proof, make it plain that there never was any other rule of
piety and religion among the people of God; yet as many things are written on
the subject of the difference between the Old and New Testaments in a manner
which may perplex ordinary readers, it will be proper here to devote a special
place to the better and more exact discussion of this subject. This discussion,
which would have been most useful at any rate, has been rendered necessary by
that monstrous miscreant, Servetus, and some madmen of the sect of the
Anabaptists, who think of the people of Israel just as they would do of some
herd of swine, absurdly imagining that the Lord gorged them with temporal
blessings here, and gave them no hope of a blessed
immortality.<sup><font size="2">22</font><a name="fnB86" href="#fn86">[8]</a></sup>
Let us guard pious minds against this pestilential error, while we at the same
time remove all the difficulties which are wont to start up when mention is made
of the difference between the Old and the New Testaments. By the way also, let
us consider what resemblance and what difference there is between the covenant
which the Lord made with the Israelites before the advent of Christ, and that
which he has made with us now that Christ is manifested.<br><br>2. It is possible,
indeed, to explain both in one word. The covenant made with all the fathers is
so far from differing from ours in reality and substance, that it is altogether
one and the same: still the administration differs. But because this brief
summary is insufficient to give any one a full understanding of the subject, our
explanation to be useful must extend to greater length. It were superfluous,
however, in showing the similarity, or rather identity, of the two
dispensations, again to treat of the particulars which have already been
discussed, as it were unseasonable to introduce those which are still to be
considered elsewhere. What we propose to insist upon here may be reduced to
three heads:&#8212;<i>First</i>, That temporal opulence and felicity was not the
goal to which the Jews were invited to aspire, but that they were admitted to
the hope of immortality, and that assurance of this adoption was given by
immediate communications, by the Law and by the Prophets. <i>Secondly</i>, That
the covenant by which they were reconciled to the Lord was founded on no merits
of their own, but solely on the mercy of God, who called them; and,
<i>thirdly</i>, That they both had and knew Christ the Mediator, by whom they
were united to God, and made capable of receiving his promises. The second of
these, as it is not yet perhaps sufficiently understood, will be fully
considered in its own place (Book 3 chap. 15&#8211;18). For we will prove by
many clear passages in the Prophets, that all which the Lord has ever given or
promised to his people is of mere goodness and indulgence. The third also has,
in various places, been not obscurely demonstrated. Even the first has not been
left unnoticed.<br><br>3. As the first is most pertinent to the present subject, and
is most controverted, we shall enter more fully into the consideration of it,
taking care, at the same time, where any of the others requires explanations to
supply it by the way, or afterwards add it in its proper place. The Apostle,
indeed, removes all doubt when he says that the Gospel which God gave concerning
his Son, Jesus Christ, &#8220;he had promised aforetime by his prophets in the
holy Scriptures,&#8221; (Rom. 1:2). And again, that &#8220;the righteousness of
God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the
prophets,&#8221; (Rom. 3:21). For the Gospel does not confine the hearts of men
to the enjoyment of the present life, but raises them to the hope of
immortality; does not fix them down to earthly delights, but announcing that
there is a treasure laid up in heaven, carries the heart thither also. For in
another place he thus explains, &#8220;After that ye believed [the Gospel,] ye
were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our
inheritance unto the redemption of the purchased possession,&#8221; (Eph. 1:13,
14). Again, &#8220;Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love
which ye have to all the saints, for the hope which is laid up for you in
heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the Gospel,&#8221;
(Col. 1:4). Again, &#8220;Whereunto he called you by our Gospel to the obtaining
of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ,&#8221; (2 Thess. 2:14). Whence also it is
called the word of salvation and the power of God, with salvation to every one
that believes, and the kingdom of
heaven.<sup><font size="2">22</font><a name="fnB87" href="#fn87">[9]</a></sup>
But if the doctrine of the Gospel is spiritual, and gives access to the
possession of incorruptible life, let us not suppose that those to whom it was
promised and declared altogether neglected the care of the soul, and lived
stupidly like cattle in the enjoyment of bodily pleasures. Let no one here
quibble and say, that the promises concerning the Gospel, which are contained in
the Law and the Prophets, were designed for a new
people.<sup><font size="2">23</font><a name="fnB88" href="#fn88">[0]</a></sup>
For Paul, shortly after making that statement concerning the Gospel promised in
the Law, adds, that &#8220;whatsoever things the law saith, it saith to those
who are under the law.&#8221; I admit, indeed, he is there treating of a
different subject, but when he said that every thing contained in the Law was
directed to the Jews, he was not so oblivious as not to remember what he had
said a few verses before of the Gospel promised in the Law. Most clearly,
therefore, does the Apostle demonstrate that the Old Testament had special
reference to the future life, when he says that the promises of the Gospel were
comprehended under it.<br><br>4. In the same way we infer that the Old Testament was
both established by the free mercy of God and confirmed by the intercession of
Christ. For the preaching of the Gospel declares nothing more than that sinners,
without any merit of their own, are justified by the paternal indulgence of God.
It is wholly summed up in Christ. Who, then, will presume to represent the Jews
as destitute of Christ, when we know that they were parties to the Gospel
covenant, which has its only foundation in Christ? Who will presume to make them
aliens to the benefit of gratuitous salvation, when we know that they were
instructed in the doctrine of justification by faith? And not to dwell on a
point which is clear, we have the remarkable saying of our Lord, &#8220;Your
father Abraham rejoiced to see my day, and he saw it and was glad,&#8221; (John
8:56). What Christ here declares of Abraham, an apostle shows to be applicable
to all believers, when he says that Jesus Christ is the &#8220;same yesterday,
to-day, and for ever,&#8221; (Heb. 13:8). For he is not there speaking merely of
the eternal divinity of Christ, but of his power, of which believers had always
full proof. Hence both the blessed
Virgin<sup><font size="2">23</font><a name="fnB89" href="#fn89">[1]</a></sup>
and Zachariah, in their hymns, say that the salvation revealed in Christ was a
fulfilment of the mercy promised &#8220;to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his
seed for ever,&#8221; (Luke 1:55, 72). If, by manifesting Christ, the Lord
fulfilled his ancient oath, it cannot be denied that the subject of that
oath<sup><font size="2">23</font><a name="fnB90" href="#fn90">[2]</a></sup> must
ever have been Christ and eternal life.<br><br>5. Nay, the Apostle makes the
Israelites our equals, not only in the grace of the covenant, but also in the
signification of the Sacraments. For employing the example of those punishments,
which the Scripture states to have been of old inflicted on the Jews, in order
to deter the Corinthians from falling into similar wickedness, he begins with
premising that they have no ground to claim for themselves any privilege which
can exempt them from the divine vengeance which overtook the Jews, since the
Lord not only visited them with the same mercies, but also distinguished his
grace among them by the same symbols: as if he had said, If you think you are
out of danger, because the Baptism which you received, and the Supper of which
you daily partake, have excellent promises, and if, in the meantime, despising
the goodness of God, you indulge in licentiousness, know that the Jews, on whom
the Lord inflicted his severest judgments, possessed similar symbols. They were
baptised in passing through the sea, and in the cloud which protected them from
the burning heat of the sun. It is said, that this passage was a carnal baptism,
corresponding in some degree to our spiritual baptism. But if so, there would be
a want of conclusiveness in the argument of the Apostle, whose object is to
prevent Christians from imagining that they excelled the Jews in the matter of
baptism. Besides, the cavil cannot apply to what immediately follows&#8212;viz.
that they did &#8220;all eat the same spiritual meat; and did all drink the same
spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and
that Rock was Christ,&#8221; (1 Cor. 10:3, 4).<br><br>6. To take off the force of
this passage of Paul, an objection is founded on the words of our Saviour,
&#8220;Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.&#8221;
&#8220;If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever,&#8221; (John 6:49,
51). There is no difficulty in reconciling the two passages. The Lord, as he was
addressing hearers who only desired to be filled with earthly food, while they
cared not for the true food of the soul, in some degree adapts his speech to
their capacity, and, in particular, to meet their carnal view, draws a
comparison between manna and his own body. They called upon him to prove his
authority by performing some miracle, such as Moses performed in the wilderness
when he obtained manna from heaven. In this manna they saw nothing but a relief
of the bodily hunger from which the people were then suffering; they did not
penetrate to the sublimer mystery to which Paul refers. Christ, therefore, to
demonstrate that the blessing which they ought to expect from him was more
excellent than the lauded one which Moses had bestowed upon their fathers, draws
this comparison: If, in your opinion, it was a great and memorable miracle when
the Lord, by Moses, supplied his people with heavenly food that they might be
supported for a season, and not perish in the wilderness from famine; from this
infer how much more excellent is the food which bestows immortality. We see why
our Lord omitted to mention what was of principal virtue in the manna, and
mentioned only its meanest use. Since the Jews had, as it were by way of
upbraiding, cast up Moses to him as one who had relieved the necessity of the
people by means of manna, he answers, that he was the minister of a much larger
grace, one compared with which the bodily nourishment of the people, on which
they set so high a value, ought to be held worthless. Paul, again, knowing that
the Lords when he rained manna from heaven, had not merely supplied their bodies
with food, but had also dispensed it as containing a spiritual mystery to typify
the spiritual quickening which is obtained in Christ, does not overlook that
quality which was most deserving of consideration. Wherefore it is surely and
clearly proved, that the same promises of celestial and eternal life, which the
Lord now gives to us, were not only communicated to the Jews, but also sealed by
truly spiritual sacraments. This subject is copiously discussed by Augustine in
his work against Faustus the Manichee.<br><br>7. But if my readers would rather have
passages quoted from the Law and the Prophets, from which they may see, as we
have already done from Christ and the Apostles, that the spiritual covenant was
common also to the Fathers, I will yield to the wish, and the more willingly,
because opponents will thus be more surely convinced, that henceforth there will
be no room for evasion. And I will begin with a proof which, though I know it
will seem futile and almost ridiculous to supercilious Anabaptists, will have
very great weight with the docile and sober-minded. I take it for granted that
the word of God has such an inherent efficacy, that it quickens the souls of all
whom he is pleased to favour with the communication of it. Peter&#8217;s
statement has ever been true, that it is an incorruptible seed, &#8220;which
liveth and abideth for ever,&#8221; (1 Peter 1:23), as he infers from the words
of Isaiah (Is. 40:6). Now when God, in ancient times, bound the Jews to him by
this sacred bond, there cannot be a doubt that he separated them unto the hope
of eternal life. When I say that they embraced the word which brought them
nearer to God, I refer not to that general method of communication which is
diffused through heaven and earth, and all the creatures of the world, and
which, though it quickens all things, each according to its nature, rescues none
from the bondage of corruption. I refer to that special mode of communication by
which the minds of the pious are both enlightened in the knowledge of God, and,
in a manner, linked to him. Adam, Abel, Noah, Abraham, and the other patriarchs,
having been united to God by this illumination of the word, I say there cannot
be the least doubt that entrance was given them into the immortal kingdom of
God. They had that solid participation in God which cannot exist without the
blessing of everlasting life.<br><br>8. If the point still seems somewhat involved,
let us pass to the form of the covenant, which will not only satisfy calm
thinkers, but sufficiently establish the ignorance of gainsayers. The covenant
which God always made with his servants was this, &#8220;I will walk among you,
and will be your God, and ye shall be my people,&#8221; (Lev. 26:12). These
words, even as the prophets are wont to expound them, comprehend life and
salvation, and the whole sum of blessedness. For David repeatedly declares, and
with good reason, &#8220;Happy is that people whose God is the Lord.&#8221;
&#8220;Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord; and the people whom he has
chosen for his own inheritance,&#8221; (Psalm 144:15; 33:12); and this not
merely in respect of earthly happiness, but because he rescues from death,
constantly preserves, and, with eternal mercy, visits those whom he has adopted
for his people. As is said in other prophets, &#8220;Art not thou from
everlasting, O Lord my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die.&#8221; &#8220;The
Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our king; he will save
us&#8221; &#8220;Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved
by the Lord?&#8221; (Hab. 1:12; Isaiah 33:22; Deut. 33:29). But not to labour
superfluously, the prophets are constantly reminding us that no good thing and,
consequently, no assurance of salvation, is wanting, provided the Lord is our
God. And justly. For if his face, the moment it hath shone upon us, is a perfect
pledge of salvation, how can he manifest himself to any one as his God, without
opening to him the treasures of salvation? The terms on which God makes himself
ours is to dwell in the midst of us, as he declared by Moses (Lev. 26:11). But
such presence cannot be enjoyed without life being, at the same time, possessed
along with it. And though nothing more had been expressed, they had a
sufficiently clear promise of spiritual life in these words, &#8220;I am your
God,&#8221; (Exod. 6:7). For he declared that he would be a God not to their
bodies only, but specially to their souls. Souls, however, if not united to God
by righteousness, remain estranged from him in death. On the other hand, that
union, wherever it exists, will bring perpetual salvation with it.<br><br>9. To this
we may add, that he not only declared he was, but also promised that he would
be, their God. By this their hope was extended beyond present good, and
stretched forward into eternity. Moreover, that this observance of the future
had the effect, appears from the many passages in which the faithful console
themselves not only in their present evils, but also for the future, by calling
to mind that God was never to desert them. Moreover, in regard to the second
part of the promise&#8212;viz. the blessing of God, its extending beyond the
limits of the present life was still more clearly confirmed by the words, I will
be the God of your seed after you (Gen. 17:7). If he was to manifest his favour
to the dead by doing good to their posterity, much less would he deny his favour
to themselves. God is not like men, who transfer their love to the children of
their friends, because the opportunity of bestowing kind offices as they wished
upon themselves is interrupted by death. But God, whose kindness is not impeded
by death, does not deprive the dead of the benefit of his mercy, which, on their
account, he continues to a thousand generations. God, therefore, was pleased to
give a striking proof of the abundance and greatness of his goodness which they
were to enjoy after death, when he described it as overflowing to all their
posterity (Exod. 20:6). The truth of this promise was sealed, and in a manner
completed, when, long after the death of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, he called
himself their God (Exod. 20:6). And why? Was not the name absurd if they had
perished? It would have been just the same as if he had said, I am the God of
men who exist not. Accordingly, the Evangelists relate that, by this very
argument, our Saviour refuted the Sadducees (Mt. 22:23; Luke 20:32), who were,
therefore, unable to deny that the resurrection of the dead was attested by
Moses, inasmuch as he had taught them that all the saints are in his hand (Deut.
33:3). Whence it is easy to infer that death is not the extinction of those who
are taken under the tutelage, guardianship, and protection of him who is the
disposer of life and death.<br><br>10. Let us now see (and on this the controversy
principally turns) whether or not believers themselves were so instructed by the
Lord, as to feel that they had elsewhere a better life, and to aspire to it
while disregarding the present. First, the mode of life which heaven had imposed
upon them made it a constant exercise, by which they were reminded, that if in
this world only they had hope, they were of all men the most miserable. Adam,
most unhappy even in the mere remembrance of his lost felicity, with difficulty
supplies his wants by anxious labours; and that the divine curse might not be
restricted to bodily labour, his only remaining solace becomes a source of the
deepest grief: Of two sons, the one is torn from him by the parricidal hand of
his brother; while the other, who survives, causes detestation and horror by his
very look. Abel, cruelly murdered in the very flower of his days, is an example
of the calamity which had come upon man. While the whole world are securely
living in luxury, Noah, with much fatigue, spends a great part of his life in
building an ark. He escapes death, but by greater troubles than a hundred deaths
could have given. Besides his ten months&#8217; residence in the ark, as in a
kind of sepulchre, nothing could have been more unpleasant than to have remained
so long pent up among the filth of beasts. After escaping these difficulties he
falls into a new cause of sorrow. He sees himself mocked by his own son, and is
forced, with his own mouth, to curse one whom, by the great kindness of God, he
had received safe from the deluge.<br><br>11. Abraham alone ought to be to us equal
to tens of thousands if we consider his faith, which is set before us as the
best model of believing, to whose race also we must be held to belong in order
that we may be the children of
God.<sup><font size="2">23</font><a name="fnB91" href="#fn91">[3]</a></sup> What
could be more absurd than that Abraham should be the father of all the faithful,
and not even occupy the meanest corner among them? He cannot be denied a place
in the list; nay, he cannot be denied one of the most honourable places in it,
without the destruction of the whole Church. Now, as regards his experience in
life, the moment he is called by the command of God, he is torn away from
friends, parents, and country, objects in which the chief happiness of life is
deemed to consist, as if it had been the fixed purpose of the Lord to deprive
him of all the sources of enjoyment. No sooner does he enter the land in which
he was ordered to dwell, than he is driven from it by famine. In the country to
which he retires to obtain relief, he is obliged, for his personal safety, to
expose his wife to prostitution. This must have been more bitter than many
deaths. After returning to the land of his habitation, he is again expelled by
famine. What is the happiness of inhabiting a land where you must so often
suffer from hunger, nay, perish from famine, unless you flee from it? Then,
again, with Abimelech, he is reduced to the same necessity of saving his head by
the loss of his wife (Gen. 12:12). While he wanders up and down uncertain for
many years, he is compelled, by the constant quarrelling of servants to part
with his nephew, who was to him as a son. This departure must doubtless have
cost him a pang something like the cutting off of a limb. Shortly after, he
learns that his nephew is carried off captive by the enemy. Wherever he goes, he
meets with savage-hearted neighbours, who will not even allow him to drink of
the wells which he has dug with great labour. For he would not have purchased
the use from the king of Gerar if he had not been previously prohibited. After
he had reached the verge of life, he sees himself childless (the bitterest and
most unpleasant feeling to old age), until, beyond expectation, Ishmael is born;
and yet he pays dearly for his birth in the reproaches of Sarah, as if he was
the cause of domestic disturbance by encouraging the contumacy of a female
slave. At length Isaac is born, but in return, the first-born Ishmael is
displaced, and almost hostilely driven forth and abandoned. Isaac remains alone,
and the good man, now worn out with age, has his heart upon him, when shortly
after he is ordered to offer him up in sacrifice. What can the human mind
conceive more dreadful than for the father to be the murderer of his son? Had he
been carried off by disease, who would not have thought the old man much to be
pitied in having a son given to him in mockery, and in having his grief for
being childless doubled to him? Had he been slain by some stranger, this would,
indeed, have been much worse than natural death. But all these calamities are
little compared with the murder of him by his father&#8217;s hand. Thus, in
fine, during the whole course of his life, he was harassed and tossed in such a
way, that any one desirous to give a picture of a calamitous life could not find
one more appropriate. Let it not be said that he was not so very distressed,
because he at length escaped from all these tempests. He is not said to lead a
happy life who, after infinite difficulties during a long period, at last
laboriously works out his escape, but he who calmly enjoys present blessings
without any alloy of suffering.<br><br>12. Isaac is less afflicted, but he enjoys
very few of the sweets of life. He also meets with those vexations which do not
permit a man to be happy on the earth. Famine drives him from the land of
Canaan; his wife is torn from his bosom; his neighbours are ever and anon
annoying and vexing him in all kinds of ways, so that he is even obliged to
fight for water. At home, he suffers great annoyance from his daughters-in-law;
he is stung by the dissension of his sons, and has no other cure for this great
evil than to send the son whom he had blessed into exile (Gen. 26:27); Jacob,
again, is nothing but a striking example of the greatest wretchedness. His
boyhood is passed most uncomfortably at home amidst the threats and alarms of
his elder brother, and to these he is at length forced to give way (Gen. 27:28);
A fugitive from his parents and his native soil, in addition to the hardships of
exile, the treatment he receives from his uncle Laban is in no respect milder
and more humane (Gen. 29). As if it had been little to spend seven years of hard
and rigorous servitude, he is cheated in the matter of a wife. For the sake of
another wife, he must undergo a new servitude, during which, as he himself
complains, the heat of the sun scorches him by day, while in frost and cold he
spends the sleepless night (Gen. 31:40, 41). For twenty years he spends this
bitter life, and daily suffers new injuries from his father-in-law. Nor is he
quiet at home, which he sees disturbed and almost broken up by the hatreds,
quarrels, and jealousies of his wives. When he is ordered to return to his
native land, he is obliged to take his departure in a manner resembling an
ignominious flight. Even then he is unable to escape the injustice of his
father-in-law, but in the midst of his journey is assailed by him with contumely
and reproach (Gen.
31:20.<sup><font size="2">23</font><a name="fnB92" href="#fn92">[4]</a></sup>)
By and bye a much greater difficulty befalls him (Gen. 32, 33). For as he
approaches his brother, he has as many forms of death in prospect as a cruel foe
could invent. Hence, while waiting for his arrival, he is distracted and
excruciated by direful terrors; and when he comes into his sight, he falls at
his feet like one half dead, until he perceives him to be more placable than he
had ventured to hope. Moreover, when he first enters the land, he is bereaved of
Rachel his only beloved wife. Afterwards he hears that the son whom she had
borne him, and whom he loved more than all his other children, is devoured by a
wild beast (Gen. 37:33). How deep the sorrow caused by his death he himself
evinces, when, after long tears, he obstinately refuses to be comforted,
declaring that he will go down to the grave to his son mourning. In the
meantime, what vexation, anxiety, and grief, must he have received from the
carrying off and dishonour of his daughter, and the cruel revenge of his sons,
which not only brought him into bad odour with all the inhabitants of the
country, but exposed him to the greatest danger of extermination? (Gen. 34) Then
follows the horrid wickedness of Reuben his first-born, wickedness than which
none could be committed more grievous (Gen. 36:22). The dishonour of a wife
being one of the greatest of calamities, what must be said when the atrocity is
perpetrated by a son? Some time after, the family is again polluted with incest
(Gen. 38:18). All these disgraces might have crushed a mind otherwise the most
firm and unbroken by misfortune. Towards the end of his life, when he seeks
relief for himself and his family from famine, he is struck by the announcement
of a new misfortune, that one of his sons is detained in prison, and that to
recover him he must entrust to others his dearly beloved Benjamin (Gen. 42, 43).
Who can think that in such a series of misfortunes, one moment was given him in
which he could breathe secure? Accordingly, his own best witness, he declares to
Pharaoh, &#8220;Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been,&#8221;
(Gen. 47:9). In declaring that he had spent his life in constant wretchedness,
he denies that he had experienced the prosperity which had been promised him by
the Lord. Jacob, therefore, either formed a malignant and ungrateful estimate of
the Lord&#8217;s favour, or he truly declared that he had lived miserable on the
earth. If so, it follows that his hope could not have been fixed on earthly
objects.<br><br>13. If these holy Patriarchs expected a happy life from the hand of
God (and it is indubitable that they did), they viewed and contemplated a
different happiness from that of a terrestrial life. This is admirably shown by
an Apostle, &#8220;By faith he [Abraham] sojourned in the land of promise, as in
a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with
him of the same promise: for he looked for a city which has foundations, whose
builder and maker is God.&#8221; &#8220;These all died in faith, not having
received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of
them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on
the earth. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a
country. And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they
came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they desire
a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be
called their God: for he has prepared for them a city,&#8221; (Heb. 11:9, 10,
13&#8211;16). They had been duller than blocks in so pertinaciously pursuing
promises, no hope of which appeared upon the earth, if they had not expected
their completion elsewhere. The thing which the Apostle specially urges, and not
without reason, is, that they called this world a pilgrimage, as Moses also
relates (Gen. 47:9). If they were pilgrims and strangers in the land of Canaan,
where is the promise of the Lord which appointed them heirs of it? It is clear,
therefore, that the promise of possession which they had received looked
farther. Hence, they did not acquire a foot breadth in the land of Canaan,
except for sepulture; thus testifying that they hoped not to receive the benefit
of the promise till after death. And this is the reason why Jacob set so much
value on being buried there, that he took Joseph bound by oath to see it done;
and why Joseph wished that his bones should some ages later, long after they had
mouldered into dust, be carried thither (Gen. 47:29, 30; 50:25).<br><br>14. In
short, it is manifest, that in the whole course of their lives, they had an eye
to future blessedness. Why should Jacob have aspired so earnestly to
primogeniture, and intrigued for it at so much risk, if it was to bring him only
exile and destitution, and no good at all, unless he looked to some higher
blessing? And that this was his feeling, he declared in one of the last
sentences he uttered, &#8220;I have waited for thy salvation, O God,&#8221;
(Gen. 49:18). What salvation could he have waited for, when he felt himself
breathing his last, if he did not see in death the beginning of a new life? And
why talk of saints and the children of God, when even one, who otherwise strove
to resist the truth, was not devoid of some similar impression? For what did
Balaam mean when he said, &#8220;Let me die the death of the righteous, and let
my last end be like his,&#8221; (Num. 23:10), unless he felt convinced of what
David afterward declares, &#8220;Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death
of his saints?&#8221; (Ps. 116:15; 34:12). If death were the goal and ultimate
limit, no distinction could be observed between the righteous and the wicked.
The true distinction is the different lot which awaits them after death.<br><br>15.
We have not yet come farther down than the books of Moses, whose only office,
according to our opponents, was to induce the people to worship God, by setting
before them the fertility of the land, and its general abundance; and yet to
every one who does not voluntarily shun the light, there is clear evidence of a
spiritual covenant. But if we come down to the Prophets, the kingdom of Christ
and eternal life are there exhibited in the fullest splendour. First, David, as
earlier in time, in accordance with the order of the Divine procedure, spoke of
heavenly mysteries more obscurely than they, and yet with what clearness and
certainty does he point to it in all he says. The value he put upon his earthly
habitation is attested by these words, &#8220;I am a stranger with thee, and a
sojourner, as all my fathers were. Verily every man at his best estate is
altogether vanity. Surely every man walketh in a vain show. And now, Lord, what
wait I for? my hope is in thee,&#8221; (Ps. 39:12, 5, 6, 7). He who confesses
that there is nothing solid or stable on the earth, and yet firmly retains his
hope in God, undoubtedly contemplates a happiness reserved for him elsewhere. To
this contemplation he is wont to invite believers whenever he would have them to
be truly comforted. For, in another passages after speaking of human life as a
fleeting and evanescent show, he adds, &#8220;The mercy of the Lord is from
everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him,&#8221; (Ps. 103:17). To this
there is a corresponding passage in another psalm, &#8220;Of old thou hast laid
the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands. They
shall perish, but thou shalt endure; yea, all of them shall wax old like a
garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed; but
thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end. The children of thy servants
shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee,&#8221; (Ps.
102:25&#8211;28). If, notwithstanding of the destruction of the heavens and the
earth, the godly cease not to be established before God, it follows, that their
salvation is connected with his eternity. But this hope could have no existence,
if it did not lean upon the promise as expounded by Isaiah, &#8220;The heavens
shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and
they that dwell therein shall die in like manner; but my salvation shall be for
ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished,&#8221; (Isa. 51:6).
Perpetuity is here attributed to righteousness and salvation, not as they reside
in God, but as they are experienced by men.<br><br>16. Nor can those things which
are everywhere said as to the prosperous success of believers be understood in
any other sense than as referring to the manifestation of celestial glory. Of
this nature are the following passages: &#8220;He preserveth the souls of his
saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. Light is sown for the
righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.&#8221; &#8220;His
righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour&#8212;the
desire of the wicked shall perish.&#8221; &#8220;Surely the righteous shall give
thanks unto thy name; the upright shall dwell in thy presence.&#8221; &#8220;The
righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.&#8221; &#8220;The Lord redeemeth
the soul of his
servants.&#8221;<sup><font size="2">23</font><a name="fnB93" href="#fn93">[5]</a></sup>
But the Lord often leaves his servants, not only to be annoyed by the violence
of the wicked, but to be lacerated and destroyed; allows the good to languish in
obscurity and squalid poverty, while the ungodly shine forth, as it were, among
the stars; and even by withdrawing the light of his countenance does not leave
them lasting joy. Wherefore, David by no means disguises the fact, that if
believers fix their eyes on the present condition of the world, they will be
grievously tempted to believe that with God integrity has neither favour nor
reward; so much does impiety prosper and flourish, while the godly are oppressed
with ignominy, poverty, contempt, and every kind of cross. The Psalmist says,
&#8220;But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.
For I was envious of the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the
wicked.&#8221; At length, after a statement of the case, he concludes,
&#8220;When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me: until I went into
the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end,&#8221; (Ps. 73:2, 3, 16,
17).<br><br>17. Therefore, even from this confession of David, let us learn that the
holy fathers under the Old Testament were not ignorant that in this world God
seldom or never gives his servants the fulfilment of what is promised them, and
therefore has directed their minds to his sanctuary, where the blessings not
exhibited in the present shadowy life are treasured up for them. This sanctuary
was the final judgment of God, which, as they could not at all discern it by the
eye, they were contented to apprehend by faith. Inspired with this confidence,
they doubted not that whatever might happen in the world, a time would at length
arrive when the divine promises would be fulfilled. This is attested by such
expressions as these: &#8220;As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness:
I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness,&#8221; (Psalm 17:15).
&#8220;I am like a green olive tree in the house of God,&#8221; (Psalm 52:8).
Again, &#8220;The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow
like a cedar in Lebanon. Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall
flourish in the courts of our God. They shall still bring forth fruit in old
age; they shall be fat and flourishing,&#8221; (Psalm 92:12&#8211;14). He had
exclaimed a little before &#8220;O Lord, how great are thy works! and thy
thoughts are very deep.&#8221; &#8220;When the wicked spring as the grass, and
when all the workers of iniquity do flourish: it is that they shall be destroyed
for ever.&#8221; Where was this splendour and beauty of the righteous, unless
when the appearance of this world was changed by the manifestation of the
heavenly kingdom? Lifting their eyes to the eternal world, they despised the
momentary hardships and calamities of the present life, and confidently broke
out into these exclamations: &#8220;He shall never suffer the righteous to be
moved. But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction:
bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days,&#8221; (Psalm
55:22, 23). Where in this world is there a pit of eternal destruction to swallow
up the wicked, of whose happiness it is elsewhere said, &#8220;They spend their
days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave?&#8221; (Job 21:13). Where,
on the other hand, is the great stability of the saints, who, as David
complains, are not only disturbed, but everywhere utterly bruised and oppressed?
It is here. He set before his eyes not merely the unstable vicissitudes of the
world, tossed like a troubled sea, but what the Lord is to do when he shall one
day sit to fix the eternal constitution of heaven and earth, as he in another
place elegantly describes: &#8220;They that trust in their wealth, and boast
themselves in the multitude of their riches; none of them can by any means
redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him.&#8221; &#8220;For he sees
that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave
their wealth to others. Their inward thought is, that their houses shall
continue for ever, and their dwelling-places to all generations; they call their
lands after their own names. Nevertheless, man being in honour abideth not: he
is like the beasts that perish. This their way is their folly: yet their
posterity approve their sayings. Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death
shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the
morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling,&#8221;
(Psalm 49:6, 7, 10&#8211;14). By this derision of the foolish for resting
satisfied with the slippery and fickle pleasures, of the world, he shows that
the wise must seek for a very different felicity. But he more clearly unfolds
the hidden doctrine of the resurrection when he sets up a kingdom to the
righteous after the wicked are cast down and destroyed. For what, pray, are we
to understand by the &#8220;morning,&#8221; unless it be the revelation of a new
life, commencing when the present comes to an end?<br><br>18. Hence the
consideration which believers employed as a solace for their sufferings, and a
remedy for their patience: &#8220;His anger endureth but a moment: in his favour
is life,&#8221; (Psalm 30:5). How did their afflictions, which continued almost
throughout the whole course of life, terminate in a moment? Where did they see
the long duration of the divine benignity, of which they had only the slightest
taste? Had they clung to earth, they could have found nothing of the kind; but
looking to heaven, they saw that the period during which the Lord afflicted his
saints was but a moment, and that the mercies with which he gathers them are
everlasting: on the other hand, they foresaw that for the wicked, who only
dreamed of happiness for a day, there was reserved an eternal and never-ending
destruction. Hence those expressions: &#8220;The memory of the just is blessed,
but the name of the wicked shall rot,&#8221; (Prov. 10:7). &#8220;Precious in
the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints,&#8221; (Psalm 116:15). Again
in Samuel: &#8220;The Lord will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked
shall be silent in darkness,&#8221; (1 Sam. 2:9); showing they knew well, that
however much the righteous might be tossed about, their latter end was life and
peace; that how pleasant soever the delights of the wicked, they gradually lead
down to the chambers of death. They accordingly designated the death of such
persons as the death &#8220;of the uncircumcised,&#8221; that is, persons cut
off from the hope of resurrection (Ezek. 28:10; 31:18). Hence David could not
imagine a greater curse than this: &#8220;Let them be blotted out of the book of
the living, and not be written with the righteous,&#8221; (Psalm 69:28).<br><br>19.
The most remarkable passage of all is that of Job: &#8220;I know that my
Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: and
though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:
whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another,&#8221;
(Job 19:25&#8211;27). Those who would make a display of their acuteness, pretend
that these words are to be understood not of the last resurrection, but of the
day when Job expected that God would deal more gently with him. Granting that
this is partly meant, we shall, however, compel them, whether they will or not,
to admit that Job never could have attained to such fulness of hope if his
thoughts had risen no higher than the earth. It must, therefore, be confessed,
that he who saw that the Redeemer would be present with him when lying in the
grave, must have raised his eyes to a future immortality. To those who think
only of the present life, death is the extremity of despair; but it could not
destroy the hope of Job. &#8220;Though he slay me,&#8221; said he, &#8220;yet
will I trust in him,&#8221; (Job 13:15). Let no trifler here burst in with the
objection that these are the sayings of a few, and do not by any means prove
that there was such a doctrine among the Jews. To this my instant answer is,
that these few did not in such passages give utterance to some hidden wisdom, to
which only distinguished individuals were admitted privately and apart from
others, but that having been appointed by the Holy Spirit to be the teachers of
the people, they openly promulgated the mysteries of God, which all in common
behaved to learn as the principles of public religion. When, therefore, we hear
that those passages in which the Holy Spirit spoke so distinctly and clearly of
the spiritual life were public oracles in the Jewish Church, it were intolerably
perverse to confine them entirely to a carnal covenant relating merely to the
earth and earthly riches.<br><br>20. When we descend to the later prophets, we have
it in our power to expatiate freely as in our own field. If, when David, Job,
and Samuel, were in question, the victory was not difficult, much easier is it
here; for the method and economy which God observed in administering the
covenant of his mercy was, that the nearer the period of its full exhibition
approached, the greater the additions which were daily made to the light of
revelation. Accordingly, at the beginning, when the first promise of salvation
was given to Adam (Gen. 3:15), only a few slender sparks beamed forth: additions
being afterwards made, a greater degree of light began to be displayed, and
continued gradually to increase and shine with greater brightness, until at
length all the clouds being dispersed, Christ the Sun of righteousness arose,
and with full refulgence illumined all the earth (Mal. 4). In appealing to the
Prophets, therefore, we can have no fear of any deficiency of proof; but as I
see an immense mass of materials, which would occupy us much longer than
compatible with the nature of our present work (the subject, indeed, would
require a large volume), and as I trust, that by what has already been said, I
have paved the way, so that every reader of the very least discernment may
proceed without stumbling, I will avoid a prolixity, for which at present there
is little necessity; only reminding my readers to facilitate the entrance by
means of the key which was formerly put into their hands (<i>supra</i>, Chap. 4
sec. 3, 4); namely, that whenever the Prophets make mention of the happiness of
believers (a happiness of which scarcely any vestiges are discernible in the
present life), they must have recourse to this distinction: that the better to
commend the Divine goodness to the people, they used temporal blessings as a
kind of lineaments to shadow it forth, and yet gave such a portrait as might
lift their minds above the earth, the elements of this world, and all that will
perish, and compel them to think of the blessedness of a future and spiritual
life.<br><br>21. One example will suffice. When the Israelites were carried away to
Babylon, their dispersion seemed to be the next thing to death, and they could
scarcely be dissuaded from thinking that Ezekiel&#8217;s prophecy of their
restoration (Ezek. 37:4) was a mere fable, because it seemed to them the same
thing as if he had prophesied that putrid caresses would be raised to life. The
Lord, in order to show that, even in that case, there was nothing to prevent him
from making room for his kindness, set before the prophet in vision a field
covered with dry bones, to which, by the mere power of his word, he in one
moment restored life and strength. The vision served, indeed, to correct the
unbelief of the Jews at the time, but it also reminded them how much farther the
power of the Lord extended than to the bringing back of the people, since by a
single nod it could so easily give life to dry scattered bones. Wherefore, the
passage may be fitly compared with one in Isaiah, &#8220;Thy dead men shall
live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell
in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the
dead. Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about
thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be
overpast. For, behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the
inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her
blood, and shall no more cover her slain,&#8221; (Isa. 26:19&#8211;21).<br><br>22.
It were absurd however to interpret all the passages on a similar principle; for
there are several which point without any veil to the future immortality which
awaits believers in the kingdom of heaven. Some of them we have already quoted,
and there are many others, but especially the following two. The one is in
Isaiah, &#8220;As the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall
remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your name remain. And
it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath
to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord. And they
shall go forth, and look upon the caresses of the men that have transgressed
against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched;
and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh,&#8221; (Isa. 66:22&#8211;24). The
other passage is in Daniel. &#8220;At that time shall Michael stand up, the
great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a
time of trouble, such as there never was since there was a nation even to that
same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one shall be
found written in the book. And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth
shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting
contempt,&#8221; (Dan. 12:1, 2).<br><br>23. In proving the two remaining
points&#8212;viz. that the Patriarchs had Christ as the pledge of their
covenant, and placed all their hope of blessing in him, as they are clearer, and
not so much controverted, I will be less particular. Let us then lay it down
confidently as a truth which no engines of the devil can destroy&#8212;that the
Old Testament or covenant which the Lord made with the people of Israel was not
confined to earthly objects, but contained a promise of spiritual and eternal
life, the expectation of which behaved to be impressed on the minds of all who
truly consented to the covenant. Let us put far from us the senseless and
pernicious notion, that the Lord proposed nothing to the Jews, or that they
sought nothing but full supplies of food, carnal delights, abundance of wealth,
external influence, a numerous offspring, and all those things which our animal
nature deems valuable. For, even now, the only kingdom of heaven which our Lord
Jesus Christ promises to his followers, is one in which they may sit down with
Abraham, and Isaac and Jacob (Mt. 8:11); and Peter declared of the Jews of his
day, that they were heirs of gospel grace because they were the sons of the
prophets, and comprehended in the covenant which the Lord of old made with his
people (Acts 3:25). And that this might not be attested by words merely, our
Lord also approved it by act (Mt. 27:52). At the moment when he rose again, he
deigned to make many of the saints partakers of his resurrection, and allowed
them to be seen in the city; thus giving a sure earnest, that every thing which
he did and suffered in the purchase of eternal salvation belonged to believers
under the Old Testament, just as much as to us. Indeed, as Peter testifies, they
were endued with the same spirit of faith by which we are regenerated to life
(Acts 15:8). When we hear that that spirit, which is, as it were, a kind of
spark of immortality in us (whence it is called the &#8220;earnest&#8221; of our
inheritance, Eph. 1:14), dwelt in like manner in them, how can we presume to
deny them the inheritance? Hence, it is the more wonderful how the Sadducees of
old fell into such a degree of sottishness as to deny both the resurrection and
the substantive
existence<sup><font size="2">23</font><a name="fnB94" href="#fn94">[6]</a></sup>
of spirits, both of which where attested to them by so many striking passages of
Scripture. Nor would the stupidity of the whole nation in the present day, in
expecting an earthly reign of the Messiah, be less wonderful, had not the
Scriptures foretold this long before as the punishment which they were to suffer
for rejecting the Gospel, God, by a just judgment, blinding minds which
voluntarily invite darkness, by rejecting the offered light of heaven. They
read, and are constantly turning over the pages of Moses, but a veil prevents
them from seeing the light which beams forth in his countenance (2 Cor. 3:14);
and thus to them he will remain covered and veiled until they are converted to
Christ, between whom and Moses they now study, as much as in them lies, to
maintain a separation.<br><br><br><br></div>

<div align="center">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO TESTAMENTS.<br><br><br><br></div>

difference between the Old and the New Testament, sec. 1&#8211;11. II. The last
of these points being, that the Old Testament belonged to the Jews only, whereas
the New Testament belongs to all; the calling of the Gentiles is shortly

sec. 13, 14.</i><br><br><br><br></div>
<div align="center">Sections.<br><br><br><br></div>
<div>1.	 Five points of difference between the Old and the New Testaments. These
belong to the mode of administration rather than the substance. First
difference. In the Old Testament the heavenly inheritance is exhibited under
temporal blessings; in the New, aids of this description are not
employed.<br><br>2.	 Proof of this first difference from the simile of an heir in
pupillarity, as in Gal. 4:1.<br><br>3.	 This the reason why the Patriarchs, under
the Law, set a higher value on this life and the blessings of it, and dreaded
the punishments, these being even more striking. Why severe and sudden
punishments existed under the Law.<br><br>4.	 A second difference. The Old Testament
typified Christ under ceremonies. The New exhibits the immediate truth and the
whole body. The scope of the Epistle to the Hebrews in explaining this
difference. Definition of the Old Testament.<br><br>5.	 Hence the Law our
Schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ.<br><br>6.	 Notwithstanding, among those under
the Law, some of the strongest examples of faith are exhibited, their equals
being scarcely to be found in the Christian Church. The ordinary method of the
divine dispensation to be here attended to. These excellent individuals placed
under the Law, and aided by ceremonies, that they might behold and hail Christ
afar off.<br><br>7.	 Third difference. The Old Testament is literal, the New
spiritual. This difference considered first generally.<br><br>8.	 Next treated
specially, on a careful examination of the Apostle&#8217;s text. A threefold
antithesis. The Old Testament is literal, deadly, temporary. The New is
spiritual, quickening, eternal. Difference between the letter and the
spirit.<br><br>9.	 Fourth difference. The Old Testament belongs to bondage, the New
to liberty. This confirmed by three passages of Scripture. Two objections
answered.<br><br>10.	 Distinction between the three last differences and the first.
Confirmation of the above from Augustine. Condition of the patriarchs under the
Old Testament.<br><br>11.	 Fifth difference. The Old Testament belonged to one
people only, the New to all.<br><br>12.	 The second part of the chapter depending on
the preceding section. Of the calling of the Gentiles. Why the calling of the
Gentiles scented to the Apostles so strange and new.<br><br>13.	 The last part of
the chapter. Two objections considered. 1. God being immutable, cannot
consistently disapprove what he once ordered. Answer confirmed by a passage of
Scripture.<br><br>14.	Objections. 2. God could at first have transacted with the
Jews as he now does with Christians. Answer, showing the absurdity of this
objection. Another answer founded on a just consideration of the divine will and
the dispensation of grace.<br><br><br><br>1. WHAT, then? you will say, Is there no
difference between the Old and the New Testaments? What is to become of the many
passages of Scripture in which they are contrasted as things differing most
widely from each other? I readily admit the differences which are pointed out in
Scripture, but still hold that they derogate in no respect from their
established unity, as will be seen after we have considered them in their order.
These differences (so far as I have been able to observe them and can remember)
seem to be chiefly four, or, if you choose to add a fifth, I have no objections.
I hold and think I will be able to show, that they all belong to the mode of
administration rather than to the substance. In this way, there is nothing in
them to prevent the promises of the Old and New Testament from remaining the
same, Christ being the foundation of both. The first difference then is, that
though, in old time, the Lord was pleased to direct the thoughts of his people,
and raise their minds to the heavenly inheritance, yet, that their hope of it
might be the better maintained, he held it forth, and, in a manner, gave a
foretaste of it under earthly blessings, whereas the gift of future life, now
more clearly and lucidly revealed by the Gospel, leads our minds directly to
meditate upon it, the inferior mode of exercise formerly employed in regard to
the Jews being now laid aside. Those who attend not to the divine purpose in
this respect, suppose that God&#8217;s ancient people ascended no higher than
the blessings which were promised to the body. They hear the land of Canaan so
often named as the special, and as it were the only, reward of the Divine Law to
its worshipers; they hear that the severest punishment which the Lord denounces
against the transgressors of the Law is expulsion from the possession of that
land and dispersion into other countries; they see that this forms almost the
sum of the blessings and curses declared by Moses; and from these things they
confidently conclude that the Jews were separated from other nations not on
their own account, but for another reason&#8212;viz. that the Christian Church
might have an emblem in whose outward shape might be seen an evidence of
spiritual things. But since the Scripture sometimes demonstrates that the
earthly blessings thus bestowed were intended by God himself to guide them to a
heavenly hope, it shows great unskilfulness, not to say dullness, not to attend
to this mode of dispensation. The ground of controversy is this: our opponents
hold that the land of Canaan was considered by the Israelites as supreme and
final happiness, and now, since Christ was manifested, typifies to us the
heavenly inheritance; whereas we maintain that, in the earthly possession which
the Israelites enjoyed, they beheld, as in a mirror, the future inheritance
which they believed to be reserved for them in heaven.<br><br>2. This will better
appear from the similitude which Paul uses in Galatians (Gal. 4:1). He compares
the Jewish nation to an heir in pupillarity, who, as yet unfit to govern
himself, follows the direction of a tutor or guide to whose charge he has been
committed. Though this simile refers especially to ceremonies, there is nothing
to prevent us from applying it most appropriately here also. The same
inheritance was destined to them as to us, but from nonage they were incapable
of entering to it, and managing it. They had the same Church, though it was
still in puerility. The Lord, therefore kept them under this tutelage, giving
them spiritual promises, not clear and simple, but typified by earthly objects.
Hence, when he chose Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their posterity, to the hope
of immortality, he promised them the land of Canaan for an inheritance, not that
it might be the limit of their hopes, but that the view of it might train and
confirm them in the hope of that true inheritance, which, as yet, appeared not.
And, to guard against delusion, they received a better promise, which attested
that this earth was not the highest measure of the divine kindness. Thus,
Abraham is not allowed to keep down his thoughts to the promised land: by a
greater promise his views are carried upward to the Lord. He is thus addressed,
&#8220;Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward,&#8221;
(Gen. 15:1). Here we see that the Lord is the final reward promised to Abraham
that he might not seek a fleeting and evanescent reward in the elements of this
world, but look to one which was incorruptible. A promise of the land is
afterwards added for no other reason than that it might be a symbol of the
divine benevolence, and a type of the heavenly inheritance, as the saints
declare their understanding to have been. Thus David rises from temporal
blessings to the last and highest of all, &#8220;My flesh and my heart faileth:
but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.&#8221; &#8220;My
heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God,&#8221; (Ps. 73:26; 84:2).
Again, &#8220;The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou
maintainest my lot,&#8221; (Ps. 16:5). Again &#8220;I cried unto thee O Lord: I
said Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living,&#8221; (Ps.
142:5). Those who can venture to speak thus, assuredly declare that their hope
rises beyond the world and worldly blessings. This future blessedness, however,
the prophets often describe under a type which the Lord had taught them. In this
way are to be understood the many passages in Job (Job 18:17) and Isaiah, to the
effect, That the righteous shall inherit the earth, that the wicked shall be
driven out of it, that Jerusalem will abound in all kinds of riches, and Sion
overflow with every species at abundance. In strict propriety, all these things
obviously apply not to the land of our pilgrimage, nor to the earthly Jerusalem,
but to the true country, the heavenly city of believers, in which the Lord has
commanded blessing and life for evermore (Ps. 133:3).<br><br>3. Hence the reason why
the saints under the Old Testament set a higher value on this mortal life and
its blessings than would now be meet. For, though they well knew, that in their
race they were not to halt at it as the goal, yet, perceiving that the Lord, in
accommodation to their feebleness, had there imprinted the lineaments of his
favour, it gave them greater delight than it could have done if considered only
in itself. For, as the Lord, in testifying his good will towards believers by
means of present blessings, then exhibited spiritual felicity under types and
emblems, so, on the other hand, by temporal punishments he gave proofs of his
judgment against the reprobate. Hence, by earthly objects, the favour of the
Lord was displayed, as well as his punishment inflicted. The unskilful, not
considering this analogy and correspondence (if I may so speak) between rewards
and punishments, wonder that there is so much variance in God, that those who,
in old time, were suddenly visited for their faults with severe and dreadful
punishments, he now punishes much more rarely and less severely, as if he had
laid aside his former anger, and, for this reason, they can scarcely help
imagining, like the Manichees, that the God of the Old Testament was different
from that of the New. But we shall easily disencumber ourselves of such doubts
if we attend to that mode of divine administration to which I have
adverted&#8212;that God was pleased to indicate and typify both the gift of
future and eternal felicity by terrestrial blessings, as well as the dreadful
nature of spiritual death by bodily punishments, at that time when he delivered
his covenant to the Israelites as under a kind of veil.<br><br>4. Another
distinction between the Old and New Testaments is in the types, the former
exhibiting only the image of truth, while the reality was absent, the shadow
instead of the substance, the latter exhibiting both the full truth and the
entire body. Mention is usually made of this, whenever the New Testament is
contrasted with the
Old,<sup><font size="2">23</font><a name="fnB95" href="#fn95">[7]</a></sup> but
it is nowhere so fully treated as in the Epistle to the Hebrews (chap.
7&#8211;10). The Apostle is there arguing against those who thought that the
observances of the Mosaic Law could not be abolished without producing the total
ruin of religion. In order to refute this error, he adverts to what the Psalmist
had foretold concerning the priesthood of Christ (Ps. 110:4). seeing that an
eternal priesthood is assigned to him, it is clear that the priesthood in which
there was a daily succession of priests is abolished. And he proves that the
institution of this new Priest must prevail, because confirmed by an oath. He
afterwards adds, that a change of the priest necessarily led to a change of the
covenant. And the necessity of this he confirms by the reason, that the weakness
of the law was such, that it could make nothing perfect. He then goes on to show
in what this weakness consists, namely, that it had external carnal observances
which could not render the worshipers perfect in respect of conscience, because
its sacrifices of beasts could neither take away sins nor procure true holiness.
He therefore concludes that it was a shadow of good things to come, and not the
very image of the things, and accordingly had no other office than to be an
introduction to the better hope which is exhibited in the Gospel.<br><br>Here we may
see in what respect the legal is compared with the evangelical covenant, the
ministry of Christ with that of Moses. If the comparison referred to the
substance of the promises, there would be a great repugnance between the two
covenants; but since the nature of the case leads to a different view, we must
follow it in order to discover the truth. Let us, therefore bring forward the
covenant which God once ratified as eternal and unending. Its completion,
whereby it is fixed and ratified, is Christ. Till such completion takes place,
the Lord, by Moses, prescribes ceremonies which are, as it were formal symbols
of confirmation. The point brought under discussion was, Whether or not the
ceremonies ordained in the Law behaved to give way to Christ. Although these
were merely accidents of the covenant, or at least additions and appendages,
and, as they are commonly called, accessories, yet because they were the means
of administering it, the name of covenant is applied to them, just as is done in
the case of other
sacraments.<sup><font size="2">23</font><a name="fnB96" href="#fn96">[8]</a></sup>
Hence, in general, the Old Testament is the name given to the solemn method of
confirming the covenant comprehended under ceremonies and sacrifices. Since
there is nothing substantial in it, until we look beyond it, the Apostle
contends that it behaved to be annulled and become antiquated (Heb. 7:22), to
make room for Christ, the surety and mediator of a better covenant, by whom the
eternal sanctification of the elect was once purchased, and the transgressions
which remained under the Law wiped away. But if you prefer it, take it thus: the
covenant of the Lord was old, because veiled by the shadowy and ineffectual
observance of ceremonies; and it was therefore temporary, being, as it were in
suspense until it received a firm and substantial confirmation. Then only did it
become new and eternal when it was consecrated and established in the blood of
Christ. Hence the Saviour, in giving the cup to his disciples in the last
supper, calls it the cup of the new testament in his blood; intimating, that the
covenant of God was truly realised, made new, and eternal, when it was sealed
with his blood.<br><br>5. It is now clear in what sense the Apostle said (Gal. 3:24;
4:1), that by the tutelage of the Law the Jews were conducted to Christ, before
he was exhibited in the flesh. He confesses that they were sons and heirs of
God, though, on account of nonage, they were placed under the guardianship of a
tutor. It was fit, the Sun of Righteousness not yet having risen, that there
should neither be so much light of revelation nor such clear understanding. The
Lord dispensed the light of his word, so that they could behold it at a
distance, and obscurely. Accordingly, this slender measure of intelligence is
designated by Paul by the term <i>childhood</i>, which the Lord was pleased to
train by the elements of this world, and external observances, until Christ
should appear. Through him the knowledge of believers was to be matured. This
distinction was noted by our Saviour himself when he said that the Law and the
Prophets were until John, that from that time the gospel of the kingdom was
preached (Mt. 11:13). What did the Law and the Prophets deliver to the men of
their time? They gave a foretaste of that wisdom which was one day to be clearly
manifested, and showed it afar off. But where Christ can be pointed to with the
finger, there the kingdom of God is manifested. In him are contained all the
treasures of wisdom and understanding, and by these we penetrate almost to the
very shrine of heaven.<br><br>6. There is nothing contrary to this in the fact, that
in the Christian Church scarcely one is to be found who, in excellence of faith,
can be compared to Abraham, and that the Prophets were so distinguished by the
power of the Spirit, that even in the present day they give light to the whole
world. For the question here is, not what grace the Lord conferred upon a few,
but what was the ordinary method which he followed in teaching the people, and
which even was employed in the case of those very prophets who were endued with
special knowledge above others. For their preaching was both obscure as relating
to distant objects, and was included in types. Moreover, however wonderful the
knowledge displayed in them, as they were under the necessity of submitting to
the tutelage common to all the people, they must also be ranked among children.
Lastly, none of them ever had such a degree of discernment as not to savour
somewhat of the obscurity of the age. Whence the words of our Saviour,
&#8220;Many kings and prophets have desired to see the things which you see, and
have not seen them, and to hear the things which ye hear, and have not heard
them. Blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear,&#8221;
(Mt. 13:17). And it was right that the presence of Christ should have this
distinguishing feature, that by means of it the revelation of heavenly mysteries
should be made more transparent. To the same effect is the passage which we
formerly quoted from the First Epistle of Peter, that to them it was revealed
that their labour should be useful not so much to themselves as to our
age.<br><br>7. I proceed to the third distinction, which is thus expressed by
Jeremiah: &#8220;Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new
covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah; not according to
the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the
hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt; (which my covenant they brake,
although I was an husband unto them, saith the Lord); but this shall be the
covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the
Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and
will be their God, and they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more
every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, know the Lord: for
they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them,&#8221;
(Jer. 31:31&#8211;34). From these words, the Apostle took occasion to institute
a comparison between the Law and the Gospel, calling the one a doctrine of the
letter, the other a doctrine of the spirit; describing the one as formed on
tables of stone, the other on tables of the heart; the one the preaching of
death, the other of life; the one of condemnation, the other of justification;
the one made void, the other permanent (2 Cor. 3:5, 6). The object of the
Apostle being to explain the meaning of the Prophet, the worlds of the one
furnish us with the means of ascertaining what was understood by both. And yet
there is some difference between them. For the Apostle speaks of the Law more
disparagingly than the Prophet. This he does not simply in respect of the Law
itself, but because there were some false zealots of the Law who, by a perverse
zeal for ceremonies, obscured the clearness of the Gospel, he treats of the
nature of the Law with reference to their error and foolish affection. It will,
therefore, be proper to attend to this peculiarity in Paul. Both, however, as
they are contrasting the Old and New Testament, consider nothing in the Law but
what is peculiar to it. For example, the Law
everywhere<sup><font size="2">23</font><a name="fnB97" href="#fn97">[9]</a></sup>
contains promises of mercy; but as these are adventitious to it, they do not
enter into the account of the Law as considered only in its own nature. All
which is attributed to it is, that it commands what is right, prohibits crimes,
holds forth rewards to the cultivators of righteousness, and threatens
transgressors with punishment, while at the same time it neither changes nor
amends that depravity of heart which is naturally inherent in all.<br><br>8. Let us
now explain the Apostle&#8217;s contrast step by step. The Old Testament is
literal, because promulgated without the efficacy of the Spirit: the New
spiritual, because the Lord has engraven it on the heart. The second antithesis
is a kind of exposition of the first. The Old is deadly, because it can do
nothing but involve the whole human race in a curse; the New is the instrument
of life, because those who are freed from the curse it restores to favour with
God. The former is the ministry of condemnation, because it charges the whole
sons of Adam with transgression; the latter the ministry of righteousness,
because it unfolds the mercy of God, by which we are justified. The last
antithesis must be referred to the Ceremonial Law. Being a shadow of things to
come, it behaved in time to perish and vanish away; whereas the Gospel, inasmuch
as it exhibits the very body, is firmly established for ever. Jeremiah indeed
calls the Moral Law also a weak and fragile covenant; but for another reason,
namely, because it was immediately broken by the sudden defection of an
ungrateful people; but as the blame of such violation is in the people
themselves, it is not properly alleged against the covenant. The ceremonies,
again, inasmuch as through their very weakness they were dissolved by the advent
of Christ, had the cause of weakness from within. Moreover, the difference
between the spirit and the letter must not be understood as if the Lord had
delivered his Law to the Jews without any good result; i.e. as if none had been
converted to him. It is used comparatively to commend the riches of the grace
with which the same Lawgivers assuming, as it were a new characters honoured the
preaching of the Gospel. When we consider the multitude of those whom, by the
preaching of the Gospel, he has regenerated by his, Spirit, and gathered out of
all nations into the communion of his Church, we may say that those of ancient
Israel who, with sincere and heartfelt affections embraced the covenant of the
Lord, were few or none, though the number is great when they are considered in
themselves without comparison.<br><br>9. Out of the third distinction a fourth
arises. In Scripture, the term bondage is applied to the Old Testaments because
it begets fear, and the term freedom to the New, because productive of
confidence and security. Thus Paul says to the Romans, &#8220;Ye have not
received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of
adoption whereby we cry, Abba, Father,&#8221; (Rom. 8:15). To the same effect is
the passage in the Hebrews, &#8220;For ye are not come unto the mount that might
be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and
tempest, and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they
that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more: (for
they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch
the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart: and so terrible
was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake); but ye are come
unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly
Jerusalem,&#8221; &amp;c. (Heb. 12:18&#8211;22). What Paul briefly touches on in
the passage which we have quoted from the Romans, he explains more fully in the
Epistles to the Galatians, where he makes an allegory of the two sons of Abraham
in this way: &#8220;Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem
which now is, and is in bondage with her children. But Jerusalem which is above
is free, which is the mother of us all,&#8221; (Gal. 4:25, 26). As the offspring
of Agar was born in slavery, and could never attain to the inheritances while
that of Sara was free and entitled to the inheritance, so by the Law we are
subjected to slavery, and by the Gospel alone regenerated into liberty. The sum
of the matter comes to this: The Old Testament filled the conscience with fear
and trembling&#8212;The New inspires it with gladness. By the former the
conscience is held in bondage, by the latter it is manumitted and made free. If
it be objected, that the holy fathers among the Israelites, as they were endued
with the same spirit of faith, must also have been partakers of the same liberty
and joy, we answer, that neither was derived from the Law; but feeling that by
the Law they were oppressed like slaves, and vexed with a disquieted conscience,
they fled for refuge to the (gospel; and, accordingly, the peculiar advantage of
the Gospel was, that, contrary to the common rule of the Old Testament, it
exempted those who were under it from those evils. Then, again, we deny that
they did possess the spirit of liberty and security in such a degree as not to
experience some measure of fear and bondage. For however they might enjoy the
privilege which they had obtained through the grace of the Gospel, they were
under the same bonds and burdens of observances as the rest of their nation.
Therefore, seeing they were obliged to the anxious observance of ceremonies
(which were the symbols of a tutelage bordering on slavery, and handwritings by
which they acknowledged their guilt, but did not escape from it), they are
justly said to have been, comparatively, under a covenant of fear and bondage,
in respect of that common dispensation under which the Jewish people were then
placed.<br><br>10. The three last contrasts to which we have adverted (sec. 4, 7,
9), are between the Law and the Gospel, and hence in these the Law is designated
by the name of the Old, and the Gospel by that of the New Testament. The first
is of wider extent (sec. 1), comprehending under it the promises which were
given even before the Law. When Augustine maintained that these were not to be
included under the name of the Old Testament (August. ad Bonifac. lib. 3 c. 14),
he took a most correct view, and meant nothing different from what we have now
taught; for he had in view those passages of Jeremiah and Paul in which the Old
Testament is distinguished from the word of grace and mercy. In the same
passage, Augustine, with great shrewdness remarks, that from the beginning of
the world the sons of promise, the divinely regenerated, who, through faith
working by love, obeyed the commandments, belonged to the New Testament;
entertaining the hope not of carnal, earthly, temporal, but spiritual, heavenly,
and eternal blessings, believing especially in a Mediator, by whom they doubted
not both that the Spirit was administered to them, enabling them to do good, and
pardon imparted as often as they sinned. The thing which he thus intended to
assert was, that all the saints mentioned in Scripture, from the beginning of
the world, as having been specially selected by God, were equally with us
partakers of the blessing of eternal salvation. The only difference between our
division and that of Augustine is, that ours (in accordance with the words of
our Saviour, &#8220;All the prophets and the law prophesied until John,&#8221;
Mt. 11:13) distinguishes between the gospel light and that more obscure
dispensation of the word which preceded it, while the other division simply
distinguishes between the weakness of the Law and the strength of the Gospel.
And here also, with regard to the holy fathers, it is to be observed, that
though they lived under the Old Testament, they did not stop there, but always
aspired to the New, and so entered into sure fellowship with it. Those who,
contented with existing shadows, did not carry their thoughts to Christ, the
Apostle charges with blindness and malediction. To say nothing of other matters,
what greater blindness can be imagined, than to hope for the expiation of sin
from the sacrifice of a beast, or to seek mental purification in external
washing with water, or to attempt to appease God with cold ceremonies, as if he
were greatly delighted with them? Such are the absurdities into which those fall
who cling to legal observances, without respect to Christ.<br><br>11. The fifth
distinction which we have to add consists in this, that until the advent of
Christ, the Lord set apart one nation, to which he confined the covenant of his
grace. Moses says, &#8220;When the Most High divided to the nations their
inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people
according to the number of the children of Israel. For the Lord&#8217;s portion
is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance,&#8221; (Deut. 32:8, 9). In
another passage he thus addresses the people: &#8220;Behold, the heaven and the
heaven of heavens is the Lord&#8217;s thy God, the earth also, with all that
therein is. Only the Lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he
chose their seed, after them, even you, above all people, as it is this
day,&#8221; (Deut. 10:14, 15). That people, therefore, as if they had been the
only part of mankind belonging to him he favoured exclusively with the knowledge
of his name, depositing his covenant, as it were, in their bosom, manifesting to
them the presence of his divinity and honouring them with all privileges. But to
say nothing of other favours, the only one here considered is his binding them
to him by the communion of his word, so that he was called and regarded as their
God. Meanwhile, other nations, as if they had had no kind of intercourse with
him, he allowed to wander in vanity not even supplying them with the only means
of preventing their destructions&#8212;viz. the preaching of his word. Israel
was thus the Lord&#8217;s favourite child the others were aliens. Israel was
known and admitted to trust and guardianship, the others left in darkness;
Israel was made holy, the others were profane; Israel was honoured with the
presence of God, the others kept far aloof from him. But on the fulness of the
time destined to renew all things, when the Mediator between God and man was
manifested the middle wall of partition, which had long kept the divine mercy
within the confines of Israel, was broken down, peace was preached to them who
were afar off, as well as to those who were nigh, that being, together
reconciled to God, they might unite as one people. Wherefore, there is now no
respect of Jew or Greek, of circumcision or uncircumcision, but Christ is all
and in all. To him the heathen have been given for his inheritance, and the
uttermost parts of the earth for his possession (Ps. 2:8), that he may rule
without distinction &#8220;from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of
the earth,&#8221; (Ps. 72:8).<br><br>12. The calling of the Gentiles, therefore, is
a distinguishing feature illustrative of the superiority of the New over the Old
Testament. This, it is true, had been previously declared by the prophets, in
passages both numerous and clear, but still the fulfilment of it was deferred to
the reign of the Messiah. Even Christ did not acknowledge it at the very outset
of his ministry, but delayed it until having completed the whole work of
redemption in all its parts, and finished the period of his humiliation, he
received from the Father &#8220;a name which is above every name, that at the
name of Jesus every knee should bow,&#8221; (Phil. 2:9, 10). Hence the period
being not yet completed, he declared to the woman of Canaan, &#8220;I am not
sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel,&#8221; (Mt. 15:24). Nor in
his first commission to the Apostles does he permit them to pass the same
limits, &#8220;Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the
Samaritans enter ye not: but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of
Israel,&#8221; (Mt. 10:5, 6). However plainly the thing may have been declared
in numerous passages, when it was announced to the Apostles, it seemed to them
so new and extraordinary, that they were horrified at it as something monstrous.
At length, when they did act upon it, it was timorously, and not without
reluctance. Nor is this strange; for it seemed by no means in accordance with
reason, that the Lord, who for so many ages had selected Israel from the rest of
the nations should suddenly, as it were, change his purpose, and abandon his
choice. Prophecy, indeed, had foretold it, but they could not be so attentive to
prophecies, as not to be somewhat startled by the novel spectacle thus presented
to their eye. It was not enough that God had in old times given specimens of the
future calling of the Gentiles. Those whom he had so called were very few in
number, and, moreover, he in a manner adopted them into the family of Abraham,
before allowing them to approach his people. But by this public call, the
Gentiles were not only made equal to the Jews, but seemed to be substituted into
their place, as if the Jews had been
dead.<sup><font size="2">24</font><a name="fnB98" href="#fn98">[0]</a></sup> We
may add, that any strangers whom God had formerly admitted into the body of the
Church, had never been put on the same footing with the Jews. Wherefore, it is
not without cause that Paul describes it as the mystery which has been hid from
ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints (Col.
1:26).<br><br>13. The whole difference between the Old and New Testaments has, I
think, been fully and faithfully explained, under these four or five heads in so
far as requisite for ordinary instruction. But since this variety in governing
the Church, this diversity in the mode of teaching, this great change in rites
and ceremonies, is regarded by some as an absurdity, we must reply to them
before passing to other matters. And this can be done briefly, because the
objections are not so
strong<sup><font size="2">24</font><a name="fnB99" href="#fn99">[1]</a></sup> as
to require a very careful refutation. It is unreasonable they say, to suppose
that Gods who is always consistent With himself permitted such a change as
afterwards to disapprove what he had once ordered and commended. I answer, that
God ought not to be deemed mutable, because he adapts different forms to
different ages, as he knows to be expedient for each. If the husband man
prescribes one set of duties to his household in winter, and another in summer,
we do not therefore charge him with fickleness or think he deviates from the
rules of good husbandry which depends on the regular course of nature. In like
manner, if a father of a family, in educating, governing, and managing his
children, pursues one course in boyhood another in adolescence and another in
manhood we do not therefore say that he is fickle, or abandons his opinions.
Why, then do we charge God with inconstancy when he makes fit and congruous
arrangements for diversities of times? The latter similitude ought to be
completely satisfactory. Paul likens the Jews to children, and Christians to
grown men (Gal. 4:1). What irregularity is there in the Divine arrangement,
which confined them to the rudiments which were suitable to their age, and
trains us by a firmer and more manly discipline? The constancy of God is
conspicuous in this, that he delivered the same doctrine to all ages, and
persists in requiring that worship of his name which he commanded at the
beginning. His changing the external form and manner does not show that he is
liable to change. In so far he has only accommodated himself to the mutable and
diversified capacities of man.<br><br>14. But it is said, Wench this diversity, save
that God chose to make it? Would it not have been as easy for him from the
first, as after the advent of Christ, to reveal eternal life in clear terms
without any figures, to instruct his people by a few clear sacraments, to bestow
his Holy Spirit, and diffuse his grace over the whole globe? This is very much
the same as to bring a charge against God, because he created the world at so
late a period, when he could have done it at the first, or because he appointed
the alternate changes of summer and winter, of clay and night. With the feeling
common to every pious mind, let us not doubt that every thing which God has done
has been done wisely and justly, although we may be ignorant of the cause which
required that it should be so done. We should arrogate too much to ourselves
were we not to concede to God that he may have reasons for his counsel, which we
are unable to discern. It is strange, they say, that he now repudiates and
abominates the sacrifices of beasts, and the whole apparatus of that Levitical
priesthood in which he formerly delighted. As if those external and transient
matters could delight God, or affect him in any
way!<sup><font size="2">24</font><a name="fnB100" href="#fn100">[2]</a></sup> It
has already been observed, that he appointed none of these things on his own
account, but instituted them all for the salvation of men. If a physician,
adopting the best method, effects a cure upon a youth, and afterwards, when the
same individual has grown old, and is again subject to the same disease, employs
a different method of cure, can it be said that he repudiates the method which
he formerly approved? Nay, continuing to approve of it, he only adapts himself
to the different periods of life. In like manner, it was necessary in
representing Christ in his absence, and predicting his future advent, to employ
a different set of signs from those which are employed, now that his actual
manifestation is exhibited. It is true, that since the advent of Christ, the
calling of God is more widely addressed to all nations, and the graces of the
Spirit more liberally bestowed than they had previously been. But who, I ask,
can deny the right of God to have the free and uncontrolled disposal of his
gifts, to select the nations which he may be pleased to illuminate, the places
which he may be pleased to illustrate by the preaching of his word, and the mode
and measure of progress and success which he may be pleased to give to his
doctrine,&#8212;to punish the world for its ingratitude by withdrawing the
knowledge of his name for certain ages, and again, when he so pleases, to
restore it in mercy? We see, then, that in the calumnies which the ungodly
employ in this matter, to perplex the minds of the simple, there is nothing that
ought to throw doubt either on the justice of God or the veracity of
Scripture.<br><br><br><br></div>

Answer. The sum of the doctrine.<br><br><br><br>1. IT deeply concerned us, that he who
was to be our Mediator should be very God and very man. If the necessity be
inquired into, it was not what is commonly termed simple or absolute, but flowed
from the divine decree on which the salvation of man depended. What was best for
us, our most merciful Father determined. Our iniquities, like a cloud
intervening between Him and us, having utterly alienated us from the kingdom of
heaven, none but a person reaching to him could be the medium of restoring
peace. But who could thus reach to him? Could any of the sons of Adam? All of
them, with their parents, shuddered at the sight of God. Could any of the
angels? They had need of a head, by connection with which they might adhere to
their God entirely and inseparably. What then? The case was certainly desperate,
if the Godhead itself did not descend to us, it being impossible for us to
ascend. Thus the Son of God behoved to become our Emmanuel, the God with us; and
in such a way, that by mutual union his divinity and our nature might be
combined; otherwise, neither was the proximity near enough, nor the affinity
strong enough, to give us hope that God would dwell with us; so great was the
repugnance between our pollution and the spotless purity of God. Had man
remained free from all taint, he was of too humble a condition to penetrate to
God without a Mediator. What, then, must it have been, when by fatal ruin he was
plunged into death and hell, defiled by so many stains, made loathsome by
corruption; in fine, overwhelmed with every curse? It is not without cause,
therefore, that Paul, when he would set forth Christ as the Mediator, distinctly
declares him to be man. There is, says he, &#8220;one Mediator between God and
man, the man Christ Jesus,&#8221; (1 Tim. 2:5). He might have called him God, or
at least, omitting to call him God he might also have omitted to call him man;
but because the Spirit, speaking by his mouth, knew our infirmity, he
opportunely provides for it by the most appropriate remedy, setting the Son of
God familiarly before us as one of ourselves. That no one, therefore, may feel
perplexed where to seek the Mediator, or by what means to reach him, the Spirit,
by calling him man, reminds us that he is near, nay, contiguous to us, inasmuch
as he is our flesh. And, indeed, he intimates the same thing in another place,
where he explains at greater length that he is not a high priest who
&#8220;cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all
points tempted like as we are, yet without sin,&#8221; (Heb. 4:15).<br><br>2. This
will become still clearer if we reflect, that the work to be performed by the
Mediator was of no common description: being to restore us to the divine favour,
so as to make us, instead of sons of men, sons of God; instead of heirs of hell,
heirs of a heavenly kingdom. Who could do this unless the Son of God should also
become the Son of man, and so receive what is ours as to transfer to us what is
his, making that which is his by nature to become ours by grace? Relying on this
earnest, we trust that we are the sons of God, because the natural Son of God
assumed to himself a body of our body, flesh of our flesh, bones of our bones,
that he might be one with us; he declined not to take what was peculiar to us,
that he might in his turn extend to us what was peculiarly his own, and thus
might be in common with us both Son of God and Son of man. Hence that holy
brotherhood which he commends with his own lips, when he says, &#8220;I ascend
to my Father, and your Father, to my God, and your God,&#8221; (John 20:17). In
this way, we have a sure inheritance in the heavenly kingdom, because the only
Son of God, to whom it entirely belonged, has adopted us as his brethren; and if
brethren, then partners with him in the inheritance (Rom. 8:17). Moreover, it
was especially necessary for this cause also that he who was to be our Redeemer
should be truly God and man. It was his to swallow up death: who but Life could
do so? It was his to conquer sin: who could do so save Righteousness itself? It
was his to put to flight the powers of the air and the world: who could do so
but the mighty power superior to both? But who possesses life and righteousness,
and the dominion and government of heaven, but God alone? Therefore, God, in his
infinite mercy, having determined to redeem us, became himself our Redeemer in
the person of his only begotten Son.<br><br>3. Another principal part of our
reconciliation with God was, that man, who had lost himself by his disobedience,
should, by way of remedy, oppose to it obedience, satisfy the justice of God,
and pay the penalty of sin. Therefore, our Lord came forth very man, adopted the
person of Adam, and assumed his name, that he might in his stead obey the
Father; that he might present our flesh as the price of satisfaction to the just
judgment of God, and in the same flesh pay the penalty which we had incurred.
Finally, since as God only he could not suffer, and as man only could not
overcome death, he united the human nature with the divine, that he might
subject the weakness of the one to death as an expiation of sin, and by the
power of the other, maintaining a struggle with death, might gain us the
victory. Those, therefore, who rob Christ of divinity or humanity either detract
from his majesty and glory, or obscure his goodness. On the other hand, they are
no less injurious to men, undermining and subverting their faith, which, unless
it rest on this foundation, cannot stand. Moreover, the expected Redeemer was
that son of Abraham and David whom God had promised in the Law and in the
Prophets. Here believers have another advantage. Tracing up his origin in
regular series to David and Abraham, they more distinctly recognise him as the
Messiah celebrated by so many oracles. But special attention must be paid to
what I lately explained, namely, that a common nature is the pledge of our union
with the Son of God; that, clothed with our flesh, he warred to death with sin
that he might be our triumphant conqueror; that the flesh which he received of
us he offered in sacrifice, in order that by making expiation he might wipe away
our guilt, and appease the just anger of his Father.<br><br>4. He who considers
these things with due attention, will easily disregard vague speculations, which
attract giddy minds and lovers of novelty. One speculation of this class is,
that Christ, even though there had been no need of his interposition to redeem
the human race, would still have become man. I admit that in the first ordering
of creation, while the state of nature was entire, he was appointed head of
angels and men; for which reason Paul designates him &#8220;the first-born of
every creature,&#8221; (Col. 1:15). But since the whole Scripture proclaims that
he was clothed with flesh in order to become a Redeemer, it is presumptuous to
imagine any other cause or end. We know well why Christ was at first
promised&#8212;viz. that he might renew a fallen world, and succour lost man.
Hence under the Law he was typified by sacrifices, to inspire believers with the
hope that God would be propitious to them after he was reconciled by the
expiation of their sins. Since from the earliest age, even before the Law was
promulgated, there was never any promise of a Mediator without blood, we justly
infer that he was destined in the eternal counsel of God to purge the pollution
of man, the shedding of blood being the symbol of expiation. Thus, too, the
prophets, in discoursing of him, foretold that he would be the Mediator between
God and man. It is sufficient to refer to the very remarkable prophecy of Isaiah
(Is. 53:4, 5), in which he foretells that he was &#8220;smitten for our
iniquities;&#8221; that &#8220;the chastisement of our peace was upon
him;&#8221; that as a priest &#8220;he was made an offering for sin;&#8221;
&#8220;that by his stripes we are healed;&#8221; that as all &#8220;like lost
sheep have gone astray,&#8221; &#8220;it pleased the Lord to bruise him, and put
him to grief,&#8221; that he might &#8220;bear our iniquities.&#8221; After
hearing that Christ was divinely appointed to bring relief to miserable sinners,
whose overleaps these limits gives too much indulgence to a foolish
curiosity.<br><br>Then when he actually appeared, he declared the cause of his
advent to be, that by appeasing God he might bring us from death unto life. To
the same effect was the testimony of the Apostles concerning him (John 1:9;
10:14). Thus John, before teaching that the Word was made flesh, narrates the
fall of man. But above all, let us listen to our Saviour himself when
discoursing of his office: &#8220;God so loved the world, that he gave his only
begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
everlasting life.&#8221; Again, &#8220;The hour is coming, and now is, when the
dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall
live.&#8221; &#8220;I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.&#8221; &#8220;The Son of man is come to
save that which was lost.&#8221; Again, &#8220;They that be whole need not a
physician.&#8221;<sup><font size="2">24</font><a name="fnB101" href="#fn101">[3]</a></sup>
I should never have done were I to quote all the passages. Indeed, the Apostles,
with one consent, lead us back to this fountain; and assuredly, if he had not
come to reconcile God, the honour of his priesthood would fall, seeing it was
his office as priest to stand between God and men, and &#8220;offer both gifts
and sacrifices for sins,&#8221; (Heb. 5:1); nor could he be our righteousness,
as having been made a propitiation for us in order that God might not impute to
us our sins (2 Cor. 5:19). In short, he would be stript of all the titles with
which Scripture invests him. Nor could Paul&#8217;s doctrine stand &#8220;What
the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own
Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the
flesh,&#8221; (Rom. 8:3). Nor what he states in another passage: &#8220;The
grace of God that bringeth salvation has appeared to all men,&#8221; (Tit.
2:11). In fine, the only end which the Scripture uniformly assigns for the Son
of God voluntarily assuming our nature, and even receiving it as a command from
the Father, is, that he might propitiate the Father to us by becoming a victim.
&#8220;Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to
suffer;&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;and that repentance and remission of sins should be
preached in his name.&#8221; &#8220;Therefore does my Father love me, because I
lay down my life, that I might take it again.&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;This
commandment have I received of my Father.&#8221; &#8220;As Moses lifted up the
serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up.&#8221;
&#8220;Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.
Father, glorify thy
name.&#8221;<sup><font size="2">24</font><a name="fnB102" href="#fn102">[4]</a></sup>
Here he distinctly assigns as the reason for assuming our nature, that he might
become a propitiatory victim to take away sin. For the same reason Zacharias
declares (Luke 1:79), that he came &#8220;to perform the mercy promised to our
fathers,&#8221; &#8220;to give light to them that sit in darkness, and in the
shadow of death.&#8221; Let us remember that all these things are affirmed of
the Son of God, in whom, as Paul elsewhere declares, were &#8220;hid all the
treasures of wisdom and knowledge,&#8221; and save whom it was his determination
&#8220;not to know any thing,&#8221; (Col. 2:3; 1 Cor. 2:2).<br><br>5. Should any
one object, that in this there is nothing to prevent the same Christ who
redeemed us when condemned from also testifying his love to us when safe by
assuming our nature, we have the brief answer, that when the Spirit declares
that by the eternal decree of God the two things were connected
together&#8212;viz. that Christ should be our Redeemer, and, at the same time, a
partaker of our nature, it is unlawful to inquire further. He who is tickled
with a desire of knowing something more, not contented with the immutable
ordination of God, shows also that he is not even contented with that Christ who
has been given us as the price of redemption. And, indeed, Paul not only
declares for what end he was sent, but rising to the sublime mystery of
predestination, seasonably represses all the wantonness and prurience of the
human mind. &#8220;He has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world,
that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: having
predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself,
according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his
grace, wherein he has made us accepted in the Beloved: In whom we have
redemption through his blood,&#8221; (Eph. 1:4&#8211;7). Here certainly the fall
of Adam is not presupposed as anterior in point of time, but our attention is
directed to what God predetermined before all ages, when he was pleased to
provide a cure for the misery of the human race. If, again, it is objected that
this counsel of God depended on the fall of man, which he foresaw, to me it is
sufficient and more to reply, that those who propose to inquire, or desire to
know more of Christ than God predestinated by his secret decree, are presuming
with impious audacity to invent a new Christ. Paul, when discoursing of the
proper office of Christ, justly prays for the Ephesians that God would
strengthen them &#8220;by his Spirit in the inner man,&#8221; that they might
&#8220;be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length, and
depth and height; and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge,&#8221;
(Eph. 3:16, 18); as if he intended of set purpose to set barriers around our
minds, and prevent them from declining one iota from the gift of reconciliation
whenever mention is made of Christ. Wherefore, seeing it is as Paul declares it
to be, &#8220;a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ
Jesus came into the world to save sinners,&#8221; (1 Tim. 1:15), in it I
willingly acquiesce. And since the same Apostle elsewhere declares that the
grace which is now manifested by the Gospel &#8220;was given us in Christ Jesus
before the world began,&#8221; (2 Tim. 1:9), I am resolved to adhere to it
firmly even to the end. This moderation is unjustly vituperated by Osiander, who
has unhappily, in the present day, again agitated this question, which a few had
formerly raised. He brings a charge of overweening confidence against those who
deny that the Son of God would have appeared in the flesh if Adam had not
fallen, because this notion is not repudiated by any passage of Scripture. As if
Paul did not lay a curb on perverse curiosity when after speaking of the
redemption obtained by Christ, he bids us &#8220;avoid foolish questions,&#8221;
(Tit. 3:9). To such insanity have some proceeded in their preposterous eagerness
to seem acute, that they have made it a question whether the Son of God might
not have assumed the nature of an ass. This blasphemy, at which all pious minds
justly shudder with detestation, Osiander excuses by the pretext that it is no
where distinctly refuted in Scripture; as if Paul, when he counted nothing
valuable or worth knowing &#8220;save Jesus Christ and him crucified,&#8221; (I
Cor. 2:2), were admitting, that the author of salvation is an ass. He who
elsewhere declares that Christ was by the eternal counsel of the Father
appointed &#8220;head over all things to the church,&#8221; would never have
acknowledged another to whom no office of redemption had been assigned.<br><br>6.
The principle on which Osiander founds is altogether frivolous. He will have it
that man was created in the image of God, inasmuch as he was formed on the model
of the future Messiah, in order to resemble him whom the Father had already
determined to clothe with flesh. Hence he infers, that though Adam had never
fallen from his first and pure original, Christ would still have been man. How
silly and distorted this view is, all men of sound judgment at once discern;
still he thinks he was the first to see what the image of God was, namely, that
not only did the divine glory shine forth in the excellent endowments with which
he was adorned, but God dwelt in him essentially. But while I grant that Adam
bore the image of God, inasmuch as he was united to God (this being the true and
highest perfection of dignity), yet I maintain, that the likeness of God is to
be sought for only in those marks of superiority with which God has
distinguished Adam above the other animals. And likewise, with one consent,
acknowledge that Christ was even then the image of God, and, accordingly,
whatever excellence was engraven on Adam had its origin in this, that by means
of the only begotten Son he approximated to the glory of his Maker. Man,
therefore, was created in the image of God (Gen. 1:27), and in him the Creator
was pleased to behold, as in a mirror, his own glory. To this degree of honour
he was exalted by the kindness of the only begotten Son. But I add, that as the
Son was the common head both of men and angels, so the dignity which was
conferred on man belonged to the angels also. For when we hear them called the
sons of God (Ps. 82:6), it would be incongruous to deny that they were endued
with some quality in which they resembled the Father. But if he was pleased that
his glory should be represented in men and angels, and made manifest in both
natures, it is ignorant trifling in Osiander to say, that angels were postponed
to men, because they did not bear the image of Christ. They could not constantly
enjoy the immediate presence of God if they were not like to him; nor does Paul
teach (Col. 3:10) that men are renewed in the image of God in any other way than
by being associated with angels, that they may be united together under one
head. In fine, if we believe Christ, our felicity will be perfected when we
shall have been received into the heavens, and made like the angels. But if
Osiander is entitled to infer that the primary type of the image of God was in
the man Christ, on the same ground may any one maintain that Christ behoved to
partake of the angelic nature, seeing that angels also possess the image of
God.<br><br>7. Osiander has no reason to fear that God would be found a liar, if the
decree to incarnate the Son was not previously immutably fixed in his mind. Even
had Adam not lost his integrity, he would, with the angels, have been like to
God; and yet it would not therefore have been necessary that the Son of God
should become either a man or an angel. In vain does he entertain the absurd
fear, that unless it had been determined by the immutable counsel of God, before
man was created, that Christ should be born, not as the Redeemer, but as the
first man, he might lose his precedence, since he would not have been born,
except for an accidental circumstance, namely, that he might restore the lost
race of man; and in this way would have been created in the image of Adam. For
why should he be alarmed at what the Scripture plainly teaches, that &#8220;he
was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin?&#8221; (Heb. 4:15).
Hence Luke, also, hesitates not to reckon him in his genealogy as a son of Adam
(Luke 3:38). I should like to know why Christ is termed by Paul the second Adam
(1 Cor. 15:47), unless it be that a human condition was decreed him, for the
purpose of raising up the ruined posterity of Adam. For if in point of order,
that condition was antecedent to creation, he ought to have been called the
first Adam. Osiander confidently affirms, that because Christ was in the purpose
of God foreknown as man, men were formed after him as their model. But Paul, by
calling him the second Adam, gives that revolt which made it necessary to
restore nature to its primitive condition an intermediate place between its
original formation and the restitution which we obtain by Christ: hence it
follows, that it was this restitution which made the Son of God be born, and
thereby become man. Moreover, Osiander argues ill and absurdly, that as long as
Adam maintained his integrity, he would have been the image of himself, and not
of Christ. I maintain, on the contrary, that although the Son of God had never
become incarnate, nevertheless the image of God was conspicuous in Adam, both in
his body and his soul; in the rays of this image it always appeared that Christ
was truly head, and had in all things the pre-eminence. In this way we dispose
of the futile sophism put forth by Osiander, that the angels would have been
without this head, had not God purposed to clothe his Son with flesh, even
independent of the sin of Adam. He inconsiderately assumes what no rational
person will grant, that Christ could have had no supremacy over the angels, so
that they might enjoy him as their prince, unless in so far as he was man. But
it is easy to infer from the words of Paul (Col. 1:15), that inasmuch as he is
the eternal Word of God, he is the first-born of every creature, not because he
is created, or is to be reckoned among the creatures, but because the entire
structure of the world, such as it was from the beginning, when adorned with
exquisite beauty had no other beginning; then, inasmuch as he was made man, he
is the first-born from the dead. For in one short passage (Col. 1:16&#8211;18),
the Apostle calls our attention to both views: that by the Son all things were
created, so that he has dominion over angels; and that he became man, in order
that he might begin to be a Redeemer. Owing to the same ignorance, Osiander says
that men would not have had Christ for their king unless he had been a man; as
if the kingdom of God could not have been established by his eternal Son, though
not clothed with human flesh, holding the supremacy while angels and men were
gathered together to participate in his celestial life and glory. But he is
always deluded, or imposes upon himself by this false principle, that the church
would have been akefalon&#8212;without a head&#8212;had not Christ appeared in
the flesh. In the same way as angels enjoyed him for their head, could he not by
his divine energy preside over men, and by the secret virtue of his Spirit
quicken and cherish them as his body, until they were gathered into heaven to
enjoy the same life with the angels? The absurdities which I have been refuting,
Osiander regards as infallible oracles. Taking an intoxicating delight in his
own speculations, his wont is to extract ridiculous plans out of nothing. He
afterwards says that he has a much stronger passage to produce, namely, the
prophecy of Adam, who, when the woman was brought to him, said, &#8220;This is
now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh,&#8221; (Gen. 2:23). But how does he
prove it to be a prophecy? Because in Matthew Christ attributes the same
expression to God! as if every thing which God has spoken by man contained a
prophecy. On the same principle, as the law proceeded from God, let Osiander in
each precept find a prophecy. Add, that our Saviour&#8217;s exposition would
have been harsh and grovelling, had he confined himself to the literal meaning.
He was not referring to the mystical union with which he has honoured the
Church, but only to conjugal fidelity, and states, that the reason why God
declared man and wife to be one flesh, was to prevent any one from violating
that indissoluble tie by divorce. If this simple meaning is too low for
Osiander, let him censure Christ for not leading his disciples to the hidden
sense, by interpreting his Father&#8217;s words with more subtlety. Paul gives
no countenance to Osiander&#8217;s dream, when, after saying that &#8220;we are
members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones,&#8221; he immediately adds,
&#8220;This is a great mystery,&#8221; (Eph. 5:30&#8211;32). For he meant not to
refer to the sense in which Adam used the words, but sets forth, under the
figure and similitude of marriage, the sacred union which makes us one with
Christ. His words have this meaning; for reminding us that he is speaking of
Christ and the Church, he, by way of correction, distinguishes between the
marriage tie and the spiritual union of Christ with his Church. Wherefore, this
subtlety vanishes at once. I deem it unnecessary to discuss similar absurdities:
for from this very brief refutation, the vanity of them all will be discovered.
Abundantly sufficient for the solid nurture of the children of God is this sober
truth, that &#8220;when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his
Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them who were under the
law,&#8221; (Gal. 4:4, 5).<br><br><br><br></div>

objections answered.<br><br><br><br>1. OF the divinity of Christ, which has elsewhere
been established by clear and solid proofs, I presume it were superfluous again
to treat. It remains, therefore, to see how, when clothed with our flesh, he
fulfilled the office of Mediator. In ancient times, the reality of his human
nature was impugned by the Manichees and Marcionites, the latter figuring to
themselves a phantom instead of the body of Christ, and the former dreaming of
his having been invested with celestial flesh. The passages of Scripture
contradictory to both are numerous and strong. The blessing is not promised in a
heavenly seed, or the mask of a man, but the seed of Abraham and Jacob; nor is
the everlasting throne promised to an aerial man, but to the Son of David, and
the fruit of his loins. Hence, when manifested in the flesh, he is called the
Son of David and Abraham, not because he was born of a virgin, and yet created
in the air, but because, as Paul explains, he was &#8220;made of the seed of
David, according to the flesh,&#8221; (Rom. 1:3), as the same apostle elsewhere
says, that he came of the Jews (Rom. 9:5). Wherefore, our Lord himself not
contented with the name of man, frequently calls himself the Son of man, wishing
to express more clearly that he was a man by true human descent. The Holy Spirit
having so often, by so many organs, with so much care and plainness, declared a
matter which in itself is not abstruse, who could have thought that mortals
would have had the effrontery to darken it with their glosses? Many other
passages are at hand, were it wished to produce more: for instance, that one of
Paul, that &#8220;God sent forth his Son, made of a woman,&#8221; (Gal. 4:4),
and innumerable others, which show that he was subject to hunger, thirst, cold,
and the other infirmities of our nature. But from the many we must chiefly
select those which may conduce to build up our minds in true faith, as when it
is said, &#8220;Verily, he took not on him the nature of angels, but he took on
him the seed of Abraham,&#8221; &#8220;that through death he might destroy him
that had the power of death,&#8221; (Heb. 2:16, 14). Again, &#8220;Both he that
sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is
not ashamed to call them brethren.&#8221; &#8220;Wherefore in all things it
behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and
faithful high priest.&#8221; (Heb. 2:11, 17). Again &#8220;We have not an high
priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities,&#8221; (Heb.
4:15), and the like. To the same effect is the passage to which we lately
referred, in which Paul distinctly declares, that the sins of the world behoved
to be expiated in our flesh (Rom. 8:3). And certainly every thing which the
Father conferred on Christ pertains to us for this reason, that &#8220;he is the
head,&#8221; that from him the whole body is &#8220;fitly joined together, and
compacted by that which every joint supplieth,&#8221; (Eph. 4:16). Nay, in no
other way could it hold true as is said, that the Spirit was given to him
without measure (John 1:16), and that out of his fulness have all we received;
since nothing could be more absurd than that God, in his own essence, should be
enriched by an adventitious gift. For this reason also, Christ himself elsewhere
says, &#8220;For their sakes I sanctify myself,&#8221; (John 17:19).<br><br>2. The
passages which they produce in confirmation of their error are absurdly wrested,
nor do they gain any thing by their frivolous subtleties when they attempt to do
away with what I have now adduced in opposition to them. Marcion imagines that
Christ, instead of a body, assumed a phantom, because it is elsewhere said, that
he was made in the likeness of man, and found in fashion as a man. Thus he
altogether overlooks what Paul is then discussing (Phil. 2:7). His object is not
to show what kind of body Christ assumed, but that, when he might have justly
asserted his divinity he was pleased to exhibit nothing but the attributes of a
mean and despised man. For, in order to exhort us to submission by his example,
he shows, that when as God he might have displayed to the world the brightness
of his glory, he gave up his right, and voluntarily emptied himself; that he
assumed the form of a servant, and, contented with that humble condition,
suffered his divinity to be concealed under a veil of flesh. Here,
unquestionably, he explains not what Christ was, but in what way he acted. Nay,
from the whole context it is easily gathered, that it was in the true nature of
man that Christ humbled himself. For what is meant by the words, he was
&#8220;found in fashion as a man,&#8221; but that for a time, instead of being
resplendent with divine glory, the human form only appeared in a mean and abject
condition? Nor would the words of Peter, that he was &#8220;put to death in the
flesh, but quickened by the Spirits&#8221; (1 Pet. 3:18), hold true, unless the
Son of God had become weak in the nature of man. This is explained more clearly
by Paul, when he declares that &#8220;he was crucified through weakness,&#8221;
(2 Cor. 13:4). And hence his exaltation; for it is distinctly said, that Christ
acquired new glory after he humbled himself. This could fitly apply only to a
man endued with a body and a soul. Manes dreams of an aerial body, because
Christ is called the second Adam, the Lord from heaven. But the apostle does not
there speak of the essence of his body as heavenly, but of the spiritual life
which derived from Christ quickens us (I Cor. 15:47). This life Paul and Peter,
as we have seen, separate from his flesh. Nay, that passage admirably confirms
the doctrine of the orthodox, as to the human nature of Christ. If his body were
not of the same nature with ours, there would be no soundness in the argument
which Paul pursues with so much earnestness,&#8212;If Christ is risen we shall
rise also; if we rise not, neither has Christ risen. Whatever be the cavils by
which the ancient Manichees, or their modern disciples, endeavour to evade this,
they cannot succeed. It is a frivolous and despicable evasion to say, that
Christ is called the Son of man, because he was promised to men; it being
obvious that, in the Hebrew idiom, the Son of man means a true man: and Christ,
doubtless, retained the idiom of his own
tongue.<sup><font size="2">24</font><a name="fnB103" href="#fn103">[5]</a></sup>
Moreover, there cannot be a doubt as to what is to be understood by the sons of
Adam. Not to go farther, a passage in the eighth psalm, which the apostles apply
to Christ, will abundantly suffice: &#8220;What is man, that thou art mindful of
him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?&#8221; (Ps 8:4). Under this
figure is expressed the true humanity of Christ. For although he was not
immediately descended of an earthly father, yet he originally sprang from Adam.
Nor could it otherwise be said in terms of the passage which we have already
quoted, &#8220;Forasmuch, then, as the children are partakers of flesh and
blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same;&#8221; these words
plainly proving that he was an associate and partner in the same nature with
ourselves. In this sense also it is said, that &#8220;both he that sanctifieth
and they who are sanctified are all of one.&#8221; The context proves that this
refers to a community of nature; for it is immediately added, &#8220;For which
cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,&#8221; (Heb. 2:11). Had he said
at first that believers are of God, where could there have been any ground for
being ashamed of persons possessing such dignity? But when Christ of his
boundless grace associates himself with the mean and ignoble, we see why it was
said that &#8220;he is not ashamed.&#8221; It is vain to object, that in this
way the wicked will be the brethren of Christ; for we know that the children of
God are not born of flesh and blood, but of the Spirit through faith. Therefore,
flesh alone does not constitute the union of brotherhood. But although the
apostle assigns to believers only the honour of being one with Christ, it does
not however follow, that unbelievers have not the same origin according to the
flesh; just as when we say that Christ became man, that he might make us sons of
God, the expression does not extend to all classes of persons; the intervention
of faith being necessary to our being spiritually ingrafted into the body of
Christ. A dispute is also ignorantly raised as to the term <i>first-born</i>. It
is alleged that Christ ought to have been the first son of Adam, in order that
he might be the first-born among the brethren (Rom. 8:29). But primogeniture
refers not to age, but to degree of honour and pre-eminence of virtue. There is
just as little colour for the frivolous assertion that Christ assumed the nature
of man, and not that of angels (Heb. 2:16), because it was the human race that
he restored to favour. The apostle, to magnify the honour which Christ has
conferred upon us, contrasts us with the angels, to whom we are in this respect
preferred. And if due weight is given to the testimony of Moses (Gen. 3:15),
when he says that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent,
the dispute is at an end. For the words there used refer not to Christ alone,
but to the whole human race. Since the victory was to be obtained for us by
Christ, God declares generally, that the posterity of the woman would overcome
the devil. From this it follows, that Christ is a descendant of the human race,
the purpose of God in thus addressing Eve being to raise her hopes, and prevent
her from giving way to despair.<br><br>3. The passages in which Christ is called the
seed of Abraham, and the fruit of the loins of David, those persons, with no
less folly than wickedness, wrap up in allegory. Had the term <i>seed</i> been
used allegorically, Paul surely would not have omitted to notice it, when he
affirms clearly, and without figure, that the promise was not given &#8220;to
seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ,&#8221; (Gal.
3:16). With similar absurdity they pretend that he was called the Son of David
for no other reason but because he had been promised, and was at length in due
time manifested. For Paul, after he had called him the Son of David, by
immediately subjoining &#8220;<i>according to the flesh</i>&#8221;, certainly
designates his nature. So also (Rom. 9:5), while declaring him to be &#8220;God
blessed for ever,&#8221; he mentions separately, that, &#8220;as concerning the
flesh, he was descended from the Jews.&#8221; Again if he had not been truly
begotten of the seed of David, what is the meaning of the expression, that he is
the &#8220;fruit of his loins;&#8221; or what the meaning of the promise,
&#8220;Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne?&#8221; (Ps. 132:11).
Moreover their mode of dealing with the genealogy of Christ, as given by
Matthew, is mere sophistry; for though he reckons up the progenitors not of
Mary, but of Joseph, yet as he was speaking of a matter then generally
understood, he deems it enough to show that Joseph was descended from the seed
of David, since it is certain that Mary was of the same family. Luke goes still
farther, showing that the salvation brought by Christ is common to the whole
human race, inasmuch as Christ, the author of salvation, is descended from Adam,
the common father of us all. I confess, indeed, that the genealogy proves Christ
to be the Son of David only as being descended of the Virgin; but the new
Marcionites, for the purpose of giving a gloss to their heresy, namely to prove
that the body which Christ assumed was unsubstantial, too confidently maintain
that the expression as to seed is applicable only to males, thus subverting the
elementary principles of nature. But as this discussion belongs not to theology,
and the arguments which they adduce are too futile to require any laboured
refutation, I will not touch on matters pertaining to philosophy and the medical
art. It will be sufficient to dispose of the objection drawn from the statement
of Scripture, that Aaron and Jehoiadah married wives out of the tribe of Judah,
and that thus the distinction of tribes was confounded, if proper descent could
come through the female. It is well known, that in regard to civil order,
descent is reckoned through the male; and yet the superiority on his part does
not prevent the female from having her proper share in the descent. This
solution applies to all the genealogies. When Scripture gives a list of
individuals, it often mentions males only. Must we therefore say that females go
for nothing? Nay, the very children know that they are classified with men. For
this reasons wives are said to give children to their husbands, the name of the
family always remaining with the males. Then, as the male sex has this
privilege, that sons are deemed of noble or ignoble birth, according to the
condition of their fathers, so, on the other hand, in slavery, the condition of
the child is determined by that of the mother, as lawyers say, <i>partus
sequitur ventrem</i>. Whence we may infer, that offspring is partly procreated
by the seed of the mother. According to the common custom of nations, mothers
are deemed progenitors, and with this the divine law agrees, which could have
had no ground to forbid the marriage of the uncle with the niece, if there was
no consanguinity between them. It would also be lawful for a brother and sister
uterine to intermarry, when their fathers are different. But while I admit that
the power assigned to the woman is passive, I hold that the same thing is
affirmed indiscriminately of her and of the male. Christ is not said to have
been made by a woman, but of a woman (Gal. 4:4). But some of this herd, laying
aside all shame, publicly ask whether we mean to maintain that Christ was
procreated of the proper seed of a
Virgin.<sup><font size="2">24</font><a name="fnB104" href="#fn104">[6]</a></sup>
I, in my turn, asks whether they are not forced to admit that he was nourished
to maturity in the Virgin&#8217;s womb. Justly, therefore, we infer from the
words of Matthew, that Christ, inasmuch as he was begotten of Mary, was
procreated of her seed; as a similar generation is denoted when Boaz is said to
have been begotten of Rachab (Mt. 1:5, 16). Matthew does not here describe the
Virgin as the channel through which Christ flowed, but distinguishes his
miraculous from an ordinary birth, in that Christ was begotten by her of the
seed of David. For the same reason for which Isaac is said to be begotten of
Abraham, Joseph of Jacob, Solomon of David, is Christ said to have been begotten
of his mother. The Evangelist has arranged his discourse in this way. Wishing to
prove that Christ derives his descent from David, he deems it enough to state,
that he was begotten of Mary. Hence it follows, that he assumed it as an
acknowledged fact, that Mary was of the same lineage as Joseph.<br><br>4. The
absurdities which they wish to fasten upon us are mere puerile calumnies. They
reckon it base and dishonouring to Christ to have derived his descent from men;
because, in that case, he could not be exempted from the common law which
includes the whole offspring of Adam, without exception, under sin. But this
difficulty is easily solved by Paul&#8217;s antithesis, &#8220;As by one man sin
entered into the world, and death by sin&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;even so by the
righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of
life,&#8221; (Rom. 5:12, 18). Corresponding to this is another passage,
&#8220;The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from
heaven,&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:47). Accordingly, the same apostle, in another
passage, teaching that Christ was sent &#8220;in the likeness of sinful flesh,
that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us,&#8221; distinctly
separates him from the common lot, as being true man, and yet without fault and
corruption (Rom. 8:3). It is childish trifling to maintain, that if Christ is
free from all taint, and was begotten of the seed of Mary, by the secret
operation of the Spirit, it is not therefore the seed of the woman that is
impure, but only that of the man. We do not hold Christ to be free from all
taint, merely because he was born of a woman unconnected with a man, but because
he was sanctified by the Spirit, so that the generation was pure and spotless,
such as it would have been before Adam&#8217;s fall. Let us always bear in mind,
that wherever Scripture adverts to the purity of Christ, it refers to his true
human nature, since it were superfluous to say that God is pure. Moreover, the
sanctification of which John speaks in his seventeenth chapter is inapplicable
to the divine nature. This does not suggest the idea of a twofold seed in Adam,
although no contamination extended to Christ, the generation of man not being in
itself vicious or impure, but an accidental circumstance of the fall. Hence, it
is not strange that Christ, by whom our integrity was to be restored, was
exempted from the common corruption. Another absurdity which they obtrude upon
us&#8212;viz. that if the Word of God became incarnate, it must have been
enclosed in the narrow tenement of an earthly body, is sheer petulance. For
although the boundless essence of the Word was united with human nature into one
person, we have no idea of any enclosing. The Son of God descended miraculously
from heaven, yet without abandoning heaven; was pleased to be conceived
miraculously in the Virgin&#8217;s womb, to live on the earth, and hang upon the
cross, and yet always filled the world as from the beginning.<br><br><br><br></div>

pestilential heresies of Servetus.<br><br><br><br>1. WHEN it is said that the Word was
made flesh, we must not understand it as if he were either changed into flesh,
or confusedly intermingled with flesh, but that he made choice of the
Virgin&#8217;s womb as a temple in which he might dwell. He who was the Son of
God became the Son of man, not by confusion of substance, but by unity of
person. For we maintain, that the divinity was so conjoined and united with the
humanity, that the entire properties of each nature remain entire, and yet the
two natures constitute only one Christ. If, in human affairs, any thing
analogous to this great mystery can be found, the most apposite
similitude<sup><font size="2">24</font><a name="fnB105" href="#fn105">[7]</a></sup>
seems to be that of man, who obviously consists of two substances, neither of
which however is so intermingled with the other as that both do not retain their
own properties. For neither is soul body, nor is body soul. Wherefore that is
said separately of the soul which cannot in any way apply to the body; and that,
on the other hand, of the body which is altogether inapplicable to the soul; and
that, again, of the whole man, which cannot be affirmed without absurdity either
of the body or of the soul separately. Lastly, the properties of the soul are
transferred to the body, and the properties of the body to the soul, and yet
these form only one man, not more than one. Such modes of expression intimate
both that there is in man one person formed of two compounds, and that these two
different natures constitute one person. Thus the Scriptures speak of Christ.
They sometimes attribute to him qualities which should be referred specially to
his humanity and sometimes qualities applicable peculiarly to his divinity, and
sometimes qualities which embrace both natures, and do not apply specially to
either. This combination of a twofold nature in Christ they express so
carefully, that they sometimes communicate them with each other, a figure of
speech which the ancients termed ijdiwmavtwn koinoniva (a communication of
properties).<br><br>2. Little dependence could be placed on these statements, were
it not proved by numerous passages throughout the sacred volume that none of
them is of man&#8217;s devising. What Christ said of himself, &#8220;Before
Abraham was I am,&#8221; (John 8:58), was very foreign to his humanity. I am not
unaware of the cavil by which erroneous spirits distort this passage&#8212;viz.
that he was before all ages, inasmuch as he was foreknown as the Redeemer, as
well in the counsel of the Father as in the minds of believers. But seeing he
plainly distinguishes the period of his manifestation from his eternal
existence, and professedly founds on his ancient government, to prove his
precedence to Abraham, he undoubtedly claims for himself the peculiar attributes
of divinity. Paul&#8217;s assertion that he is &#8220;the first-born of every
creature,&#8221; that &#8220;he is before all things, and by him all things
consist,&#8221; (Col. 1:15, 17); his own declaration, that he had glory with the
Father before the world was, and that he worketh together with the Father, are
equally inapplicable to man. These and similar properties must be specially
assigned to his divinity. Again, his being called the servant of the Father, his
being said to grow in stature, and wisdom, and favour with God and man, not to
seek his own glory, not to know the last day, not to speak of himself, not to do
his own will, his being seen and
handled,<sup><font size="2">24</font><a name="fnB106" href="#fn106">[8]</a></sup>
apply entirely to his humanity; since, as God, he cannot be in any respect said
to grow, works always for himself, knows every thing, does all things after the
counsel of his own will, and is incapable of being seen or handled. And yet he
not merely ascribes these things separately to his human nature, but applies
them to himself as suitable to his office of Mediator. There is a communication
of ijdiwvmata, or properties, when Paul says, that God purchased the Church
&#8220;with his own blood,&#8221; (Acts 20:28), and that the Jews crucified the
Lord of glory (1 Cor. 2:8). In like manner, John says, that the Word of God was
&#8220;handled.&#8221; God certainly has no blood, suffers not, cannot be
touched with hands; but since that Christ, who was true God and true man, shed
his blood on the cross for us, the acts which were performed in his human nature
are transferred improperly, but not ceaselessly, to his divinity. We have a
similar example in the passage where John says that God laid down his life for
us (1 John 3:16). Here a property of his humanity is communicated with his other
nature. On the other hand, when Christ, still living on the earth, said,
&#8220;No man has ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, even
the Son of man, which is in heaven,&#8221; (John 3:13), certainly regarded as
man in the flesh which he had put on, he was not then in heaven, but inasmuch as
he was both God and man, he, on account of the union of a twofold nature,
attributed to the one what properly belonged to the other.<br><br>3. But, above all,
the true substance of Christ is most clearly declared in those passages which
comprehend both natures at once. Numbers of these exist in the Gospel of John.
What we there read as to his having received power from the Father to forgive
sins; as to his quickening whom he will; as to his bestowing righteousness,
holiness, and salvation; as to his being appointed judge both of the quick and
the dead; as to his being honoured even as the
Father,<sup><font size="2">24</font><a name="fnB107" href="#fn107">[9]</a></sup>
are not peculiar either to his Godhead or his humanity, but applicable to both.
In the same way he is called the Light of the world, the good Shepherd, the only
Door, the true Vine. With such prerogatives the Son of God was invested on his
manifestation in the flesh, and though he possessed the same with the Father
before the world was created, still it was not in the same manner or respect;
neither could they be attributed to one who was a man and nothing more. In the
same sense we ought to understand the saying of Paul, that at the end Christ
shall deliver up &#8220;the kingdom to God, even the Father,&#8221; (1 Cor.
15:24). The kingdom of God assuredly had no beginning, and will have no end: but
because he was hid under a humble clothing of flesh, and took upon himself the
form of a servant, and humbled himself (Phil. 2:8), and, laying aside the
insignia of majesty, became obedient to the Father; and after undergoing this
subjection was at length crowned with glory and honour (Heb. 2:7), and exalted
to supreme authority, that at his name every knee should bow (Phil. 2:10); so at
the end he will subject to the Father both the name and the crown of glory, and
whatever he received of the Father, that God may be all in all (1 Cor. 15:28).
For what end were that power and authority given to him, save that the Father
might govern us by his hand? In the same sense, also, he is said to sit at the
right hand of the Father. But this is only for a time, until we enjoy the
immediate presence of his Godhead. And here we cannot excuse the error of some
ancient writers, who, by not attending to the office of Mediator, darken the
genuine meaning of almost the whole doctrine which we read in the Gospel of
John, and entangle themselves in many snares. Let us, therefore, regard it as
the key of true interpretation, that those things which refer to the office of
Mediator are not spoken of the divine or human nature
simply.<sup><font size="2">25</font><a name="fnB108" href="#fn108">[0]</a></sup>
Christ, therefore, shall reign until he appear to judge the world, inasmuch as,
according to the measure of our feeble capacity, he now connects us with the
Father. But when, as partakers of the heavenly glory, we shall see God as he is,
then Christ, having accomplished the office of Mediator, shall cease to be the
vicegerent of the Father, and will be content with the glory which he possessed
before the world was. Nor is the name of Lord specially applicable to the person
of Christ in any other respect than in so far as he holds a middle place between
God and us. To this effect are the words of Paul, &#8220;To us there is but one
God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus
Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him,&#8221; (1 Cor. 8:6); that is, to
the latter a temporary authority has been committed by the Father until his
divine majesty shall be beheld face to face. His giving up of the kingdom to the
Father, so far from impairing his majesty, will give a brighter manifestation of
it. God will then cease to be the head of Christ, and Christ&#8217;s own Godhead
will then shine forth of itself, whereas it is now in a manner veiled.<br><br>4.
This observation, if the readers apply it properly, will be of no small use in
solving a vast number of difficulties. For it is strange how the ignorant, nay,
some who are not altogether without learning, are perplexed by these modes of
expression which they see applied to Christ, without being properly adapted
either to his divinity or his humanity, not considering their accordance with
the character in which he was manifested as God and man, and with his office of
Mediator. It is very easy to see how beautifully they accord with each other,
provided they have a sober interpreter, one who examines these great mysteries
with the reverence which is meet. But there is nothing which furious and frantic
spirits cannot throw into
confusion.<sup><font size="2">25</font><a name="fnB109" href="#fn109">[1]</a></sup>
They fasten on the attributes of humanity to destroy his divinity; and, on the
other hand, on those of his divinity to destroy his humanity: while those which,
spoken conjointly of the two natures, apply to neither, they employ to destroy
both. But what else is this than to contend that Christ is not man because he is
God, not God because he is man, and neither God nor man because he is both at
once. Christ, therefore, as God and man, possessing natures which are united,
but not confused, we conclude that he is our Lord and the true Son of God, even
according to his humanity, though not by means of his humanity. For we must put
far from us the heresy of Nestorius, who, presuming to dissect rather than
distinguish between the two natures, devised a double Christ. But we see the
Scripture loudly protesting against this, when the name of the Son of God is
given to him who is born of a Virgin, and the Virgin herself is called the
mother of our Lord (Luke 1:32, 43). We must beware also of the insane fancy of
Eutyches, lest, when we would demonstrate the unity of person, we destroy the
two natures. The many passages we have already quoted, in which the divinity is
distinguished from the humanity, and the many other passages existing throughout
Scripture, may well stop the mouth of the most contentious. I will shortly add a
few observations, which will still better dispose of this fiction. For the
present, one passage will suffice&#8212;Christ would not have called his body a
temple (John 2:19), had not the Godhead distinctly dwelt in it. Wherefore, as
Nestorius had been justly condemned in the Council of Ephesus, so afterwards was
Eutyches in those of Constantinople and Chalcedony, it being not more lawful to
confound the two natures of Christ than to divide them.<br><br>5. But in our age,
also, has arisen a not less fatal monster, Michael Servetus, who for the Son of
God has substituted a figment composed of the essence of God, spirit, flesh, and
three untreated elements. First, indeed, he denies that Christ is the Son of
God, for any other reason than because he was begotten in the womb of the Virgin
by the Holy Spirit. The tendency of this crafty device is to make out, by
destroying the distinction of the two natures, that Christ is somewhat composed
of God and man, and yet is not to be deemed God and man. His aim throughout is
to establish, that before Christ was manifested in the flesh there were only
shadowy figures in God, the truth or effect of which existed for the first time,
when the Word who had been destined to that honour truly began to be the Son of
God. We indeed acknowledge that the Mediator who was born of the Virgin is
properly the Son of God. And how could the man Christ be a mirror of the
inestimable grace of God, had not the dignity been conferred upon him both of
being and of being called the only-begotten Son of God? Meanwhile, however, the
definition of the Church stands unmoved, that he is accounted the Son of God,
because the Word begotten by the Father before all ages assumed human nature by
hypostatic union,&#8212;a term used by ancient writers to denote the union which
of two natures constitutes one person, and invented to refute the dream of
Nestorius, who pretended that the Son of God dwelt in the flesh in such a manner
as not to be at the same time man. Servetus calumniously charges us with making
the Son of God double, when we say that the eternal Word before he was clothed
with flesh was already the Son of God: as if we said anything more than that he
was manifested in the flesh. Although he was God before he became man, he did
not therefore begin to be a new God. Nor is there any greater absurdity in
holding that the Son of God, who by eternal generation ever had the property of
being a Son, appeared in the flesh. This is intimated by the angel&#8217;s word
to Mary: &#8220;That holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the
Son of God,&#8221; (Luke 1:35); as if he had said that the name of Son, which
was more obscure under the law, would become celebrated and universally known.
Corresponding to this is the passage of Paul, that being now the sons of God by
Christ, we &#8220;have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,
Father,&#8221; (Rom. 8:15). Were not also the holy patriarchs of old reckoned
among the sons of God? Yea, trusting to this privilege, they invoked God as
their Father. But because ever since the only-begotten Son of God came forth
into the world, his celestial paternity has been more clearly manifested, Paul
assigns this to the kingdom of Christ as its distinguishing feature. We must,
however, constantly hold, that God never was a Father to angels and men save in
respect of his only-begotten Son: that men, especially, who by their iniquity
were rendered hateful to God, are sons by gratuitous adoption, because he is a
Son by nature. Nor is there anything in the assertion of Servetus, that this
depends on the filiation which God had decreed with himself. Here we deal not
with figures, as expiation by the blood of beasts was shown to be; but since
they could not be the sons of God in reality, unless their adoption was founded
in the head, it is against all reason to deprive the head of that which is
common to the members. I go farther: since the Scripture gives the name of sons
of God to the angels, whose great dignity in this respect depended not on the
future redemption, Christ must in order take precedence of them that he may
reconcile the Father to them. I will again briefly repeat and add the same thing
concerning the human race. Since angels as well as men were at first created on
the condition that God should be the common Father of both; if it is true, as
Paul says, that Christ always was the head, &#8220;the first-born of every
creature&#8212;that in all things he might have the pre-eminence,&#8221; (Col.
1:15, 18), I think I may legitimately infer, that he existed as the Son of God
before the creation of the world.<br><br>6. But if his filiation (if I may so
express it) had a beginning at the time when he was manifested in the flesh, it
follows that he was a Son in respect of human nature also. Servetus, and others
similarly frenzied, hold that Christ who appeared in the flesh is the Son of
God, inasmuch as but for his incarnation he could not have possessed this name.
Let them now answer me, whether, according to both natures, and in respect of
both, he is a Son? So indeed they prate; but Paul&#8217;s doctrine is very
different. We acknowledge, indeed, that Christ in human nature is called a Son,
not like believers by gratuitous adoption merely, but the true, natural, and,
therefore, only Son, this being the mark which distinguishes him from all
others. Those of us who are regenerated to a new life God honours with the name
of sons; the name of true and only-begotten Son he bestows on Christ alone. But
how is he an only Son in so great a multitude of brethren, except that he
possesses by nature what we acquire by gift? This honour we extend to his whole
character of Mediator, so that He who was born of a Virgin, and on the cross
offered himself in sacrifice to the Father, is truly and properly the Son of
God; but still in respect of his Godhead: as Paul teaches when he says, that he
was &#8220;separated unto the gospel of God (which he had promised afore by his
prophets in the Holy Scriptures), concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord,
which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; and declared to be
the Son of God with power,&#8221; (Rom. 1:1&#8211;4). When distinctly calling
him the Son of David according to the flesh, why should he also say that he was
&#8220;declared to be the Son of God,&#8221; if he meant not to intimate, that
this depended on something else than his incarnation? For in the same sense in
which he elsewhere says, that &#8220;though he was crucified through weakness,
yet he liveth by the power of God,&#8221; (2 Cor. 13:4), so he now draws a
distinction between the two natures. They must certainly admit, that as on
account of his mother he is called the Son of David, so, on account of his
Father, he is the Son of God, and that in some respect differing from his human
nature. The Scripture gives him both names, calling him at one time the Son of
God, at another the Son of Man. As to the latter, there can be no question that
he is called a Son in accordance with the phraseology of the Hebrew language,
because he is of the offspring of Adam. On the other hand, I maintain that he is
called a Son on account of his Godhead and eternal essence, because it is no
less congruous to refer to his divine nature his being called the Son of God,
than to refer to his human nature his being called the Son of Man. In fine, in
the passage which I have quoted, Paul does not mean, that he who according to
the flesh was begotten of the seed of David, was declared to be the Son of God
in any other sense than he elsewhere teaches that Christ, who descended of the
Jews according to the flesh, is &#8220;over all, God blessed for ever,&#8221;
(Rom. 9:5). But if in both passages the distinction of two natures is pointed
out, how can it be denied, that he who according to the flesh is the Son of Man,
is also in respect of his divine nature the Son of God?<br><br>7. They indeed find a
blustering defence of their heresy in its being said, that &#8220;God spared not
his own Son,&#8221; and in the communication of the angel, that He who was to be
born of the Virgin should be called the &#8220;Son of the Highest,&#8221; (Rom.
8:32; Luke 1:32). But before pluming themselves on this futile objection, let
them for a little consider with us what weight there is in their argument. If it
is legitimately concluded, that at conception he began to be the Son of God,
because he who has been conceived is called a Son, it will follow, that he began
to be the Word after his manifestation in the flesh, because John declares, that
the Word of life of which he spoke was that which &#8220;our hands have
handled,&#8221; (1 John 1:1). In like manner we read in the prophet,
&#8220;Thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of
Israel, yet out of thee shall he come forth that is to be a ruler in Israel;
whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting,&#8221; (Mic. 5:2).
How will they be forced to interpret if they will follow such a method of
arguing? I have declared that we by no means assent to Nestorius, who imagined a
twofold Christ, when we maintain that Christ, by means of brotherly union, made
us sons of God with himself, because in the flesh, which he took from us, he is
the only-begotten Son of God. And Augustine wisely reminds
us,<sup><font size="2">25</font><a name="fnB110" href="#fn110">[2]</a></sup>
that he is a bright mirror of the wonderful and singular grace of God, because
as man he obtained honour which he could not merit. With this distinction,
therefore, according to the flesh, was Christ honoured even from the
womb&#8212;viz. to be the Son of God. Still, in the unity of person we are not
to imagine any intermixture which takes away from the Godhead what is peculiar
to it. Nor is it more absurd that the eternal Word of God and Christ, uniting
the two natures in one person, should in different ways be called the Son of
God, than that he should in various respects be called at one time the Son of
God, at another the Son of Man. Nor are we more embarrassed by another cavil of
Servetus&#8212;viz. that Christ, before he appeared in the flesh, is nowhere
called the Son of God, except under a figure. For though the description of him
was then more obscure, yet it has already been clearly proved, that he was not
otherwise the eternal God, than as he was the Word begotten of the eternal
Father. Nor is the name applicable to the office of Mediator which he undertook,
except in that he was God manifest in the flesh. Nor would God have thus from
the beginning been called a Father, had there not been even then a mutual
relation to the Son, &#8220;of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is
named,&#8221; (Eph. 3:15). Hence it is easy to infer, that under the Law and the
Prophets he was the Son of God before this name was celebrated in the Church.
But if we are to dispute about the word merely, Solomon, speaking of the
incomprehensibility of God, affirms that his Son is like himself,
incomprehensible: &#8220;What is his name, and what is his Son&#8217;s name, if
thou canst tell?&#8221; (Prov. 30:4). I am well aware that with the contentious
this passage will not have sufficient weight; nor do I found much upon it,
except as showing the malignant cavils of those who affirm that Christ is the
Son of God only in so far as he became man. We may add, that all the most
ancient writers, with one mouth and consent, testified the same thing so
plainly, that the effrontery is no less ridiculous than detestable, which dares
to oppose us with Irenaeus and Tertullian, both of whom acknowledge that He who
was afterwards visibly manifested was the invisible Son of
God.<sup><font size="2">25</font><a name="fnB111" href="#fn111">[3]</a></sup><br><br>8.
But although Servetus heaped together a number of horrid dogmas, to which,
perhaps, others would not subscribe, you will find, that all who refuse to
acknowledge the Son of God except in the flesh, are obliged, when urged more
closely, to admit that he was a Son, for no other reason than because he was
conceived in the womb of the Virgin by the Holy Spirit; just like the absurdity
of the ancient Manichees, that the soul of man was derived by transfusion from
God, from its being said, that he breathed into Adam&#8217;s nostrils the breath
of life (Gen. 2:7). For they lay such stress on the name of Son that they leave
no distinction between the natures, but babblingly maintain that the man Christ
is the Son of God, because, according to his human nature, he was begotten of
God. Thus, the eternal generation of Wisdom, celebrated by Solomon (Prov. 8:22,
seq). is destroyed, and no kind of Godhead exists in the Mediator: or a phantom
is substituted instead of a man. The grosser delusions of Servetus, by which he
imposed upon himself and some others, it were useful to refute, that pious
readers might be warned by the example, to confine themselves within the bounds
of soberness and modesty: however, I deem it superfluous here, as I have already
done it in a special
treatise.<sup><font size="2">25</font><a name="fnB112" href="#fn112">[4]</a></sup>
The whole comes to this, that the Son of God was from the beginning an idea, and
was even then a preordained man, who was to be the essential image of God. nor
does he acknowledge any other word of God except in external splendour. The
generation he interprets to mean, that from the beginning a purpose of
generating the Son was begotten in God, and that this purpose extended itself by
act to creation. Meanwhile, he confounds the Spirit with the Word, saying that
God arranged the invisible Word and Spirit into flesh and soul. In short, in his
view the typifying of Christ occupies the place of generation; but he says, that
he who was then in appearance a shadowy Son, was at length begotten by the Word,
to which he attributes a generating power. From this it will follow, that dogs
and swine are not less sons of God, because created of the original seed of the
Divine Word. But although he compounds Christ of three untreated elements, that
he may be begotten of the essence of God, he pretends that he is the first-born
among the creatures, in such a sense that, according to their degree, stones
have the same essential divinity. But lest he should seem to strip Christ of his
Deity, he admits that his flesh is oJmoouvsion, of the same substance with God,
and that the Word was made man, by the conversion of flesh into Deity. Thus,
while he cannot comprehend that Christ was the Son of God, until his flesh came
forth from the essence of God and was converted into Deity, he reduces the
eternal personality (<i>hypostasis</i>) of the Word to nothing, and robs us of
the Son of David, who was the promised Redeemer. It is true, he repeatedly
declares that the Son was begotten of God by knowledge and predestination, but
that he was at length made man out of that matter which, from the beginning,
shone with God in the three elements, and afterwards appeared in the first light
of the world, in the cloud and pillar of fire. How shamefully inconsistent with
himself he ever and anon becomes, it were too tedious to relate. From this brief
account sound readers will gather, that by the subtle ambiguities of this
infatuated man, the hope of salvation was utterly extinguished. For if the flesh
were the Godhead itself, it would cease to be its temple. Now, the only Redeemer
we can have is He who being begotten of the seed of Abraham and David according
to the flesh, truly became man. But he erroneously insists on the expression of
John, &#8220;The Word was made flesh.&#8221; As these words refute the heresy of
Nestorius, so they give no countenance to the impious fiction of which Eutyches
was the inventor, since all that the Evangelist intended was to assert a unity
of person in two natures.<br><br><br><br></div>

power of Christ, and the advantage we derive from it, sec. 3&#8211;5. III. Of

<div align="center">Sections.<br><br><br><br></div>
<div>1.	 Among heretics and false Christians, Christ is found in name only; but
by those who are truly and effectually called of God, he is acknowledged as a
Prophet, King, and Priest. In regard to the Prophetical Office, the Redeemer of
the Church is the same from whom believers under the Law hoped for the full
light of understanding.<br><br>2.	 The unction of Christ, though it has respect
chiefly to the Kingly Office, refers also to the Prophetical and Priestly
Offices. The dignity, necessity, and use of this unction.<br><br>3.	 From the
spirituality of Christ&#8217;s kingdom its eternity is inferred. This twofold,
referring both to the whole body of the Church, and to its individual
members.<br><br>4.	 Benefits from the spiritual kingdom of Christ. 1. It raises us
to eternal life. 2. It enriches us with all things necessary to salvation. 3. It
makes us invincible by spiritual foes. 4. It animates us to patient endurance.
5. It inspires confidence and triumph. 6. It supplies fortitude and love.<br><br>5.	
The unction of our Redeemer heavenly. Symbol of this unction. A passage in the
apostle reconciled with others previously quoted, to prove the eternal kingdom
of Christ.<br><br>6.	 What necessary to obtain the benefit of Christ&#8217;s
Priesthood. We must set out with the death of Christ. From it follows, 1. His
intercession for us. 2. Confidence in prayer. 3. Peace of conscience. 4. Through
Christ, Christians themselves become priests. Grievous sin of the Papists in
pretending to sacrifice Christ.<br><br><br><br>1. THOUGH heretics pretend the name of
Christ, truly does Augustine affirm (Enchir. ad Laurent. cap. 5), that the
foundation is not common to them with the godly, but belongs exclusively to the
Church: for if those things which pertain to Christ be diligently considered, it
will be found that Christ is with them in name only, not in reality. Thus in the
present day, though the Papists have the words, Son of God, Redeemer of the
world, sounding in their mouths, yet, because contented with an empty name, they
deprive him of his virtue and dignity; what Paul says of &#8220;not holding the
head,&#8221; is truly applicable to them (Col. 2:19). Therefore, that faith may
find in Christ a solid ground of salvation, and so rest in him, we must set out
with this principle, that the office which he received from the Father consists
of three parts. For he was appointed both Prophet, King, and Priest; though
little were gained by holding the names unaccompanied by a knowledge of the end
and use. These too are spoken of in the Papacy, but frigidly, and with no great
benefit, the full meaning comprehended under each title not being understood. We
formerly observed, that though God, by supplying an uninterrupted succession of
prophets, never left his people destitute of useful doctrine, such as might
suffice for salvation; yet the minds of believers were always impressed with the
conviction that the full light of understanding was to be expected only on the
advent of the Messiah. This expectation, accordingly, had reached even the
Samaritans, to whom the true religion had never been made known. This is plain
from the expression of the woman, &#8220;I know that Messiah cometh, which is
called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things,&#8221; (John 4:25).
Nor was this a mere random presumption which had entered the minds of the Jews.
They believed what sure oracles had taught them. One of the most remarkable
passages is that of Isaiah, &#8220;Behold, I have given him for a witness to the
people, a leader and commander to the people,&#8221; (Is. 54:4); that is, in the
same way in which he had previously in another place styled him
&#8220;Wonderful, Counsellor,&#8221; (Is.
9:6).<sup><font size="2">25</font><a name="fnB113" href="#fn113">[5]</a></sup>
For this reason, the apostle commending the perfection of gospel doctrine, first
says that &#8220;God, at sundry times and in divers manners spake in times past
unto the prophets,&#8221; and then adds, that he &#8220;has in these last days
spoken unto us by his Son,&#8221; (Heb. 1:1, 2). But as the common office of the
prophets was to hold the Church in suspense, and at the same time support it
until the advent of the Mediator; we read, that the faithful, during the
dispersion, complained that they were deprived of that ordinary privilege.
&#8220;We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet, neither is there
among us any that knoweth how long,&#8221; (Ps. 74:9). But when Christ was now
not far distant, a period was assigned to Daniel &#8220;to seal up the vision
and prophecy,&#8221; (Daniel 9:24), not only that the authority of the
prediction there spoken of might be established, but that believers might, for a
time, patiently submit to the want of the prophets, the fulfilment and
completion of all the prophecies being at hand.<br><br>2. Moreover, it is to be
observed, that the name <i>Christ</i> refers to those three offices: for we know
that under the law, prophets as well as priests and kings were anointed with
holy oil. Whence, also, the celebrated name of Messiah was given to the promised
Mediator. But although I admit (as, indeed, I have elsewhere shown) that he was
so called from a view to the nature of the kingly office, still the prophetical
and sacerdotal unctions have their proper place, and must not be overlooked. The
former is expressly mentioned by Isaiah in these words: &#8220;The Spirit of the
Lord God is upon me: because the Lord has anointed me to preach good tidings
unto the meek; he has sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty
to the captive, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to
proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord,&#8221; (Is. 60:1, 2). We see that he
was anointed by the Spirit to be a herald and witness of his Father&#8217;s
grace, and not in the usual way; for he is distinguished from other teachers who
had a similar office. And here, again, it is to be observed, that the unction
which he received, in order to perform the office of teacher, was not for
himself, but for his whole body, that a corresponding efficacy of the Spirit
might always accompany the preaching of the Gospel. This, however, remains
certain, that by the perfection of doctrine which he brought, an end was put to
all the prophecies, so that those who, not contented with the Gospel, annex
somewhat extraneous to it, derogate from its authority. The voice which
thundered from heaven, &#8220;This is my beloved Son, hear him&#8221; gave him a
special privilege above all other teachers. Then from him, as head, this unction
is diffused through the members, as Joel has foretold, &#8220;Your sons and your
daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men
shall see visions,&#8221; (Joel 2:28). Paul&#8217;s expressions, that he was
&#8220;made unto us wisdom,&#8221; (1 Cor. 1:30), and elsewhere, that in him
&#8220;are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,&#8221; (Col. 2:3),
have a somewhat different meaning, namely, that out of him there is nothing
worth knowing, and that those who, by faith, apprehend his true character,
possess the boundless immensity of heavenly blessings. For which reason, he
elsewhere says, &#8220;I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus
Christ and him crucified,&#8221; (1 Cor. 2:2). And most justly: for it is
unlawful to go beyond the simplicity of the Gospel. The purpose of this
prophetical dignity in Christ is to teach us, that in the doctrine which he
delivered is substantially included a wisdom which is perfect in all its
parts.<br><br>3. I come to the Kingly office, of which it were in vain to speak,
without previously reminding the reader that its nature is spiritual; because it
is from thence we learn its efficacy, the benefits it confers, its whole power
and eternity. Eternity, moreover, which in Daniel an angel attributes to the
office of Christ (Dan. 2:44), in Luke an angel justly applies to the salvation
of his people (Luke 1:33). But this is also twofold, and must be viewed in two
ways; the one pertains to the whole body of the Church the other is proper to
each member. To the former is to be referred what is said in the Psalms,
&#8220;Once have I sworn by my holiness, that I will not lie unto David. His
seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. It shall be
established for ever, as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven,&#8221;
(Ps. 89:35, 37). There can be no doubt that God here promises that he will be,
by the hand of his Son, the eternal governor and defender of the Church. In none
but Christ will the fulfilment of this prophecy be found; since immediately
after Solomon&#8217;s death the kingdom in n great measure lost its dignity,
and, with ignominy to the family of David, was transferred to a private
individual. Afterwards decaying by degrees, it at length came to a sad and
dishonourable end. In the same sense are we to understand the exclamation of
Isaiah, &#8220;Who shall declare his generation?&#8221; (Isaiah 53:8). For he
asserts that Christ will so survive death as to be connected with his members.
Therefore, as often as we hear that Christ is armed with eternal power, let us
learn that the perpetuity of the Church is thus effectually secured; that amid
the turbulent agitations by which it is constantly harassed, and the grievous
and fearful commotions which threaten innumerable disasters, it still remains
safe. Thus, when David derides the audacity of the enemy who attempt to throw
off the yoke of God and his anointed, and says, that kings and nations rage
&#8220;in vain,&#8221; (Ps. 2:2&#8211;4), because he who sitteth in the heaven
is strong enough to repel their assaults, assuring believers of the perpetual
preservation of the Church, he animates them to have good hope whenever it is
occasionally oppressed. So, in another place, when speaking in the person of
God, he says, &#8220;The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand,
until I make thine enemies thy footstool,&#8221; (Ps. 110:1), he reminds us,
that however numerous and powerful the enemies who conspire to assault the
Church, they are not possessed of strength sufficient to prevail against the
immortal decree by which he appointed his Son eternal King. Whence it follows
that the devil, with the whole power of the world, can never possibly destroy
the Church, which is founded on the eternal throne of Christ. Then in regard to
the special use to be made by each believer, this same eternity ought to elevate
us to the hope of a blessed immortality. For we see that every thing which is
earthly, and of the world, is temporary, and soon fades away. Christ, therefore,
to raise our hope to the heavens, declares that his kingdom is not of this world
(John 18:36). In fine, let each of us, when he hears that the kingdom of Christ
is spiritual, be roused by the thought to entertain the hope of a better life,
and to expect that as it is now protected by the hand of Christ, so it will be
fully realised in a future life.<br><br>4. That the strength and utility of the
kingdom of Christ cannot, as we have said, be fully perceived without
recognising it as spiritual, is sufficiently apparent, even from this, that
having during the whole course of our lives to war under the cross, our
condition here is bitter and wretched. What then would it avail us to be ranged
under the government of a heavenly King, if its benefits were not realised
beyond the present earthly life? We must, therefore, know that the happiness
which is promised to us in Christ does not consist in external
advantages&#8212;such as leading a joyful and tranquil life, abounding in
wealth, being secure against all injury, and having an affluence of delights,
such as the flesh is wont to long for&#8212;but properly belongs to the heavenly
life. As in the world the prosperous and desirable condition of a people
consists partly in the abundance of temporal good and domestic peace, and partly
in the strong protection which gives security against external violence; so
Christ also enriches his people with all things necessary to the eternal
salvation of their souls and fortifies them with courage to stand unassailable
by all the attacks of spiritual foes. Whence we infer, that he reigns more for
us than for himself, and that both within us and without us; that being
replenished, in so far as God knows to be expedient, with the gifts of the
Spirit, of which we are naturally destitute, we may feel from their first
fruits, that we are truly united to God for perfect blessedness; and then
trusting to the power of the same Spirit, may not doubt that we shall always be
victorious against the devil, the world, and every thing that can do us harm. To
this effect was our Saviour&#8217;s reply to the Pharisees, &#8220;The kingdom
of God is within you.&#8221; &#8220;The kingdom of God cometh not with
observation,&#8221; (Luke 17:21, 22). It is probable that on his declaring
himself to be that King under whom the highest blessing of God was to be
expected, they had in derision asked him to produce his insignia. But to prevent
those who were already more than enough inclined to the earth from dwelling on
its pomp, he bids them enter into their consciences, for &#8220;the kingdom of
God&#8221; is &#8220;righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost,&#8221;
(Rom. 14:17). These words briefly teach what the kingdom of Christ bestows upon
us. Not being earthly or carnal, and so subject to corruption, but spiritual, it
raises us even to eternal life, so that we can patiently live at present under
toil, hunger, cold, contempt, disgrace, and other annoyances; contented with
this, that our King will never abandon us, but will supply our necessities until
our warfare is ended, and we are called to triumph: such being the nature of his
kingdom, that he communicates to us whatever he received of his Father. Since
then he arms and equips us by his power, adorns us with splendour and
magnificence, enriches us with wealth, we here find most abundant cause of
glorying, and also are inspired with boldness, so that we can contend intrepidly
with the devil, sin, and death. In fine, clothed with his righteousness, we can
bravely surmount all the insults of the world: and as he replenishes us
liberally with his gifts, so we can in our turn bring forth fruit unto his
glory.<br><br>5. Accordingly, his royal unction is not set before us as composed of
oil or aromatic perfumes; but he is called the Christ of God, because &#8220;the
Spirit of the Lord&#8221; rested upon him; &#8220;the Spirit of wisdom and
understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and of
the fear of the Lord,&#8221; (Isaiah 11:2). This is the oil of joy with which
the Psalmist declares that he was anointed above his fellows (Ps. 45:7). For, as
has been said, he was not enriched privately for himself, but that he might
refresh the parched and hungry with his abundance. For as the Father is said to
have given the Spirit to the Son without measure (John 3:34), so the reason is
expressed, that we might all receive of his fulness, and grace for grace (John
1:16). From this fountain flows the copious supply (of which Paul makes mention,
Eph. 4:7) by which grace is variously distributed to believers according to the
measure of the gift of Christ. Here we have ample confirmation of what I said,
that the kingdom of Christ consists in the Spirit, and not in earthly delights
or pomp, and that hence, in order to be partakers with him, we must renounce the
world. A visible symbol of this grace was exhibited at the baptism of Christ,
when the Spirit rested upon him in the form of a dove. To designate the Spirit
and his gifts by the term &#8220;<i>unction</i>&#8221; is not new, and ought not
to seem absurd (see 1 John 2:20, 27), because this is the only quarter from
which we derive life; but especially in what regards the heavenly life, there is
not a drop of vigour in us save what the Holy Spirit instils, who has chosen his
seat in Christ, that thence the heavenly riches, of which we are destitute,
might flow to us in copious abundance. But because believers stand invincible in
the strength of their King, and his spiritual riches abound towards them, they
are not improperly called Christians. Moreover, from this eternity of which we
have spoken, there is nothing derogatory in the expression of Paul, &#8220;Then
cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the
Father,&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:24); and also, &#8220;Then shall the Son also himself
be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in
and&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:28); for the meaning merely is, that, in that perfect
glory, the administration of the kingdom will not be such as it now is. For the
Father has given all power to the Son, that by his hand he may govern, cherish,
sustain us, keep us under his guardianship, and give assistance to us. Thus,
while we wander far as pilgrims from God, Christ interposes, that he may
gradually bring us to full communion with God. And, indeed, his sitting at the
right hand of the Father has the same meaning as if he was called the vicegerent
of the Father, entrusted with the whole power of government. For God is pleased,
mediately (so to speak) in his person to rule and defend the Church. Thus also
his being seated at the right hand of the Father is explained by Paul, in the
Epistle to the Ephesians, to mean, that &#8220;he is the head over all things to
the Church, which is his body,&#8221; (Eph. 1:20, 22). Nor is this different in
purport from what he elsewhere teaches, that God has &#8220;given him a name
which is above every name; that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, of
things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, and that
every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the
Father,&#8221; (Phil. 2:9&#8211;11). For in these words, also, he commends an
arrangement in the kingdom of Christ, which is necessary for our present
infirmity. Thus Paul rightly infers that God will then be the only Head of the
Church, because the office of Christ, in defending the Church, shall then have
been completed. For the same reason, Scripture throughout calls him <i>Lord</i>,
the Father having appointed him over us for the express purpose of exercising
his government through him. For though many lordships are celebrated in the
world, yet Paul says, &#8220;To us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are
all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things,
and we by him,&#8221; (1 Cor. 8:6). Whence it is justly inferred that he is the
same God, who, by the mouth of Isaiah, declared, &#8220;The Lord is our Judge,
the Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our King: he will save us,&#8221; (Isaiah
33:22). For though he every where describes all the power which he possesses as
the benefit and gift of the Father, the meaning simply is, that he reigns by
divine authority, because his reason for assuming the office of Mediator was,
that descending from the bosom and incomprehensible glory of the Father, he
might draw near to us. Wherefore there is the greater reason that we all should
with one consent prepare to obey, and with the greatest alacrity yield implicit
obedience to his will. For as he unites the offices of King and Pastor towards
believers, who voluntarily submit to him, so, on the other hand, we are told
that he wields an iron sceptre to break and bruise all the rebellious like a
potter&#8217;s vessel (Ps. 2:9). We are also told that he will be the Judge of
the Gentiles, that he will cover the earth with dead bodies, and level down
every opposing height (Ps. 110:6). Of this examples are seen at present, but
full proof will be given at the final judgment, which may be properly regarded
as the last act of his reign.<br><br>6. With regard to his Priesthood, we must
briefly hold its end and use to be, that as a Mediator, free from all taint, he
may by his own holiness procure the favour of God for us. But because a deserved
curse obstructs the entrance, and God in his character of Judge is hostile to
us, expiation must necessarily intervene, that as a priest employed to appease
the wrath of God, he may reinstate us in his favour. Wherefore, in order that
Christ might fulfil this office, it behoved him to appear with a sacrifice. For
even under the law of the priesthood it was forbidden to enter the sanctuary
without blood, to teach the worshipper that however the priest might interpose
to deprecate, God could not be propitiated without the expiation of sin. On this
subject the Apostle discourses at length in the Epistle to the Hebrews, from the
seventh almost to the end of the tenth chapter. The sum comes to this, that the
honour of the priesthood was competent to none but Christ, because, by the
sacrifice of his death, he wiped away our guilt, and made satisfaction for sin.
Of the great importance of this matter, we are reminded by that solemn oath
which God uttered, and of which he declared he would not repent, &#8220;Thou art
a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek,&#8221; (Ps. 110:4). For,
doubtless, his purpose was to ratify that point on which he knew that our
salvation chiefly hinged. For, as has been said, there is no access to God for
us or for our prayers until the priest, purging away our defilements, sanctify
us, and obtain for us that favour of which the impurity of our lives and hearts
deprives us. Thus we see, that if the benefit and efficacy of Christ&#8217;s
priesthood is to reach us, the commencement must be with his death. Whence it
follows, that he by whose aid we obtain favour, must be a perpetual intercessor.
From this again arises not only confidence in prayer, but also the tranquillity
of pious minds, while they recline in safety on the paternal indulgence of God,
and feel assured, that whatever has been consecrated by the Mediator is pleasing
to him. But since God under the Law ordered sacrifices of beasts to be offered
to him, there was a different and new arrangement in regard to Christ&#8212;viz.
that he should be at once victim and priest, because no other fit satisfaction
for sin could be found, nor was any one worthy of the honour of offering an only
begotten son to God. Christ now bears the office of priest, not only that by the
eternal law of reconciliation he may render the Father favourable and propitious
to us, but also admit us into this most honourable alliance. For we though in
ourselves polluted, in him being priests (Rev. 1:6), offer ourselves and our all
to God, and freely enter the heavenly sanctuary, so that the sacrifices of
prayer and praise which we present are grateful and of sweet odour before him.
To this effect are the words of Christ, &#8220;For their sakes I sanctify
myself,&#8221; (John 17:19); for being clothed with his holiness, inasmuch as he
has devoted us to the Father with himself (otherwise we were an abomination
before him), we please him as if we were pure and clean, nay, even sacred. Hence
that unction of the sanctuary of which mention is made in Daniel (Dan. 9:24).
For we must attend to the contrast between this unction and the shadowy one
which was then in use; as if the angel had said, that when the shadows were
dispersed, there would be a clear priesthood in the person of Christ. The more
detestable, therefore, is the fiction of those who, not content with the
priesthood of Christ, have dared to take it upon themselves to sacrifice him, a
thing daily attempted in the Papacy, where the mass is represented as an
immolation of Christ.<br><br><br><br></div>

<div align="center">Sections.<br><br><br><br></div>
<div>1.	 Every thing needful for us exists in Christ. How it is to be
obtained.<br><br>2.	 Question as to the mode of reconciling the justice with the
mercy of God. Modes of expression used in Scripture to teach us how miserable
our condition is without Christ.<br><br>3.	 Not used improperly; for God finds in us
ground both of hatred and love.<br><br>4.	 This confirmed from passages of Scripture
and from Augustine.<br><br>5.	 The second part of the chapter, treating of our
redemption by Christ. First generally. Redemption extends to the whole course of
our Saviour&#8217;s obedience, but is specially ascribed to his death. The
voluntary subjection of Christ. His agony. His condemnation before Pilate. Two
things observable in his condemnation. 1. That he was numbered among
transgressors. 2. That he was declared innocent by the judge. Use to be made of
this.<br><br>6.	 Why Christ was crucified. This hidden doctrine typified in the Law,
and completed by the Apostles and Prophets. In what sense Christ was made a
curse for us. The cross of Christ connected with the shedding of his
blood.<br><br>7.	 Of the death of Christ. Why he died. Advantages from his death. Of
the burial of Christ. Advantages.<br><br>8.	 Of the descent into hell. This article
gradually introduced into the Church. Must not be rejected, nor confounded with
the previous article respecting burial.<br><br>9.	 Absurd exposition concerning the
Limbus Patrum. This fable refuted.<br><br>10.	 The article of the descent to hell
more accurately expounded. A great ground of comfort.<br><br>11.	 Confirmation of
this exposition from passages of Scripture and the works of ancient Theologians.
An objection refuted. Advantages of the doctrine.<br><br>12.	 Another objection that
Christ is insulted, and despair ascribed to him in its being said that he
feared. Answer, from the statements of the Evangelists, that he did fear, was
troubled in spirit, amazed, and tempted in all respects as we are, yet without
sin. Why Christ was pleased to become weak. His fear without sin. Refutation of
another objection, with an answer to the question, Did Christ fear death, and
why? When did Christ descend to hell, and how? What has been said refutes the
heresy of Apollinaris and of the Monothelites.<br><br>13.	 Of the resurrection of
Christ. The many advantages from it. 1. Our righteousness in the sight of God
renewed and restored. 2. His life the basis of our life and hope, also the
efficacious cause of new life in us. 3. The pledge of our future
resurrection.<br><br>14.	 Of the ascension of Christ. Why he ascended. Advantages
derived from it.<br><br>15.	 Of Christ&#8217;s seat at the Father&#8217;s right
hand. What meant by it.<br><br>16.	 Many advantages from the ascension of Christ. 1.
He gives access to the kingdom which Adam had shut up. 2. He intercedes for us
with the Father. 3. His virtue being thence transfused into us, he works
effectually in us for salvation.<br><br>17.	 Of the return of Christ to judgment.
Its nature. The quick and dead who are to be judged. Passages apparently
contradictory reconciled. Mode of judgment.<br><br>18.	 Advantages of the doctrine
of Christ&#8217;s return to judgment. Third part of the chapter, explaining the
view to be taken of the Apostles&#8217; Creed. Summary of the Apostles&#8217;
Creed.<br><br>19.	 Conclusion of the whole chapter, showing that in Christ the
salvation of the elect in all its parts is comprehended.<br><br><br><br>1. ALL that we
have hitherto said of Christ leads to this one result, that condemned, dead, and
lost in ourselves, we must in him seek righteousness, deliverance, life and
salvation, as we are taught by the celebrated words of Peter, &#8220;Neither is
there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given
among men whereby we must be saved,&#8221; (Acts 4:12). The name of Jesus was
not given him at random, or fortuitously, or by the will of man, but was brought
from heaven by an angel, as the herald of the supreme
decree;<sup><font size="2">25</font><a name="fnB114" href="#fn114">[6]</a></sup>
the reason also being added, &#8220;for he shall save his people from their
sins,&#8221; (Matt. 1:21). In these words attention should be paid to what we
have elsewhere observed, that the office of Redeemer was assigned him in order
that he might be our Saviour. Still, however, redemption would be defective if
it did not conduct us by an uninterrupted progression to the final goal of
safety. Therefore, the moment we turn aside from him in the minutest degree,
salvation, which resides entirely in him, gradually disappears; so that all who
do not rest in him voluntarily deprive themselves of all grace. The observation
of Bernard well deserves to be remembered: The name of Jesus is not only light
but food also, yea, oil, without which all the food of the soul is dry; salt,
without which as a condiment whatever is set before us is insipid; in fine,
honey in the mouth, melody in the ear, joy in the heart, and, at the same time,
medicine; every discourse where this name is not heard is absurd (Bernard in
Cantica., Serm. 15). But here it is necessary diligently to consider in what way
we obtain salvation from him, that we may not only be persuaded that he is the
author of it, but having embraced whatever is sufficient as a sure foundation of
our faith, may eschew all that might make us waver. For seeing no man can
descend into himself, and seriously consider what he is, without feeling that
God is angry and at enmity with him, and therefore anxiously longing for the
means of regaining his favour (this cannot be without satisfaction), the
certainty here required is of no ordinary description,&#8212;sinners, until
freed from guilt, being always liable to the wrath and curse of God, who, as he
is a just judge, cannot permit his law to be violated with impunity, but is
armed for vengeance.<br><br>2. But before we proceed farther, we must see in
passing, how can it be said that God, who prevents us with his mercy, was our
enemy until he was reconciled to us by Christ. For how could he have given us in
his only-begotten Son a singular pledge of his love, if he had not previously
embraced us with free favour? As there thus arises some appearance of
contradiction, I will explain the difficulty. The mode in which the Spirit
usually speaks in Scripture is, that God was the enemy of men until they were
restored to favour by the death of Christ (Rom. 5:10); that they were cursed
until their iniquity was expiated by the sacrifice of Christ (Gal. 3:10, 13);
that they were separated from God, until by means of Christ&#8217;s body they
were received into union (Col. 1:21, 22). Such modes of expression are
accommodated to our capacity, that we may the better understand how miserable
and calamitous our condition is without Christ. For were it not said in clear
terms, that Divine wrath, and vengeance, and eternal death, lay upon us, we
should be less sensible of our wretchedness without the mercy of God, and less
disposed to value the blessing of deliverance. For example, let a person be
told, Had God at the time you were a sinner hated you, and cast you off as you
deserved, horrible destruction must have been your doom; but spontaneously and
of free indulgence he retained you in his favour, not suffering you to be
estranged from him, and in this way rescued you from danger,&#8212;the person
will indeed be affected, and made sensible in some degree how much he owes to
the mercy of God. But again, let him be told, as Scripture teaches, that he was
estranged from God by sin, an heir of wrath, exposed to the curse of eternal
death, excluded from all hope of salvation, a complete alien from the blessing
of God, the slave of Satan, captive under the yoke of sin; in fine, doomed to
horrible destruction, and already involved in it; that then Christ interposed,
took the punishment upon himself and bore what by the just judgment of God was
impending over sinners; with his own blood expiated the sins which rendered them
hateful to God, by this expiation satisfied and duly propitiated God the Father,
by this intercession appeased his anger, on this basis founded peace between God
and men, and by this tie secured the Divine benevolence toward them; will not
these considerations move him the more deeply, the more strikingly they
represent the greatness of the calamity from which he was delivered? In short,
since our mind cannot lay hold of life through the mercy of God with sufficient
eagerness, or receive it with becoming gratitude, unless previously impressed
with fear of the Divine anger, and dismayed at the thought of eternal death, we
are so instructed by divine truth, as to perceive that without Christ God is in
a manner hostile to us, and has his arm raised for our destruction. Thus taught,
we look to Christ alone for divine favour and paternal love.<br><br>3. Though this
is said in accommodation to the weakness of our capacity, it is not said
falsely. For God, who is perfect righteousness, cannot love the iniquity which
he sees in all. All of us, therefore, have that within which deserves the hatred
of God. Hence, in respect, first, of our corrupt nature; and, secondly, of the
depraved conduct following upon it, we are all offensive to God, guilty in his
sight, and by nature the children of hell. But as the Lord wills not to destroy
in us that which is his own, he still finds something in us which in kindness he
can love. For though it is by our own fault that we are sinners, we are still
his creatures; though we have brought death upon ourselves he had created us for
life. Thus, mere gratuitous love prompts him to receive us into favour. But if
there is a perpetual and irreconcilable repugnance between righteousness and
iniquity, so long as we remain sinners we cannot be completely received.
Therefore, in order that all ground of offence may be removed, and he may
completely reconcile us to himself, he, by means of the expiation set forth in
the death of Christ, abolishes all the evil that is in us, so that we, formerly
impure and unclean, now appear in his sight just and holy. Accordingly, God the
Father, by his love, prevents and anticipates our reconciliation in Christ. Nay,
it is because he first loves us, that he afterwards reconciles us to himself.
But because the iniquity, which deserves the indignation of God, remains in us
until the death of Christ comes to our aid, and that iniquity is in his sight
accursed and condemned, we are not admitted to full and sure communion with God,
unless, in so far as Christ unites us. And, therefore, if we would indulge the
hope of having God placable and propitious to us, we must fix our eyes and minds
on Christ alone, as it is to him alone it is owing that our sins, which
necessarily provoked the wrath of God, are not imputed to us.<br><br>4. For this
reason Paul says, that God &#8220;has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in
heavenly places in Christ: according as he has chosen us in him before the
foundation of the world,&#8221; (Eph. 1:3, 4). These things are clear and
conformable to Scripture, and admirably reconcile the passages in which it is
said, that &#8220;God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
Son,&#8221; (John 3:16); and yet that it was &#8220;when we were enemies we were
reconciled to God by the death of his Son,&#8221; (Rom. 5:10). But to give
additional assurance to those who require the authority of the ancient Church, I
will quote a passage of Augustine to the same effect: &#8220;Incomprehensible
and immutable is the love of God. For it was not after we were reconciled to him
by the blood of his Son that he began to love us, but he loved us before the
foundation of the world, that with his only begotten Son we too might be sons of
God before we were any thing at all. Our being reconciled by the death of Christ
must not be understood as if the Son reconciled us, in order that the Father,
then hating, might begin to love us, but that we were reconciled to him already,
loving, though at enmity with us because of sin. To the truth of both
propositions we have the attestation of the Apostle, &#8216;God commendeth his
love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us,&#8217;
(Rom. 5:8). Therefore he had this love towards us even when, exercising enmity
towards him, we were the workers of iniquity. Accordingly in a manner wondrous
and divine, he loved even when he hated us. For he hated us when we were such as
he had not made us, and yet because our iniquity had not destroyed his work in
every respect, he knew in regard to each one of us, both to hate what we had
made, and love what he had made.&#8221; Such are the words of Augustine (Tract
in Jo. 110).<br><br>5. When it is asked then how Christ, by abolishing sin, removed
the enmity between God and us, and purchased a righteousness which made him
favourable and kind to us, it may be answered generally, that he accomplished
this by the whole course of his obedience. This id proved by the testimony of
Paul, &#8220;As by one man&#8217;s disobedience many were made sinners, so by
the obedience of one shall many be made righteous,&#8221; (Rom. 5:19). And
indeed he elsewhere extends the ground of pardon which exempts from the curse of
the law to the whole life of Christ, &#8220;When the fulness of the time was
come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem
them that were under the law,&#8221; (Gal. 4:4, 5). Thus even at his baptism he
declared that a part of righteousness was fulfilled by his yielding obedience to
the command of the Father. In short, from the moment when he assumed the form of
a servant, he began, in order to redeem us, to pay the price of deliverance.
Scripture, however, the more certainly to define the mode of salvation, ascribes
it peculiarly and specially to the death of Christ. He himself declares that he
gave his life a ransom for many (Mt. 20:28). Paul teaches that he died for our
sins (Rom. 4:25). John Baptist exclaimed, &#8220;Behold the Lamb of God, which
taketh away the sin of the world,&#8221; (John 1:29). Paul in another passage
declares, &#8220;that we are justified freely by his grace, through the
redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God has set forth to be a propitiation
through faith in his blood,&#8221; (Rom. 3:25). &#8220;Again, being justified by
his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him&#8221; (Rom. 5:9). Again
&#8220;He has made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made
the righteousness of God in him,&#8221; (2 Cor. 5:21). I will not search out all
the passages, for the list would be endless, and many are afterwards to be
quoted in their order. In the Confession of Faith, called the Apostles&#8217;
Creed, the transition is admirably made from the birth of Christ to his death
and resurrection, in which the completion of a perfect salvation consists. Still
there is no exclusion of the other part of obedience which he performed in life.
Thus Paul comprehends, from the beginning even to the end, his having assumed
the form of a servant, humbled himself, and become obedient to death, even the
death of the cross (Phil. 2:7). And, indeed, the first step in obedience was his
voluntary subjection; for the sacrifice would have been unavailing to
justification if not offered spontaneously. Hence our Lord, after testifying,
&#8220;I lay down my life for the sheep,&#8221; distinctly adds, &#8220;No man
taketh it from me,&#8221; (John 10:15, 18). In the same sense Isaiah says,
&#8220; Like a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opened not his
mouth,&#8221; (Is. 53:7). The Gospel History relates that he came forth to meet
the soldiers; and in presence of Pilate, instead of defending himself, stood to
receive judgment. This, indeed, he did not without a struggle, for he had
assumed our infirmities also, and in this way it behoved him to prove that he
was yielding obedience to his Father. It was no ordinary example of incomparable
love towards us to struggle with dire terrors, and amid fearful tortures to cast
away all care of himself that he might provide for us. We must bear in minds
that Christ could not duly propitiate God without renouncing his own feelings
and subjecting himself entirely to his Father&#8217;s will. To this effect the
Apostle appositely quotes a passage from the Psalms, &#8220;Lo, I come (in the
volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God,&#8221; (Heb.
10:5; Ps. 40:7, 8). Thus, as trembling consciences find no rest without
sacrifice and ablution by which sins are expiated, we are properly directed
thither, the source of our life being placed in the death of Christ. Moreover,
as the curse consequent upon guilt remained for the final judgment of God, one
principal point in the narrative is his condemnation before Pontius Pilate, the
governor of Judea, to teach us, that the punishment to which we were liable was
inflicted on that Just One. We could not escape the fearful judgment of God; and
Christ, that he might rescue us from it, submitted to be condemned by a mortal,
nay, by a wicked and profane man. For the name of Governor is mentioned not only
to support the credibility of the narrative, but to remind us of what Isaiah
says, that &#8220;the chastisement of our peace was upon him;&#8221; and that
&#8220;with his stripes we are healed,&#8221; (Is. 53:5). For, in order to
remove our condemnation, it was not sufficient to endure any kind of death. To
satisfy our ransom, it was necessary to select a mode of death in which he might
deliver us, both by giving himself up to condemnations and undertaking our
expiation. Had he been cut off by assassins, or slain in a seditious tumult,
there could have been no kind of satisfaction in such a death. But when he is
placed as a criminal at the bar, where witnesses are brought to give evidence
against him, and the mouth of the judge condemns him to die, we see him
sustaining the character of an offender and evil-doer. Here we must attend to
two points which had both been foretold by the prophets, and tend admirably to
comfort and confirm our faith. When we read that Christ was led away from the
judgment-seat to execution, and was crucified between thieves, we have a
fulfilment of the prophecy which is quoted by the Evangelist, &#8220;He was
numbered with the transgressors,&#8221; (Is. 53:12; Mark 15:28). Why was it so?
That he might bear the character of a sinner, not of a just or innocent person,
inasmuch as he met death on account not of innocence, but of sin. On the other
hand, when we read that he was acquitted by the same lips that condemned him
(for Pilate was forced once and again to bear public testimony to his
innocence), let us call to mind what is said by another prophet, &#8220;I
restored that which I took not away,&#8221; (Ps. 69:4). Thus we perceive Christ
representing the character of a sinner and a criminal, while, at the same time,
his innocence shines forth, and it becomes manifest that he suffers for
another&#8217;s and not for his own crime. He therefore suffered under Pontius
Pilate, being thus, by the formal sentence of the judge, ranked among criminals,
and yet he is declared innocent by the same judge, when he affirms that he finds
no cause of death in him. Our acquittal is in this that the guilt which made us
liable to punishment was transferred to the head of the Son of God (Is. 53:12).
We must specially remember this substitution in order that we may not be all our
lives in trepidation and anxiety, as if the just vengeance which the Son of God
transferred to himself, were still impending over us.<br><br>6. The very form of the
death embodies a striking truth. The cross was cursed not only in the opinion of
men, but by the enactment of the Divine Law. Hence Christ, while suspended on
it, subjects himself to the curse. And thus it behoved to be done, in order that
the whole curse, which on account of our iniquities awaited us, or rather lay
upon us, might be taken from us by being transferred to him. This was also
shadowed in the Law, since twm`a<br><br>, the word by which sin itself is properly
designated, was applied to the sacrifices and expiations offered for sin. By
this application of the term, the Spirit intended to intimate, that they were a
kind of kaqarmavton (purifications), bearing, by substitutions the curse due to
sin. But that which was represented figuratively in the Mosaic sacrifices is
exhibited in Christ the archetype. Wherefore, in order to accomplish a full
expiation, he made his soul to !`a<br><br>, <i>i.e.</i>, a propitiatory victim for
sin (as the prophet says, Is. 53:5, 10), on which the guilt and penalty being in
a manner laid, ceases to be imputed to us. The Apostle declares this more
plainly when he says, that &#8220;he made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin;
that we might be made the righteousness of God in him,&#8221; (2 Cor. 5:21). For
the Son of God, though spotlessly pure, took upon him the disgrace and ignominy
of our iniquities, and in return clothed us with his purity. To the same thing
he seems to refer, when he says, that he &#8220;condemned sin in the
flesh,&#8221; (Rom. 8:3), the Father having destroyed the power of sin when it
was transferred to the flesh of Christ. This term, therefore, indicates that
Christ, in his death, was offered to the Father as a propitiatory victim; that,
expiation being made by his sacrifice, we might cease to tremble at the divine
wrath. It is now clear what the prophet means when he says, that &#8220;the Lord
has laid upon him the iniquity of us all,&#8221; (Is. 53:6); namely, that as he
was to wash away the pollution of sins, they were transferred to him by
imputation. Of this the cross to which he was nailed was a symbol, as the
Apostle declares, &#8220;Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being
made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a
tree: that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus
Christ,&#8221; (Gal. 3:13, 14). In the same way Peter says, that he &#8220;bare
our sins in his own body on the tree,&#8221; (1 Peter 2:24), inasmuch as from
the very symbol of the curse, we perceive more clearly that the burden with
which we were oppressed was laid upon him. Nor are we to understand that by the
curse which he endured he was himself overwhelmed, but rather that by enduring
it he repressed broke, annihilated all its force. Accordingly, faith apprehends
acquittal in the condemnation of Christ, and blessing in his curse. Hence it is
not without cause that Paul magnificently celebrates the triumph which Christ
obtained upon the cross, as if the cross, the symbol of ignominy, had been
converted into a triumphal chariot. For he says, that he blotted out the
handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and
took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross: that &#8220;having spoiled
principalities and powers he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in
it,&#8221; (Col. 2:14, 15). Nor is this to be wondered at; for, as another
Apostle declares, Christ, &#8220;through the eternal Spirit, offered himself
without spot to God,&#8221; (Heb. 9:14), and hence that transformation of the
cross which were otherwise against its nature. But that these things may take
deep root and have their seat in our inmost hearts, we must never lose sight of
sacrifice and ablution. For, were not Christ a victim, we could have no sure
conviction of his being ajpoluvtrwsi", ajntivlutron, kai; iJlasthvrion, <i>our
substitute-ransom and propitiation</i>. And hence mention is always made of
blood whenever scripture explains the mode of redemption: although the shedding
of Christ&#8217;s blood was available not only for propitiation, but also acted
as a laver to purge our defilements.<br><br>7. The Creed next mentions that he
&#8220;was dead and buried&#8221;. Here again it is necessary to consider how he
substituted himself in order to pay the price of our redemption. Death held us
under its yoke, but he in our place delivered himself into its power, that he
might exempt us from it. This the Apostle means when he says, &#8220;that he
tasted death for every man,&#8221; (Heb. 2:9). By dying he prevented us from
dying; or (which is the same thing) he by his death purchased life for us (see
Calvin in Psychopann). But in this he differed from us, that in permitting
himself to be overcome of death, it was not so as to be engulfed in its abyss
but rather to annihilate it, as it must otherwise have annihilated us; he did
not allow himself to be so subdued by it as to be crushed by its power; he
rather laid it prostrate, when it was impending over us, and exulting over us as
already overcome. In fine, his object was, &#8220;that through death he might
destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver them
who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage,&#8221;
(Heb. 2:14, 15). This is the first fruit which his death produced to us. Another
is, that by fellowship with him he mortifies our earthly members that they may
not afterwards exert themselves in action, and kill the old man, that he may not
hereafter be in vigour and bring forth fruit. An effect of his burials moreover
is that we as his fellows are buried to sin. For when the Apostle says, that we
are ingrafted into the likeness of Christ&#8217;s deaths and that we are buried
with him unto sin, that by his cross the world is crucified unto us and we unto
the world, and that we are dead with him, he not only exhorts us to manifest an
example of his death, but declares that there is an efficacy in it which should
appear in all Christians, if they would not render his death unfruitful and
useless. Accordingly in the death and burial of Christ a twofold blessing is set
before us&#8212;viz. deliverance from death, to which we were enslaved, and the
mortification of our flesh (Rom. 6:5; Gal. 2:19, 6:14; Col. 3:3).<br><br>8. Here we
must not omit the descent to hell, which was of no little importance to the
accomplishment of redemption. For although it is apparent from the writings of
the ancient Fathers, that the clause which now stands in the Creed was not
formerly so much used in the churches, still, in giving a summary of doctrine, a
place must be assigned to it, as containing a matter of great importance which
ought not by any means to be disregarded. Indeed, some of the ancient Fathers do
not omit
it,<sup><font size="2">25</font><a name="fnB115" href="#fn115">[7]</a></sup> and
hence we may conjecture, that having been inserted in the Creed after a
considerable lapse of time, it came into use in the Church not immediately but
by
degrees.<sup><font size="2">25</font><a name="fnB116" href="#fn116">[8]</a></sup>
This much is uncontroverted, that it was in accordance with the general
sentiment of all believers, since there is none of the Fathers who does not
mention Christ&#8217;s descent into hell, though they have various modes of
explaining it. But it is of little consequence by whom and at what time it was
introduced. The chief thing to be attended to in the Creed is, that it furnishes
us with a full and every way complete summary of faith, containing nothing but
what has been derived from the infallible word of God. But should any still
scruple to give it admission into the Creed, it will shortly be made plain, that
the place which it holds in a summary of our redemption is so important, that
the omission of it greatly detracts from the benefit of Christ&#8217;s death.
There are some again who think that the article contains nothing new, but is
merely a repetition in different words of what was previously said respecting
burial, the word Hell (Infernis) being often used in Scripture for sepulchre. I
admit the truth of what they allege with regard to the not infrequent use of the
term <i>infernos</i> for <i>sepulchre</i>; but I cannot adopt their opinion, for
two obvious reasons. First, What folly would it have been, after explaining a
matter attended with no difficulty in clear and unambiguous terms, afterwards to
involve rather than illustrate it by clothing it in obscure phraseology? When
two expressions having the same meaning are placed together, the latter ought to
be explanatory of the former. But what kind of explanation would it be to say,
the expression, &#8220;<i>Christ was buried</i>&#8221;, means, that &#8220;<i>he
descended into hell</i>&#8221;? My second reason is the improbability that a
superfluous tautology of this description should have crept into this
compendium, in which the principal articles of faith are set down summarily in
the fewest possible number of words. I have no doubt that all who weigh the
matter with some degree of care will here agree with me.<br><br>9. Others interpret
differently&#8212;viz. That Christ descended to the souls of the Patriarchs who
died under the law, to announce his accomplished redemption, and bring them out
of the prison in which they were confined. To this effect they wrest the
passage<sup><font size="2">25</font><a name="fnB117" href="#fn117">[9]</a></sup>
in the Psalms &#8220;He hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron
in sunder.&#8221; (Ps. 107:16); and also the passage in Zechariah, &#8220;I have
sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water,&#8221; (Zech.
9:11). But since the psalm foretells the deliverance of those who were held
captive in distant lands, and Zechariah comparing the Babylonish disaster into
which the people had been plunged to a deep dry well or abyss, at the same time
declares, that the salvation of the whole Church was an escape from a profound
pit, I know not how it comes to pass, that posterity imagined it to be a
subterraneous cavern, to which they gave the name of <i>Limbus</i>. Though this
fable has the countenance of great authors, and is now also seriously defended
by many as
truth,<sup><font size="2">26</font><a name="fnB118" href="#fn118">[0]</a></sup>
it is nothing but a fable. To conclude from it that the souls of the dead are in
prison is childish. And what occasion was there that the soul of Christ should
go down thither to set them at liberty? I readily admit that Christ illumined
them by the power of his Spirit, enabling them to perceive that the grace of
which they had only had a foretaste was then manifested to the world. And to
this not improbably the passage of Peter may be applied, wherein he says, that
Christ &#8220;went and preached to the spirits that were in prison,&#8221; (or
rather &#8220;a watch-tower&#8221;) (I Pet. 3:19). The purport of the context
is, that believers who had died before that time were partakers of the same
grace with ourselves: for he celebrates the power of Christ&#8217;s death, in
that he penetrated even to the dead, pious souls obtaining an immediate view of
that visitation for which they had anxiously waited; while, on the other hand,
the reprobate were more clearly convinced that they were completely excluded
from salvation. Although the passage in Peter is not perfectly definite, we must
not interpret as if he made no distinction between the righteous and the wicked:
he only means to intimate, that the death of Christ was made known to
both.<br><br>10. But, apart from the Creed, we must seek for a surer exposition of
Christ&#8217;s descent to hell: and the word of God furnishes us with one not
only pious and holy, but replete with excellent consolation. Nothing had been
done if Christ had only endured corporeal death. In order to interpose between
us and God&#8217;s anger, and satisfy his righteous judgment, it was necessary
that he should feel the weight of divine vengeance. Whence also it was necessary
that he should engage, as it were, at close quarters with the powers of hell and
the horrors of eternal death. We lately quoted from the Prophet, that the
&#8220;chastisement of our peace was laid upon him&#8221; that he &#8220;was
bruised for our iniquities&#8221; that he &#8220;bore our infirmities;&#8221;
expressions which intimate, that, like a sponsor and surety for the guilty, and,
as it were, subjected to condemnation, he undertook and paid all the penalties
which must have been exacted from them, the only exception being, that the pains
of death could not hold him. Hence there is nothing strange in its being said
that he descended to hell, seeing he endured the death which is inflicted on the
wicked by an angry God. It is frivolous and ridiculous to object that in this
way the order is perverted, it being absurd that an event which preceded burial
should be placed after it. But after explaining what Christ endured in the sight
of man, the Creed appropriately adds the invisible and incomprehensible judgment
which he endured before God, to teach us that not only was the body of Christ
given up as the price of redemption, but that there was a greater and more
excellent price&#8212;that he bore in his soul the tortures of condemned and
ruined man.<br><br>11. In this sense, Peter says that God raised up Christ,
&#8220;having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible he should
be holden of it,&#8221; (Acts 2:24). He does not mention death simply, but says
that the Son of God endured the pains produced by the curse and wrath of God,
the source of death. How small a matter had it been to come forth securely, and
as it were in sport to undergo death. Herein was a true proof of boundless
mercy, that he shunned not the death he so greatly dreaded. And there can be no
doubt that, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, the Apostle means to teach the same
thing, when he says that he &#8220;was heard in that he feared,&#8221; (Heb.
5:7). Some instead of &#8220;feared,&#8221; use a term meaning reverence or
piety, but how inappropriately, is apparent both from the nature of the thing
and the form of
expression.<sup><font size="2">26</font><a name="fnB119" href="#fn119">[1]</a></sup>
Christ then praying in a loud voice, and with tears, is heard in that he feared,
not so as to be exempted from death, but so as not to be swallowed up of it like
a sinner, though standing as our representative. And certainly no abyss can be
imagined more dreadful than to feel that you are abandoned and forsaken of God,
and not heard when you invoke him, just as if he had conspired your destruction.
To such a degree was Christ dejected, that in the depth of his agony he was
forced to exclaim, &#8220;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&#8221; The
view taken by some, that he here expressed the opinion of others rather than his
own conviction, is most improbable; for it is evident that the expression was
wrung from the anguish of his inmost soul. We do not, however, insinuate that
God was ever hostile to him or angry with
him.<sup><font size="2">26</font><a name="fnB120" href="#fn120">[2]</a></sup>
How could he be angry with the beloved Son, with whom his soul was well pleased?
or how could he have appeased the Father by his intercession for others if He
were hostile to himself? But this we say, that he bore the weight of the divine
anger, that, smitten and afflicted, he experienced all the signs of an angry and
avenging God. Hence Hilary argues, that to this descent we owe our exemption
from death. Nor does he dissent from this view in other passages, as when he
says, &#8220;The cross, death, hell, are our life.&#8221; And again, &#8220;The
Son of God is in hell, but man is brought back to heaven.&#8221; And why do I
quote the testimony of a private writer, when an Apostle asserts the same thing,
stating it as one fruit of his victory that he delivered &#8220;them who through
fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage?&#8221; (Heb. 2:15). He
behoved therefore, to conquer the fear which incessantly vexes and agitates the
breasts of all mortals; and this he could not do without a contest. Moreover it
will shortly appear with greater clearness that his was no common sorrow, was
not the result of a trivial cause. Thus by engaging with the power of the devil,
the fear of death, and the pains of hell, he gained the victory, and achieved a
triumph, so that we now fear not in death those things which our Prince has
destroyed.<sup><font size="2">26</font><a name="fnB121" href="#fn121">[3]</a></sup><br><br>12.
Here some miserable creatures, who, though unlearned, are however impelled more
by malice than ignorance, cry out that I am offering an atrocious insult to
Christ, because it were most incongruous to hold that he feared for the safety
of his soul. And then in harsher terms they urge the calumnious charge that I
attribute despair to the Son of God, a feeling the very opposite of faith.
First, they wickedly raise a controversy as to the fear and dread which Christ
felt, though these are openly affirmed by the Evangelists. For before the hour
of his death arrived, he was troubled in spirit, and affected with grief; and at
the very onset began to be exceedingly amazed. To speak of these feelings as
merely assumed, is a shameful evasion. It becomes us, therefore (as Ambrose
truly teaches), boldly to profess the agony of Christ, if we are not ashamed of
the cross. And certainly had not his soul shared in the punishment, he would
have been a Redeemer of bodies only. The object of his struggle was to raise up
those who were lying prostrate; and so far is this from detracting from his
heavenly glory, that his goodness, which can never be sufficiently extolled,
becomes more conspicuous in this, that he declined not to bear our infirmities.
Hence also that solace to our anxieties and griefs which the Apostle sets before
us: &#8220;We have not an high priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of
our infirmities; but was in all respects tempted like as we are, yet without
sin,&#8221; (Heb. 4:15). These men pretend that a thing in its nature vicious is
improperly ascribed to Christ; as if they were wiser than the Spirit of God, who
in the same passage reconciles the two things&#8212;viz. that he was tempted in
all respects like as we are, and yet was without sin. There is no reason,
therefore, to take alarm at infirmity in Christ, infirmity to which he submitted
not under the constraint of violence and necessity, but merely because he loved
and pitied us. Whatever he spontaneously suffered, detracts in no degree from
his majesty. One thing which misleads these detractors is, that they do not
recognise in Christ an infirmity which was pure and free from every species of
taint, inasmuch as it was kept within the limits of obedience. As no moderation
can be seen in the depravity of our nature, in which all affections with
turbulent impetuosity exceed their due bounds, they improperly apply the same
standard to the Son of God. But as he was upright, all his affections were under
such restraint as prevented every thing like excess. Hence he could resemble us
in grief, fear, and dread, but still with this mark of distinction. Thus
refuted, they fly off to another cavil, that although Christ feared death, yet
he feared not the curse and wrath of God, from which he knew that he was safe.
But let the pious reader consider how far it is honourable to Christ to make him
more effeminate and timid than the generality of men. Robbers and other
malefactors contumaciously hasten to death, many men magnanimously despise it,
others meet it calmly. If the Son of God was amazed and terror-struck at the
prospect of it, where was his firmness or magnanimity? We are even told, what in
a common death would have been deemed most extraordinary, that in the depth of
his agony his sweat was like great drops of blood falling to the ground. Nor was
this a spectacle exhibited to the eyes of others, since it was from a secluded
spot that he uttered his groans to his Father. And that no doubt may remain, it
was necessary that angels should come down from heaven to strengthen him with
miraculous consolation. How shamefully effeminate would it have been (as I have
observed) to be so excruciated by the fear of an ordinary death as to sweat
drops of blood, and not even be revived by the presence of angels? What? Does
not that prayer, thrice repeated, &#8220;Father, if it be possible, let this cup
pass from me,&#8221; (Mt. 26:39), a prayer dictated by incredible bitterness of
soul, show that Christ had a fiercer and more arduous struggle than with
ordinary death?<br><br>Hence it appears that these triflers, with whom I am
disputing, presume to talk of what they know not, never having seriously
considered what is meant and implied by ransoming us from the justice of God. It
is of consequence to understand aright how much our salvation cost the Son of
God. If any one now ask, Did Christ descend to hell at the time when he
deprecated death? I answer, that this was the commencement, and that from it we
may infer how dire and dreadful were the tortures which he endured when he felt
himself standing at the bar of God as a criminal in our stead. And although the
divine power of the Spirit veiled itself for a moment, that it might give place
to the infirmity of the flesh, we must understand that the trial arising from
feelings of grief and fear was such as not to be at variance with faith. And in
this was fulfilled what is said in Peter&#8217;s sermon as to having been loosed
from the pains of death, because &#8220;it was not possible he could be holden
of it,&#8221; (Acts 2:24). Though feeling, as it were, forsaken of God, he did
not cease in the slightest degree to confide in his goodness. This appears from
the celebrated prayer in which, in the depth of his agony, he exclaimed,
&#8220;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&#8221; (Mt. 27:46). Amid all
his agony he ceases not to call upon his God, while exclaiming that he is
forsaken by him. This refutes the Apollinarian heresy as well as that of those
who are called Monothelites. Apollinaris pretended, that in Christ the eternal
Spirit supplied the place of a soul, so that he was only half a man; as if he
could have expiated our sins in any other way than by obeying the Father. But
where does the feeling or desire of obedience reside but in the soul? And we
know that his soul was troubled in order that ours, being free from trepidation,
might obtain peace and quiet. Moreover, in opposition to the Monothelites, we
see that in his human he felt a repugnance to what he willed in his divine
nature. I say nothing of his subduing the fear of which we have spoken by a
contrary affection. This appearance of repugnance is obvious in the words,
&#8220;Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.
Father, glorify thy name,&#8221; (John 12:27, 28). Still, in this perplexity,
there was no violent emotion, such as we exhibit while making the strongest
endeavours to subdue our own feelings.<br><br>13. Next follows the resurrection from
the dead, without which all that has hitherto been said would be defective. For
seeing that in the cross, death, and burial of Christ, nothing but weakness
appears, faith must go beyond all these, in order that it may be provided with
full strength. Hence, although in his death we have an effectual completion of
salvation, because by it we are reconciled to God, satisfaction is given to his
justice, the curse is removed, and the penalty paid; still it is not by his
death, but by his resurrection, that we are said to be begotten again to a
living hope (1 Pet. 1:3); because, as he, by rising again, became victorious
over death, so the victory of our faith consists only in his resurrection. The
nature of it is better expressed in the words of Paul, &#8220;Who (Christ) was
delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification,&#8221;
(Rom. 4:25); as if he had said, By his death sin was taken away, by his
resurrection righteousness was renewed and restored. For how could he by dying
have freed us from death, if he had yielded to its power? how could he have
obtained the victory for us, if he had fallen in the contest?<br><br>Our salvation
may be thus divided between the death and the resurrection of Christ: by the
former sin was abolished and death annihilated; by the latter righteousness was
restored and life revived, the power and efficacy of the former being still
bestowed upon us by means of the latter. Paul accordingly affirms, that he was
declared to be the Son of God by his resurrection (Rom. 1:4), because he then
fully displayed that heavenly power which is both a bright mirror of his
divinity, and a sure support of our faith; as he also elsewhere teaches, that
&#8220;though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of
God,&#8221; (2 Cor. 13:4). In the same sense, in another passage, treating of
perfection, he says, &#8220;That I may know him and the power of his
resurrection,&#8221; (Phil. 3:10). Immediately after he adds, &#8220;being made
conformable unto his death.&#8221; In perfect accordance with this is the
passage in Peter, that God &#8220;raised him up from the dead, and gave him
glory, that your faith and hope might be in God,&#8221; ( 1 Pet. 1:21). Not that
faith founded merely on his death is vacillating, but that the divine power by
which he maintains our faith is most conspicuous in his resurrection. Let us
remember, therefore, that when death only is mentioned, everything peculiar to
the resurrection is at the same time included, and that there is a like
synecdoche in the term <i>resurrection</i>, as often as it is used apart from
death, everything peculiar to death being included. But as, by rising again, he
obtained the victory, and became the resurrection and the life, Paul justly
argues, &#8220;If Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your
sins,&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:17). Accordingly, in another passage, after exulting in
the death of Christ in opposition to the terrors of condemnation, he thus
enlarges, &#8220;Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even
at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us,&#8221; (Rom.
8:34). Then, as we have already explained that the mortification of our flesh
depends on communion with the cross, so we must also understand, that a
corresponding benefit is derived from his resurrection. For as the Apostle says,
&#8220;Like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father,
even so we also should walk in newness of life,&#8221; (Rom. 6:4). Accordingly,
as in another passage, from our being dead with Christ, he inculcates,
&#8220;Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth,&#8221; (Col.
3:5); so from our being risen with Christ he infers, &#8220;seek those things
which are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God,&#8221; (Col.
3:1). In these words we are not only urged by the example of a risen Saviour to
follow newness of life, but are taught that by his power we are renewed unto
righteousness. A third benefit derived from it is, that, like an earnest, it
assures us of our own resurrection, of which it is certain that his is the
surest representation. This subject is discussed at length (1 Cor. 15). But it
is to be observed, in passing, that when he is said to have &#8220;risen from
the dead,&#8221; these terms express the reality both of his death and
resurrection, as if it had been said, that he died the same death as other men
naturally die, and received immortality in the same mortal flesh which he had
assumed.<br><br>14. The resurrection is naturally followed by the ascension into
heaven. For although Christ, by rising again, began fully to display his glory
and virtue, having laid aside the abject and ignoble condition of a mortal life,
and the ignominy of the cross, yet it was only by his ascension to heaven that
his reign truly commenced. This the Apostle shows, when he says he ascended
&#8220;that he might fill all things,&#8221; (Eph. 4:10); thus reminding us,
that under the appearance of contradiction, there is a beautiful harmony,
inasmuch as though he departed from us, it was that his departure might be more
useful to us than that presence which was confined in a humble tabernacle of
flesh during his abode on the earth. Hence John, after repeating the celebrated
invitation, &#8220;If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink,&#8221;
immediately adds, &#8220;the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus
was not yet glorified,&#8221; (John 7:37, 39). This our Lord himself also
declared to his disciples, &#8220;It is expedient for you that I go away: for if
I go not away the Comforter will not come unto you,&#8221; (John 16:7). To
console them for his bodily absence, he tells them that he will not leave them
comfortless, but will come again to them in a manner invisible indeed, but more
to be desired, because they were then taught by a surer experience that the
government which he had obtained, and the power which he exercises would enable
his faithful followers not only to live well, but also to die happily. And,
indeed we see how much more abundantly his Spirit was poured out, how much more
gloriously his kingdom was advanced, how much greater power was employed in
aiding his followers and discomfiting his enemies. Being raised to heaven, he
withdrew his bodily presence from our sight, not that he might cease to be with
his followers, who are still pilgrims on the earth, but that he might rule both
heaven and earth more immediately by his power; or rather, the promise which he
made to be with us even to the end of the world, he fulfilled by this ascension,
by which, as his body has been raised above all heavens, so his power and
efficacy have been propagated and diffused beyond all the bounds of heaven and
earth. This I prefer to explain in the words of Augustine rather than my own:
&#8220;Through death Christ was to go to the right hand of the Father, whence he
is to come to judge the quick and the dead, and that in corporal presence,
according to the sound doctrine and rule of faith. For, in spiritual presence,
he was to be with them after his ascension,&#8221; (August. Tract. in Joann.
109). In another passage he is more full and explicit: &#8220;In regard to
ineffable and invisible grace, is fulfilled what he said, Lo, I am with you
alway, even to the end of the world (Mt. 28:20); but in regard to the flesh
which the Word assumed in regard to his being born of a Virgin, in regard to his
being apprehended by the Jews, nailed to the tree, taken down from the cross,
wrapt in linen clothes, laid in the sepulchre, and manifested on his
resurrection, it may be said, Me ye have not always with you. Why? because, in
bodily presence, he conversed with his disciples forty days, and leading them
out where they saw, but followed not, he ascended into heaven, and is not here:
for there he sits at the right hand of the Father: and yet he is here, for the
presence of his Godhead was not withdrawn. Therefore, as regards his divine
presence, we have Christ always: as regards his bodily presence, it was truly
said to the disciples, Me ye have not always. For a few days the Church had him
bodily present. Now, she apprehends him by faith, but sees him not by the
eye,&#8221; (August. Tract. 51).<br><br>15. Hence it is immediately added, that he
&#8220;sitteth at the right hand of God the Father;&#8221; a similitude borrowed
from princes, who have their assessors to whom they commit the office of ruling
and issuing commands. Thus Christ, in whom the Father is pleased to be exalted,
and by whose hand he is pleased to reign, is said to have been received up, and
seated on his right hand (Mark 16:19); as if it had been said, that he was
installed in the government of heaven and earth, and formally admitted to
possession of the administration committed to him, and not only admitted for
once, but to continue until he descend to judgment. For so the Apostle
interprets, when he says, that the Father &#8220;set him at his own right hand
in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and
dominion, and every name that is named not only in this world, but also in that
which is to come; and has put all things under his feet, and given him to be the
head over all things to the
Church.&#8221;<sup><font size="2">26</font><a name="fnB122" href="#fn122">[4]</a></sup>
You see to what end he is so seated namely, that all creatures both in heaven
and earth should reverence his majesty, be ruled by his hand, do him implicit
homage, and submit to his power. All that the Apostles intends when they so
often mention his seat at the Father&#8217;s hand, is to teach, that every thing
is placed at his disposal. Those, therefore, are in error, who suppose that his
blessedness merely is indicated. We may observe, that there is nothing contrary
to this doctrine in the testimony of Stephen, that he saw him standing (Acts
7:56), the subject here considered being not the position of his body, but the
majesty of his empire, <i>sitting</i> meaning nothing more than presiding on the
judgment-seat of heaven.<br><br>16. From this doctrine faith derives manifold
advantages.<sup><font size="2">26</font><a name="fnB123" href="#fn123">[5]</a></sup>
First, it perceives that the Lord, by his ascension to heaven, has opened up the
access to the heavenly kingdom, which Adam had shut. For having entered it in
our flesh, as it were in our name, it follows, as the Apostle says, that we are
in a manner now seated in heavenly places, not entertaining a mere hope of
heaven, but possessing it in our head. Secondly, faith perceives that his seat
beside the Father is not without great advantage to us. Having entered the
temple not made with hands, he constantly appears as our advocate and
intercessor in the presence of the Father; directs attention to his own
righteousness, so as to turn it away from our sins; so reconciles him to us, as
by his intercession to pave for us a way of access to his throne, presenting it
to miserable sinners, to whom it would otherwise be an object of dread, as
replete with grace and mercy. Thirdly, it discerns his power, on which depend
our strength, might, resources, and triumph over hell, &#8220;When he ascended
up on high, he led captivity captive,&#8221; (Eph. 4:8). Spoiling his foes, he
gave gifts to his people, and daily loads them with spiritual riches. He thus
occupies his exalted seat, that thence transferring his virtue unto us, he may
quicken us to spiritual life, sanctify us by his Spirit, and adorn his Church
with various graces, by his protection preserve it safe from all harm, and by
the strength of his hand curb the enemies raging against his cross and our
salvation; in fine, that he may possess all power in heaven and earth, until he
have utterly routed all his foes, who are also ours and completed the structure
of his Church. Such is the true nature of the kingdom, such the power which the
Father has conferred upon him, until he arrive to complete the last act by
judging the quick and the dead.<br><br>17. Christ, indeed, gives his followers no
dubious proofs of present power, but as his kingdom in the world is in a manner
veiled by the humiliation of a carnal condition, faith is most properly invited
to meditate on the visible presence which he will exhibit on the last day. For
he will descend from heaven in visible form, in like manner as he was seen to
ascend,<sup><font size="2">26</font><a name="fnB124" href="#fn124">[6]</a></sup>
and appear to all, with the ineffable majesty of his kingdom, the splendour of
immortality, the boundless power of divinity, and an attending company of
angels. Hence we are told to wait for the Redeemer against that day on which he
will separate the sheep from the goats and the elect from the reprobate, and
when not one individual either of the living or the dead shall escape his
judgment. From the extremities of the universe shall be heard the clang of the
trumpet summoning all to his tribunal; both those whom that day shall find
alive, and those whom death shall previously have removed from the society of
the living. There are some who take the words, quick and dead, in a different
sense;<sup><font size="2">26</font><a name="fnB125" href="#fn125">[7]</a></sup>
and, indeed, some ancient writers appear to have hesitated as to the exposition
of them; but our meaning being plain and clear, is much more accordant with the
Creed which was certainly written for popular use. There is nothing contrary to
it in the Apostle&#8217;s declaration, that it is appointed unto all men once to
die. For though those who are surviving at the last day shall not die after a
natural manner, yet the change which they are to undergo, as it shall resemble,
is not improperly called, death (Heb. 9:27). &#8220;We shall not all sleep, but
we shall all be changed,&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:51). What does this mean? Their
mortal life shall perish and be swallowed up in one moment, and be transformed
into an entirely new nature. Though no one can deny that that destruction of the
flesh will be death, it still remains true that the quick and the dead shall be
summoned to judgment (1 Thess. 4:16); for &#8220;the dead in Christ shall rise
first; then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them
in the clouds to meet the lord in the air.&#8221; Indeed, it is probable, that
these words in the Creed were taken from Peter&#8217;s sermon as related by Luke
(Acts 10:42), and from the solemn charge of Paul to Timothy (2 Tim. 4:1).<br><br>18.
It is most consolatory to think, that judgment is vested in him who has already
destined us to share with him in the honour of judgment (Mt. 19:28); so far is
it from being true, that he will ascend the judgment-seat for our condemnation.
How could a most merciful prince destroy his own people? how could the head
disperse its own members? how could the advocate condemn his clients? For if the
Apostle, when contemplating the interposition of Christ, is bold to exclaim,
&#8220;Who is he that condemneth?&#8221; (Rom. 8:33), much more certain is it
that Christ, the intercessor, will not condemn those whom he has admitted to his
protection. It certainly gives no small security, that we shall be sisted at no
other tribunal than that of our Redeemer, from whom salvation is to be expected;
and that he who in the Gospel now promises eternal blessedness, will then as
judge ratify his
promise.<sup><font size="2">26</font><a name="fnB126" href="#fn126">[8]</a></sup>
The end for which the Father has honoured the Son by committing all judgment to
him (John 5:22), was to pacify the consciences of his people when alarmed at the
thought of judgment. Hitherto I have followed the order of the Apostles&#8217;
Creed, because it states the leading articles of redemption in a few words, and
may thus serve as a tablet in which the points of Christian doctrine, most
deserving of attention, are brought separately and distinctly before
us.<sup><font size="2">26</font><a name="fnB127" href="#fn127">[9]</a></sup> I
call it the Apostles&#8217; Creed, though I am by no means solicitous as to its
authorship. The general consent of ancient writers certainly does ascribe it to
the Apostles, either because they imagined it was written and published by them
for common use, or because they thought it right to give the sanction of such
authority to a compendium faithfully drawn up from the doctrine delivered by
their hands. I have no doubt, that, from the very commencement of the Church,
and, therefore, in the very days of the Apostles, it held the place of a public
and universally received confession, whatever be the quarter from which it
originally proceeded. It is not probable that it was written by some private
individual, since it is certain that, from time immemorial, it was deemed of
sacred authority by all Christians. The only point of consequence we hold to be
incontrovertible&#8212;viz. that it gives, in clear and succinct order, a full
statement of our faith, and in every thing which it contains is sanctioned by
the sure testimony of Scripture. This being understood, it were to no purpose to
labour anxiously, or quarrel with any one as to the authorship, unless, indeed,
we think it not enough to possess the sure truth of the Holy Spirit, without, at
the same time, knowing by whose mouth it was pronounced, or by whose hand it was
written.<br><br>19. When we see that the whole sum of our salvation, and every
single part of it, are comprehended in Christ, we must beware of deriving even
the minutes portion of it from any other quarter. If we seek salvation, we are
taught by the very name of Jesus that he possesses
it;<sup><font size="2">27</font><a name="fnB128" href="#fn128">[0]</a></sup> if
we seek any other gifts of the Spirit, we shall find them in his unction;
strength in his government; purity in his conception; indulgence in his
nativity, in which he was made like us in all respects, in order that he might
learn to sympathise with us: if we seek redemption, we shall find it in his
passion; acquittal in his condemnation; remission of the curse in his cross;
satisfaction in his sacrifice; purification in his blood; reconciliation in his
descent to hell; mortification of the flesh in his sepulchre; newness of life in
his resurrection; immortality also in his resurrection; the inheritance of a
celestial kingdom in his entrance into heaven; protection, security, and the
abundant supply of all blessings, in his kingdom; secure anticipation of
judgment in the power of judging committed to him. In fine, since in him all
kinds of blessings are treasured up, let us draw a full supply from him, and
none from any other quarter. Those who, not satisfied with him alone, entertain
various hopes from others, though they may continue to look to him chiefly,
deviate from the right path by the simple fact, that some portion of their
thought takes a different direction. No distrust of this description can arise
when once the abundance of his blessings is properly known.<br><br><br><br></div>

<div align="center">Sections.<br><br><br><br></div>
<div>1.	 Christ not only the minister, but also the author and prince of
salvation. Divine grace not obscured by this mode of expression. The merit of
Christ not opposed to the mercy of God, but depends upon it.<br><br>2.	 The
compatibility of the two proved by various passages of Scripture.<br><br>3.	 Christ
by his obedience truly merited divine grace for us.<br><br>4.	 This grace obtained
by the shedding of Christ&#8217;s blood, and his obedience even unto
death.<br><br>5.	 In this way he paid our ransom.<br><br>6.	 The presumptuous manner in
which the Schoolmen handle this subject.<br><br><br><br>1. A QUESTION must here be
considered by way of supplement. Some men too much given to subtilty, while they
admit that we obtain salvation through Christ, will not hear of the name of
merit, by which they imagine that the grace of God is obscured; and therefore
insist that Christ was only the instrument or minister, not the author or
leader, or prince of life, as he is designated by Peter (Acts 3:15). I admit
that were Christ opposed simply, and by himself, to the justice of God, there
could be no room for merit, because there cannot be found in man a worth which
could make God a debtor; nay, as Augustine says most
truly,<sup><font size="2">27</font><a name="fnB129" href="#fn129">[1]</a></sup>
&#8220;The Saviour, the man Christ Jesus, is himself the brightest illustration
of predestination and grace: his character as such was not procured by any
antecedent merit of works or faith in his human nature. Tell me, I pray, how
that man, when assumed into unity of person by the Word, co-eternal with the
Father, as the only begotten Son at God, could merit
this.&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;Let the very fountain of grace, therefore, appear in
our head, whence, according to the measure of each, it is diffused through all
his members. Every man, from the commencement of his faith, becomes a Christian,
by the same grace by which that man from his formation became Christ.&#8221;
Again, in another passage, &#8220;There is not a more striking example of
predestination than the mediator himself. He who made him (without any
antecedent merit in his will) of the seed of David a righteous man never to be
unrighteous, also converts those who are members of his head from unrighteous
into righteous&#8221; and so forth. Therefore when we treat of the merit of
Christ, we do not place the beginning in him, but we ascend to the ordination of
God as the primary cause, because of his mere good pleasure he appointed a
Mediator to purchase salvation for us. Hence the merit of Christ is
inconsiderately opposed to the mercy of God. It is a well known rule, that
principal and accessory are not incompatible, and therefore there is nothing to
prevent the justification of man from being the gratuitous result of the mere
mercy of God, and, at the same time, to prevent the merit of Christ from
intervening in subordination to this mercy. The free favour of God is as fitly
opposed to our works as is the obedience of Christ, both in their order: for
Christ could not merit anything save by the good pleasure of God, but only
inasmuch as he was destined to appease the wrath of God by his sacrifice, and
wipe away our transgressions by his obedience: in one word, since the merit of
Christ depends entirely on the grace of God (which provided this mode of
salvation for us), the latter is no less appropriately opposed to all
righteousness of men than is the former.<br><br>2. This distinction is found in
numerous passages of Scripture: &#8220;God so loved the world, that he gave his
only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him might not perish,&#8221;
(John 3:16). We see that the first place is assigned to the love of God as the
chief cause or origin, and that faith in Christ follows as the second and more
proximate cause. Should any one object that Christ is only the formal
cause,<sup><font size="2">27</font><a name="fnB130" href="#fn130">[2]</a></sup>
he lessens his energy more than the words justify. For if we obtain
justification by a faith which leans on him, the groundwork of our salvation
must be sought in him. This is clearly proved by several passages: &#8220;Herein
is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the
propitiation for our sins,&#8221; (1 John 4:10). These words clearly demonstrate
that God, in order to remove any obstacle to his love towards us, appointed the
method of reconciliation in Christ. There is great force in this word
&#8220;<i>propitiation</i>&#8221;; for in a manner which cannot be expressed,
God, at the very time when he loved us, was hostile to us until reconciled in
Christ. To this effect are all the following passages: &#8220;He is the
propitiation for our sins;&#8221; &#8220;It pleased the Father that in him
should all fulness dwell, and having made peace by the blood of his cross, by
him to reconcile all things unto himself;&#8221; &#8220;God was in Christ
reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto
them;&#8221; &#8220;He has made us accepted in the Beloved,&#8221; &#8220;That
he might reconcile both into one body by the
cross.&#8221;<sup><font size="2">27</font><a name="fnB131" href="#fn131">[3]</a></sup>
The nature of this mystery is to be learned from the first chapter to the
Ephesians, where Paul, teaching that we were chosen in Christ, at the same time
adds, that we obtained grace in him. How did God begin to embrace with his
favour those whom he had loved before the foundation of the world, unless in
displaying his love when he was reconciled by the blood of Christ? As God is the
fountain of all righteousness, he must necessarily be the enemy and judge of man
so long as he is a sinner. Wherefore, the commencement of love is the bestowing
of righteousness, as described by Paul: &#8220;He has made him to be sin for us
who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him,&#8221;
(2 Cor. 5:21). He intimates, that by the sacrifice of Christ we obtain free
justification, and become pleasing to God, though we are by nature the children
of wrath, and by sin estranged from him. This distinction is also noted whenever
the grace of Christ is connected with the love of God (2 Cor. 13:13); whence it
follows, that he bestows upon us of his own which he acquired by purchase. For
otherwise there would be no ground for the praise ascribed to him by the Father,
that grace is his, and proceeds from him.<br><br>3. That Christ, by his obedience,
truly purchased and merited grace for us with the Father, is accurately inferred
from several passages of Scripture. I take it for granted, that if Christ
satisfied for our sins, if he paid the penalty due by us, if he appeased God by
his obedience; in fine, if he suffered the just for the unjust, salvation was
obtained for us by his righteousness; which is just equivalent to meriting. Now,
Paul&#8217;s testimony is, that we were reconciled, and received reconciliation
through his death (Rom. 5:11). But there is no room for reconciliation unless
where
offence<sup><font size="2">27</font><a name="fnB132" href="#fn132">[4]</a></sup>
has preceded. The meaning, therefore, is, that God, to whom we were hateful
through sin, was appeased by the death of his Son, and made propitious to us.
And the antithesis which immediately follows is carefully to be observed,
&#8220;As by one man&#8217;s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the
obedience of one shall many be made righteous,&#8221; (Rom. 5:19). For the
meaning is&#8212;As by the sin of Adam we were alienated from God and doomed to
destruction, so by the obedience of Christ we are restored to his favour as if
we were righteous. The future tense of the verb does not exclude present
righteousness, as is apparent from the context. For he had previously said,
&#8220;the free gift <i>is</i> of many offences unto justification.&#8221;<br><br>4.
When we say, that grace was obtained for us by the merit of Christ, our meaning
is, that we were cleansed by his blood, that his death was an expiation for sin,
&#8220;His blood cleanses us from all sin.&#8221; &#8220;This is my blood, which
is shed for the remission of sins,&#8221; (1 John 1:7; Luke 22:20). If the
effect of his shed blood is, that our sins are not imputed to us, it follows,
that by that price the justice of God was satisfied. To the same effect are the
Baptist&#8217;s words, &#8220;Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin
of the world,&#8221; (John 1:29). For he contrasts Christ with all the
sacrifices of the Law, showing that in him alone was fulfilled what these
figures typified. But we know the common expression in Moses&#8212;Iniquity
shall be expiated, sin shall be wiped away and forgiven. In short, we are
admirably taught by the ancient figures what power and efficacy there is in
Christ&#8217;s death. And the Apostle, skilfully proceeding from this principle,
explains the whole matter in the Epistle to the Hebrews, showing that without
shedding of blood there is no remission (Heb. 9:22). From this he infers, that
Christ appeared once for all to take away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
Again, that he was offered to bear the sins of many (Heb. 9:12). He had
previously said, that not by the blood of goats or of heifers, but by his own
blood, he had once entered into the holy of holies, having obtained eternal
redemption for us. Now, when he reasons thus, &#8220;If the blood of bulls and
of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the
purifying of the flesh: how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the
eternal Spirit offered himself to God, purge your consciences from dead works to
serve the living God?&#8221; (Heb. 9:13, 14), it is obvious that too little
effect is given to the grace of Christ, unless we concede to his sacrifice the
power of expiating, appeasing, and satisfying: as he shortly after adds,
&#8220;For this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of
his death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first
testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal
inheritance,&#8221; (Heb. 9:15). But it is especially necessary to attend to the
analogy which is drawn by Paul as to his having been made a curse for us (Gal.
3:13). It had been superfluous and therefore absurd, that Christ should have
been burdened with a curse, had it not been in order that, by paying what others
owed, he might acquire righteousness for them. There is no ambiguity in
Isaiah&#8217;s testimony, &#8220;He was wounded for our transgressions, he was
bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was laid upon him; and
with his stripes we are healed,&#8221; (Is. 53:5). For had not Christ satisfied
for our sins, he could not be said to have appeased God by taking upon himself
the penalty which we had incurred. To this corresponds what follows in the same
place, &#8220;for the transgression of my people was he stricken,&#8221; (Is.
53:8). We may add the interpretation of Peter, who unequivocally declares, that
he &#8220;bare our sins in his own body on the tree,&#8221; (1 Pet. 2:24), that
the whole burden of condemnation, of which we were relieved, was laid upon
him.<br><br>5. The Apostles also plainly declare that he paid a price to ransom us
from death: &#8220;Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption
that is in Christ Jesus: whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through
faith in his blood,&#8221; (Rom. 3:24, 25). Paul commends the grace of God, in
that he gave the price of redemption in the death of Christ; and he exhorts us
to flee to his blood, that having obtained righteousness, we may appear boldly
before the judgment-seat of God. To the same effect are the words of Peter:
&#8220;Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things,
as silver and gold,&#8221; &#8220;but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a
lamb without blemish and without spot,&#8221; (1 Pet. 1:18, 19). The antithesis
would be incongruous if he had not by this price made satisfaction for sins. For
which reason, Paul says, &#8220;Ye are bought with a price.&#8221; Nor could it
be elsewhere said, there is &#8220;one mediator between God and men, the man
Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all,&#8221; (1 Tim. 2:5, 6), had not
the punishment which we deserved been laid upon him. Accordingly, the same
Apostle declares, that &#8220;we have redemption through his blood, even the
forgiveness of sins,&#8221; (Col. 1:14); as if he had said, that we are
justified or acquitted before God, because that blood serves the purpose of
satisfaction. With this another passage agrees&#8212;viz. that he blotted out
&#8220;the handwriting of ordinances which was against us, which was contrary to
us,&#8221; (Col. 2:14). These words denote the payment or compensation which
acquits us from guilt. There is great weight also in these words of Paul:
&#8220;If righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain,&#8221;
(Gal. 2:21). For we hence infer, that it is from Christ we must seek what the
Law would confer on any one who fulfilled it; or, which is the same thing, that
by the grace of Christ we obtain what God promised in the Law to our works:
&#8220;If a man do, he shall live in them,&#8221; (Lev. 18:5). This is no less
clearly taught in the discourse at Antioch, when Paul declares, &#8220;That
through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins; and by him all
that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified
by the law of Moses,&#8221; (Acts 13:38, 39). For if the observance of the Law
is righteousness, who can deny that Christ, by taking this burden upon himself,
and reconciling us to God, as if we were the observers of the Law, merited
favour for us? Of the same nature is what he afterwards says to the Galatians:
&#8220;God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem
them that were under the law,&#8221; (Gal. 4:4, 5). For to what end that
subjection, unless that he obtained justification for us by undertaking to
perform what we were unable to pay? Hence that imputation of righteousness
without works, of which Paul treats (Rom. 4:5), the righteousness found in
Christ alone being accepted as if it were ours. And certainly the only reason
why Christ is called our &#8220;meat,&#8221; (John 6:55), is because we find in
him the substance of life. And the source of this efficacy is just that the Son
of God was crucified as the price of our justification; as Paul says, Christ
&#8220;has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a
sweet-smelling savour,&#8221; (Eph. 5:2); and elsewhere, he &#8220;was delivered
for our offences, and was raised again for our justification,&#8221; (Rom.
4:25). Hence it is proved not only that salvation was given us by Christ, but
that on account of him the Father is now propitious to us. For it cannot be
doubted that in him is completely fulfilled what God declares by Isaiah under a
figure, &#8220;I will defend this city to save it for mine own sakes and for my
servant David&#8217;s sake,&#8221; (Isaiah 37:35). Of this the Apostle is the
best witness when he says &#8220;Your sins are forgiven you for his name&#8217;s
sake,&#8221; (1 John 2:12). For although the name of Christ is not expressed,
John, in his usual manner, designates him by the pronoun &#8220;He,&#8221;
(aujtov"). In the same sense also our Lord declares, &#8220;As the living Father
has sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live
by me,&#8221; (John 6:57). To this corresponds the passage of Paul, &#8220;Unto
you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to
suffer for his sake,&#8221; (Phil. 1:29).<br><br>6. To inquire, as Lombard and the
Schoolmen do (Sent. Lib. 3 Dist. 18), whether he merited for himself, is foolish
curiosity. Equally rash is their decision when they answer in the affirmative.
How could it be necessary for the only Son of God to come down in order to
acquire some new quality for himself? The exposition which God gives of his own
purpose removes all doubt. The Father is not said to have consulted the
advantage of his Son in his services, but to have given him up to death, and not
spared him, because he loved the world (Rom. 8). The prophetical expressions
should be observed: &#8220;To us a Son is born;&#8221; &#8220;Rejoice greatly, O
daughter of Zion: shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto
thee,&#8221; (Isaiah 9:6; Zech. 9:9). It would otherwise be a cold commendation
of love which Paul describes, when he says, &#8220;God commendeth his love
toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us,&#8221; (Rom.
5:8). Hence, again, we infer that Christ had no regard to himself; and this he
distinctly affirms, when he says, &#8220;For their sakes I sanctify
myself,&#8221; (John 17:19). He who transfers the benefit of his holiness to
others, testifies that he acquires nothing for himself. And surely it is most
worthy of remark, that Christ, in devoting himself entirely to our salvation, in
a manner forgot himself. It is absurd to wrest the testimony of Paul to a
different effect: &#8220;Wherefore God has highly exalted him, and given him a
name which is above every name,&#8221; (Phil.
2:9).<sup><font size="2">27</font><a name="fnB133" href="#fn133">[5]</a></sup>
By what services could a man merit to become the judge of the world, the head of
angels, to obtain the supreme government of God, and become the residence of
that majesty of which all the virtues of men and angels cannot attain one
thousandth part? The solution is easy and complete. Paul is not speaking of the
cause of Christ&#8217;s exaltation, but only pointing out a consequence of it by
way of example to us. The meaning is not much different from that of another
passage: &#8220;Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter
into his glory?&#8221; (Luke 24:26).<br><br></div>
