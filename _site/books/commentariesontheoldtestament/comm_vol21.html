<div><font face="Palatino">This prophecy is against the Moabites, who, though
they derived their origin from Lot, and were of the same blood with the
Israelites, had yet been inimical to them. This prophecy would be uninteresting,
were we not to remember the history on which the application and use of what is
said depends. We have said that the Moabites, as the father of their nation was
Lot, were connected by blood with the Israelites; they ought then to have
retained the recollection of their brotherhood, and to have dealt kindly with
them; for God had spared them when the people of Israel entered into the land of
Canaan. The Israelites, we know, passed through the borders of Moab without
doing any harm to them, because it was God&#8217;s purpose, from a regard to
Lot, to preserve them for a time. But this people never ceased to contrive all
manner of plots against God&#8217;s people; and, as we shall hereafter see, when
the state of that people became embarrassed, they cruelly exulted over them, and
became more insolent than avowed enemies. Hence God prophesied against them,
that the Israelites might know, as we reminded you yesterday, that their
miserable condition was not overlooked by God, and that though he chastised
them, yet some hope of mercy remained, as he undertook their cause and would be
their defender. It was then no small comfort which this prophecy brought to the
faithful; for they thus knew that God was still their father, though apparently
he seemed to be severe to them. We now perceive the design of what is here
said.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The case of the Moabites was different from that of
the Egyptians, for the Egyptians were wholly aliens to the chosen people; but
the Moabites, as we have said, were related to them. They were therefore
willful, and as it were intestine enemies; and nature itself ought to have
taught them to acknowledge the Israelites as their brethren, and to cultivate
mutual kindness. This cruelty and ingratitude were so hateful to God, that at
length he punished them most severely. But as the Moabites remained in quietness
when Judea was laid waste, and the city Jerusalem destroyed, after the overthrow
of the kingdom of Israel, and the banishment of the ten tribes to distant
countries, it behooved the faithful to exercise patience, which could not have
been done without hope. It was this then that Jeremiah had in view, even to
sustain the minds of the godly with the expectation of God&#8217;s judgment,
which he here denounces on the Moabites.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Against

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the
God of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>By the first term he
designates the immense power of God, and reminds them that God is the judge of
the whole world, and that his kingdom extends over all nations; but by the
second expression he bears testimony to the love with which he had embraced the
children of Abraham, because he had been pleased to choose them as his peculiar
inheritance.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, as before, does not speak in an ordinary
way, but declares in lofty terms what God had committed to him, in order that he
might terrify the Moabites; not indeed that they heard his threatenings, but it
was necessary that he should denounce vengeance in this vehement manner, that
the Jews might know that the cruelty and pride of the Moabites, hereafter
mentioned, would not go unpunished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>No more shall be the praise
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or the boasting
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of Moab over
Heshbon</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>We may learn from this place
and from others, that Heshbon had been taken from the Moabites; for it was
occupied by God&#8217;s people, because the Moabites had lost it, as Moses
relates in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;042130&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
21:30, and in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;050226&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
2:26, etc. But (as things change) when the Moabites became strong, they took
away this city from the Israelites. Hence the Prophet says, that there would be
no more boasting that they possessed that city; for he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have
thought,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or devised, etc. There is here
a striking allusion, for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wb&ccedil;j</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chesbon</i>,<i> </i>is derived from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b&ccedil;j</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chesheb</i>,<i> </i>to devise or to consult, as though it were a place of
consultation or devisings. The Prophet then says, that as to Heshbon they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>consulted
against</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> it</i>,<i>
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hyl[
wb&ccedil;j</font><font face="Palatino"><i> cheshbu olie</i>.<i> </i>He uses the
root from which the name of the city is derived. Heshbon, then, hitherto called
the place of consultation, was to have and find other counselors, even those who
would contrive ruin for it. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come
ye</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>the Prophet refers here to the
counsel taken by the Chaldeans,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come ye, and let us cut her off
from being a nation</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He then joins
another city, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou,

shall go after thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or pursue thee, as
though the city itself was fleeing from the sword; not that cities move from one
place to another; but when the citizens deliberate how they may drive away their
enemies and resist their attacks, &#8212; when they seek aid here and there,
&#8212; when they set up their own remedies, they are said to flee. But the
Prophet says, &#8220;Thou shalt gain nothing by fleeing, for the sword shall
pursue thee.&#8221; It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">By naming many cities, he shews that the whole land
was doomed to ruin, so that no corner of it would be exempt from destruction.
For the Moabites might have suffered some loss without much injury had they been
moderately chastised; but the Prophet shews that they would be so reduced by the
power of Nebuchadnezzar, that ruin would extend to every part of the land. We
now then see why this catalogue of the cities is given.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the

called, because the city consisted of two parts, a higher and a lower part. He
then adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>desolation and great
destruction</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He thus explains himself,
for the citizens of Horonaim would in vain cry out, because desolation and
breaking or destruction would constrain them, that is, make them cry out so as
to howl for the bitterness of their grief. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet speaks again generally of the whole
country. It is said that the land of Moab was afflicted; not that it was so
then; but to make certain the prophecy, he speaks of the event as having already
taken place; for the prophets, as it is well known, speaking in the person of
God, relate things as yet hidden, as though they had been completed. He says
that the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>little ones
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of Moab so cried as to be
heard.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fH5</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This is much more emphatic than if he had said that men and women cried out; for
children do not soon perceive what is going on, for their understanding is not
great. Men and women howl when threatenings only are announced; but little
children are not moved but by present evils, and except they are actually
beaten, they are not affected; and then they hardly distinguish between some
slight evil and death. Hence, when the Prophet says that the little ones of Moab
were heard in their crying, he means that the grievousness of its calamity would
be extreme, as that little children, as though wise before their time, would
perceive the atrocious cruelty of their enemies. It follows, &#8212;

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here Jeremiah uses another figure, that the weeping
would be everywhere heard in the ascent to Luhith. It is probable, and it
appears from the Prophet&#8217;s words, that this city was situated on a high
place. He then says, that men would go up with weeping
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the ascent to
Luhith</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>literally, In (or with)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>weeping shall weeping
ascend</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>But some read as though it were
written
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hkb</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>beke</i>,<i> </i>weeping; nor is there a doubt but that the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hl[y</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>iole</i>,<i> </i>refers to a person. But Jeremiah seems to have mentioned
weeping twice in order to show that men would not only weep in one place, but
during the long course of their ascent, as though he had said, &#8220;They who
shall be near the city shall weep, and they in the middle of their course, and
those at the foot of the mountain;&#8221; that is, there shall be weeping in
every place. We now then perceive the meaning of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the descent to
Horonaim</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>It hence appears that this
city was situated in a low place or on a plain; and therefore I know not why
they say that one part of it was higher than the other. It might indeed be that
it had a hill in it; but the place was in a level country, and had mountains
around it, as we learn from the Prophet&#8217;s words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the descent to Horonaim the
enemies shall hear a cry of distress</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>By
saying that enemies would hear a cry,</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH6</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he means that the citizens of Horonaim
and their neighbors would become frantic through grief. For fear restrains
weeping, and when any one sees an enemy near, the very sight of him checks him,
so that he dares not openly to show his grief; and then shame also restrains
tears as well as sighings, for an enemy would deride our weepings in our misery.
There is no doubt then, but that the Prophet here amplifies the grievousness of
their sorrow, when he says, that though the citizens of Horonaim had enemies
before their eyes, they would yet break forth with weeping and loud crying, and
that the reproach and derision of enemies would not restrain
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Flee,
save</i></font><font face="Palatino">:<i> </i>this is the crying of distress;
for miserable men, as the case is in extreme evils, mutually exhort one another,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Flee, save your
lives</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He then compares them to a
tamarisk. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r[wr[</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
oruor</i>,<i> </i>designates a country, as it is probable, and there were also
two cities of this name. However,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r[r[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>oror</i>,<i> </i>is a tamarisk, as we have already seen in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;241706&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
17:6. Some render it, &#8220;<i>a </i>tower;&#8221;<i> </i>and the words of
Isaiah in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;231702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
17:2, are perverted by some to maintain another meaning; for they think that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r[wr[</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
oruor</i>,<i> </i>means the cot of shepherds in the desert; but I prefer the
opinion of those who render it &#8220;tamarisk,&#8221;<i> </i>or juniper, though
the Prophet seems to me to allude to the city Aroer, or to a region of that
name, but I rather think to the city. He then says,
<i>-</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye shall be as a
tamarisk in the desert</i></font><font face="Palatino">:<i> </i>and it is known
from other places that Aroer was in the land of Moab.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive what the Prophet means: that
Moab would be like a juniper in the desert, that is, a barren tree, which never
grows to any size; and then it is dry, because it is not cherished by any rain,
nor fed by any moisture from the ground. It is in this sense, as we have stated,
that our Prophet took the similitude in

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah assigns here the reason why God would take
vengeance on the Moabites; but we shall hereafter see other reasons why God had
been so much displeased with them. Let us then know that we are not here taught
avowedly why God determined to lay waste and destroy the land of Moab; for there
is here but one reason given, while there were others and greater ones, even
because they had wantonly exulted over the miseries of the Jews, because they
had conspired against them, because they had betrayed them, and lastly, because
they had as it were carried on war with their God. But here Jeremiah briefly
shews, that were there no other reasons, the Moabites deserved that God should
pour forth his wrath on them even for this, because they trusted in their own
works and treasures. By works some understand herds and flocks; and in this
sense they<i> </i>are sometimes taken, and it is an exposition that may be
admitted. We may however understand by &#8220;works&#8221; fortifications,
especially as &#8220;treasures&#8221; are added. He then says, that the Moabites
were such that it was just that God should be roused against them, because they
were inebriated with false confidence in their own power, and because they had
many treasures: they hence thought that they were impregnable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet in the meantime intimates, that the
Moabites greatly deceived themselves in thinking that they were safe against
God&#8217;s hand, because they were strongly fortified, and because they had
immense treasures laid up. Hence he says that all these things would avail
nothing, for God would destroy the whole land.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even
thou</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he says,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shalt be

particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;g</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gam</i>,<i> </i>even or also; for the Prophet expresses what would now take
place; for the Moabites in vain trusted in their treasures and power, because
God would notwithstanding destroy them, and his hand would penetrate<i> </i>into
their fortresses. &#8220;God<i> </i>then shall find thee out equally the same,
as though thou wert exposed to all dangers.&#8221; They who abound in warlike
preparations, furnished with all kinds of defences, think themselves exempted
from the common lot of men: hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even
thou</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>equally the same with any village
exposed to the will of enemies,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>even thou shalt be taken; and go
forth shall Chemosh</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This was the
tutelar God of the land, as it appears from the book of Judges and other places,
and even from what Moses says,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;071125&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Judges
11:25;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;111107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 11:7, 33; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;042129&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
21:29.) As, then, the Moabites worshipped this idol, they thought themselves
safe whatever evil might be at hand. The Prophet then derides this confidence.
We have said before, that the ungodly in part set up their own earthly power in
opposition to God, and in part imagined that they were aided by their idols.
Hence the prophets exposed these two evils, as it appears also from the present
passage: the Prophet had said, &#8220;Because thou trustest in thy fortresses
and treasures, even thou shalt be taken;&#8221; and now he says, &#8220;Because
thou thinkest Chemosh to be a sure and invincible defense, it shall be driven
into exile and be kept captive.&#8221; This he said in reproach to the idol. He
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>its priests and its
princes</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>even those princes, who seem to
lie down safely under its shadow, they also shall be driven into
exile.</font><br></div>

them to rest dependent for a long time on this promise, which God had given them

<div><font face="Palatino">Here is a bitter derision; for it was necessary not
only to goad the Moabites, but also to pierce them through, because they were
inflated with so much pride, and also because they cruelly raged against
God&#8217;s people, as we shall more fully see hereafter. When the Israelites
were conquered, these ungodly men cast forth their taunts, and also betrayed
them to their enemies. Hence the Prophet now says,

wings; as though he had said, that the Moabites could not escape destruction
except by flying. In short, as they had not only so proudly despised, but had
also persecuted their miserable brethren, the Prophet says, &#8220;Come<i>
</i>shall the time when feet for running or for flight shall not be sufficient
for you, your enemies being so eager in pursuit; but you will desire to have
wings.&#8221; But, as we shall see, he will presently tell us, that Moab had

them, for wherever it would betake itself, it would be thence driven away; for
the enemy would take all the cities, so that the whole people would be under the
necessity of removing elsewhere; he intimates, in short, that there would be no
hope for life to the Moabites, except by flight, and that the swiftest. At

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here encourages the Chaldeans to
severity, so as to make no end until they destroyed that nation. We have said
that the prophets assumed different characters, so that what they said might be
more impressive. The Chaldeans were not indeed the disciples of Jeremiah; nor
was this exhortation intended for them, but that the Israelites might know that
what they heard from the mouth of Jeremiah<i> </i>was certain. He then turns to
address the Chaldeans; as he before spoke to any who might be present,
&#8220;Give wings to Moab;&#8221; so now another apostrophe follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cursed</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>etc., &#8212; to whom does he speak? to the Chaldeans; and yet the Prophet
did not address them as though he could effect anything; but, as I have said, he
had a regard to the Jews.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage has been very absurdly explained, and it
is commonly quoted as though the Prophet had said, that special care ought to be
taken by us, not to omit anything of what God commands. But they thus
misrepresent the meaning. We ought therefore to bear in mind what I have already
said, that these words are addressed to the Chaldeans, as though he had said,
&#8220;Spare not, but shed blood, and let no humanity move you, for it is the
work of God; God has armed you, that ye might fully execute his judgment and
spare no blood: ye shall then be accursed, except ye execute his
vengeance.&#8221; It is not indeed a common mode of speaking; but as to the
subject and the meaning there is no ambiguity. It is the same thing as though he
had said, &#8220;Go on courageously, and boldly execute God&#8217;s vengeance,
inasmuch as punishment has been denounced<i> </i>on<i> </i>them.&#8221; As when
soldiers idly delay, the leader when present not only exhorts them but also
urges them on with reproofs and threatenings, in order to rouse their alacrity;
so the Prophet here shews that God, as though present with the Chaldeans, would
chide their sloth, &#8220;Why do ye give over? cursed is every one who will not
shed blood, and who will not destroy them from the least to the
greatest.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the whole import of the passage is found in the
expression, that the destruction of that ungodly nation was <i>the work of
Jehovah</i>;<i> </i>as if he had said, &#8220;Though the Chaldeans shall lay
waste the land of Moab, and shall do this, not in order to obey<i> </i>God, but
from avarice and ambition, yet it will be the work of God; for God has hired the
Chaldeans for this end, that they might destroy the Moabites, though they may
think of no such thing.&#8221; It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here he expresses more clearly what we have before
seen, that Moab in vain promised to himself perpetual impunity, because he had
for a long time been prosperous. Then the Prophet says that he would be suddenly
destroyed, when God ascended his tribunal to execute his
judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He first says, that he had been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>quiet from his
childhood</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>because when the Israelites
had been often harassed, that nation remained untouched, and never felt any
disadvantage, as though fortified on all sides by their own defences; for they
dwelt in part amidst mountains, but had a level country, as it is well known,
beyond Jordan. It was a land in a moderate degree fertile, so that as they
enjoyed continual peace, they collected great wealth. But it was very hard for
the Israelites, when God afflicted them with various calamities, to see the
Moabites secure and safe from all trouble and all losses. As, then, this thought
might have grievously wounded the minds of the faithful, the Prophet here
exhorts them not to envy the happiness of the Moabites, because God would at
length stretch forth his hand against them, according to what was done by David,
who also exhorted the faithful patiently to wait for the day of the Lord, when
they saw the ungodly enjoying all kinds of pleasure, and meeting with success
according to their wishes.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;193701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
37:1, 7, 8.) We now then understand the object of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He compares Moab to an old man, who had passed his
whole life in security, without any losses, without any grief or sorrow.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Quiet</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>then, <i>has
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Moab</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

childhood</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>even from the time he became
a nation. For what was the childhood of Moab? even from the time they expelled
the giants and other inhabitants and dwelt in their land. Then success ever
attended them; and hence he says, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>settled on their
dregs,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>so that they underwent no change.
Here is another metaphor: as wine which remains in its own vessel, and is never
changed into another, retains its taste, its strength, and its savor; so also
the Prophet says that Moab had always been in the enjoyment of perpetual
felicity, like wine which remains on its own dregs. For the dregs preserve the
wine, as it is well known; for the wine, being taken off from its dregs, loses
in part its own strength, and at length becomes vapid; but wine, being not
changed, continues in its own strength.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see how apt is the comparison, when the
Prophet says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Moab had not
been changed from vessel to vessel, but had settled on his
dregs</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>And he explains himself without a
figure when he adds, that he had <i>not gone</i>,<i> </i>or removed, <i>into
captivity</i>.<i> </i>He yet intimates that this perpetual peace would avail the
Moabites nothing, because as the Lord had resolved to destroy them, he would
cause the strength of Moab to fail and all his wealth to be reduced to
nothing.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet said in the last lecture that the
Moabites, as long as they lived prosperously, were very hardened, as impunity
becomes an incentive to sin; for the ungodly, while God spares them, think that
they shall never be called to an account. He now adds, that the <i>days
</i>would <i>come</i>,<i> </i>in which God would suddenly execute vengeance on
them. But he pursues the comparison which he had used; for he had said, that the
Moabites were like wine which had not been poured from one vessel into another;
and hence they retained their own odor, that is, they were inebriated with their
own pleasures, because God had granted them peace and quietness for a long
time.</font><br></div>

to cast forth with violence, so as to break what is thus cast forth. As to the
real meaning there is not much difference: for we perceive what was God&#8217;s
purpose, that he would send to the Moabites enemies to drive them into exile,
and thus to deprive them of those pleasures in which they had so long indulged.
But this was not said for the sake of the Moabites, but that the Jews might
know, that though that land had been in a quiet state, yet it would not escape
the hand of God; for its long continued felicity could not render void that
decree of God of which the Prophet had spoken. It now follows &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">We may see more clearly from this verse, that the
Prophet does not so much address the Moabites as his own people; for he was not
a teacher to the Moabites to promote their safety; on the contrary, he intended
his doctrine for the benefit of the Jews, as in the present
instance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ashamed</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>

idol:</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for we have said that Chemosh was
the god of the Moabites, as every nation had its own peculiar god, even its own
invention. Now, the comparison made here shews that the Prophet wished to exhort
the people, to whom he was appointed a teacher, to repentance; for he set before
them the example of the ten tribes. And we know that at the time Jeremiah
announced this prophecy, the kingdom of Israel was destroyed. All the
Israelites, then, had been driven into exile except the tribe of Judah and the
half tribe of Benjamin. Now, the ten tribes, as it is well known, had, under
Jeroboam, departed from the pure worship of God, and had built for themselves an
altar in Bethel. Hence, then, the Prophet now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As
ashamed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> were </i>the Israelites of their
superstitions, which they had devised for themselves, so a similar vengeance of
God awaited the people of Moab; and thus he shews to the Jews what it is to
trust in the only true God. The Jews were not, indeed, involved in so gross a
superstition as to worship idols, at least publicly; but Ezekiel shews that they
also were contaminated with this kind of pollution, and that the very sanctuary
was defiled with idols; and at the same time the worship of God, according to
the Law, continued to be celebrated. But the Jews had nothing but the external
form: they had, indeed, the temple and the altar, they professed to worship the
true God, but in the meantime impiety and contempt of true religion prevailed
among them, and they had begun to involve themselves in many ungodly
superstitions, as we have before seen.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What, then, does Jeremiah now do? He sets before
their eyes the ten tribes whom God had destroyed, though the Israelites, as well
as the Jews, had descended from the same father, even Abraham. As, then, God had
inflicted so heavy a punishment on the kingdom of Israel, he now shews to the
Jews, that the punishment of the Moabites was not less probable; and why?
because they have, he says, their idol. God shews that this was a most atrocious
wickedness, by which the Moabites had provoked his anger; for there is nothing
less intolerable than for men to transfer the glory of God to their own
inventions, to statues, to logs of wood, to stones, or to idols of gold and
silver. We now, then, understand the object of the Prophet. It follows &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here reproves the pride of the Moabites,
because they trusted in their own strength, and derided God and what the
Prophets announced. We indeed know that ungodly men, when all things prosper
with them, are moved by no fear, divest themselves of every<i> </i>feeling, and
become so sunk in indifference, that they not only disdainfully disregard the
true God, but also what is connected with moral obligation. Such, then, was the
confidence which prevailed among the Moabites. Hence the Prophet here checks
this foolish boasting.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How say ye, We are strong, we are
warlike men</i></font><font face="Palatino">?<i> </i>as though he had said,
&#8220;These boastings, while God is seriously contending with you, are all
empty, and will avail you nothing: ye think yourselves beyond the reach of
danger, because ye possess great power, and are surrounded with strong defences;
but God will reduce to nothing whatever you regard as your protection.&#8221;
<i>Wasted</i>,<i> </i>then, <i>is Moab</i>.<i> </i>He sets up this threatening
in opposition to their arrogance. He indeed foretells what was to come, but
speaks of it as a thing already fulfilled. <i>Wasted</i>,<i> </i>he says, is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Moab, and the enemy has cut off
his cities</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hl[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ole</i>,<i> </i>is to be taken in a transitive sense; it is indeed a neuter
verb, but the other meaning is more suitable to this place, that the enemy would
cut off the cities of the Moabites. I yet allow that it may be explained
otherwise, that the inhabitants would ascend or depart from his cities; for,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hl[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ole</i>,<i> </i>metaphorically, indeed, signifies to ascend, and to flow off,
or to go away, as they say, in smoke; and if an anomaly as to number, common in
Hebrew, be approved, the sense will be, &#8220;and from his cities they have
vanished.&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH8</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And this explanation agrees well with
what follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and his young men
have descended to the slaughter</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>that
is, they who seem the strongest among them shall be drawn to destruction, or
shall descend to the slaughter. But as the event seemed difficult to be
believed, God is again introduced. Then the Prophet says, that he did not speak
from his own mind, but announced what God had committed to him. And he adds his
title, that the Jews might be more attentive to the consideration of God&#8217;s
power. God, he says, is he who speaks,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the King, whose name is Jehovah
of hosts</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He sets up God&#8217;s name in
opposition to the warlike preparations, of which the Moabites, as we have seen,
boasted; as though he had said, that if the Moabites had to do with mortals,
they might indeed have justly gloried; but as they had a contest with the living
God, all their power would vanish away, since God was prepared to execute
vengeance. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet expresses something more, that the
vengeance of which he spoke was near and hastening. It served to alleviate the
sorrow of the faithful, when they understood that the Moabites would shortly be
punished; for it was a grievous and bitter trial, when God severely chastened
his own children, to see that the wicked were in the meantime spared. As, then,
he deferred his judgments as to the wicked, that delay tended to drive the
faithful to despair, at least they could not bear with sufficient patience the
scourges of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the reason why the Prophet now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Near is the destruction
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of the Moabites,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and their calamity
hastens</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>And though God did for some
time yet bear with the Moabites, so that they remained in a quiet state, and
reveled in their pleasures, yet this prophecy was true; for we are to bear in
mind that truth, which ought ever to be remembered as to promises and
threatenings, that a thousand years are as one day with the Lord: and hence is
that exhortation given by the Prophet Habakkuk,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;If the prophecy delays, wait for
it; for coming it will come, and will not delay.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;350203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Habakkuk
2:3)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this mode of speaking occurs often in the
prophets. When, therefore, God denounces punishment on the wicked and the
despisers of his Law, he says, &#8220;Behold, your day hastens,&#8221; and he
says this, that they<i> </i>might be awakened and begin to fear in due
time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here, as I have reminded you, Jeremiah had a
regard to his own people. For the faithful might have objected, and said,
&#8220;What can this be? how long will God defer the punishment which he
threatens to our enemies?&#8221; Hence he says, &#8220;Strengthen your minds for
a little while, for God will presently stretch forth his hand and show that he
is a defender who cares for you and your safety; for he will set himself against
the Moabites, because they have been unfaithful and vexatious to you.&#8221; It
is, then, for this reason that he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Near is their
destruction</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their vengeance
hastens</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may hence learn this useful doctrine, that
whenever God promises anything, we ought to receive it as a present thing,
though yet hidden and even remote. There is no distance which ought to impede
our faith; but we ought to regard as certain whatever God promises, and as
though it were before our eyes and in our hand. And the same ought to be the
case as to threatenings; whenever God denounces anything hard and grievous, it
ought to touch and move us the same as though we saw his hand armed with a
sword, and as though the very execution of his vengeance was exhibited before
our eyes. For we know what the Scripture teaches us elsewhere,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;When the wicked shall say, Peace
and security, destruction comes suddenly on them, as the pain of childbearing,

sympathy; but we have stated for what purpose he did this; for it was not his
object to show that the Moabites deserved pity, so that their neighbors ought to
have condoled with them in their calamities: but by this figurative mode of
speaking he exaggerated the grievousness of the evils which were soon to happen
to the Moabites; as though he had said, &#8220;This judgment of God will be so
dreadful as to make all their neighbors to tremble; all who had previously known
the state of the people of Moab, will be smitten with such terror as will make
them to groan and mourn with them.&#8221; In short, the Prophet had nothing else
in view than to show that God&#8217;s vengeance on the Moabites would not be
less severe and dreadful than it had been on the ten tribes, and what it would
be on the tribe of Judah.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We have stated elsewhere why the prophets in
describing calamities spoke in so elevated a style; for their object was not to
seek fame or the praise of eloquence. They are not these rhetorical ornaments
which the prophets used; but they necessarily spoke in a lofty style of the
punishments which awaited the ungodly, because such was the hardness of their
hearts that they hesitated not to despise God&#8217;s threatenings, or to regard
them as fables. That God&#8217;s threatenings then might penetrate into the
hearts of men, it was necessary to exaggerate them by means of various
comparisons, as it is done here and in many places. We ought at the same time to
bear in mind what I have said, that the Prophet had a regard to his own people.
As the Moabites were like a hid treasure, the Jews could never have thought it
possible, that the Chaldeans would at length make an inroad there; but the
Prophet declares that the thing was so certain, as though it was seen by their
own eyes. In order then to lead the Jews<i> </i>to the very scene itself, the
judgments of God are here not only described, but as it were
painted.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who fleeth and her who
escapes</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He, indeed, changes the gender
of the nouns; but when he mentions many, and then one person, he did this for
the sake of amplifying; because, on the one hand, he wished to show that so
great would be the number of exiles, that the whole land would become empty; and
then, on the other hand, when he says that this and that person would flee, he
means that they would be so scattered that they would not go in troops; but as
it is usual in a disordered state of things, one would flee on this side, and
another on the other side. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ask
him who fleeth</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or as we may render the

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ask her who
escapes</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>because not only men, but also
women would flee, so that no sex would be spared. In short, he intimates, that
those who dwelt in cities well fortified, would be all anxiety on seeing enemies
irresistibly advancing through every part of the country.</font><br></div>

not his purpose to show that they deserved pity who had been the most cruel
enemies to God&#8217;s Church, but to show that God&#8217;s vengeance would be
so dreadful as to call forth cryings and howlings through the whole
neighborhood. And then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Declare it in
Aroer;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and afterwards he names many
cities; as though he had said, that no corner of the land would be free from
fear and anxiety, because the enemies, after having made an inroad into one
part, would turn to another, so as to make no end of ravaging, until they had
destroyed the whole country and all the people. Of these cities and of their
situation there is no need of saying much, for it would be a useless labor. For
in the last place, the Prophet sufficiently shews that what he had in view was
what I have stated; for he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on all the cities of Moab, remote
as well as near</i></font><font face="Palatino">:<i> </i>he intimates that no
part of the land would be exempted from destruction; for the enemies having
begun to attack it, would not cease until they had gone through every part, and
desolation had spread everywhere, as though the whole country had been burnt
with fire. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">By another metaphor he expresses the same thing. By
<i>horn </i>he means power, as all who are in any measure acquainted with
Scripture well know that by this word is set forth power, strength, or any
defense for the protection of a nation. He then says that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>horn of Moab was cut

we understand what the Prophet meant when he said, that the horn of Moab was cut
off. But he again introduces God as the speaker, because the Moabites thought
that their horn could not be broken. As then Jeremiah would not have obtained
credit, had he spoken in his own name, he again brought forward God as declaring

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now addresses the Chaldeans, who were to

been chosen to be his servants. And the address had more force in it when the
Prophet showed that such a command was committed to him, as we have seen
elsewhere; for the Prophets showed how efficacious was their doctrine, when they
besieged and stormed cities, when they gave orders to armies. This then is the
course which Jeremiah now follows, when as God&#8217;s herald he summons the
Chaldeans, and commands them vigorously to perform what God approved and what he
had decreed, even to <i>inebriate </i>the Moabites with evils. The rest

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-FIRST</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We began yesterday to explain why the Prophet,
denouncing on the Moabites the punishment they had deserved, directed his speech
to the Chaldeans, even that his prophecy might have greater force and produce
greater effect. The metaphor of drunkenness which he uses, is common; for when
Scripture intimates that any are made miserable, as they say, to satiety, or
more than what can be well borne, it compares them to those who are made drunk.
For as a drunken man loses his senses, so they who are overwhelmed with
miseries, are almost stunned with evils, so that they become deprived of reason
and judgment. This then is the drunkenness which the Prophet now mentions. And
following up the same idea, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moab is rolled in his own
vomit</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Some by vomit understand
intemperate joy, and render the words in the past tense, &#8220;And<i> </i>Moab
shouted in his own vomit,&#8221; that is, he luxuriated in his own abundance,
and when he gorged himself with wine and with all kinds of luxuries, he loudly
exulted; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and therefore he shall
be also a reproach</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This contrast is not
unsuitable, that Moab immediately exulted when in prosperity, and that therefore
God would shortly punish him, so as to make him a reproach or a
derision.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But I follow what has been generally approved, that
Moab shall be rolled, or shall clap hands even in his own vomit: so that by
vomit the Prophet means excessive grief. For the drunkard delights in drinking,
but afterwards by vomiting he suffers the punishment of his intemperance, when
his head, his stomach, his legs and other members shake and tremble. So also, it
is no unsuitable comparison, when the Prophet calls sorrow, arising from
calamity, vomiting. He then says, that when
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Moab shall clap his
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or roll
himself</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fH12</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(for the word is variously rendered) in his own miseries, he shall be even a
<i>derision</i>.<i> </i>Why he says, that he would be a derision, we may learn
from the next verse, for he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Has not Israel been a derision to
thee?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the higher cause for the drunkenness mentioned
here ought to be observed, even because Moab exalted himself against God. For
after having spoken of the pride through which he exulted over God, he adds an
explanation,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> Has not Israel been
a derision to thee?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>See then how the
Moabites acted proudly towards God, even because they treated his Church
reproachfully. And this ought especially to be noticed; for God intimates by
these words, that he is so connected with the faithful as to regard their cause
as his own, as it is said elsewhere,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He that toucheth you, toucheth
the apple of my eye.&#8221;<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;380208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Zechariah
2:8)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God then so takes the faithful under his own
protection, that whatever injury is done to them, he counts it as done to him.
This connection is well expressed by the Prophet, when he says, &#8220;The
Moabites have raised themselves against God;&#8221; and at the same time he
shews the way and manner, even because they exulted over the Israelites. Were
any one to object and say, that the Moabites injured mortal men only and not
God; the answer has already been given, even that God has so adopted his Church
as to identify himself with it. Let us then know, that God, when he sees us
suffering anything unjustly, regards the wrong as done to himself. As then the
people of Israel had been a derision to the Moabites, the Prophet threatens them
with a similar punishment for their pride.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Has he been found among thieves?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">It is, indeed, certain, that the people of
Israel deserved very severe scourges, and that when they were subjected to so
many adversities, a just reward was rendered to them for their iniquities. With
regard to God this is certain; but with regard to the Moabites, the people of
Israel were innocent; for these ungodly men could not object anything to the
Israelites, for they were altogether like them, or even worse. God then compares
here his chosen people with aliens, and says that the Israelites were not
thieves. Under one thing he comprehends everything, as though he had said,
&#8220;Of what wickedness have the Israelites been guilty, that you have thus
become so enraged against them?&#8221; We hence see what the words of the
Prophet mean, even that the Moabites were impelled by nothing but cruelty and
pride, when they so basely raged against the Israelites, and so disdainfully
oppressed them; for as I have already said, there was no cause why the Moabites
should have been so hostile to the miserable people. Thus their crime was
doubled, for they acted proudly towards God&#8217;s people,<i> </i>and they
acted thus without a cause; for with regard to them, God&#8217;s people were
innocent.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>were
moved</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or excited
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whenever they spoke of the
Israelites</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he intimates that they were
carried away by malevolence, so as to wish all kinds of evil to the miserable,
and then, as far as they could, to lay snares for them. As then they thus raged
furiously against the Israelites, the Prophet includes everything of this kind
in the word &#8220;moved,&#8221;<i> </i>or raised an
uproar.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fH13</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet intimates by anticipation, that how
much soever the Moabites might boast, they could not, by their boastings and
their pride, so succeed that God should not appear against them as a Judge. We
have said already, that as the Moabites had been long in a quiet state, what the
Prophet denounced on them, appeared at the first hearing as incredible. It is
then by way of anticipation that he says, that the Moabites were
<i>proud</i>,<i> </i>did swell with <i>haughtiness</i>,<i> </i>and breathed much
<i>arrogance</i>,<i> </i>that, in short, they manifested high and lofty spirits.
When the Prophet says all this, and adds, that nothing would avail them, we see
that he meets those doubts which might have possessed weak minds, so as to
prevent them to believe his prophecy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And when he uses the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have
heard</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he not only means by report, but
that the Moabites loudly boasted, as it is usual with proud men; for they made,
so to speak, a bellowing, and sought, even by their tongues alone, to strike
others with terror. As then they proclaimed their wealth and their power, they
sought in a manner to shake the very air, so that all might tremble at their
voice alone. This seems to have been expressed by the Prophet, when he said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have
heard</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>In short, Jeremiah does not mean
that the report of the pride of Moab had spread abroad, as rumors often fly
respecting the haughtiness and boastings of men; but he intimates that the
Moabites were heralds of their own power, so that they spoke in lofty terms of
their own greatness, and thus their own tongues testified of their haughtiness

near to the rendering which I have given. But I will not here discuss other
interpretations, or try at large to disprove-them, but it is sufficient for us
to understand the real meaning of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the first place, God is here introduced as saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I know his
insolence</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The pronoun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yna</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ani</i>,<i> </i>is emphatical, for in the last verse the Prophet had said,
that the boastings of Moab were a terror, as they spoke loudly of their own
strength and defences. As then they thus with open mouths sounded forth their
own praises, they filled all their neighbors with terror; hence the Prophet
said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have heard the pride of
Moab</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Now God also on his part gives
this answer, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
know</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his
insolence;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as though he had said,
&#8220;The Moabites do not thus boast, but that I am a witness; all these things
ascend to my tribunal.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds, still in the person of God,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not rectitude are his
lies</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>By the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wtrb[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>obertu</i>,<i> </i>which some render, &#8220;his<i> </i>indignation,&#8221;
the Prophet means, I think, insolence. It signifies properly excess, as it comes
from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rb[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ober</i>,<i> </i>to pass over. The noun is indeed often taken to express
indignation, because anger keeps within no limits, but is, as Horace says, a
momentary madness.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH15</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But on account of what the passage seems
to require, I render it insolence, and it is the most suitable word. And God
having declared that the insolence of Moab was seen by him, mentions also his
<i>lies</i>.<i> </i>The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ydb</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>means branches of trees, and sometimes sons or children, they being members
of the community; and hence some render it &#8220;sons&#8221; here, as though
the Prophet had said, that after the Moabites had been cut off, there would be
none remaining to continue their name in the world. As then there was to be no
posterity to the Moabites, they think that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ydb</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>badim </i>here means sons or children. But this view cannot be admitted,
because we shall hereafter see that there was to be some residue to the
Moabites. We cannot then take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ydb</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>badim</i>,<i> </i>but as referring to their vain boastings, for they were
nothing but lies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must consider what Jeremiah says; the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;k</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ken</i>,<i> </i>means right; and I take the two words as being in apposition,
&#8220;His<i> </i>lies are not right;&#8221;<i> </i>that is, there is no
stability in his lies. For when an apposition is explained, one of the words is
turned to an adjective, or a preposition is inserted: <i>Not</i> <i>right
</i>then <i>are his lies</i>;<i> </i>that is, in his lies there is no rectitude,
or in his lies there is no stability. But the rectitude of which the Prophet now
speaks, refers not to justice or equity, but to stability; and that it has this
meaning may be gathered from other places. Then he says, that the boastings
which the Moabites indulged in were vain, because God would not establish what
they thought, or as they commonly say, what they presumed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And then he adds the reason; the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;k</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ken</i>,<i> </i>is to be taken here adverbially; it is an adverb of likeness,
&#8220;so,&#8221;<i> </i>or thus, <i>they shall not so do</i>;<i> </i>that is,
as they had conceived in their minds. It is a confirmation of the last clause;
for why was there to be no stability in their lies? because God would break down
the Moabites, so that their counsels would be vain, without any effect. We now
then perceive the meaning of the words.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From Zoar to
Horonaim</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>We must bear in mind the
situations of these cities; but we may<i> </i>suppose that the Prophet chose
those cities which were opposite to each other. Then from one corner to the
other continual crying would be heard, because there would be everywhere
desolation and ruin. And then he comes to another part, from one city even to
another there would be a similar cry. In short, he shews that no part in the
whole land of Moab would be in a quiet state and free from miseries. This is the
meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he compares the whole land of Moab, or the city
Horonaim, to an heifer three years old, on account of its lasciviousness. Some
restrict the comparison to the city Horonaim, for they read the words in
apposition, &#8220;to Heronaim, an heifer three years old,&#8221; putting the
last words in the accusative case: but others read them apart, &#8220;an heifer
three years old&#8221; is Moab. And I prefer this construction, because he
afterwards adds another city, even Nimrim. As, however, it is a matter of no
great moment, I will not contend with any one who may take the other view.
Whether then it be one city or the whole country, it is compared to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an heifer three years
old</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>because that nation had long
luxuriated in its own pleasures. Now, an heifer three years old, as it is well
known, frisks and leaps, because it knows not what it is to fear the yoke; and
then it is not worn out, as the case is with cows, who are weakened by having
often brought forth young; and further, the milk that is taken from them
exhausts their strength. But all heifer three years old is in her rigor and
prime. In short, the Prophet intimates that the Moabites lived well, and as it
were unrestrained, for they had long exulted in their abundance; and as they had
plenty of wine and bread, they gave themselves up to
luxury.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fH19</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Surely even the waters of Nimrim
shall be a desolation</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Some think Nimrim
to have been a city, and it is elsewhere called Nimra. Its waters are also
mentioned by Isaiah, as the brooks of the willows. We may hence conclude that
these waters were perpetual and flowed continually. But the Prophet speaks
metaphorically as before, for the meaning is, that nothing would be so safe in
the land of Moab as not to be destroyed, that nothing would be so fruitful as
not to be dried up. Then by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
waters of Nimrim </i></font><font face="Palatino">he means the abundance which
was in the whole country. For the Chaldeans did not dry up that river or those
lakes, for it is certainly unknown whether there was a river there or a lake.
But it is probable that there was there abundance of waters, which were not
dried up by the coming of an hostile army; but, as I have said, he shews by
these figurative expressions that the whole land of Moab would be laid waste. It

<div><font face="Palatino">In this verse the Prophet expresses what he had
before referred to, that God would become in such a way the avenger of the pride

descended from a pious father, for they were the posterity of Lot; but they had
renounced the worship of the only true God, and had defiled themselves with the
pollutions of heathens. Justly then does God declare that he would be the
avenger of idolatry, while executing punishment on the pride and cruelty of the

shews that idolatry and all profanation of divine worship, cannot finally escape

if he spared not the Moabites, to whom the law had not, been given, and who had
been corrupted through many long years, how shall they now escape unpunished, to
whom God&#8217;s Word is daily propounded, and in whose ears it sounds? Let, us
then remember that superstitions cannot be endured, for God will at length
vindicate his own glory with regard to these abominations; for every

Moabites would be scattered, as though it were, as they say, a thing forsaken.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet describes at large a very great mourning.
They were wont in great sorrow to pull off their hair, to shave their beard, and
to put on sackcloth, or to gird it round their loins, and also to cut their
hands with a knife or with their nails. As these things were signs of grief;
Jeremiah puts them all together, in order to show that the calamity of Moab
would not be common, but what would cause to the whole people extreme
lamentation. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall make
bald</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their heads, their beard they
shall pull off</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or shave; for the word,
to diminish, may signify either. Then he adds, the <i>incisions in the
hands</i>;<i> </i>they shall tear their faces and their hands with their nails,
or as some say, with a knife or a razor. As to sackcloth, it was also a sign of
mourning. It is indeed certain that it was formerly the practice for men, as
though it was innate in human nature, in great calamities to spread ashes on the
head and to put on sackloth. But he has added other excesses which are not very
congenial to nature, for it is not agreeable to humanity to pull off the beard,
to make bald the head, or to tear the hands and the face with the nails. These
things show excesses, suitable neither to men nor to women, &#8212; not to women
on the ground of modesty, nor to men on the ground of manliness and strength of
mind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But mankind never control themselves, and whether
they mourn or rejoice, they are ever led away to excesses, observing no
moderation. There was also another evil connected with sackcloth and ashes; for
when it was God&#8217;s design to lead men by these symbols to humble
themselves, to consider their sins and to flee to his mercy, they were diverted
to another end, even that he who mourned might appear miserable to others, and
make a display of his weeping and tears. In short, besides excess, there was
also this common evil, even hypocrisy. For men ever turn aside to what is vain,
and dissemble in all things. But in this place there is no reason to dispute
about mourning, for the Prophet means only that the Moabites would become most
miserable, exhibiting all the symptoms of sorrow. It follows &#8212;

what is added, that the calamity would come from God; for it would not have been
sufficient to foretell adversity, except this was added, that God ascended his

<div><font face="Palatino">I have already reminded you, that the Prophet is not
using too many words in this extended discourse, for it was necessary to confirm
at large what all would have otherwise rejected. He then says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the cities of Moab were
taken,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>strongholds were
seized</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He mentions these things
expressly, because the country of Moab thought that it was defended by cities
and strongholds; and they thus thought, &#8220;Should<i> </i>the Chaldeans come
and make an irruption, there are many cities who will oppose them; they will
then have to spend much time in overcoming these obstacles. It may then so
happen, that being broken down with fatigue they will return to their own
country, and we shall recover what we may have lost.&#8221; With this confidence
then the Moabites deceived themselves, when they looked on their well fortified
cities and strongholds. For this reason the Prophet now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Taken are the cities, and seized
on are the
strongholds</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH23</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There was another thing of which the Moabites
boasted, that they possessed military valor; and yet they had not of late made a
trial of their strength, as they had been indulging themselves in sloth and
pleasures. But as they had formerly performed deeds worthy of being remembered,
they despised, as I have said, their enemies, arrogating to themselves the
credit of great valor. The Prophet, on the other hand, declares that their
courage would vanish away: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he
says</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, of the men of Moab shall
become effeminate in that day</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>softer
than the heart of a woman, when oppressed with evils. It might have appeared a
complete comparison, when he said that the men of Moab would be soft and
effeminate; but he wished to express something more, and hence he added, that
they would become softer than women when in great trouble. And by these words he
intimates, that it is in God&#8217;s power to melt the hearts of men, and to
break down their fierceness, so that they who were like lions are made like
does. And this ought to be carefully noticed; because courage is not only a
special gift, but it is also necessary that God should daily and constantly
strengthen those whom he has once made brave; otherwise they who are courageous
above others will soon lose their valor. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

calamity of Moab would be a just reward for his pride and indeed his sacrilege.
The Prophet then says that though God&#8217;s vengeance might seem extremely
grievous, yet it was most just, because the Moabites had not only been cruel
against their neighbors, but also reproachful against God. Here, then, he
condemns them first for cruelty, and then for their impious pride,

contumelious against God himself, who had promised to be the protector and the
Father of his people. As then the Moabites thus despised the protection and
promise of God, they are here justly condemned by the Prophet, that they

God</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>And this ought to be carefully
noticed, so that we may not do any wrong to the godly, for God will at length
show that he is injured in their persons. And then also no common consolation
may be hence derived, that all who molest us are carrying on war against God,
and that all who injure us act sacrilegiously towards him. For the Prophet has
before explained how the Moabites gloried against God, even because they
regarded the children of Israel with derision. It follows, &#8212;

Moabites should adopt many means of escape, yet they should be taken, for
God&#8217;s hand would everywhere entrap them. He mentions <i>terror </i>first,
then the <i>pit</i>,<i> </i>and thirdly, the
<i>snare</i>,</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH24</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, &#8220;Thou wilt be so
frightened that terror will compel thee to flee; but when thou fleest, pits will
be in the way into which thou wilt fall: but if thou wilt rise from the pit,
snares will surround thee, and thou wilt be taken.&#8221; We then see that by
these similitudes nothing else is meant but God&#8217;s judgment, which impended
over the Moabites, so that it could by no means be averted by them; for no ways
could be found out by which they could escape, because fear would force them to
flee, and would, as it is usually the case, deprive them of mind and thought,
and thus they would be driven here and there, and could not move from any place
without meeting with a pit, and, as it has been said, after the pit there would
be the snare.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now all this has not been expressed without reason,
because we know with how many flatteries men are wont to delude themselves when
God summons them to judgment; for they immediately look around here and there,
and promise themselves impunity, and then they hope for light punishment, as
though they were at peace with God. But the unbelieving harden themselves, as
Isaiah says, as though they had made a covenant with death and a compact with
hell.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;232815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
28:15.) As, then, the wicked set up security in opposition to God, the Prophet
here shews that there are many ways in his hand, by which he can take the
fugitives, and those who seem to think that they can escape through their own
astuteness; and hence he said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He
who flees from terror</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>that is, from
present danger, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall fall into

shall now think themselves secure, they shall meet with new dangers, and new
deaths will surround them.</font><br></div>

verse, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because I will bring on
Moab the year of their visitation</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Here
God sustains the minds of the godly, that they might not faint on account of
long delay. As, then, the faithful might have been worn out with weariness while
God prolonged the time as to the Moabites, the Prophet says, &#8220;Come<i>
</i>at length shall the year of their visitation.&#8221; For as it has been
stated elsewhere, by this mode of speaking God intimates that though he for a
time passes by things and connives at them, he will at length show himself to be
the judge of the world. We would have God ever to act in haste; and hence, when
he exhorts us to patience, all our feelings rebel. This happens, because we do
not consider that the fitness of times is determined by his will. Hence he
speaks now of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the year of
visitation</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>as though he had said,
&#8220;I may for a time appear to disregard human affairs and to neglect my own,
while my people are cruelly oppressed by the wicked; but the time of visitation
will come.&#8221;<i> </i>For by this word &#8220;visitation,&#8221;<i> </i>God
means that there are changes, or, as they commonly say, revolutions, which are
fixed and certain. We<i> </i>now then understand the design of God, when he
says, that he would bring a visitation on the Moabites. It follows, &#8212;

Prophet, I doubt not, borrowed these words from Moses, for he says in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;042128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
21:28, that a fire had gone forth from Heshbon; and there the expression is
given as an old proverb. There is no doubt but that enemies had triumphed over
that city when it was taken; for that whole song spoken by Moses is ironical,
and in saying that fire had gone forth, he referred to their counsels, for they
thought that city sufficiently strong against enemies. Now the Prophet says,
that what had been formerly said of Heshbon would be again fulfilled, that it
would be, as it were, the beginning of the fire. The meaning then, as I think,
is, that the Moabites indeed thought, that they would have a quiet and agreeable
shadow under the protection of the city Heshbon, and of the city Sihon; but what
was to be? even that these two cities would become, as it were, the beginnings
of the fire. How, or in what way? even because the probability is, that there
those counsels were taken which provoked the Chaldeans. We indeed know that
riches and power always produce haughtiness and false confidence in men; for in
villages and small towns wars are not contrived; but the great cities gather the
wood and kindle the fire; and the fire afterwards spreads and pervades the whole
land.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fH26</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This, then, is what our Prophet means, when he says,
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fire went forth from
Heshbon</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>even contrary to the
expectation of the people, for they thought that were all things to go to ruin,
there yet would be safety for them in that city:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>go
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall fire

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rqrq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kadkad</i>,<i> </i>he means all parts. Extremity is elsewhere taken for a
part; but he does not mean that fire would come<i> </i>to all parts or extreme
corners, only as it were to touch them slightly: but he intimates that the whole
land would be consumed by this fire; it would thus spread itself to its very
extremities.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fH27</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as I have already said, the Prophet alludes to
that old saying mentioned by Moses,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;042127&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
21:27, 28.) Further, there is no doubt but that Heshbon and Sihon were then in
the possession of that nation; for they had taken away many cities from the
Israelites, and thus the children of Israel had been reduced to narrower limits.
At length the tribe of Judah alone remained after the overthrow of the kingdom
of Israel. When they were driven into Chaldea, it was an easy thing for the
Moabites to make that their own which belonged to no one. Besides, as they had
helped the Chaldeans and betrayed that miserable people, and had thus acted
perfidiously towards their brethren, a reward was given to them. But when at
length they themselves dreaded the power of the Babylonian monarchy, they began
to change their minds, and endeavored to obstruct the farther progress of the
Chaldeans. Hence then a war was contemplated, and the occasion was given. He
then speaks of Heshbon and Sihon as chief cities; and there is no doubt but that
Sihon derived its name from a king who ruled there. For we know that there was a
king bearing this name; but as he speaks here of a place, it is probable, that
the king&#8217;s name was given to the city in order to commemorate
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at length adds, that this

he calls the Moabites tumultuous, because they before made a great noise, and
were dreaded by their neighbors. As then all their neighbors had been
frightened, in a manner, by their voice alone, he calls them sons of tumult, or
tumultuous men, from the effect produced. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet, as he comes to the end of his
prophecy, suddenly exclaims, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woe
to thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">!<i> </i>as though he had said, that
words failed him to express the grievousness of God&#8217;s vengeance. There is
then more force in this single expression, than if he had at large described the
miseries of that nation. He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The people of Chemosh have
perished</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The Prophet again intimates,
that the Moabites vainly confided in their idol, Chemosh; they thought that
there would be a sure safety to them from their god, who was, as they commonly
say, a tutelar god. But the Prophet says, that their superstition would avail
them nothing, for they and their idol would perish together. He exults over this
fictitious god, that on the other hand he might extol the power of the only true
God. For there is here an implied contrast between the God of Israel and Chemosh
whom the Moabites worshipped.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy sons and thy daughters shall

Prophet does not seem here to continue the same subject; for he had said before
that ruin or destruction was coming on the Moabites, but he now mitigates that
punishment, and speaks only of exile. But as captivity is like death, as it
abolishes the name of a nation, he speaks correctly and suitably. And then we
must observe, that God, for a time, so executed his vengeance on the Moabites,
that he left them some hope as to the future, according to what follows in the

<div><font face="Palatino">Here, as we see, God gives place to his mercy, so
that the Moabites should not wholly perish. At the same time, things which seem
to be contrary agree together, even that destruction was nigh the people of
Moab, and yet that some would remain alive, who would afterwards renew the name
of the nation, as it was God&#8217;s purpose to restore the Moabites to their
former state. These things, as I have said, seem inconsistent, and yet they may
be easily reconciled; for it was God&#8217;s will so to destroy the Moabites,
that those who died might not be without hope; and then, those who remained
alive were not deemed to be among the living, but in exile they were like the
dead. God, indeed, ever supported the godly with hope, even when they were
driven into Babylon: but as to the Moabites, the living as well as the dead, had
no hope. Why, then, was this promise given? not for the sake of the Moabites;
but that the Jews might feel assured that God would at length be propitious to
them; he promises pardon to the Moabites as it were accidentally, so to speak,
and thus unavowedly stretches forth his hand to them, but with a design through
this mercy to give to the Israelites a taste of his paternal favor. What remains

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-THIRD</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We began in our last lecture to explain what the
Prophet has said of the restoration of Moab; and we said that some hope of mercy
to the unworthy is left here. For though they had in various ways provoked the
wrath of God, yet he was unwilling wholly to destroy them; and from that nation
also Christ, the Redeemer of the world, derived his origin. Here, then, we have
a memorable instance of God&#8217;s favor, that he did not wholly obliterate
that nation, which yet had deserved extreme punishment. We said further, that it
was, as it were, accidental that the Prophet promised favor to the Moabites; for
we know that the people of Israel were then a people distinct from other
nations. God then so disposed of his favor, that when a few drops came to
heathens, it was, as it were, adventitious. For it was not his will to cast
indiscriminately to all the bread which he had designed for his own children, as
Christ also says, that it is not right that the children&#8217;s bread should be
given to dogs.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401526&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
15:26.) God, however, designed to show some preludes of his mercy towards alien
nations, when he so directed the promises of salvation to his chosen people as
not wholly to exclude the heathens, as we have an example here in the Moabites.
We shall hereafter see the same as to the Ammonites. Now follows &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">We have said that the Ammonites were not only
contiguous to the Moabites, but had also derived their origin from Lot, and were
thus connected with them by blood. Their origin was indeed base and shameful,
for they were, as it is well known, the offspring of incest. There was, however,
the bond of fraternity between them, because both nations had the same father.
God had spared them when he brought up his people from Egypt; for in remembrance
of the holy man Lot, he would have both peoples to remain uninjured. But
ingratitude doubled their crime, for these impious men ceased not in various
ways to harass the children of Abraham.: For this reason, therefore, does
Jeremiah now prophesy against them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And we see here, again, the object of this prophecy
and the design of the Holy Spirit in announcing it, even that the Israelites
might know that they were not so completely cast away by God, but that there
remained some remnants of his paternal favor; for if the Moabites and the
Ammonites had been free from all evils, it would have been a most grievous
trial; it would have been enough to overwhelm weak minds to see a people whom
God had adopted, miserably oppressed and severely chastised, while heathen
nations were remaining quiet in the enjoyment of their pleasures, and exulting
also over the calamities of others. God, then, in order to mitigate the grief
and sorrow which the children of Israel derived from their troubles and
calamities, shews that he would yet show them favor, because he would carry on
war against their enemies, and become<i> </i>the avenger of all the wrongs which
they had suffered. It was no common consolation for the Israelites to hear that
they were still the objects of God&#8217;s care, who, nevertheless, seemed in
various ways to have poured forth his wrath upon them in a full stream. We now,
then, see the reason why Jeremiah<i> </i>denounced destruction on the Ammonites,
as he did before on the Moabites.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the children of

</i></font><font face="Palatino">It was a trial very grievous to the miserable
Israelites to see a part of the inheritance promised them by God forcibly taken
from them by the Ammonites; for what must have come to their minds but that they
had been deceived by vain promises? But it had happened, that the Ammonites had
deprived the children of Israel of a part of their inheritance. Hence the
Prophet teaches us here, that though God connived for a time, and passed by this
robbery, he yet would not suffer the Ammonites to go unpunished for having taken
to themselves what justly belonged to others. Hence it is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why doth their king inherit
Gad</i></font><font face="Palatino">?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I know not why <i>Jerome </i>rendered

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>inherits
Gad</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Gad is not the name of a place, as
some think, but Mount Gilead, which had been given to that tribe. The Prophet
says that they possessed the country of the Gadites; for they had been ejected
from their portion, and the children of Ammon had occupied what had been given
by God to them. And this is confirmed by the Prophet Amos, when he
says,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;For<i> </i>three of the
transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not be propitious
to them, because they have cut off the mountain of
Gilead.&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

1:13)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He speaks there metaphorically, because God had fixed
the limits between the tribe of Gad and the children of Ammon, so that both
might be satisfied with their own inheritance. But the children of Ammon had
broken through and expelled the tribe of Gad from the cities of Mount Gilead.
This, then, is what now our Prophet means, even that they had taken to
themselves that part of the land which had been allotted to the children of Gad;
for it immediately follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and
his people dwell in his cities</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>even in
the cities which had been given by lot to that tribe; for we know that a
possession beyond Jordan had been given to the children of Gad. We now, then,
perceive the meaning of the words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God, then, shews that he had not forgotten his
covenant, though he had for a time suffered the Ammonites to invade the
inheritance which he had conferred on the children of Israel; yet the Gaddites
would at length recover what had been unjustly taken from them. For it was a
robbery not to be endured, that the Ammonites should have dared to take to
themselves that land, which was not the property of men, but rather of God
himself, for he had called it his rest, because he would have his people to
dwell there. And though God inflicted a just punishment on the Gaddites when he
expelled them from their inheritance, yet he afterwards punished the children of
Ammon, as he is wont to chastise his own children by the hand of the wicked, and
at length to render them also their just reward. It now follows &#8212;

minds of his children: for the Prophet announced his prediction at a time when
the Ammonites were in a state of security; and then, some years elapsed while
that people enjoyed their spoils. He therefore holds here the minds of the
faithful in suspense, that they might learn patiently to wait until the fixed
time of God&#8217;s vengeance came. For this reason, then, he says, that the
<i>days </i>would <i>come </i>when God would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cause the trumpet of war to

thing extraordinary, for the Ammonites thought, as we shall see, that they
should never be in any danger. As, then, they proudly trusted in their own
strength, the Prophet speaks here of the trumpet of war in Rabbah, which was the
metropolis of the whole land. Some think that it was Philadelphia, a name given
to it by Ptolemy. Interpreters, however, do not agree; but the opinion mostly
received is, that it was Philadelphia. Now, as to the main thing, there is no
doubt but that it was then the chief seat of government, and the capital of the
kingdom, because the Prophet, stating a part for the whole, includes the whole
land when he speaks of this city.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that she would become

incredible, because<i> </i>Rabbah was so fortified that no one thought that it
could be destroyed. But the Prophet now declares that the whole city would be
demolished, so that neither walls nor private houses would remain, but that it
would be a deformed mass of ruins. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>her daughters shall be burned

understands towns and villages; and hence is confirmed what I have said, that
Rabbah was then the chief city of the whole land of Ammon. At the end of the

confirms what I have slightly referred to, that the calamity of the Ammonites
would be a testimony as to God&#8217;s paternal kindness towards his chosen
people, because he resolved to avenge the wrongs done to them. As, then, God
undertook the cause of the Israelites as his own, he sufficiently manifested the
favor he had intended for his people, and for no other reason, but because he
had gratuitously chosen them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may be asked, when was this prophecy fulfilled?
God, indeed, under David, gave some indication of their future subjection, but
Israel never possessed that land. Indeed, from that time Ammon had not been
brought low until after the overthrow of Israel. It then follows that what
Jeremiah predicted here, was not fully accomplished except under the kingdom of
Christ. David humbled that nation, because he had received a great indignity
from the king of Ammon; and he took also Rabbah, as it is evident front sacred
history.

verse is not superfluous; for the Prophet introduces God as the speaker, because
he speaks of great things, and of which it was difficult to be fully convinced.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now triumphs, as it were, over the land
of Ammon, and, according to his accustomed manner, as we have before seen; for
had the prophets spoken without metaphors, and simply narrated the things
treated of by them, their words would have been frigid and inefficient, and
would not have penetrated into the hearts of men. This, then, is the reason why
the prophets adopted an elevated style, and adorned with grandeur their
prophecies; for they never, like rhetoricians, affected eloquence, but necessity
so urged them, that they represented to the eyes those things which they could
not otherwise form a conception of in their minds. On this subject we have
spoken often already; but I am again constrained briefly to touch on it, because
those who are not well acquainted with Scripture, and do not understand the
design of the Holy Spirit, may think that words only are here poured forth. But
when we duly weigh what I have said, then we shall readily acknowledge that the
Prophet did not, without reason, enlarge on what he had previously
said.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Howl, thou
Heshbon</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for Ai is laid
waste</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>These were two neighboring
cities: hence he exhorts Heshbon to howl on seeing the overthrow of another
city. He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cry</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>or cry aloud, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye daughters of

before touched upon as to the city Rabbah.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Gird
yourselves</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with
sackcloth</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or put on sackcloth. He does not
here exhort the citizens of Rabbah to repentance, but he speaks according to the
customs of the people, as it has been stated elsewhere. Sackcloth was, indeed, a
symbol of penitence; when the miserable wished humbly to flee to God&#8217;s
mercy, and to confess their sins, they put on sackcloth. But the unbelieving
imitated the faithful without discretion or judgment. Hence it was, that they
scattered<i> </i>ashes on their heads, that without any reason they put on
sackcloth. What was then commonly done is now mentioned by Jeremiah;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Put on
sackcloth</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lament and run here and there by
the fences</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds in the third person,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for gone is their king into
captivity.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He expressed this, that the
Israelites might know, that though that kingdom flourished for a time, yet the
day of which the Prophet had spoken would come, when the condition of the
Ammonites would be nothing better than that of the Israelites; whose king, as it
was known, had been driven into exile, together with the priests and princes.
The Prophet now denounces the same punishment on the Ammonites, that not only
their king would be driven into another land, as a captive, but also their
princes and their priests. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">As the minds of men continually vacillate, because
they do not sufficiently consider the infinite power of God, the Prophet, that
he might remove all obstacles which might have rendered his prophecy doubtful,
now declares<i> </i>that the Ammonites gloried in vain in their valleys. Some
understand by valleys a fertile land, well watered. But the Prophet, as I think,
refers rather to fortified places. He then says, that they in vain
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gloried in their deep
valleys</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>as they were surrounded with
mountains, so they thought that they could not be approached. He derides this
vain confidence, <i>Why</i>,<i> </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dost thou glory in thy
valleys</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or, profundities?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Flown down has thy
valley.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By saying, that the
<i>valley</i>,<i> </i>or depth, had flown down, he alludes to its situation: for
when any one considers a region situated among mountains, the land appears as
flowing, like a river gliding between its banks. It is then a striking allusion
to a deep place, when he says that the <i>valley flowed
down</i>.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was the same as though he had
said, &#8220;Thy depth has vanished,&#8221; or, &#8220;It<i> </i>shall not be to
thee such a protection as thou thinkest.&#8221; But the meaning is, that though
the Ammonites, confiding in their defences, disregarded all attacks of enemies,
they would yet be exposed to plunder; for their mountains and valleys would
avail them nothing, notwithstanding the opinion they entertained, that they were
so fortified, that they could not be assailed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls Ammon a <i>rebellious</i>,<i> </i>or a
backsliding <i>daughter</i>,<i> </i>though he mentions no particulars. But
Ezekiel and also Amos and Zephaniah, these three, clearly show why God was so
severe towards the Ammonites, (Ezekiel 25;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;300101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos
1:13;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;360209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zephaniah
2:9;) it was because they had uttered blasphemies against him and his people,
exulted over the miseries and calamities of the chosen people, and plundered
them when they saw them overcome by their enemies. For these reasons, then, our
Prophet now calls them a <i>rebellious </i>people: they had proudly exalted
themselves against God, and exercised cruel tyranny as to the miserable
Israelites, who were yet, as it has been stated, connected with them by
blood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who trusts in her

strongholds; for the Prophet in the next words explains himself,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who can come to me?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">It appears, then, that the Ammonites thought
themselves thus secure, because they were not exposed to their enemies, but
protected by their mountains, as though they were in hiding places. This
boasting sufficiently shews that they did not so much trust in their treasures
as in their hidden places, because they dwelt in recesses. The meaning is, that
though the Ammonites gloried that they were beyond the reach of danger, yet God
would become the avenger of the cruelty which they had exercised towards their
relations, the Israelites. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah at length concludes his prophecy, by saying,
that God would dissipate that foolish confidence through which the Ammonites
were filled with pride, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because
he would bring a terror</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>on them. He sets
up terror in opposition to that security in which the Ammonites lay torpid; for
they were inebriated, as it were, with their pleasures. And then the strongholds
by which they thought themselves protected, so hardened their hearts, that they
feared no danger. God then sets up this terror in opposition to the false
arrogance by which they were inflated:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
bring</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a terror from all around
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>And this was not without reason
added, for the Ammonites thought that they could, on some side, escape, if
enemies pressed hard on them; and as there were many outlets, they thought it
impossible that they should fall into the hands of enemies. But God declares
that they would be in every way full of fear, for terror would surround and
besiege them, so that they could not escape.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall be driven out, every one
to his face,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or, before his face. This
would be the effect of terror, because God would deprive them of all thought;
for when we flee in haste, and only regard any opening that may present itself,
it is evident that we are driven by terror. As we say in French, <i>Il court
devant soi</i>;<i> </i>so the Prophet says here,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall be driven out, every one
before his face</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>that is, &#8220;ye
shall flee wherever a place may be open to you.&#8221; He shews that they would
be so full of fear, that they would not consider which would be the best way,
nor think of a safe retreat; they would, in short, think of nothing but of
flight. And to the same purpose is what follows:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There will be none to gather the
dispersed</i></font><font face="Palatino">:<i> </i>for when trembling seizes the
hearts of the multitude, they can yet be recalled, when one who has more courage
than the rest encourages them to stop, as we know that many armies have been in
this way saved; for as to soldiers, when suddenly seized with fear, a leader has
often been able to gather them again. But the Prophet, when he says, that there
would be none to call them back from flight, intimates their destruction. He at

<div><font face="Palatino">He now says the same thing of the children of Ammon,
as he said before of the Moabites, that some hope yet remained for them, for God
would at length show mercy to that nation. But, as we have said, these promises
were but adventitious, because God had chosen but one people to be a Father to
them; and the children of Abraham must be viewed as distinct from all other
nations. But though God built, as it were, a wall to separate his people from
aliens, it was yet his will to give some preludes of his favor, and of the
calling of the Gentiles. The Prophet, then, had here a regard to the kingdom of
Christ. The promise, no doubt, extended itself to his coming; for he speaks of
the calling of the Gentiles, which God deferred until he manifested his own Son
to the world. It is the same then, as though the Prophet had said, that
God&#8217;s mercy would at length be showed to the Ammonites in common with
others; that is, when God would gather his Church from the whole world, and
unite, in one body, those who were before scattered. Nor is there a doubt but
that the Prophet, speaking of the children of Ammon, intended to show what was
to be manifested through all parts of the world. And so it is, that on our
calling is our salvation founded, for we see that the gospel has not been,
without a design, proclaimed to the world; but as God had determined and settled
this from the beginning, so we see that Jeremiah was a herald of our adoption.

inveterate enemies to the chosen people, though their origin ought to have
disposed them to show kindness to them, for they had descended from the same
father, even Abraham. The Idumeans also gloried in their holy descent,<i>
</i>and had circumcision in common with the Jews. It was then a most impious
cruelty that the Idumeans entertained such bitter hatred towards their own
blood. Hence our Prophet most severely reproved them, as also did Ezekiel and
Obadiah.

the Idumeans thought themselves safe through their own counsels, because they
excelled in acuteness, it yet would avail them nothing, for the Lord would blind
them and deprive them of a sane mind; for what is put here interrogatively is
declared plainly by Obadiah, (Obadiah 28.) even in God&#8217;s

necessary that he should speak of this as of a future thing. But our Prophet, as
the judgment of which Obadiah was a witness and a herald, was near at hand,
boldly exults over the Idumeans, and laughs at their reproach, inasmuch as they
were deprived of counsel and understanding when they had most need of them.
Teman, no doubt, was the name of a mountain or of a region; and this we learn

</i>that is, as they understand it, &#8220;from the children of Esau.&#8221; But
this is frigid and forced; and the two clauses correspond much better when read
thus, &#8220;Is<i> </i>there no more wisdom in Teman? has counsel perished from
the intelligent?&#8221; that is, from those who have hitherto boasted of their
intelligence and acuteness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rotten has become their
wisdom.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jrs</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>

putrid, as it is in <i>Niphal</i>.<i> </i>I know not whether they have done
this, because they did not know another meaning suitable to the context; but we
may fitly render it thus, that their wisdom had become superfluous, that is,
useless. We may also adopt another meaning, that their wisdom had been hitherto
overflowing, that is, superabounded; for they had such wisdom, so as not only to
act wisely for themselves, but also to show to others what was right and useful.
As then the Idumeans possessed so much wisdom as to direct others, and not to be
wise only for themselves, the words would read well were they rendered, that
their wisdom had abounded. But in that case the words would be ironical; for the
Prophet seems to assign a reason for his astonishment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I give then this explanation: he first says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is there wisdom no more in Teman?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He exclaims, as though the thing was very
strange, &#8220;How can this be! is the very fountain of wisdom exhausted? Who
could have thought that a city so renowned for wisdom would become so fatuitous
as not to know her approaching calamity, so as to meet it, and apply in time the
remedy?&#8221; And to the same effect he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Has counsel perished from the

has their wisdom</i>;<i> </i>and this he says, in order to show a reason for his
astonishment.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fH35</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must notice the sameness and the difference
between our Prophet and Obadiah. The latter foretold the blindness of that
nation; but our Prophet, as though he wished to rouse from their torpor those
who had been inattentive to the prophecy of Obadiah, exclaims, &#8220;How has
wisdom perished from Teman, and counsel from the intelligent?&#8221; We must
further observe, that this punishment was by God inflicted on the Idumeans,
because they had applied all their thoughts to frauds and intrigues; and it
seldom happens, but that they who excel in acuteness become very sharp and
fraudulent. As then men are thus wont to abuse for the most part their
knowledge, God blinds them, and shews that men cannot of themselves be wise, but
as far as it is given them from above. As I have already said, the Prophet
enlarges on this judgment, that he might the more effectually rouse the minds of
men. For had the Idumeans been rustics, such as dwell among mountains, and had
no report prevailed as to their wisdom, no one would have wondered that they
were taken and subdued; for simple and unwary men are exposed to the intrigues
of their enemies, and cannot escape them. But the Prophet, in order to set forth
this judgment of God as wonderful, says that their wisdom had been as it were
overflowing, that is, like an abundant treasure, for they administered counsel
to others. As, then, the Idumeans so much excelled in intelligence, especially
those who dwelt in the city Teman, the Prophet shews by this very circumstance
that their blindness proceeded from the manifest vengeance of God, and that such
a change did not happen by chance. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

</i>he says; the language is abrupt, yet the meaning is not ambiguous. The
meaning is, that when any one warned the Idumeans to flee, none of them would

they would have there a perpetual quietness.

fH36</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand the design of the Prophet, &#8212;
that he wished to set before our eyes how proudly the Idumeans trusted in their
defences, as they never could be persuaded to flee. The Prophet then, as
God&#8217;s herald, declares that they would have to flee. But what did they do?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They made deep their
habitation,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, they would remain
quiet in their own country, as though they were fixed in the center of the
earth, and therefore unassailable. By saying then that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made
deep</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he sets forth their obstinacy, so
that no one could terrify them, though he announced extreme dangers. But it was
his purpose thus to strengthen confidence in his prophecy, because the greatest
part of the faithful could form no judgment but according to the present aspect
of things; and the Idumeans proudly laughed at all threatenings. That the
faithful then might not think that the Idumeans would be safe, he afterwards
adds, in God&#8217;s name, &#8220;Behold, I will bring ruin on Esau.&#8221; He
mentions their father, and the Idumeans, we know, descended from Esau the
first-born of Isaac; and hence they were of the same blood with the Israelites.
But the Prophet, by bringing forward the name of a reprobate man, intended, no
doubt, to renew the memory of a curse, for Esau had been rejected, and his
younger brother Jacob succeeded in his place. Hence the Prophet, that he might
gain more credit to his words, brought before the people what was well known to
them, that Esau had been rejected by God; for on the rejection of Esau depended
their gratuitous election and adoption.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says that God would be the avenger of that
nation <i>at the time of visitation</i>;<i> </i>for as I have before reminded
you, what we have read was not immediately fulfilled. When, therefore, the
Israelites suffered extreme calamities, their hope might a hundred times have
failed them, on seeing the Idumeans remaining still as it were asleep in their
pleasures, and these judgments of God as it were buried; for it might have come
to their minds that all which Jeremiah had declared had passed away like smoke.
Hence, to sustain their hope and patience, he sets before them here the <i>time
</i>of visitation; as though he had said, that the Idumeans also would have
their turn, after God had patiently borne with their impiety and spared them for
a long time. But of this we shall hereafter see. Now, as I have shown elsewhere,
the words which remind us of the time of God&#8217;s visitations, ought to be
noticed, that we may not by hastening fall headlong, as it is usually the case;
for they who are in a hurry, fall at the first step. That we may then learn to
wait for the ripened time, let this remain fixed in our minds, that God has his
settled seasons of visitations. It now follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Interpreters have not only obscured, but also
perverted this verse, and only said what is to no purpose, and have gone far
from the meaning of the Prophet.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH37</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> How so? because it did not occur to them
to compare this with a passage in Obadiah. Obadiah is the true interpreter; nay,
our Prophet has borrowed what we read here from him. For there a question is
asked, &#8220;If thieves were to come to thee, if robbers
(</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ydd&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shaddi</i>,<i> </i>is added there, but is omitted by Jeremiah) &#8212; if
robbers by night, how wouldest thou have been reduced to nothing?&#8221; But in
the first place the rendering ought to be, &#8220;Had thieves come to thee, how
wouldest thou have been reduced to nothing?&#8221; then he adds, &#8220;Would
they not have stolen what would suffice them?&#8221; He afterwards adds the
second clause, &#8220;If<i> </i>the grape-gatherers had come to thee, would they
not have left grapes.&#8221; There is now then no ambiguity in the
Prophet&#8217;s words, if we read them interrogatively. But there is an implied
contrast between the calamity threatened to the people and the other
devastations. Were a thief of the night to plunder another&#8217;s house, he
would depart, loaded with his prey, and leave something behind; for in all
plunder some things remain: so also as to grape-gatherers, some grapes remain,
which escape the gatherers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then the Prophet here shews, that so great would be
the destruction of that nation, that it would exceed all kinds of plundering;
for when one strips his vines, he leaves some grapes; and when a thief enters a
house, he does not carry all things away with him, being satisfied with his
booty. But nothing, he says, shall be left remaining with the Idumeans. We hence
see why the Prophet brings forward the two comparisons, that of the
grape-gatherers and of the thieves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must at the same time observe, that when God
denounces his vengeance on the Israelites, he often adduces these comparisons,
in order to show that nothing would be left them, &#8220;When the olives are
shaken, yet some fruit remains on the top of the trees; but thou shalt be wholly
emptied.&#8221; As God had said these things, the Israelites might have raised
an objection and said, &#8220;What is our condition, and how miserable! for we
are extremely afflicted; though God afflicts the Idumeans, yet he deals mildly
with them, for God&#8217;s wrath is less inflamed against them than against
us.&#8221; Lest then the faithful should be thus thrown into despair, our
Prophet declares that the Idumeans would be wholly destroyed, so that not a
grape would be left them, nor any of their furniture, for their enemies would
lay desolate the whole land. Now follows a confirmation of this verse &#8212;

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the beginning of the verse, the meaning of the
Prophet is not obscure; for he means that such would be the destruction of the
people of Edom, that they would be spoiled by enemies, that they would become
wholly naked. But he speaks in the name of God:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I uncover Esau, and make
open his hidden things</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>By hidden things
he means treasures, as it is evident from Obadiah. He then says that he would so
expose the Idumeans to plunder, that there would be no hidden thing but that
their enemies would seize and plunder it. This is the meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then confirms what I have said, that this
plundering would not be like grape-gathering, or theft, or common robbery,
because God would altogether empty the Idumeans of all that they had, even of
all that they hid in the ground.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the end of the verse, some give this
explanation, &#8220;There will be none to say:&#8221; there is then a word to be
understood, &#8212; &#8220;there will be none to say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Leave thy orphans to me, I will
nourish</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or sustain <i>them</i>,<i>
</i>or I will he a father to them;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and thy widows, let them
hope</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or trust <i>in me</i>,<i> </i>or
rest on me.&#8221; For it is no small comfort to parents, when they know that
their widows would have one to flee to, and also their orphans. When one dies
and sees that his widow is destitute of every help, and sees that his orphans
are miserable and needy, his paternal and conjugal love is grievously wounded.
For is it more bitter than death itself, when the husband cannot provide any
help for his widow, when he cannot provide any relief for his orphans. Hence
some interpreters think that the ruin of this people is in this way exaggerated;
that is, because no one would be found to bring comfort to parents, and to take
as it were the place of the dead.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the meaning would not be unsuitable, were the
words deemed ironical, that the Prophet spoke in the person of God,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Leave to me thy orphans, I will
nourish them, and let thy widows rest on me</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>or trust in me: for it follows afterwards,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, they to whom there was no
judgment, have drunk of the cup,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>etc.<i>
</i>The passage then would not read amiss, if we consider that God taunts the
Idumeans, and ironically declares that he would be a judge against them even
after they were dead; for God&#8217;s vengeance, we know, reaches to the third
and the fourth generation. As then he had before declared, that the Idumeans
would be destroyed, their seed, their brethren, and their neighbors, so he now
confirms the same thing, &#8212; &#8220;What! dost thou expect that I should be
a father or a protector to thy orphans? that I should bring aid to thy widow?
This thou expectest in vain from me.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, in a few words, very sharply goads the
minds of the Idumeans, when God thus presents himself, and says by way of
mockery, that he would be a protector to their orphans and widows; for they had
indiscriminately vented their rage on orphans and women, and spared neither sex
nor age. Then God shews here that there was no reason why they should expect any
comfort as to their children, for he would be their avenger to the third and the
fourth generation. And forced, no doubt, is what some say; at least I do not see
how the words, <i>I will nourish them</i>,<i> </i>can comport with the rest of
the context. This clause, then, I apply to God himself, because his vengeance
would consume them with their brethren, their neighbors and their seed. And the
irony is the most suitable to the whole passage; that is, that God meant to
show, that he could bring no help to orphans or aid to widows, since they had
been so cruel both to orphans and widows.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms the last verse, as I think, &#8212; that
God&#8217;s vengeance awaited the whole seed of Esau, because it would be
unreasonable to deal more severely with God&#8217;s people than with aliens, who
had wholly shaken off the yoke. For I explain what is said here of the Church,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Those to whom it was not their
judgment to drink the cup shall surely
drink</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Some apply this to neighboring
nations who had not become so wicked as the Idumeans. But this exposition is
frigid, and we ought always, as we have said elsewhere, to have regard to the
design of the Prophet. What then was his object but to show to the faithful,
that there was no reason for them to despond, however grievously God might
afflict them, because the punishment which he would inflict on the Idumeans
would in no way be milder; for we know that we are greatly tempted by envy when
we see that the state of the impious and the reprobate is better than that of
God&#8217;s children. And it was for this purpose that Psalm 37 was
composed,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Envy not the wicked, nor let
their prosperity vex thee, because they shall soon
perish.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And David also, in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;197302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
73:2, 3, confesses, that he in a manner staggered when he saw the wicked
luxuriating in their pleasures, while the children of God were miserably
treated. Then our Prophet in this place, as often elsewhere, had regard to the
faithful, and wished to sustain them, lest they should succumb under their
burden, when God afflicted them as well as the Idumeans. Hence he says, when
speaking of the Idumeans,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Drinking they shall drink the cup
whose judgment was not to drink, and shalt thou be
exempted</i></font><font face="Palatino">?<i> </i>that is, &#8220;I<i> </i>will
not spare my people, and should I spare aliens? this cannot
be.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We then see that it was a fruitful source of
consolation to the faithful, when they heard that the wicked, who openly and
avowedly disregarded God, could not escape his judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be now asked, how could he say that it was
not the judgment of the Church to drink of the cup of God&#8217;s wrath? He
speaks comparatively, and this answer ought to suffice us. It is certain that
the Israelites deserved all the evils which they suffered. God then justly
chastised them; he did not act without reason or through sudden wrath, but
executed<i> </i>what he had previously decreed.<i> </i>It was then God&#8217;s
judgment, even what he had determined and fixed; for judgment here is to be
taken for God&#8217;s decree, by which he apportions to each<i> </i>his own lot.
It was not then a judgment to the Israelites to drink of the cup, when one
compared them to the Idumeans, &#8212; how so? Here a new question arises, for
the Israelites had been worse than all others. The Idumeans had departed wholly
from God; all light had become extinct among them; and then the law had not been
given them: before Jacob went down to Egypt, who was to be from thence<i>
</i>delivered according to the prefixed time made known to Abraham, they dwelt
in mountains separated from the land of Canaan. They therefore possessed no part
of God&#8217;s law, except that they had the empty symbol of circumcision. But
the Israelites, on whom had always shone the doctrine of the law, were
altogether inexcusable. Why then does the Prophet say that there was no judgment
to them? My answer is, that the reference here is not to the persons of men, but
on the contrary to the grace of God, through which he had been pleased to
embrace the children of Israel. As then God had chosen that nation, what is
regarded here is special adoption; for it is right in God to indulge his
children, and it is right also in him to pardon them rather than aliens. When
any one is offended with his own son, he will be reconciled to him; but an alien
will not find pardon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see that the Prophet does not regard what
the people had deserved, nor consider how detestable had been their impiety, and
of what grievous punishment they were worthy; but on the contrary, he refers to
that grace of God through which he had chosen the seed of Jacob. He had indeed
previously chosen the whole seed of Abraham; but the rejection of Esau followed,
so that Jacob alone remained as the seed. Since then God had manifested himself
as a father to the children of Jacob, the Prophet says that it was not their
judgment to drink of the cup, because it was according to reason and common
sense that God should forgive them rather than aliens, whom he had already
rejected, and who were like putrid members:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whose judgment was not
to drink the cup, drinking shall drink, and shalt thou escape
free</i></font><font face="Palatino">?<i> </i>The meaning is, that if the green
wood is burnt, what will become of the dry? as Christ said.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;422331&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
23:31.) There is a similar consolation mentioned in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 4:17, 18, where those afflictions are mentioned to which the Church of God
is now exposed. Now, as we are tender and delicate, and the minds of many may be
harassed, Peter says, that if God be so severe towards his own, those of his own
household, what will become of the wicked? what dreadful vengeance awaits
them?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence perceive the drift of the Prophet&#8217;s
words, and what doctrine may be hence deduced, even that when we see God&#8217;s
judgment beginning at God&#8217;s house, as the Prophet elsewhere says,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242529&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
25:29) and as also Peter says; that is, when God chastises his own children, and
seems in the meantime to pass by the wicked, we ought patiently to wait for the
visitation previously mentioned; and this ought always to be remembered by us,
&#8220;If this be done in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?&#8221;
We shall not then envy the wicked, when God defers and does not immediately
execute his judgment; for the punishments inflicted by God on his servants are
only temporary and limited, and intended as medicine, inasmuch as all we suffer
are helps to our salvation, as Paul teaches us.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450828&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:28.) As then God paternally chastises us, let us not shun his paternal hand;
nor let us think that God deals more kindly with the wicked because he suspends
his judgments, for at length they will be hurried into their own ruin, as the
Prophet says here.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In speaking of a cup, the Prophet uses a phrase
common in Scripture, for the Scripture by a metaphor calls punishment inflicted
on men for their sins a cup; because God apportions to each his just measure. It
is taken then as allowed, that calamities are not by chance,<i> </i>but proceed
from God&#8217;s hand, as though he gave a cup to drink. Now when he afflicts
his own, they are constrained to drink as it were his wrath; it is therefore a
sour and a bitter cup. But the wicked shall hereafter drink poison. Even
medicine,<i> </i>though displeasing to the taste because of its bitterness, is
yet wholesome; but poison kills men, though its taste is like medicine. This
then is the comparison that is used here by Jeremiah;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Drinking, they shall drink the
cup</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>even God&#8217;s servants, who yet
ought to have been exempted through a singular privilege, even because God had
chosen them to be his peculiar people;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shalt
thou</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be exempted from
drinking</i></font><font face="Palatino">?<i> </i>He addresses all
aliens.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have before seen another mode of speaking,
&#8220;They<i> </i>shall drink to the dregs,&#8221; as though he had said,
&#8220;God will not only give thee to drink a bitter cup, but its bitterness
will kill and destroy thee, for God will constrain thee to drink the very
dregs.&#8221; But still the meaning is the same, though the phrase is different.
He then asserts that the Idumeans would not be exempt from God&#8217;s judgment,
and why? because God does not spare even his own children. Here then is
suggested to us the best consolation when God in various ways afflicts us: let
us know that it cannot be otherwise, but that it is a prelude to the last
judgment, when salvation shall surely be our portion, for God purifies us now by
temporal punishments, that we may be then free from final vengeance. But when
the ungodly are secure, let us know that God&#8217;s judgment is indeed hidden,
but yet certain, and will shortly overtake them; for when they
say,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet confirms what he had already
prophesied respecting the Idumeans; but to remove every doubt, he says, that God
had <i>sworn</i>;<i> </i>and he introduces God as the speaker, in order that his
word might be emphatical. He then declares that God had made an oath respecting
the destruction of Bozrah. What is particular is put for what is general; for he
includes the whole nation under the name of this city. Nor does he simply
declare that the Idumeans would be laid waste and destroyed, but he accumulates
words:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Bozrah</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
curse</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What the Prophet said was no doubt a thing difficult
to be believed; for God did not without reason bring forth his own name. For as
he would have us to use it seriously and reverently, so he does not interpose so
precious a pledge except under the greatest necessity. It is then certain, that
there was a weighty reason why God testified by an oath what we read here of the
destruction of the people of Edom. Now I have said that what Jeremiah announced
was hardly credible; and it was so, because there was no cause for war; and
besides, the country was fortified by its own inclosures; for the Idumeans
thought, as it seems, that they were impregnable. This, then, was the reason why
God interposed an oath. At the same time his purpose was, as I have before
reminded you, to consult the benefit of the faithful; for God makes an oath that
he might apply a remedy to the weakness of our faith; for as we almost always
vacillate, a simple testimony, without being sanctioned by an oath, would not be
sufficient for us. This is then the reason for making an oath.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God is said to swear <i>by himself</i>,<i>
</i>because there is none greater; as the apostle says, by whom he can swear.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580613&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
6:13.) Men in doubtful and hidden things flee to God, who knows the heart, who
is himself the truth, and from whom nothing is hid. And an oath, as we learn
from many places of Scripture, is a part of divine worship. As then this honor
peculiarly belongs to him, that is, that we should swear by his name, when he
himself swears, he cannot derive authority from another, which may confirm his
words: he therefore swears by himself. And we have heard what he declares by
Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I<i> </i>will not give my glory
to another.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
42:8)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God then prescribes to us the form of swearing, when
he swears by himself. God is said to swear sometimes by his soul, or by his
life, and he is said sometimes to lift up his hand. These expressions are not
strictly proper, but transferred to God from men. But the mode of speaking used
by Jeremiah ought especially to be observed, for we see how an oath is to be
rightly made, even when it is made by an appeal to God&#8217;s name, for he is
alone the fit witness and judge in things doubtful and hidden.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is therefore under the Papacy a base and an
intolerable idolatry, for the Papists swear by dead saints. This is nothing else
but to rob God of his right; for since he alone, as it has been stated, is the
truth, so he alone is the fit judge when things are hidden and cannot be
ascertained by human testimony. And we ought to notice the words used in
swearing, that is, when men submit to God&#8217;s judgment, and implore him as a
judge. Whosoever then swears by the saints, it is the same thing as to make them
to occupy the place of God, so as to make them the judges of the world, and to
ascribe to them all power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;God is a witness to my
soul,&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">says Paul,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470123&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 1:23;) and then we have such words as these,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;May God do this to me and add
that.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;080117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ruth
1:17;</font><br><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;091444&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Samuel 14:44;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;100335&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Samuel 3:35,<i> </i>etc.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By such expressions, as I have said, is set forth the
authority and character of an oath. In short, we must bear in mind, that when
necessity constrains us to swear, God is ever the sole judge, and that therefore
his name is profaned when we swear by another.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now what it is to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a reproach
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
curse</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>is evident from other places,
even when any one is set as it were in a theater, that he might be an example of
disgrace, or when any calamity gives an occasion for execrations and
maledictions, &#8220;May<i> </i>God destroy thee as he destroyed<i> </i>the
Idumeans:&#8221; this is to be a curse, as we have elsewhere
seen.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cities</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>and thereby intimates that this desolation would not be confined to one
part, but be extended to all parts. He also says that they would be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>perpetual
wastes</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>and thus he took away every hope
of restoration. When he prophesied before against the Moabites and the
Ammonites, he mingled some consolation, but as to Edom, every hope is cut off.
The nation, no doubt, deserved a heavier vengeance, for it had a nearer
connection with the Israelites &#8212; hence its cruelty was less to be borne.
Besides, it appears that it exceeded in its barbarity all other nations; for it
is not without reason said in the Psalms,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Remember,<i> </i>O Lord, the

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet again shews that God would be the author
of the calamity of which he speaks; for if things were viewed by men, no one
could have thought that the Idumeans could in so short a time be destroyed. It
was therefore necessary for the faithful to raise upwards their minds. And this
the Prophet had in view when he said that all this would be from
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But most forcible are his words when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have heard a
hearing;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>some say, &#8220;a<i>
</i>report,&#8221; but improperly, as I think; for though,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h[wm&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shemuoe</i>,<i> </i>often means a report or rumor, yet here it ought to be
taken for a proclamation, which God published as it were by his own heralds. For
the similitude is taken from men, proclaiming war against their enemies by a
solemn rite. Then Jeremiah says, that a<i> voice was heard </i>sent from above,
because it was God&#8217;s purpose publicly and openly to testify, that what we
read here of the destruction of Edom would take place. We now then understand
the meaning of the Prophet, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A hearing have we heard from
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then follows immediately a confirmation, <i>a

ambassador</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is sent to the
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>God, indeed, had no messenger
or herald to proclaim war against the Idumeans, or to rouse up the Assyrians and
Chaldeans; but the Prophets usually spoke thus, that men, being led to the very
scene, might know that what was said was real, and would not be without its
effect, as prophecies were as so many embassies. And according to this view, the
prophets, as we have stated elsewhere, sometimes besieged and stormed cities,
sometimes sounded the trumpet, even for this purpose, to show that their
doctrine was linked with its execution, for God never spoke by them to no
purpose or in vain. The Prophet at the same time reminds us that the Chaldeans
and the Assyrians were in God&#8217;s hand, so that he could by a nod or a hiss
rouse them to war, as it is said elsewhere,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;God<i> </i>will hiss for the fly
of Egypt.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230718&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
7:18)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet then means, that the Chaldeans and the
Assyrians would be ready to obey God, as though they were hired soldiers, and
enlisted under his banner.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We<i> </i>now then see how forcible was this mode of
speaking; for the faithful might hence learn, that it was in God&#8217;s power
to perform whatever he proclaimed by his servant, because he could by one word
rouse, draw, arm, and lead to war the Assyrians and the Chaldeans, as he also
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be ye assembled, and come
against her, and rise up to battle</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>And
he speaks of many nations, lest any one should think that the Idumeans would be
able to resist, for he is not immediately conquered who is attacked by his
enemies. But the Prophet meets this doubt, and says that there would be many
nations, who, with their united strength, would come against the people of Edom,
so that they would have no power to resist. Nearly the same words are found in
Obadiah. It now follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Interpreters for the most part give this exposition,
that the people of Edom would be contemptible, because God had determined to
cast them down from their dignity, which they for a time possessed: and then
they connect the next verse, in which the reason for this is given, &#8220;Thy
terror deceived thee, the pride of thy heart,&#8221; etc. But this passage may
be taken otherwise, &#8212; that God derides the pride of that nation, which
ought to have restrained itself, because it contended against nature, when it
wished to elate itself so much. And it seems to me that this is the real meaning
of the Prophet. I do not, indeed, pronounce the other view wrong, yet it
behooves me to state what I prefer. I then think that there is to be understood
here an implied comparison between the Israelites and the children of Edom,
which is more clearly expressed by Malachi,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;390102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
1:2, 3;) for God there extols his kindness towards the Israelites, because he
gave them a rich and fruitful land, and sent away the posterity of Esau, and
confined them within rough mountains. As then the Idumeans, ejected from so
pleasant and desirable an inheritance as had been given to the children of
Abraham, were confined as it were to rugged mountains, the Prophet derides their
pride, because they tried in a way contrary and repugnant to nature to elevate
themselves: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I made
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>small among the nations, and
contemptible among men</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>And we know that
less easily can that pride be borne, where there is no reason for boasting. When
any one obscure from the lowest rank exalts himself above the most noble, all
regard him with contempt, for it is a monstrous thing. It is for this reason
that the Prophet now says, &#8220;What have you, O Idumeans, that ye are so
proud! What do you possess? what is your glory? for God has humbled you. It is
then the same as though a fly wished to exceed in bulk the
elephant.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But if the other exposition be preferred, the meaning
would be as follows, &#8220;Behold,<i> </i>I will make thee small and
contemptible among the nations, because thou hast been very proud.&#8221; But I
have stated what I approve, even that God here brings against the Idumeans their
folly, because they ought not to have boasted without reason,
&#8220;Behold,&#8221; he says; he shews, as by the finger, how mean and abject
their condition was; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>1 have made
thee small among the nations, and contemptible among
men</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>And, doubtless, were it a
threatening, it would not have been sufficiently forcible; for the Prophet has
hitherto been thundering against the Idumeans, and he goes on in the same
strain. If then he had now put in what we read, referring to their smallness, it
would have been frigid. I doubt not, then, but that the Prophet describes the
state of that nation, such as it had been in comparison with that of the chosen
people, and even of other nations; for though they were rich, had always been
free from disturbance, and suffered no losses, yet they lived, as it has been
stated, in mountains by no means fertile. It now follows &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">Some render the first words thus, &#8220;Thine idol
hath deceived thee;&#8221;<i> </i>and others, &#8220;Thy<i> </i>folly hath
deceived thee.&#8221; The verb has, indeed, this meaning, though there is a
different reading, for some put a point over the right side of the letter, and
others on the left. But the most suitable meaning is thus conveyed,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Deceived thee has thy terror, the
pride of thy heart</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Those who render the
first word &#8220;idol,&#8221; consider that superstition is referred to, that
the false confidence which the Edomites placed in their idols had deceived them.
But this seems to be a forced explanation. Why others have rendered the word
&#8220;folly,&#8221; I know not. The word properly means terror. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#8776;lp</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
pelets</i>,<i> </i>means to terrify, and from this the noun is derived. And when
the word is taken for an idol, it is so metaphorically, because idols terrify
men, or because a terrible end awaits their worshippers. But I retain the proper
meaning of the word. At the same time terror here is to be taken actively,
because the Idumeans were a terror to other nations, and were thus blinded with
pride on account of their conceit as to their power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the following words are explanatory,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the pride of thy
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>for they who despise others fill
themselves with empty pride, and thus elevate their own hearts. As then the
Idumeans had gained for themselves the repute of being a warlike people, the
terror entertained for them inflated their own hearts with pride: but the
Prophet says, that they were <i>deceived</i>,<i> </i>as they arrogated to
themselves too much power. At the same time he continues the subject which I
have stated, as though he had said, &#8220;How comes it, that as God has
designed thee to be contemptible, thou takest to thyself such authority among
the nations? Thou fightest against nature, for thou hast hitherto in vain
terrified thy neighbors: hence it is, that thou art swollen with pride; but it
is a mere delusion; thou art greatly mistaken, and deceivest thyself in thus
thinking of thy strength, since thy condition ought, on the contrary, to make
thee humble.&#8221; We now see how well the whole passage runs, and how aptly
the words agree together. He then says that it was a foolish confidence, by
which the people of Edom, whom God had made contemptible, were
deceived.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds, by way of concession,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou who dwellest in the fissures
of rocks, and occupiest the heights of
mountains</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>In these words the Prophet
concedes something to the Idumeans; but he afterwards adds, that the fortresses,
by which they thought themselves to be protected, would come to nothing;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>though thou raisest high thy nest
as the eagle, thence will I</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>says God,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>draw thee
down</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>We<i> </i>hence see that the
Prophet concedes<i> </i>to the Idumeans some reason for boasting on account of
their mountains, because they presented on every side a defense against enemies;
and yet he shews that all this would be useless to them; for he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>though thou raisest high thy nest
as the eagle</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>that is, though thou
ascendest, as they commonly say, above the very clouds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thence will I draw thee
down</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this passage teaches us first, that all who trust
in their own earthly defences deceive themselves; and, secondly, that all who
arrogate to themselves more than what is just and right, contend, as it were,
against God, and that it cannot, therefore, be otherwise but that God will lay
them prostrate. We are then taught by this doctrine to cultivate humility.
Humility has its roots fixed deeply within; so that the state of those who
willingly submit themselves, becomes firm and permanent; for the root, which
appears not on the surface, sustains the tree. So also that humility, which is
not known by men, is our real and solid prop and support. Whosoever takes the
wing and flies, and seeks, through his own presumption, to raise up himself,
provokes God as it were designedly: and here the Prophet shews what end awaits
all those who thus raise themselves on high, seeking to set their nest on a
summit like the eagle; for God will draw them down and lay them prostrate, as he
did to the Idumeans. It now follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

have before stated how necessary was such a repetition, because no one could
have thought that destruction was so nigh the Idumeans. He did not then repeat
what he had said, in order to explain more clearly what might have been
otherwise obscure, but to fix more fully in the hearts of the faithful what
appeared incredible.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He expresses more at large what he had briefly
included in one word: he had said, that Edom would become a <i>waste</i>;<i>
</i>but he now shews what sort of waste it would be, even such as that of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sodom and Gomorrah, and other
cities</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>for God, as it is well known,
destroyed the five cities against which he fulminated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And hence again we learn, that there was no hope left
for the Idumeans; as though the Prophet had said, that their final overthrow was
inevitable, because God would have them wholly destroyed, and their memory
obliterated. It is yet probable that there were some remnant of the nation; but
this was not inconsistent with this prophecy, because they who remained alive
became so scattered, that they never formed one people, nor had any name. And
though God might have chosen some from that nation, yet this favor remained hid,
and, as it was unknown to men, it can hardly be taken to the account. However
this may have been, we must bear in mind what I have before briefly referred to,
&#8212; that the Idumeans were so accursed, that their calamity was much severer
than that of other nations; and this they had deserved by their unnatural
cruelty and many contumelies towards the miserable Israelites, their own
relatives. This, then, was the reason why Jeremiah compared the land to,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sodom and Gomorrah, and the other
cities; no man shall dwell there</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>that
is, the country shall be desolate.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And yet it appears, from history, that that country
was afterwards inhabited, for even the Romans placed there a garrison. But the
Prophet, as I have already said, meant that none of the Idumeans would survive
to possess the land, so as to become a nation. Though, then, other inhabitants
might have afterwards possessed the land, this was nothing to the Idumeans; for
that people had perished, and from that time no restoration followed: this was
sufficient as a fulfillment of this prophecy. Nay, it was a harder thing, that
their land should receive aliens and strangers, than if it had been left
desolate.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must also bear in mind the common mode of
speaking adopted by the Prophets; for when they adduce Sodom and Gomorrah as
examples, they speak hyperbolically; and there is no need here to accumulate
passages to prove this; for they who are in any tolerable measure acquainted
with Scripture, must know that whenever mention is made of Sodom and Gomorrah,
all pardon and alleviation of punishment are excluded. Isaiah, extolling
God&#8217;s mercy towards his chosen people, says,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Had<i> </i>not God left us a very
small seed, we must have been as Sodom and like to Gomorrah.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
1:9)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this mode of speaking, as I have said, often
occurs in Scripture; yea, even our Prophet threatened the Israelites with the
destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242314&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
23:14.) The words, no doubt, are used hyperbolically; for God had not fulminated
against other lands or nations and sunk them in the deep, as he had done to
Sodom and Gomorrah. But in comparisons all parts do not
correspond.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, some one may ask, Why does God thus exceed due
limits in speaking? To this I answer, that it is not done without just reason
and necessity. We indeed see that men are indifferent to God&#8217;s judgments;
for such is their sloth and insensibility, that they disregard as a light thing,
or deem as nothing, what God threatens. As then men are so brutish, being
unmoved by God&#8217;s threatenings, it is necessary that such indifference
should be roused and awakened. He therefore sets Sodom and Gomorrah before their
eyes; and as Jude also says, there an example of all the punishments which await
the reprobate has been exhibited. (Jude 7.) God therefore designed to represent
once for all, as in a mirror, how dreadful will be his vengeance on all the
wicked. Since it is so, to the same end is this threatening, that God would
destroy the Idumeans and all like them, as he did Sodom and Gomorrah, so that
none would survive, though aliens might come and succeed the Idumeans and occupy
their inheritance. I cannot now finish; we shall leave the other
comparison.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here confirms what he had said, that such
would be the violence of the Chaldean army, that the Idumeans would not be able
to resist it. He then says, that the Chaldeans would come like lions, who ascend
in great fury when compelled to change the place of their habitation; for so I
explain what is said of the elevation of Jordan. The explanations are various;
but the one I approve is, that Jeremiah compares the Chaldeans to lions, who
every year, or at least when there was a great inundation, sought hiding-places
on mountains or on elevated grounds, because they could not lie down on the
plains. The elevation of Jordan is then to be taken for its swelling, that is,
when it overflowed. We learn from many passages that the lions lodged around
Jordan. As then they dwelt in the low plains, when the river swelled, they
changed the place of their habitation. But this could not be without their rage
being excited; for we know how savage these wild beasts are. Jeremiah had also a
regard to the situation of Idumea, which was more elevated than Jordan and the
country around it. He says the same also, in the next chapter, of the
Babylonians. But it may be that he alluded in this place to what was common
among the Idumeans, and this is probable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning then is, as I think, that as lions
ascended to higher grounds when Jordan swelled and overflowed, so the Chaldeans
would come to the Idumeans, and invade the country like furious wild beasts.
This is one thing. Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the habitation of
strength</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Jerome&#8217;s rendering is,
&#8220;to valiant beauty;&#8221; the word is so explained almost everywhere, but
it is to be taken here for a strong dwelling. He alludes to the situation of
that land, for it seemed impregnable, because it was surrounded, as it has
appeared elsewhere, by mountains. The situation of Babylon was different, it
being surrounded by the various streams of the Euphrates.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What follows is obscure,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when I shall have made him to
rest, I will make him to run from her.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Some explain the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ki</i>,<i> </i>differently. It is indeed a causative, but is often taken, as
it is well known, as an adverb of time. But the meaning of the Prophet is
ambiguous, and some have imagined that the chosen people are spoken of, as
though the Prophet meant, that when the Lord gave rest to his people, he would
then cause them to flee from the land of Edom. But this exposition is wholly
inadmissible; and I wonder how they came to make such a mistake; for the
Prophet, I have no doubt, means here that the Idumeans had a long time been at
ease, but that a sudden calamity would come which would scatter them here and
there, and force them to seek safety by flight; and this is the best meaning
that we can elicit: <i>When</i>,<i> </i>therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I shall have made her to
rest</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or, from the time I shall have
made her to rest,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> I will make him
to flee from her</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>as though he had said,
&#8220;I<i> </i>have hitherto suffered this nation to rest in its abundance, and
thus to remain quiet; but I will suddenly disperse the inhabitants here and
there, and they shall see their own land occupied by their enemies.&#8221; In
short, there is here a comparison between two conditions; for the Idumeans had
long remained in their own dregs, for there was no one who caused them any
trouble. God had then granted them a continual quietness; but now he declares
that he would make all of them to flee, and that suddenly. And it was necessary
that this should be distinctly expressed, that the Idumeans might not in future
trust in their tranquil state, as hypocrites do, who usually abuse God&#8217;s
indulgence, and think, when he bears long with them, that they have escaped
every danger. Lest then such confidence should deceive the Idumeans, the Prophet
says that they would have to flee after having been long in a state of
tranquillity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The words may at the same time be explained
otherwise; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[gr</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
rego</i>,<i> </i>means to rend, to cut, to break; and it may be so taken here,
&#8220;When I shall have made a rent;&#8221; for the Idumeans, as it has been
stated, were fortified by defences on every side. God now intimates that he
would make an irruption, which he compares to rending; and this explanation is
not unsuitable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It afterwards follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And who is the chosen
</i></font><font face="Palatino">one,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that I may set him over her?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">God now summons all the strong ones, that he
might set them over Idumea, not as pastors or such as might care for the welfare
of the land and provide for its safety, but such as would oppress it with
tyrannical cruelty:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>then <i>is </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the chosen
</i></font><font face="Palatino">one? At the same time God shews that all men of
war are in his hand and at his disposal; as though he had said, &#8220;If<i>
</i>the Idumeans think that they surpass all others in courage and strength,
they are greatly mistaken; for I will find those who possess more courage, for I
have ready at hand chosen men to set over them whenever I please, who will
easily subdue the Idumeans, however superior they may think themselves to be in
martial valor.&#8221; Then God does not here ask a question as of a doubtful
matter, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is the chosen one,
that I may set him over her? </i></font><font face="Palatino">but he shews that
it would be no difficult thing for him to destroy the Idumeaus, because he would
send for the chosen one from any part of the world he pleased, and set him over
Idumea, not as a pastor, as I have said, but as a cruel tyrant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For who is as I am?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He confirms the last clause; for God extols his
own power, which is wont to be despised by the unbelieving. The sentence indeed
seems to be a common truth, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who
is as I am? </i></font><font face="Palatino">for all allow this from the least
to the greatest. The Prophet appears then to have announced something trite and
ordinary by saying, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>none is
like God;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for even the worst of men
acknowledge this, and the least child confesses it, and it is the dictate of
nature. But were any one duly to consider how great is the pride of men, he
would find that this truth is not so common; for there is hardly one in a
hundred who concedes to God what justly belongs to him. For when he comes forth
either to promise salvation or to announce punishment, how little is any one
moved? nay, they who hold this principle, that God can do all things, are yet
carried away, when the least hinderance occurs, to vain imaginations, and at
length become<i> </i>wholly lost. When any one is persuaded that God ought to be
feared, if any occasion for a false confidence be presented, what he had at
first entertained in his mind will be choked, and then wholly extinguished. In
short, if we carefully consider how contemptibly men think of God, we shall
understand that this truth is not in vain often repeated in Scripture, that God
has none like him. For when any one dares to exalt himself against God, he
immediately strikes all with terror; and yet the power of God is regarded as
nothing. We see that even the faithful themselves deem the least thing stronger
than God; nay, they hesitate not to set up flies and insects, so to speak, in
opposition to God, and even to make them equal to him. This is indeed very
shameful, and yet it is what has usually prevailed perpetually in all
ages.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, understand why God declares here as a
great matter and as it were incredible, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there is none like
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>And hence also we learn what the
last clause means, when it is asked,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Where is the chosen one whom I
may set over her? </i></font><font face="Palatino">for he follows up the subject
by saying, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There is no one like
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words he shews that the
whole world is under his power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and who will protest against
me?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some read, &#8220;Who<i> </i>will
prescribe to me the time?&#8221; But they who thus render the words, obscure the
meaning of the Prophet. The Prophet, I doubt not, means, that there is no one
who will dare to dispute with God; or were any one to attempt this, it would be
ridiculous, because God could with one breath dissipate all contentions which
men might raise. When therefore he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who will protest against
me?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>it is the same as though he said,
&#8220;Who will make himself a party against me?&#8221; as it is commonly said.
Who then will oppose himself to me? or, Who will dare to contend with me? or,
Who will dare to dispute in judgment with me? I have therefore given this
rendering, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and who will protest
against me?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and this seems clearly to
express the meaning of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and who is this pastor that
stands before my face?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pastor</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>he alludes to the comparison of a lion; for he thus compares the Idumeans to
sheep. Though they were very ferocious, yet here their weakness is referred to.
As, then, a sheep cannot defend itself against a lion, so the Prophet shews that
the Idumeans would not possess sufficient courage to resist the attacks of the
Chaldeans. In short, the Prophet means, that though the Idumeans had many
protectors, yet there would be no one able to stand against God when he came
forth armed to destroy that nation. The sum of what is said is, that there would
be no one, by right or by strength, equal to God, to defend the Idumeans; for he
said first, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who will protest
against me?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What shepherd will stand against
me? </i></font><font face="Palatino">We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet,
that as the Idumeans had to carry on war with God, it could not possibly be but
that they must perish, for though they might get aids on every side, yet they
could not, either by right or by strength, withstand
God.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fH40</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet proceeds with his subject respecting the
Idumeans and their destruction; but he makes a preface in order to gain credit
to his words. He then says that this was God&#8217;s <i>counsel </i>and his
<i>thoughts</i>.<i> </i>He speaks after the manner of men; for he transfers to
God what does not properly belong to his nature; for God does not deliberate or
consult, but has once for all decreed before the creation of the world what he
will do; nor does he toss about his thoughts in all directions, as men do, who
do not immediately see what is right or what ought to be done. Nothing of this
kind belongs to God. But this way of speaking is sufficiently common, when what
strictly applies to man is transferred to God. It ought at the same time to be
observed, that this is not done without reason, for when God speaks by his
servants, we ever raise doubts, &#8220;Is that said in earnest &#8212; can it be
changed &#8212; is it revocable?&#8221; In short, we receive what is light and
frivolous, and immediately give credit to it; but when God declares anything, we
subject it to comments, and raise up a hundred disputes on every subject,
&#8220;Oh, but this or that may happen; and it may be that God does not speak in
earnest.&#8221; As, then, men never acquiesce in God&#8217;s word, as they ought
to do, the Prophets borrow from common use these forms of speech, that God had
thus thought, that he had thus decreed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning is, that whatever Jeremiah had hitherto
predicted of the Idumeans, could not be retracted, for it was a settled decree,
so fixed as though God had thought of it for a hundred or thousand
years.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the inhabitants of
Teman</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>by whom he means the Idumeans.
But the repetition deserves notice: he first mentions Edom, and then the
inhabitants of Teman. And Teman and Seir are sometimes the same.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If not, cast them
down</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>etc.; the verb properly means to
draw, and to draw in reproach and contempt, as when a carcase is drawn through
the mire. Then the Prophet means here a throwing down, accompanied with
reproach. And he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If not,
draw them forth shall the least of the
flock</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He speaks here otherwise than
before; for he called the Chaldeans chosen, and extolled their strength, that he
might strip the Idumeans of their vain confidence; but he now proceeds further
and says, that there was no need of great valor to put that nation to flight,
because even the least could lay them prostrate on the ground, and also draw
them in disgrace through the land. Now, though the manner of speaking is
different, yet the meaning remains the same, even that God would arm the
Chaldeans with courage, so that they would easily destroy the land of Edom; and
then, that though the Chaldeans should not, according to the estimation of men,
excel in valor, they would yet be superior to the Idumeans, because victory was
in God&#8217;s hand, and he could work by means of flies as well as by men, and
by children as well as by giants.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The formula of swearing is adopted, when he says,
<i>If not</i>,<i> draw them</i>,<i> </i>etc. It is an elliptical phrase, as it
has often been observed; such an obtestation as this is understood,
&#8220;Believe me not hereafter,&#8221; or, &#8220;Regard me not as God.&#8221;
In short, it is a form of an oath, which is a stronger affirmation than if he
had simply said, &#8220;Draw them forth shall the least of the
flock.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some render the last clause, &#8220;If not, set shall

in itself sufficiently clear; but as it was not easy to convince the Jews of
what had been already said of the destruction of the Idumeans, the Prophet
continues the same subject. He then says that the

such would be the calamity, that it would terrify all neighboring countries: as
when a great mass falls, the earth shakes, so the fall of the Idumeans, who had
long gloried in their wealth, could not but strike all their neighbors with

Chaldeans, as though he had said, &#8220;When<i> </i>the state of that nation
shall seem peaceable, when they rest secure in their own nest, then shall the
Chaldeans suddenly come, or rather fly.&#8221; For he compares them to eagles,
in order to show that it would be a very quick and ruinous expedition. At the
time this prophecy was declared by the Prophet, no one could have suspected that
the Chaldeans would become enemies to the Idumeans, for they were on the best
terms with each other; nay, we know that they paid every attention to gain the
favor of the Chaldeans. Hence it is said in the Psalms,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Remember,<i> </i>O Lord, the

that nation with the Chaldeans. Nor is there a doubt but that they tried by all
means to conciliate the Chaldeans for their own interest. Hence the Prophet here
points out a sudden change, when he says that the Chaldeans would be like
eagles, who would </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>expand their
wings over Bozrah</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>We have seen
elsewhere that this was the chief city of that nation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the valiant men of Edom shall
be like the heart of a sorrowful woman</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>We have seen how great was the pride of the Idumeans. As then they thought
themselves superior in valor and counsel, and all other things, the Prophet here
shews that the <i>heart </i>of their <i>valiant </i>men would become effeminate;
for it cannot be but the hearts of men are in God&#8217;s hand. God then is
alone he who can sustain and animate us and give us firmness; and he also, when
he pleases, can debilitate our spirits; and these things he does every moment:
and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that day
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then is not expressed without reason; for God
does not only impart to every one of us what valor he pleases, but also takes
away, when he pleases, the courage which he had given. Hence it is, that the
hearts of the brave become cowardly, and also, that the most timid become
sometimes bolder than lions, even when it pleases God either to weaken or to
strengthen the hearts of men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it ought to be noticed, that no hope is given
here to the Idumeans as to any remnant. When the Prophet spoke before of other
nations, he gave them some consolation; but here he does not mitigate
God&#8217;s vengeance: he dooms the Idumeans to final ruin, without giving them
any hope; and for this reason, because God had for a long time borne with them,
and they had most wickedly abused his forbearance. He had spared them from the
time the children of Israel came up from Egypt; and when they denied a passage
to them, the children of Israel made a long circuit with great inconvenience,
that they might not touch their land. It was a singular favor shown to them. And
had they had the least drop of humanity in them, they must have acknowledged
such a kindness; on the contrary, they had ever cruelly treated their own
brethren, and never ceased to do so, though often warned. It is no wonder then
that God should now give them up to ruin, and announce predictions full of
despair. This ought to be carefully observed, so that we may learn not to make
light of God&#8217;s patience when he bears long with us, but in due time to
repent, lest when he rises for judgment he should utterly destroy us. It now
follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah speaks here of the kingdom of Syria, which
he means by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Damascus</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>where the kings, as it is well known, resided. The Syrians had been from the
beginning very hostile to the Israelites; and histories, well known, record that
they had continual wars for many years. At length the kings of Israel
confederated with the Syrians for the purpose of attacking their brethren the
Jews. Hence it was, that the Syrians caused great troubles to the Jews, and were
friends to the Israelites until both kingdoms were subverted by the Chaldeans.
It is hence probable that this prophecy was announced while the kingdom was yet
standing, or at least before its final overthrow; for it was much weakened
before it was wholly cut off, as it has been stated elsewhere.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was necessary to make this preface, in order that
we might know the design of God in proclaiming this prophecy against the
Syrians, even because they had been from the beginning enemies to the
Israelites, and also, because they had united their strength with them for the
purpose of oppressing the Jews. They had therefore always been like the fans of
the Devil in the work of consuming the church of God. God then shews here that
the calamity which awaited them, was a just reward for the impious cruelty which
they had exercised towards the chosen people. This we must bear in
mind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hamath is
confounded</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>this is considered to have
been Antioch in Syria. There were many celebrated cities of this name; but
Hamath towards Cilicia was the most renowned. He then says that the city
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hamath</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>that is, Antioch, was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ashamed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>as well as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Arpad</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>which was also an opulent city. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because they heard a bad
report</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or an adverse rumor. By these
words he intimates that the kingdom of Syria would be terrified by a report
only. No one could have thought such a thing, for when they had united
themselves with the Israelites, they thought that they had power enough to drive
away their enemies. As then they supposed themselves to be thus strong, so as to
be beyond danger, the Prophet derides their confidence, and says that they would
be so terrified by mere report, that they would be ashamed as though conquered
by enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>would be
melted</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">gwm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mug</i>,<i> </i>means to be dissolved or melted. But there is here a
different reading; many copies have
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hgad
&#181;yb</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>beim dage</i>,<i> </i>connected with
this; and they who read thus are forced to wrest the words of the Prophet. This
reading literally is, &#8220;They<i> </i>are ashamed in the sea, dread to
rest,&#8221;<i> </i>or, make to rest, &#8220;it cannot,&#8221; or could not. We
see how harsh is the expression; they, however, elicit this meaning, that these
cities would be dissolved, as he who sails on the sea and cannot through dread
make his heart tranquil. But, as I have already said, the words of the Prophet
are thus perverted. Now, if we read for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>beth</i>,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">k</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
caph</i>,<i> </i>which denotes likeness, the meaning would be very suitable,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as a sea of
dread,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or a turbulent sea (a noun in the
genitive case instead of an adjective, a common thing in Scripture) <i>which
cannot rest </i>or be still.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH42</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the general meaning of the passage, there is
not much difference; for the Prophet intends to show that the Syrians would be
like a turbulent sea, which is tossed here and there, so that the waves conflict
together. If any one prefers to refer this to sailors, the meaning would be
still materially the same. The sum of what is said then is, that as the Syrians
had been terrible to all, so they would be frightened at the mere report of war,
and so much so as to melt away and not be able to stand their ground, like the
sea, which, when a tempest rages, has no rest, but is driven in all directions.

as the kingdom of Syria had flourished, and had been eminent in wealth and

in Scripture, some sudden and unexpected evil is intended. The Prophet then no
doubt means that the ruin of Syria would be sudden; and he says this, that it
might not trust in its own power, and that others might not think her to be
beyond danger, because they saw that it was fortified by the number of its men,

regard to what is profitable. It was necessary powerfully to impress the minds
of men, when the Prophet spoke of the ruin of so great a city. Then this
astonishment includes what they call an anticipation; for it obviated a doubt
which might have prevented credit from being given to this prophecy. This might
have immediately occurred to every one, &#8220;How<i> </i>can it be that
Damascus is to perish?&#8221; Then the Prophet anticipates this, and shews, that

<div><font face="Palatino">Here God himself speaks, and declares that he would
be the author of the destruction of which Jeremiah prophesied. And he employs
the similitude of fire, because there is nothing more violent or more dreadful
than burning; for we know that the greatest cities are soon consumed and reduced
to ashes when fire begins to blaze. God then compares the destruction of the
city to burning, though no fire was applied to destroy the walls and the palaces
of the king; but the Prophet means by this metaphor, that such would be the
destruction of the city, as though it was consumed by fire. He at the same time
reminds the faithful of God&#8217;s judgment, that they might know that whatever
happened to the Syrians proceeded from his hand; because such calamities would
have availed but little, except this doctrine was also added, that just
punishments are inflicted by God on the wickedness of men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But when he speaks of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>palaces of
Ben-hadad</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he briefly points out the
cause why God would deal so severely with the Syrians. We have said already that
they had been always hostile to God&#8217;s chosen people. They first tried to
overthrow the kingdom of Israel; afterwards they confederated with the kings of
Israel, but it was for the purpose of overthrowing the kingdom of Judah; and
many were the confederacies for this end. But Ben-hadad, as we read in the first
book of Kings, grievously distressed the Israelites. We indeed learn from the
history of those times, that there were many kings of Syria who bore this name,
for it was a common name, as the kings of Egypt were called Pharaohs; and other
kings also took a popular name, as the emperors of Rome called themselves
Caesars. But we read that the last Ben-hadad was the son of Hazael, who was also
the king of Syria; and as I have said, it was not a private name. Since, then,
sacred history clearly shews that there were many who were called Ben-hadad, the
Prophet, I have no doubt, refers to the first who began to disturb and harass
the Israelites. He then points out the cause why God had determined to destroy
Damascus, for he had in his forbearance borne for a long time with the Syrians.
But when he saw that they did not repent, but on the contrary added sins to
sins, at length ascending his tribunal, he says, that the <i>fire </i>which he
would apply to the walls of Damascus, would also consume the palaces of
Ben-hadad, that is, the palaces whence so many evils had proceeded, and so much
cruelty, by which the miserable Church had been distressed. This is the meaning.

<div><font face="Palatino">There is here another prophecy added respecting the
Kedareans, who inhabited a part of Arabia. There is elsewhere mention made of
them, and it is probable that they were neighbors to the Syrians and not far
from Judea; for David complained (if he was the author of that psalm) that he
dwelt among the children of Kedar,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Woe to me, because I am compelled
to dwell in Mesech and with the children of Kedar,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19C005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
120:5)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whoever, then, composed that psalm, it is a probable
conjecture that the Kedareans, though not contiguous to Judea, were not yet far
distant; and we have said that they were the inhabitants of Arabia. And the
Prophet adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the children of
Kedem</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>so some render the word, as
though it were the name of a nation; and Moses tells us that Kedem was one of
the sons of Ishmael. It may be that for this reason Jeremiah joined this people
to the Kedareans,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;012513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
25:13-15.) But I am, however, inclined to the opinion, that he mentions here
<i>the children of the East</i>,<i> </i>that is, with respect to Judea; not that
they were nigh the Persians or other oriental nations, but he only points out a
land to the east of Judea.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But why God took vengeance on that people, the cause
is not expressed. It may yet have been that they formerly had much injured the
Israelites; God therefore having long spared them at length appeared as their
severe judge. And though the reason was unknown, yet it did good to the Jews to
know, that God&#8217;s hand was extended to every part of the world to execute
vengeance; for they might have hence concluded that they were justly punished,
because they had rebelled against God; for we know that a servant who willfully
and disdainfully disobeys his master, deserves double punishment.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;421247&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
12:47) When the Jews then saw that these barbarians, who were like wild beasts,
could not escape God&#8217;s vengeance, they might have thought within
themselves how just must have been God&#8217;s judgments executed on them, who
had knowingly and willfully despised him. This then was one of the benefits to
be derived from this prophecy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And then, as we have elsewhere said, this general
rule ought to be borne in mind, that when changes happen in the world, it is
necessary, as men&#8217;s thoughts and feelings are evanescent, that this
warning should be given, that God so rules in all these changes, that chance has
no place in them. For when calamities, like a deluge, spread over the whole
world, then we think, as it has been stated, that such a confusion happens by
chance, and without any cause. For when God afflicts some portion, the
difference may lead us to some reflection, &#8212; &#8220;One part is afflicted
and another escapes;&#8221; but when evils overwhelm the whole world, then,
there being no difference, we think that all things are in a state of confusion,
nor can we collect our thoughts so as to know, that God so takes vengeance on
all, that he yet regulates his judgments, as it is right, according to his
infinite and incomprehensible wisdom and justice. As then this adjustment which
God makes, as to his judgments, is not evident to the mind and perception of
men, it was necessary, when God was at the same time fulminating through the
whole world, that the Jews should be reminded to be ever attentive to the
operations of his hand. They saw themselves ruined, they saw the same thing
happening to the Egyptians and to all other contiguous nations; at length
Assyria was to have its turn, then Chaldea, and afterwards the Medians and
Persians. As then no part was to remain untouched, who would not have thought
that all things revolved, as it were, through blind and uncertain fate? God,
therefore, did not, without reason, forewarn the faithful, lest they should
think, that in so great vicissitudes and violent changes, all things were
indiscriminately mixed together, but that they might know that God, from heaven,
regulated and overruled all these confusions. This is the reason why the
Prophets so particularly spoke of the calamities of all
nations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us come now to the Kedareans:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To
Kedar</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and the kingdoms of
Hazor</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>These kingdoms, no doubt,
included a large country, for it is hardly credible that Hazor was the name of a
city; for who would have said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the kingdoms of
Hazor</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>had it been only the name of a
city? It is, indeed, certain, that there was a city of this name, as it is
mentioned by Joshua. But here it means a large region, contiguous to the
Kedareans. And he says that all these nations had been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>smitten by
Nebuchadnezzar</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>because these barbarous
men were probably but little known to the Jews. It must yet be observed, that
they had not been as yet smitten by Nebuchadnezzar, that is, at the time the
Prophet spoke of their destruction. But Jeremiah spoke thus, in order to confirm
his prophecy, as though he had said, that what many disregarded, and even
treated with disdain, was at length really fulfilled. For when he threatened
ruin to these remote nations, it is probable that he was derided by his own
people; and hence he says, that he had not spoken in vain, but that by the event
itself his vocation was proved, because these were smitten as he had
predicted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this is the prophecy,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Arise ye, ascend against Kedar,
and destroy the children of the
East</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH45</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here the Prophet speaks of the
Babylonians, and in the person of God, as his herald. And we have said that
God&#8217;s servants commanded and ordered what was future with supreme
authority, in order to gain more reverence and honor to their words or doctrine.
For prophecies were despised by ungodly men, and they insultingly said, that
they were only words. Hence the servants of God, to show that their words had
accomplishment connected with them, assumed the person of God. Thus they boldly
commanded the greatest kings, as Jeremiah does here, <i>Arise ye</i>;<i> </i>for
whom does he here address? the king of Babylon, that greatest of monarchs, and
also the Assyrians as well as the Chaldeans: and he commanded them to <i>arise
</i>and to <i>ascend</i>,<i> </i>as though he had them ready for his service,
even because he did not speak except by God&#8217;s command.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And such mode of speaking ought to be especially
observed, that we may learn to embrace whatever is announced in God&#8217;s
name, as though the thing itself were already before our eyes, and that we may
also know that the power of the whole world, is in such a way under God&#8217;s
control, that all the kingdoms of the earth are ready to fulfill his word. When,
therefore, God himself speaks, we ought so to regard the efficacy of his word,
as though heaven and earth were ready to obey and to fulfill what he has
commanded. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, in speaking of tents and curtains, had
regard to the way of living adopted by that nation; for the Arabs, we know,
dwelt in cabins and tents, as they do at this day, and they were also shepherds.
They had no cultivated fields, but led their flocks through the deserts; and
they had a great number of camels. This is the reason why the Prophet mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tents, curtains, camels, and
flocks</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>while speaking of the Kedareans;
for they dwelt not in a fertile country, they possessed no arable lands, nor had
they much other wealth, neither cities nor palaces. The sum of what is said is,
that the Kedareans were doomed to destruction, and were therefore exposed as a
prey to their enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as this was difficult to be believed, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall cry to them, Terror on
every side</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>By these words the Prophet
means, that there would be so much dread, that all would suffer their
possessions to be plundered, not daring to make any resistance, because terror
on every side would lay hold on them. They who read, &#8220;They shall call them
terror on every side,&#8221; think that this is said metaphorically of the
soldiers, as they were terrible. Some also say, &#8220;The king of Babylon shall
call&#8221; or summon &#8220;terror on every side against them.&#8221; But the
former explanation is the most probable, that when enemies called or cried out,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Terror,
terror</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>as conquerors, they would
overcome them by their voice alone. This is, as I think, the real meaning of the

had resolved to destroy them. By <i>counsel </i>and <i>thought </i>or purpose,
the Prophet means the secret means by which he subdued the people when they
feared no such thing. As then these shepherds lived securely on their mountains,
Nebuchadnezzar prepared his forces, and divided them; and thus were these taken
by his counsel and craft less than by strength. What the Prophet says here of
the <i>counsel </i>and <i>device </i>of Nebuchadnezzar is not superfluous,
because he indirectly touched on the sloth of that nation, who exercised no
vigilance and thought, their desert being a sufficient cover to them. As then
they thus lived securely, the Prophet here reminds them that they would have to
do with a cunning enemy, who would contrive and form his counsels at home, and
then would execute in due time what he had long meditated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But a parenthesis follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Deep have they

adversative particle must be considered as understood,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though deep have they made to
dwell;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for without this exception the
prophecy would have been less credible. For Kedareans were on every side
fortified, because no one envied them, as they were not only frugal men, but
also barbarous and contented with an austere and wretched living. As then they
thought themselves thus safe, some one might have raised this objection and
said, &#8220;Why<i> </i>dost thou bid them to flee? wherefore should they flee?
for there is no one so foolish as to attack them.&#8221; So also the Scythians
laughed at Alexander when he attacked them. &#8220;What is your object? you
think that you have to do with men; we are wild beasts: and then if you seek
wealth and riches, you will not find them with us.&#8221; Such then was the
state of those nations mentioned here. When, therefore, the Prophet bids them to
flee, because Nebuchadnezzar would suddenly attack them, he at the same time
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though deep have they made
to dwell</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH46</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He had before used this mode of
speaking: to make deep to dwell, means to have a safe and hidden standing,
remote from all danger. They are then said to be deep in their dwellings who
dwell in fortified cities, or who inhabit deserts, or who are hid in some poor
country, as the Kedareans and their neighbors. But the Prophet says, that this
would not prevent the Babylonians from invading their land, and taking
possession of it. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

pride of the Kedareans is denoted, because they would not protect themselves in
the usual way, and regarded gates and bars as nothing. But the Prophet&#8217;s
meaning is different, that as they were barbarians and shepherds and beyond the
reach of envy, they thought that no enemy would ever come to them. For what are
the causes of wars but avarice and ambition? and who would wish to rule over
barbarous nations living on their mountains? and then wealth cannot be found in
a wild uncultivated country. As then the Kedareans were such, the Prophet says
that they <i>dwelt securely</i>,<i> </i>though they were not fortified by gates
and bars, but lived alone. He then says that they lived alone, not because they
thought much of themselves as being solitary, and regarded themselves as being
above kings &#8212; for solitude often produces pride and obstinacy; but the
meaning of the Prophet, as I have said, is quite different, even because the
Kedareans thought that they had no need of friends and assistants, because they
depended not on their neighbors for aid, but were contented<i> </i>with their
own deserts. And at the same time they did not think that any enemy would
disturb them, as there was no cause and no occasion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive again why the Prophet says, that
they <i>made deep to dwell</i>,<i> </i>that is, that they had their dwelling
deep, even because poverty and the absence of all riches were to them a sort of
safe fortress: as they had no splendor and no dignity, they thought themselves
exempt from the common lot of other men. But nevertheless he says that the
Chaldeans would come and plunder them of what they had. It follows, &#8212;

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-EIGHTH.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the verse we read yesterday, Jeremiah again
repeated that the Kedareans would be so plundered by their enemies that nothing
would remain for them. He therefore speaks again of camels and of cattle: he
says that the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>abundance of
cattle</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>camels</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>would be for a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spoil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>plunder</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>But why he names camels and cattle rather than fields and vineyards, I
briefly explained yesterday. For when a fertile country is the subject, whether
abounding in corn or in vines, the Prophets spoke of such possessions; but when,
as now, a reference is made to a country abounding in cattle and also
mountainous, the Prophet speaks only of camels and of cattle; for the mode of
living in that nation, as it has been stated, was austere and hard, and almost
below the condition of man. When food for their cattle failed them, they went
elsewhere, and carried in their waggons all their furniture.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It now follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>1 will disperse them to every
wind</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Here Jeremiah predicts the
scattering of that nation. It sometimes happens that a country is plundered by
enemies, when yet the inhabitants, stripped of their goods, remain there and
live in poverty. But together with poverty, Jeremiah declares that there would
be no ordinary exile, for the words are emphatical,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will scatter them to every
wind</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>There is here an implied contrast
between that people and chaff; for as the chaff is carried away in all
directions by blasts of wind, so would be, as Jeremiah shews, the scattering of
that people. And he mentions also
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the utmost
corners</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hap
yxwxq</font><font face="Palatino">,<i> kotsutsi pae</i>.<i> Jerome </i>usually
renders the words, &#8220;shorn<i> </i>of hair,&#8221; but very improperly; for
there is no reason why the other people mentioned before should be thus called;
for in Jeremiah 7 and Jeremiah 25 Jeremiah did not speak of the Kedareans, and
yet he called many nations </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hap
yxwxq</font><font face="Palatino"> <i>kotsutsi pae</i>.<i> </i>The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#8776;xq</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>kotsets</i>,<i> </i>whence this word comes, means to cut off; and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hap</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>pae</i>,<i> </i>signifies the extremity of anything. This phrase then is the
same as though he mentioned those bordered by an extremity or a corner. And this
is most suitable to this passage; for it was not probable that they who dwelt in
recesses should be thus scattered. When any wealthy country is plundered by
enemies, they flee here and there in all directions; for instance, were a part
of Italy laid waste, they would flee to those parts who could receive fugitives;
but when a nation dwells in an extreme corner, where could it betake itself,
when routed by enemies? The Prophet therefore enhances the misery of exile when
he says, that people at the extremities would become fugitives, so as to be
scattered through all parts of the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and from all its sides will I
bring their destruction.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He confirms the
same thing; for when an evil enters on one side, neighbors may assist; but when
calamity urges on every side, miserable men must then of necessity be scattered;
and they must seek some distant exile, as there is no part that can show them
hospitality. All this then refers to their scattering. It afterwards follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Jeremiah concludes his prophecy concerning the
Kedareans; he says that their land would be deserted. The Prophets often make
use of this way of speaking, that the land, deserted by its inhabitants, would
become the habitation of dragons. And this is more grievous than when the land
remains empty; for when dragons succeed men, it is a dreadful thing. Hence, that
God&#8217;s judgment might produce more impression on men&#8217;s feelings, the
Prophets often declare that a deserted place would become the dwelling of
dragons. He adds what imports the same thing,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A waste shall it be for an
age</i></font><font face="Palatino">:<i> </i>but
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;lw[</font><font face="Palatino">,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not dwell there shall a man, nor
live there shall a son of man</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>There
seems indeed to be a superfluity of words, for it would have been sufficient in
one sentence to say, that the land would be deserted and not inhabited. But he
first assigns it to dragons: then he adds that it would be a waste or solitude;
and lastly, he says that no one would dwell there, and not only so, but having
mentioned <i>man</i>,<i> </i>he adds the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>son of
man</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Some indeed think that by <i>man

common people, the multitude. But as we have said elsewhere, this is too
refined. It is a repetition which increases the effect, though in the second
clause he speaks more generally and expresses the thing more clearly, as though
he had said, that no one of the human race would become an inhabitant of that
land.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fH48</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

<div><font face="Palatino">By Elam some interpreters understand Persia, and it
is the most common opinion. I however think that the Elamites were not the same
with the Persians; I should rather say that they were the Parthians, were it not
that Luke, in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
2:9, makes them a distinct people from the Parthians. At the same time it is not
right, as it seems to me, to regard the Persians as generally designated by
Elam; for the Persians were remote from the Jews, and the Jews never received
any injury from that people. There was therefore no reason why the Prophet
should denounce punishment on them. The country of Elymais was known as
bordering on the Medes, and contiguous to the Persians. But that people must
have joined the Assyrians and Chaldeans against the Jews. As then the
Babylonians had them as auxiliaries, it was God&#8217;s purpose to avenge the
injury done to his people. Besides, Pliny also speaks of Elamites as being
contiguous to the Nabatheans; but they were occupying,<i> </i>as it were, the
middle place between Persia and Judea. They were indeed, as he shews elsewhere,
a maritime people; for he speaks often of Elymais, but names the Elamites only
once.<i> </i>However this may have been, they were orientals as the Persians
were, but not so far from Judea; and as they were, at it has been said, near the
Medes, the probability is that they joined themselves with the enemies of the
Church, when Nebuchadnezzar drew with him the vast forces which he had
everywhere gathered, that he might extend his dominion far and wide; for we
shall see in what follows that God was grievously displeased with the
Elamites.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH49</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We hence conclude that they were very
hostile to the chosen people, whose cause God here undertakes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This much as to the name: when, therefore, Jeremiah
speaks here of the Elamites, let us know that a particular nation is referred
to, and one distinct from the Persians, and then that this nation assisted the
Chaldeans in oppressing the Jews. Let us now see what the Prophet declares
respecting them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, first, that this word came to him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the beginning of the reign of
Zedekiah</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Nebuchadnezzar, then, greatly
harassed the Jews, while yet they remained in their obstinacy; and it is
probable that the Elamites formed a part of the Chaldean army. When, therefore,
the Jews considered how various were their enemies, and when they did not expect
that they would ever be punished, it was a trial that must have greatly
distressed the minds of the godly. What Jeremiah then declared, no one could
have thought of, that is, that the Elamites would not escape unpunished, because
they so furiously attacked the chosen people under the banner of King
Nebuchadnezzar. This, then, was the reason why the Prophet specified the time:
<i>this word</i>,<i> </i>then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>came in the beginning of the
reign of Zedekiah</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then God, in the first place, declares that he would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>break the bow of
Elam</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The Parthians and other Orientals,
we know, were very skillful archers; for every nation possesses its own peculiar
excellency in connection with war. Some excel in the use of one kind of weapons,
and others in the use of another kind. Formerly light infantry were in high
repute among the Italians; the Gauls excelled in mailed horsemen. Though, now,
all things are changed, yet still every nation differs as to its peculiar art in
war. Now historians testify that the Orientals were very skillful in the use of
the bow and arrow. It is, then, no wonder that the Prophet speaks of the <i>bow
</i>of this people, and calls it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the chief part of their
strength</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>as they excelled in this sort
of fighting. The Parthians were indeed much dreaded by the Romans; they
pretended to flee, and then they turned back and made an impetuous attack on
their enemies. They<i> </i>had also arrows dipped in poison. By these means
they<i> </i>conquered large armies. For the Romans laid by their darts and
fought hand in hand, and carried on a standing fight, so to speak; but when the
Parthians kept discharging their arrows, they almost always fought
unsuccessfully with them. I refer to this, that we may know that the bow was not
without reason called the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>chief
of their might</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>for it was by it that
they were superior to other nations, though they could not fight hand in hand

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>four

moment put in motion whenever it pleases God; and when Scripture extols the
power of God, it does not without reason refer to the winds; for it is not a
small miracle when the whole world is on a sudden put in motion. It is now
tranquil, and then in half an hour the winds rise and conflict together in mid
air. And God alludes to what is usual in nature: as then he suddenly rouses up
winds which make, as it were, the whole world to shake and tremble; so he says
he would raise up winds from the four ends of the world. But he speaks
metaphorically; by winds he understands enemies, who would on all sides unite
their powers to oppress the Elamites.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
bring</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he says, on <i>Elam
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the four winds from the four
quarters </i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>of the world</i>.<i> </i>By the
last words he expresses more clearly what I have just said, that God alludes to
that formidable power which is daily presented to our eyes in nature. As, then,
a sudden change disturbs the whole earth when winds arise, so God declares that
he would rouse up four winds from the four quarters of the heavens. And he calls
them the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>quarters of the
heavens</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>for though the winds arise from
the earth, yet their blowing is not perceived until they ascend into mid air:
and though sometimes they seem to be formed above the clouds, they yet arise
from the earth; for the origin of the wind is cold and dry
exhalation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand the reason why the Prophet speaks
of the winds. There is yet no doubt but that he denotes some enemies by the four
winds; but this prophecy was not fulfilled as long as the Persian monarchy ruled
and flourished. It is, then, probable that the destruction denounced by the
Prophet took place many ages after, even when the soldiers of Alexander
contended<i> </i>about the supremacy; for we know how grievously distressed were
all the Orientals when Alexander made an irruption into those countries. It was,
indeed, a horrible tempest. But as he enjoyed the empire of the east but for a
short time, what is said by the Prophet here was not then fulfilled. But those
countries were afterwards so miserable, torn by intestine wars, that the Prophet
does not without reason compare those contrary and opposite movements to four
winds; for never has there been a fiercer emulation between enemies, and each of
them had strong armies. Hence,<i> </i>then, it was, that that land was not
oppressed by one enemy, but exposed to various and almost innumerable
calamities. This is the reason that leads me to interpret this prophecy as
fulfilled in the calamities which followed the death of Alexander the
Great.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will scatter
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to these four
winds</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>that is, as one wind breaks out
at one time, and another at another time, so the Elamites shall flee here and
there. For no one ruled long peaceably<i> </i>in the East, till almost all the
soldiers of Alexander were consumed by mutual slaughters. Then Seleucus<i>
</i>obtained Syria, and exercised<i> </i>the cruelest<i> </i>tyranny. But, as I
have said, before Seleucus obtained peace and security, the whole of that part
of the world had been inundated with blood. This is the reason why the Prophet
says that the Elamites would be scattered to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>these four
winds</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The end of the verse remains:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and there shall be no nation to
which some of the fugitives from Elam shall not
come</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>We cannot, certainly, show from
histories when this was fulfilled which the Prophet now says; but it is probable
that that people were scattered at the time when the chiefs contended about the
supremacy, that is, those who obtained power under Alexander. At the same time
there would be nothing unreasonable were we to say that the Prophet spoke
hyperbolically; and no doubt he exceeds due limits when he says &#8220;There
shall be no nation to which some of the fugitives from Elam shall not
come.&#8221; He indeed understands all the neighboring nations. But it may also
have been that they did not flee to the Asiatics, but rather departed towards
the Persian sea or to the Indies. We have already stated why the servants of God
sometimes introduced hyperbolical expressions into their teaching, even because
they had to do with men who were slow and stupid, who would not hear God when
speaking in a simple manner, and could hardly be moved when he thundered. It now

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse especially shews that the Elamites were of
the number of those who had inhumanly raged against God&#8217;s people, for he
did not without reason set forth the severity of his vengeance towards them. We
must, then, bear in mind that the Elamites had been among the chief of
God&#8217;s enemies, or at least had been in no ordinary way cruel, delighting
in slaughters. Hence he says,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> I
will dismay</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or affright, etc. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ttj</font><font face="Palatino">,

rendered, &#8220;I will break.&#8221; They who render it &#8220;I will lay
prostrate,&#8221; do not seem to know the difference between
<i>consternere</i>,<i> </i>to lay prostrate, and <i>consternare</i>,<i> </i>to
dismay. But the most suitable meaning is, that God would terrify the Elamites,
for he had spoken before of their flight and exile.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then mentions the cause of their dread, even
because <i>God </i>would dismay them and frighten them before their enemies, so
that they would not be able to stand before them. By these words he intimates,
that however warlike the Elamites were, they yet would not stand their ground
when it seemed good to God to render to them their reward, for in his hand are
the hearts of men. Though, then, the Elamites were brave, yet the Prophet
declares that they would be so faint-hearted
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>at the sight of
enemies</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>as immediately to flee away,

<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will send the sword after

would not be content with terrifying them, but that when they began to flee, he
would take them, because he would follow them, that is, urge on their enemies.
And it ought ever to be observed, that what proceeds from men is ascribed to
God, because men, however little they may think of it, yet execute his purpose,
and are not only the proclaimers of his wrath, but also the instruments of
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the evil of the indignation of
his wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH50</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This mode of speaking seems
indeed harsh; but we have elsewhere stated, that the Prophets did not without
reason join together these words, which appear somewhat harsh. Now wrath does
not in a strict sense belong to God, for no feelings of this kind appertain to
him. But when heat of wrath or indignation is mentioned, it doubles its
vehemence in order to shake off the torpor of men, who would otherwise, as I
lately said, be wholly insensible and indifferent. In short, by <i>indignation
</i>the Prophet means no other thing than that vengeance is dreadful, and ought
to astonish all mortals, so that they ought to fall down immediately as it were
lifeless, as soon as they hear that God is displeased with them. In the meantime
he shews what I have stated, that God was grievously offended with that people
whom he threatens with extreme punishment, for he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>until I shall have consumed
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>We see what I have said, that this
people were not slightly chastised, according to what has been mentioned of
others: it hence follows that their wickedness had been very atrocious. The two
clauses seem however to be inconsistent, &#8212; that God would scatter the
Elamites through all nations, &#8212; and that he would consume them, for
dispersion and consumption widely differ. But consumption refers to the body of
the nation or to its name, as though he had said, that no Elamites would
survive, because they would be merged in other nations, and disappear like
chaff. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

place. But sometimes, as I have already said, God is said to reign in the midst
of his enemies, as we have seen respecting the Egyptians. He then erected his
throne when he executed his recorded judgment on the Elamites, for though the
Elamites were blind, yet God&#8217;s power was made really evident, and by the
effect he proved that he was the King of that people whose wickedness he
punished with so much severity. In short, as God is said to be silent, to sleep,
or to lie down, when he does not execute his vengeance; so in this place he is

</i>If it be asked when this was fulfilled, doubtless there has not been a
restoration of that nation recorded in history. But the Prophet no doubt gives
here a hope to the Elamites, which he gave before to other nations, even that
they should be united again under Christ as their head. Though then the Elamites
were not afterwards known, yet they have found out that this was not said in
vain; nor does the Holy Spirit without reason mention them by the mouth of Luke
among others who were converted to Christ.

then was the time of which Jeremiah had prophesied, when he said that the
Elamites would again be gathered together, that they might not be perpetually
captives. And though they might not have then returned into their own country,
yet it was a condition far better and more desirable when they obtained a name

<div><font face="Palatino">Our Prophet has been hitherto speaking of neighboring
nations who had cruelly harassed the chosen people; and it was some consolation
when the children of Abraham understood that God undertook their cause and would
be the avenger of those wrongs which they had suffered. But this of itself would
have been no great consolation, yea, it might have been viewed as nothing by
many, while there was no hope of restoration; for it would have been but a small
consolation to have others as associates in misery. If, indeed, Jeremiah had
only taught that none of the nations who had troubled God&#8217;s Church would
escape unpunished, the Jews might have raised an objection, and said, that they
were not freed from their own calamities, because the monarchy of Babylon still
flourished, and that they were buried as it were in a perpetual grave. It was
therefore necessary that what we read here should be predicted. And though this
prophecy is given last, we ought to notice that the Prophet had from the
beginning expressly spoken, as we have seen, of the calamity and destruction of
Babylon. But this prophecy is given as the conclusion of the book, to mitigate
the sorrow of the miserable exiles; for it was no small relief to them to hear
that the tyranny by which they were oppressed, and under which they did live as
it were a lifeless life, would not be perpetual. We now then understand why the
Prophet spoke of the Babylonians and of their destruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But a longer preface would be superfluous, because
those acquainted with Scripture well know that the Jews were at length so
reduced by the Babylonians that their very name seemed to have been obliterated.
As then they were reduced to such extremities, it is no wonder that the Prophet
here affirms that the Babylonians would be at length punished, and that not only
that God might show himself to be the avenger of wickedness, but also that the
miserable exiles might know that they were not wholly repudiated, but on the
contrary that God had a care for their salvation. We now perceive the design of
this prophecy.</font><br></div>

manner that he did not bring forward what he himself had invented, but that God
was the author of this prophecy. He at the same time declares that he was
God&#8217;s minister; for God did not descend from heaven whenever it pleased
him to reveal his favor to the Jews, but, as it is said in Deuteronomy, he was
wont to speak by his servants.

<div><font face="Palatino">He predicts the ruin of Babylon, not in simple words,
for nothing seemed then more unreasonable than to announce the things which God
at length proved by the effect. As Babylon was then the metropolis of the East,
no one could have thought that it would ever be possessed by a foreign power. No
one could have thought of the Persians, for they were far off. As to the Medes,
who were nearer, they were, as we know, sunk in their own luxuries, and were
deemed but half men. As then there was so much effeminacy in the Medes, and as
the Persians were so far off and inclosed in their own mountains, Babylon
peaceably enjoyed the empire of the whole eastern world. This, then, is the
reason why the Prophet expresses at large what he might have set forth in a very
few words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Tell</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>publish</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>To what purpose is such a heap of words? even that the faithful might learn
to raise up their thoughts above the world, and to look for that which was then,
according to the judgment of all, incredible. This confidence shews that
Jeremiah did not, in vain, foretell what he states; but he thundered as it were
from heaven, knowing whence he derived this prophecy. And his proclamation was
this, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Babylon is taken, Bel is
confounded, and Merodach is broken</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>I
know not why some think that Merodach was an idol: for as to Bel, we know that
the Babylonians trusted in that god, or rather in that figment. But the Prophet
mentions here evidently the name of a king well known to the Jews, in order to
show that Babylon, with all its defences and its wealth, was already devoted to
destruction: for we know that men look partly to some god, and partly to human
or temporal means. So the Babylonians boasted that they were under the
protection of Bel, and dared proudly to set up this idol in opposition to the
only true God, as the unbelieving do; and then in the second place, they were
inebriated with confidence in their own power: and hypocrisy ever rules in the
unbelieving, so that they arrogate to themselves much more than what they
ascribe to their idols. It is then the same thing as though he had said, that
Babylon was taken, that Bel was confounded, and that the kingdom was broken, or
broken in pieces.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fH51</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The name
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Merodach</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>as I have said, was well known among the Jews, and mention is made of a
father and of a son of this name, by Isaiah and in sacred history.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;233901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
39:1;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;122012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 20:12.) It is no wonder, then, that the Prophet should name this king,
though dead, on account of the esteem in which he was held, as we have seen in
the case<i> </i>of the kingdom of Syria, he mentioned Ben-hadad, though no one
supposes that he was then alive; but as Ben-hadad distinguished himself above
other kings of Syria, the Prophet introduced his name. For the same reason, in
my opinion, he names Merodach here.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum of the whole is, that though Babylon thought
itself safe and secure through the help of its idol, and also through its wealth
and warlike power, and through other defences, yet its confidence would become
vain and empty, for God would bring to shame its idol and destroy its king. He
again returned to the idols, and not without reason; for he thus called the
attention of his own nation to the only true God, and also reminded them how
detestable was the idolatry which then prevailed among the Chaldeans. And it was
necessary to set this doctrine before the Jews, and to impress it on them, that
they might not abandon themselves to the superstitions of heathens, as it
happened. But the Prophet designedly spoke of images and idols, that the Jews
might know that it was the only true God who had adopted them, and that thus
they might acquiesce in his power, and know that those were only vain fictions
which were much made of through the whole world by the heathens and unbelieving.

<div><font face="Palatino">Let what I have before said be borne in mind, that
the Prophet makes use of many words in describing the ruin of Babylon; for it
was not enough to predict what was to be; but as weak minds vacillated, it was
necessary to add a confirmation. After having then spoken of the power of
Babylon and its idols, he now points out the way in which it was to be destroyed
&#8212; a nation would come from the north, that is, with reference to Chaldea.
And he means the Medes and Persians, as interpreters commonly think; and this is
probable, because he afterwards adds that the Jews would then return. As then
Jeremiah connects these two things together, the destruction of Babylon and the
restoration of God&#8217;s Church, it is probable that he refers here to the
Medes and Persians. If, at the same time, we more narrowly view things, there is
no doubt but that this prophecy extends further, and this will appear more
evident as we proceed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He simply says now that a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>would </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>come from the
north</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>which would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>turn the land to a
waste</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This clause shews that this
prophecy could not be fitly confined to the time when Babylon was taken by
Cyrus; for we know that it was betrayed by two Satraps during a siege; and that
it was at a time when a feast was held, as though there was peace and security,
as Daniel testifies, with whom heathen writers agree. Now Xenophon testifies
that Cyrus exercised great forbearance<i> </i>and humanity, and that he used his
victory with such moderation, that Babylon seemed as though it had not been
taken. It had, indeed, changed masters, but such was the change that the
citizens readily submitted to it. But it was afterwards more hardly dealt with,
when Darius recovered it by the aid of Zopyrus; for Babylon had revolted from
the Persians, and shook off the yoke. Darius having in vain stormed it, at
length recovered it by the help of one man; for Zopyrus, having cut off his
nose, and mutilated his ears and his face, pretended, in this deformed manner,
to be a fugitive, and complained of the cruelty and barbarity of his king, with
whom yet he was most intimate. The city was soon afterwards taken by
treachery<i> </i>in the night. Then about four thousand of the Persians were
hung in the middle of the Forum, nor did Darius spare the people. The Prophet
then seems to include this second destruction when he predicted that the whole
land would be made desolate. Nor ought this to be deemed unreasonable, for the
Prophets so spoke of God&#8217;s judgments, that they extended what they said
further than to the commencement,<i> </i>as was the case in the present
instance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When, therefore, Babylon was taken by the Persians,
it received the yoke; and she which ruled over all other nations, was reduced to
a state of servitude. For the Persians, as it is well known, were very inhuman,
and Isaiah describes them so at large. In the meantime, the city, as I have
said, retained its external appearance. The citizens were robbed of their gold
and silver, and of their precious things, and were under the necessity of
serving strangers: this was bitter to them. But when Darius punished their
perfidy and hung so many of the chief men, about four thousand, and also shed
indiscriminately the blood of the people, and subjected the city itself to the
plunder of his soldiers, then doubtless what the Prophet says here was more
fully accomplished. It was yet God&#8217;s purpose to give only a prelude of his
vengeance, when he made the Babylonians subject to the Medes and Persians. It
now follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now explains more clearly the purpose of
God, that in punishing so severely the Chaldeans, his object was to provide for
the safety of his Church. For had Jeremiah spoken only of vengeance, the Jews
might have still raised an objection and said, &#8220;It will not profit us at
all, that God should be a severe judge towards our enemies, if we are to remain
under their tyranny.&#8221;<i> </i>Then the Prophet shews that the destruction
of Babylon would be connected with the deliverance of the chosen people; and
thus he points out, as it were by the finger, the reason why Babylon was to be
destroyed, even for the sake of the chosen people, so that the miserable exiles
may take courage, and not doubt but that God would at length be propitious, as
Jeremiah had testified to them, having, as we have seen, prefixed the term of
seventy years. He was derided by the Jews, who had so habituated themselves to
hardness of heart, that they counted as nothing, or at least regarded as fables,
all the reproofs and threatenings of God, and also gave heed, as we have seen,
to the flatteries of the false prophets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah now promises that God would be their
liberator after the time of exile had passed, of which he had spoken. Thus we
perceive the design of this passage, in which the Prophet, after having referred
to the destruction of Babylon, makes a sudden transition, and refers to
God&#8217;s mercy, which he would show to the Jews after they had suffered a
just punishment: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In those
days</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and at that time &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino">he adds the appointed time, that the Jews might
not doubt but that the Chaldeans would be subdued, because God had appointed
them to destruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come shall the children of
Israel, they and the children of Judah
together</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>and he says this, that they
might still suspend their desires. He commends here the greatness of God&#8217;s
favor, because the condition of the Church would be better after the exile than
it was before. The ten tribes, as we know, had separated from the kingdom of
Judah; and that separation was as it were the tearing asunder of the body. For
God had adopted the seed of Abraham for this end, that they might be one body
under one head; but they willfully made a defection, so that both kingdoms
became mutilated. The kingdom of Israel became indeed accursed, for it had
separated from the family of David, and this separation was in a manner an
impious denial of God. As then the children of Israel had alienated themselves
from the Church, and the kingdom of the ten tribes had become spurious, their
condition was doubtless miserable (though the Jews as well as the Israelites
were alike inebriated with their own lusts).</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what does our Prophet now say? They shall return
together, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the children of Israel
and the children of Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>that is, God
will not only gather the dispersed, but will also apply such a remedy, that
there will no more be any separation; but that on the contrary a brotherly
concord will prevail between the ten tribes and the tribe of Judah, when God
shall restore them again to himself. We now then perceive what the Prophet had
in view: there is, indeed, here an implied comparison between their former state
and that which they could yet hardly hope for, after their return from exile;
for there is nothing better than brotherly concord, as it is said in the
Psalms,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;How<i> </i>good and how pleasant

separation. The Prophet says now, that they<i> </i>would <i>come

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Going<i> </i>they shall go, and
weep as those who sow; but coming they shall come with joy, carrying their
handfuls.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19C606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
126:6)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet says here, that they<i> </i>shall <i>come
with tears</i>.<i> </i>How can these two things be consistent? even because
weeping may be taken for that which flows from joy or from admiration; for we
know that tears gush out not only through sorrow, but also through rejoicing;
and further, when anything unexpected happens, tears will flow from our eyes.<i>
</i>We can then take the Prophet&#8217;s words in this sense, that they would
come weeping, because they<i> </i>would then find God merciful to them. But it
is better to regard sorrow as simply meant; and the two things may be thus
reconciled, &#8212; that the Jews would come with joy, and also with sorrow, not
only because the memory of their exile could not be immediately obliterated from
their minds, but because it behooved them to remember their sins: they saw the
Temple overthrown, the land wasted &#8212; sights sufficient to draw tears a
hundred times from the hardest. On one side there were reasons for joy; and on
the other, reasons for tears. We know that there were tears shed; for the
Prophet Haggai expressly tells us, that the old men, who had seen the former
Temple,<i> </i>were much cast down, because there was then no such glory as they
had seen. (Haggai 2.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">However this may have been, the Prophet means, that
though the return would not be without many troubles, yet<i> </i>the Jews<i>
</i>would come;<i> coming</i>,<i> </i>he says, they shall <i>come</i>,<i>
</i>that is, going they shall go, <i>and weep</i>,<i> </i>as it is said in the
Psalms, that they would come through desert and dry places.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
84:6.) The meaning then is, that though the journey would be hard and laborious,
yet the Jews would return with alacrity into their own country, so that no
labors would so fatigue them as to make them to desist from their
course.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He subjoins the main thing, that they would come to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seek their
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Their change of place would have
been useless, had they not come animated with the desire of worshipping God; for
the worship had ceased during the time of exile, as it is said again in another
Psalm,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;How shall we sing songs to our
God in a foreign land?&#8221;<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D704&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
137:4)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then the Prophet here reminds them, that God&#8217;s
favor would be real and complete, because the Jews would not only return to
their own country, so as to possess it, but that they would also set up the
worship of God, and dwell as it were under his protection. It follows &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">He explains himself more at large, that they would

way</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their faces
</i></font><font face="Palatino">would be towards <i>Sion</i>,<i> </i>that they
would also exhort one another to seek God and join themselves to him by a
perpetual covenant. The Prophet includes here all the tribes, and says that the
Jews and the Israelites would not only return into their own country, to partake
of the produce of that rich and fruitful land, but that they would also render
to God the worship due to him, and then that nothing would be so vexatious to
them but that they would be able to overcome all difficulties and all
obstacles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says first, that they would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ask the way &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino">a proof of perseverance; that they would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ask the way to
Sion</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>that is, ask how they were to
proceed that they might come to Sion. By these words, the Prophet, as I have
just said, denotes their constancy and indefatigable resolution, as though he
had said, that though they journeyed through unknown lands, yea, through many
devious places, they would yet be in no way disheartened so as not to inquire of
those they met with until they came to Sion. This is one thing. Then he adds to
the same purpose, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thither their
faces</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>We indeed know, that plans are
often changed when adverse events impede us; for he who undertakes an
expedition, when he sees his course very difficult, turns back again. But the
Prophet declares here that there would be no change of mind that would cause the
Jews to relinquish their purpose of returning, because
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their faces
</i></font><font face="Palatino">would be towards
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sion</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>that is, they would turn their eyes thither, so that nothing would be able
to turn them elsewhere. There is added, in the third place, an exhortation,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come ye; and they shall join
themselves to Jehovah </i></font><font face="Palatino">their God, by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a perpetual
covenant</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Here the Prophet first shews,
that the Jews would be so encouraged as to add stimulants to one another; and
hence it is said, <i>Come ye</i>;<i> </i>and, secondly, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall
cleave</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>(there is here a change of
person) </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to Jehovah by a perpetual
covenant which shall not by oblivion be
obliterated</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH52</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He again repeats what he had said, that the exiles
would not return to their own country, that they might there only indulge
themselves, but he mentions another end, even that they might join themselves to
God. He means, in short, that God would do for them something better and more
excellent than to allure them by earthly pleasures.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must notice the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall
cleave</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>(so it is
literally</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>) to Jehovah by a
perpetual covenant</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>for there is an
implied contrast between the covenant they had made void and the new covenant
which God would make with them, of which Jeremiah spoke in Jeremiah 31.
God&#8217;s covenant was, indeed, ever inviolable; for God did not promise to be
the God of Abraham for a certain term of years; but the adoption, as Paul
testifies, remains fixed, and can never be changed.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451129&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:29.) Then on God&#8217;s part it is eternal. But as the Jews had become
covenant-breakers, that covenant is called, on this account, weak and
evanescent: and for this reason the Prophet said,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;In the last days I will make a
covenant with you, not such as I made with your fathers, for they have broken,
he said, that covenant.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243131&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
31:31, 32)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah now repeats the same thing, though more
briefly, that the Jews would return to favor with God, not only for a moment,
but that his covenant might continue and remain valid; and the way by which this
would be done is expressed in Jeremiah 21, even because God would inscribe his
law on their inward parts, and engrave it on their hearts. For it is not in
man&#8217;s power to continue so constant as that God&#8217;s covenant should
never fail; but what the Prophet omits here must be supplied from the former
passage, that when the Jews returned, God&#8217;s covenant would again become so
valid and fixed, that it would never fail, even because their hearts would be
renewed, so that they would be faithful to God, and never become apostates any
more like their fathers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds, This covenant
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall not be
forgotten</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. We </i>hence conclude, that the
perpetuity of which he speaks, was founded rather on the mere benevolence of God
than on the virtue of the people. He calls then the covenant which God would
never forget, perpetual, because he would remember his mercy towards the chosen
people; and though they were unworthy to receive such a favor, yet he would
continue perpetually his mercy towards them to the coming of Christ; for the
passage clearly shows that this prophecy cannot be otherwise explained than of
Christ&#8217;s spiritual kingdom. The Jews indeed returned to their own country,
but it was only a small number; and besides, they were harassed by many
troubles; God also visited their land with sterility, and they were lessened by
various slaughters in wars: how then came the prophets thus to extol in such
high terms the favor of God, which yet did not appear among the people? even
because they included the kingdom of Christ; for whenever they spoke of the
return of the people, they ascended, as we have said, to the chief deliverance.
I do not yet follow our interpreters, who explain these prophecies concerning
the spiritual kingdom of Christ allegorically; for simply, or as they say,
literally, ought these words to be taken, &#8212; that God would never forget
his covenant, so as to retain the Jews in the possession of the land. But this
would have been a very small thing, had not Christ come forth, in whom is
founded the real perpetuity of the covenant, because God&#8217;s covenant cannot
be separated from a state of happiness; for blessed are the people, as the
Psalmist says, to whom God shows himself to be their God.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19E415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
144:15.) Now, then, as the <i>Jews </i>were so miserable, it follows that
God&#8217;s covenant did not openly appear or was not conspicuous; we must
therefore come necessarily to Christ, as we have elsewhere seen, that this was
commonly done by the Prophets. The Prophet now enters on a new argument, &#8212;

HUNDRED AND EIGHTIETH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE, Prophet in the sixth verse compares God&#8217;s
people to lost sheep: he therefore says, that the Jews
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wandered on the
mountains</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>went from mountain to
hill</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He throws the blame on the
shepherds, by whom the miserable people had been led astray. Notwithstanding,
God does not extenuate the fault of the people; nor did he accuse the pastors as
though their wickedness and perfidy absolved the people; but on the contrary, he
commends the greatness of his own grace, that he had mercy on a flock that was
lost and without hope. We now then understand the design of the Prophet when he
thus spoke in the person of God,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My people have become lost
sheep</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and the shepherds have

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah goes on with the same subject; for he tells
us how miserable was the condition of the people until God looked on them to
relieve them from their evils. And this comparison, as I have before said, more
fully sets forth the favor of God, because he raised up his people as it were
from hell at a time when they were reduced to despair.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All who found them devoured
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, all who came in contact
with them thought them a prey. He, in short, means that they were plundered by
all who met them; and then that enemies were so far from sparing them that they
gloried in their cruelty towards them. Hence he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their enemies said, We sin not,
because they have acted wickedly against
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words the Prophet
intimates, that their enemies indulged in greater wantonness, because they
thought that what they did would not be punished. Almost the same sentiment is
found in Zechariah, where it is said,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;All<i> </i>who devoured them
sinned not, and they who devoured them said, Blessed be the Lord who has
enriched us.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;381105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Zechariah
11:5)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must more closely consider the design of the
Holy Spirit. The Prophet indeed shows that the Jews were reduced to extremities,
so that they were not only cruelly treated by their enemies, but were also
exposed to the greatest contempt. He, however, reminded them at the same time of
their duty to repent, for when the whole world condemned them, it was but right
that God should call them to an account for their sins. As then he had set over
them all men as their judges, he indirectly touched and goaded their
consciences, so that they might know that they had to do with God. When
therefore Zechariah said,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;All who devoured thee said,
Blessed be the Lord,&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">he meant, that the sins of the people were so
manifest to all, that all the heathens declared that they deserved extreme
punishment; for by the words, &#8220;Blessed<i> </i>be the Lord who hath
enriched us,&#8221; he intimated that heathens, in spoiling and plundering the
Jews, would be so far from feeling any shame, that they would rather glory in
being enriched with prey as it were by the hand of God. So also in this place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All who found them devoured
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and their enemies said, We
sin, not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, &#8212; </i>and<i> </i>why?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because they have acted wickedly
against Jehovah.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, the Prophet means, that the Jews would not
only be exposed to the rapacity, avarice, and cruelty of enemies, but also to
the greatest contempt and reproach. At the same time he exhorted them to repent;
for if they were thus condemned by the judgment of the whole world, it was not
unreasonable to direct their thoughts to the tribunal of God. Nor was it a
strange thing that the unbelieving referred to God, for it is what we commonly
meet with in all the prophets; and it was ever a principle held by all nations,
that there is some supreme Deity; for though they devised for themselves various
gods, yet they all believed that there is one supreme God. So the name, Jehovah,
was known in common by all nations: and hence the Prophet here introduced the
Chaldeans as speaking, that the Jews had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>acted wickedly against
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>not indeed that they ascribed
to God his honor, but because this opinion, that there is some God, was held by
all; and this God they all indiscriminately worshipped according to their own
forms of religion, but they still thought that they worshipped
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What follows, interpreters explain as though the
Prophet in the person of enemies intended to exaggerate the sin of the chosen
people; they therefore connect the words thus, &#8220;They have been wicked
against Jehovah, who is the habitation of justice, and has always been the hope
of their fathers.&#8221; If we take this meaning, it is no wonder that their sin
is amplified, because the Jews had forsaken not some unknown God, whose favor
and power they had not experienced, but because they had been perfidious against
the God who had by many proofs testified his paternal love towards them. It was
then an impiety the more detestable, because they had thus dared to forsake the
only true God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But I approve of a different meaning, &#8212; that
the Prophet answers by God&#8217;s command, that their enemies deceived
themselves, when they thus confidently trod under foot the chosen people, and
thought that everything was lawful for them. The Prophet, I doubt not, now
checks the wantonness of which he speaks, as though he had said, &#8220;Ye think
that this people are wholly rejected by me, and hence there are no limits to
your cruelty; but I have so adopted them, that my covenant can never be rendered
void.&#8221; We may better understand what Jeremiah means by a similar example:
when Isaiah answered King Hezekiah that God would be the defender of the
city<i>, </i>when they recited to him the words of Sennacherib or of Rabshakch,
who brought his orders,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;233724&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
37:24) he said,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;But he thinks not that I have
founded Sion.&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH54</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That answer seems to me to be wholly like this
passage. Sennacherib said, &#8220;I will go up and take the city and the
temple;&#8221; he, in short, triumphed as though he was a conqueror; but God, on
the other hand, restrained his confidence in these words, &#8220;But that
impious and proud enemy knows not that I have created Sion, and have been from
the beginning its maker: can I then now bring upon it such a destruction as
would wholly cut off the memory of it? Many cities have indeed perished, and
there is no place so illustrious which may not sometime be destroyed; but the
condition of the holy city (says God) is different.&#8221; And he adds the
reason, Because he had created it. So in this place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah is the habitation, of
justice and the hope of their fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>For God&#8217;s enemies almost always form their judgment according to the
present state of things; for in prosperity they are inflated with so much pride
that they dare insolently to utter blasphemies against God. For though the
Chaldeans had spoken thus, that they sinned not, because the Jews had been
wicked, there is yet no doubt but that their boasting was insulting to God, as
it is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;233722&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
37:22, 23,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The virgin, the daughter of Zion,
hath despised and derided thee, and drawn out the tongue against thee; me, the
God of hosts, he says, hath he despised.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By these words God shows that he was derided in the
person of his Church. For this reason, then, God himself now comes forth and
declares that he is the habitation of justice and the hope of his chosen people,
in order that the Chaldeans might not promise themselves prosperity
perpetually.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that these sentences are set in
opposition one to another rather than connected together, and spoken in the
person of the ungodly. The Chaldeans said, &#8220;We sin not, because they have
acted wickedly against Jehovah;&#8221; then the Prophet responds and shows that
they deceived themselves if they thought that God&#8217;s covenant was
abolished, because he for a time chastised his people, as it is said by
Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;What shall the messengers of the
nations declare?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino">or,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">When he spoke of the deliverance of the people and
city, he added this acclamation, that it would be a memorable benefit, the
report of which would be known among all nations, that is, that God had founded
Sion, that it had been wonderfully delivered as it were from present
destruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He first calls God the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>habitation of
justice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and he alludes, as I think, to
the tabernacle; and then he more clearly expresses himself, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God was the hope of their
fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Jews were indeed unworthy
of being protected by God; but he speaks not here of their merits, but, on the
contrary, God himself affirms the perpetuity of his covenant, and the constancy
of his faithfulness, in opposition to the ungodly. For since the Chaldeans had
already possessed the greater part of the country, and had taken all the cities
except Jerusalem, they thought that the people were forsaken by their God; and
this tended to cast reproach on God himself. Hence he declares here, that though
the Jews had been wicked, yet his covenant was so far from being extinct, that
he was a <i>habitations, </i>that is, like a place of refuge. And he calls him
the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>habitation of
justice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, firm or faithful; for
justice is not to be taken here in its proper sense, but, as in many other
places of Scripture, it means firmness or rectitude;<i> </i>as<i> </i>though he
had said, &#8220;God has once extended his wings to cherish his people, (as it
is said elsewhere;) he will therefore be always a sure
habitation.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He had also been the hope of their fathers, according
to what is said by Isaiah, that he had created Sion from the beginning; but he
renews the memory of his covenant, as though he had said, &#8220;It is not today
that I have first received this people into favor, but I made a covenant with
their father Abraham, which will remain fixed.&#8221; So, also, he says in this
place, that he was the hope of their fathers, even because he had adopted the
whole race<i> </i>of Abraham, and showed them mercy through all ages. Then the
Prophet indirectly infers that it would not be possible for their enemies
perpetually to possess power over them, because God, after having chastened his
people, would again gather the dispersed, and thus heal all their
evils.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fH55</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A useful doctrine may be hence gathered, that
whenever the Church seems to be so oppressed by enemies as to exclude any hope
of restoration, this ought always to be borne in mind by us, that as God has
once chosen it, it cannot be but that he will manifest his faithfulness even in
death itself, and raise from the grave those who seem to have been already
reduced to ashes. Let this passage, then, come to our minds, when the calamities
of the Church threaten utter ruin, and nothing but despair meets us; and when
enemies insolently arrogate everything to themselves, and boastingly declare
that we are accursed. But God is a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>habitation of
justice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and was the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hope of our
fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>let us, then, recumb on that
grace which he has once promised, when he deigned to choose us for himself, and
to adopt us as his peculiar people. Such is the import of the passage. It
follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse confirms the exposition which I have
given; for God does not now reprove his people, nor does he condemn their sins;
but on the contrary, he exhorts them to entertain good hope, though they were
overwhelmed with extreme miseries, he then pursues the same subject when he bids
them to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>flee from Babylon and to
go forth from Chaldea</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for he promises
deliverance to the faithful, and at the same time reminds them of the coming
ruin of the Chaldean empire, so that they who went the farthest off would best
consult their own safety. For the Prophet intimates that all found in Chaldea
would be exposed to the violence of enemies; hence he bids them to flee and to
go forth quickly. But as I have before said, he promises a free exit to the
Jews; for he would have in vain exhorted them to depart had they been shut up,
for we know that they had been confined as within inclosures. Had they then been
thus captives, the Prophet would have spoken in mockery by saying to them,
<i>Flee </i>and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>go
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But he shows that their captivity
would not be perpetual, because God would remove all obstacles and open a way
for the miserable exiles to return to their own country.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He bids them to be as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he-goats before the

to hasten with all confidence. For the he-goats possess more boldness than
sheep, and they go before the flock because no fear restrains them. So God takes
away every fear of danger from the Jews when he bids them to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as he-goats before the
flock</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though he had said that they
were no more to fear, lest the Chaldeans should punish them for avowing their
wish to return to their own country; for it was a capital offense to speak of
their return as long as the Chaldeans ruled over the Jews. But God now promises
a change, for he would dissipate the terror by which they had been for a time
restrained. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here, again, God declares that enemies would come and
overthrow the monarchy of Babylon; but what has been before referred to is here
more clearly expressed. For he says, first, that he would be the leader of that
war &#8212; that the Persians and Medes would fight under his authority.
<i>I</i>, he says (the pronoun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ykna</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
anki, </i>is here emphatical,) </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I

</i>and then he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an,
assembly of great nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The
Chaldeans, as we know, had devoured many kingdoms, for Babylon had subjugated
all the neighboring nations. Except, then, this had been distinctly expressed,
they might have disregarded the prophetic threatenings. But Jeremiah speaks here
of the assembly of great nations, lest the Chaldeans, relying on their power,
the largeness of the monarchy, and the multitude of their men, should promise
themselves victory, and thus lie asleep in their indulgences. God then, in these
words, shortly intimates that there would be ready at hand those who in number
and power would surpass the Chaldeans.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They will set in order against
her.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Something is to be here supplied
&#8212; that they would set the battle in order. Now, by this expression, the
Prophet sets forth the boldness of the Persians and Medes, as they would be
immediately ready for the conflict; they would not long consult, but quickly
advance to the fight. In short, he refers to the quickness and boldness of the
Persians and Medes, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall set in order against
her;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for they who distrust their own
strength, take convenient positions, or contrive ambushes, or withdraw for a
time until they know all the plans of their enemies; but the Prophet says that
the Persians would by no means be such, because they would be prepared for
battle at the first onset, and have the army set in order against the
Babylonians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thence taken shall
be</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Babylon. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mesham, </i>means from that place. But the Prophet intimates that the
Persians would become conquerors by one battle only, so that the Chaldeans would
no more dare to resist. We indeed know that those once put to flight, do often
prepare new forces and renew the battle; this is indeed usually the case, and it
seldom happens that any one is conquered in one battle. But the Prophet here
declares that Babylon would be taken at one time; as soon, he says, as the fight
begins, the enemies shall not only overcome, but shall by one assault take
Babylon, so as to make it captive.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, perceive the design of the Prophet;
but, doubtless, this prophecy was a derision to the unbelieving, for he seemed
to speak of a thing impossible: thus he sang a fable to the deaf. But God,
however, did not without reason predict that Babylon would be so taken, that it
would, as it were, in one moment fall into the hands of enemies. We said,
indeed, yesterday, that it was long besieged and taken by treachery in the
night; but we also said that this prophecy is not to be confined to one period;
for Babylon was often taken. It was taken through the contrivance of Zopyrus, as
we said yesterday, when it thought itself sufficiently strong to resist, and
Darius had nearly despaired. We shall therefore find nothing inconsistent in
this prophecy, when we consider how great and how supine was the security of
that people even at the time when they were suddenly
overthrown.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Its arrows as of a valiant
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>some render it, as of a bereaving
man, because some put the point on the right side and some on the left. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lk&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shecal, </i>means to act prudently, to be prosperous, and also to be
bereaved. But I agree with those who take the first sense, for it immediately
follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it shall not return in
vain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Those who render the word
&#8220;bereaved,&#8221; understand thereby that the arrows of the Persians would
be deadly or fatal. But the context does not correspond, for an explanation is
afterwards given, that it would not return in vain. It seems, then, that by this
word Jeremiah denotes their dexterity, as though he had said that the Persians
would be so skillful in throwing arrows, that they would not discharge one arrow
in vain; as those who are well exercised in that art always aim directly at an
enemy, and never shoot their arrows here and there without effect. So then the
Prophet says that the arrows of the Persians would be those of men shooting
skillfully, who know how to take a right aim.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH56</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And he calls them <i>valiant </i>or
strong; for it is not enough to send arrows straight against an enemy, except
there be also nerve and strength to shoot them; for arrows might touch one, but
not penetrate into his body, or hardly hurt his skin. But the Prophet refers to
both these things &#8212; that arrows would be hurled with sufficient force to
strike and wound the Chaldeans &#8212; and that they would also have always a
direct aim, so that no one would miss its object. It afterwards follows, &#8212;

might more fully confirm what he had said; for it is sometimes the case, that
they who are conquered flee to their cities. The country is indeed laid waste,
but the enemies depart with their spoils. But the Prophet here says, that the
whole of Chaldea would be plundered: he further adds, that the plunderers would
be <i>satiated, </i>as though he had said, &#8220;The enemies shall not only
seize on all sides, as it sometimes happens, on what may fall into their hands,
but they shall heap together all the treasures of Chaldea until they shall be
satiated.&#8221; He means, in short, that Chaldea would be wholly emptied; for
these two things ought to be deemed as set in opposition the one to the other,
&#8212; that the enemies would be filled to satiety, and that the Chaldeans
would be reduced to poverty. Then the satiety of which the Prophet speaks,

so many and so remarkable victories, could be broken down and laid prostrate by
new enemies; for they had been terrible to the whole world, they had subdued all
their neighbors, they had extended on all sides their borders; it was then the
same as though they had set their nest in the clouds. Then the Prophet says
here, that though they exulted and gave loose reins to their joy, yet this state
of things would not be perpetual, because they should at length be brought to
shame. This is one thing. And the second reason why the Prophet spoke thus was,
because God intended that it should be testified to his own people, that though
he permitted so much liberty to the Chaldeans, he had not yet forgotten his
covenant; and for this reason he mentioned the word heritage. Though then the
calamity of his people was apparently a sort of repudiation, as though God
designed to have nothing more to do</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">with them, yet he says that they were his own
heritage; and thus he shows, that God would give a specimen of his favor towards
the Jews, by thus severely chastising the Chaldeans. This then is the reason why
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have rejoiced in
plundering my heritage, but your mother is
ashamed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He expresses here more than if
he had said, &#8220;Ye shall at length lie down confounded with shame;&#8221;

unjustly raged against the Church. But the name of God seems also to have been
designedly mentioned, that the faithful might more readily receive this
prophecy: for had they thought that what Jeremiah said came from man, they would
have hardly believed his words, for what he said exceeded the comprehension of
men. He then mentioned the indignation of God, that the faithful might know that

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now turns to address the Medes and
Persians, and instigates them, in the name of God, to destroy Babylon. We have
already said, why the Prophets assume authority over all nations, even that they
might show that God&#8217;s power is connected with his word. For men do not
easily apprehend the efficacy of God&#8217;s word, and think that the air is to
no purpose beaten by an empty sound. Hence the Prophets show that God has his
hand extended whenever he speaks, so that nothing is announced in vain. This
then is the reason why the Prophet now, as before, commands the Persians and
Medes strenuously to exert themselves in attacking Babylon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
first,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> Set in
order</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, the battle, or the
assault; set in order </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>against
Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>around</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>so that no escape might be open to them. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All ye who bend the
bow</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for this mode of fighting was
common among the Medes and Persians, as it appeared elsewhere; and the Orientals
still follow the same practice, for they throw darts at their enemy, and move
here and there, for they do not engage in pitched battles. he afterwards says,
<i>Throw </i>or </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shoot at her,
spare not the arrow</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>the singular is
here used for the plural, he adds the reason, <i>because they have acted
wickedly against God.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH60</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though the iniquity of Babylon was manifold, there is
yet no doubt but that God here undertakes the cause of his Church. Then, of all
the sins of the Chaldeans, the chief was this, that they had oppressed the
Church of God; for we know with what favor God regards his children, so that he
who hurts them toucheth the apple of his eye, as he testifies elsewhere.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;380208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
2:8.) This singular effect of love Jeremiah sets forth when he says, that the
Chaldeans had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>acted wickedly
against Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>even because they had
tyrannically oppressed his Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now God will have nothing, as it were, apart from his
children: and hence we learn a useful doctrine, &#8212; that the salvation of
his Church is so precious in the sight of God, flint he regards the wrong done
to the faithful as done to himself. Thus there is no reason why we should
torment ourselves, when the ungodly harass us, because God will at length really
show that our salvation is not less dear to him than their own eyes are to men.

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah proceeds in exhorting the Persians and the
Medes, not that he had ever spoken to them; but this mode of speaking, as it has
been said, availed to confirm the minds of the godly, so that they might feel
assured that what had proceeded from the mouth of Jeremiah was not vain. Here,
then, he assumes the person of God himself, and with authority commands the
Persians and the Medes as to what they were to do. He says again,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cry aloud against
her.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By crying aloud or shouting, he
means the cry of triumph which soldiers send forth when a city is taken, or
rather, as I think, the encouraging cries, by which soldiers rouse one another
when they make an attack; for battles are never without shoutings, nor the
storming of cities. God titan bids the soldiers to animate one another in their
usual way to make a strenuous effort. <i>Shout, </i>he says, and then adds,
<i>all around.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>She hath given her
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words he intimates that
Babylon would not be able to resist. Hands are wont to be given as a token of
union; but he is also said to give his hand who confesses himself to be
conquered. In this sense we may take the words of Jeremiah, that Babylon had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>given her
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because she could not defend
herself against the Medes and Persians. But as we know flint the city was taken
by treachery, in this manner also was fulfilled what Jeremiah had announced,
when two Satraps, in order to revenge private wrongs, sent for Cyrus: for thus
it happened that Babylon, or those within it, willingly stretched forth the
hands.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>her foundations have fallen, and
her walls have been overthrown</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>not that
Cyrus attacked the city with warlike engines, for he entered in by the fords;
but still the soldiers readily mounted the walls. Jeremiah then speaks
figuratively, as though he had said, that the Chaldeans were mistaken in
thinking that they had strong fortresses, because the walls would avail them
nothing, however high and wide they were. And we know what ancient historians
relate of these walls and towers. The event was almost incredible; for no one
could have thought it possible that a city so fortified could be taken by
assault. But the Prophet derides this confidence, and declares that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>walls would be
overthrown</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>together with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their
foundations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH61</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But as it was a thing difficult to be
believed, he again adds a confirmation, that it would be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the vengeance of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though he had said, that the
destruction of Babylon ought not to be estimated according to the thoughts of
men, because God would there put forth his wonderful power. In the meantime, he
animates again the Persians and the Medes to take vengeance, and to render to
the Babylonians what they had deserved. The Prophet in short intimates that the
Persians and the Medes would be armed to execute God&#8217;s vengeance on the
Babylonians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must notice the last clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Do to her as she has
done</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to others; for we hence learn, what
we have also observed elsewhere, that a reward is rendered to every one, so that
they who have been cruel to others, do find how dreadful is God&#8217;s
judgment. God does not always execute his judgment by men; but still this is
ever true,</font><br></div>

renders to the ungodly their reward; for he sometimes punishes them by the hand
of man, and sometimes he suspends his judgment. Here he shows that the Persians
and the Medes would be the executioners of his vengeance, even as the Chaldeans
themselves had been as it were his scourges when he chastised his people for
their sins; for he had employed the Chaldeans in carrying on war against the
Jews. But God has many ways by which he calls each one to an account. Thus at
length he punished the Chaldeans, because they indulged only their avarice and
ambition in oppressing the Jews; for it was not their purpose to punish the Jews
as they deserved; but their own lust, as I have just said, led them to cruelty
and slaughter. It was, therefore, but just that they should in their turn be
chastised by God&#8217;s hand. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

bids them <i>cut </i>off from <i>Babylon </i>both the <i>sowers </i>and the
<i>reapers; </i>but by stating a part for the whole he includes also all others.
Husbandmen in a manner preserve the life of men, as other arts and occupations
are not capable of doing so. Were there no sowing and reaping, all would of
necessity perish. When, therefore, the Prophet bids them take away those who
sowed and reaped, it was the same as though he had said, <i>&#8220;</i>Strike<i>
</i>with the sword and kill all the inhabitants, so that nothing may remain but
the land reduced to solitude.&#8221; He then commands the Chaldeans to be slain,

<div><font face="Palatino">This, indeed, was not fulfilled by Cyrus, as we have
elsewhere seen. But what I then reminded you of ought to be borne in mind, that
the Prophet extends his threatenings much further, for Babylon was often smitten

prelude, but other calamities followed, when it was more severely
oppressed.</font><br></div>

when the empire flourished. There were there many husbandmen and many
artificers. The Chaldeans ruled, and yet many were content with small means, and
even paltry; or it may be that the Chaldeans compelled conquered nations to do
servile work in agriculture and in works of art. The Prophet now says, that in

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet more clearly shows what he had
briefly referred to, even that God was thus incensed against the Babylonians,
because he had undertaken the cause of the people whom he had chosen. Then
Jeremiah&#8217;s design was to show to the faithful, that though God severely
chastised them for a time, he had not wholly divested himself of his paternal
regard towards them, because he would at length make it openly evident that they
to whom he had been so rigid were dear to him. He then mitigates the severity of
punishment, that the Jews might not succumb to despair, but call upon God in
their miseries, and hope that he, after having turned them, would at length be
propitious to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum of what is said is, that whatever punishments
God inflicts on his Church are temporary, and are also useful for salvation,
being remedies to prevent them from perishing in their vices. Let us then learn
to embrace the promises whenever we are wounded with extreme sorrow under the
chastisements of God: let us learn, I say, to look to his mercy; and let us be
convinced of this, that though signs of his wrath may appear on every side, yet
the punishments we suffer are not fatal, but on the contrary, medicinal. For
this reason, the Prophet exhorted the faithful of his time to be patient, by
showing that God, after having been a Judge, would be again a Father to
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a scattered
flock</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or a straying sheep, which is the
same thing. He expresses how they became so,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the first
</i></font><font face="Palatino">who
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>devoured
</i></font><font face="Palatino">them was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the king of
Assyria</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for we know that the kingdom of
Israel was overthrown by the Assyrians, and the land of Judah was also very much
pillaged by them; a small portion remained. Then God says, that the people had
been consumed by the calamities which the Assyrians had occasioned. But he
compares what remained to bones, as though a wild beast devoured a sheep, and
left only the bones. There was then no flesh or skin in Israel after the
Assyrians had cruelly treated them, and that often. But as the kingdom of Judah
remained, he says that it was like bones; and hence he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and this last, Nebuchadnezzar,
the king of Babylon, hath broken, his
bones</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH62</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, hath broken in pieces
and devoured the bones which remained.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet. Moreover,
he exaggerates the miseries of the chosen people, that he might in a manner open
a way for mercy. God, then, here assumes the feeling of man, who is touched with
a sad spectacle, when he sees a miserable and harmless sheep devoured, and the
bones cast away, and then sees another wild beast, still more savage, who breaks
the bones with his teeth and devours them. Since God then thus speaks, there is
no doubt but that he meant to express with what tender feeling he regarded his
chosen people, and that he also meant to give the godly the hope of salvation.

<div><font face="Palatino">What I have said may hence with more certainty be
inferred &#8212; that the similitude which God employed was intended for this
end, that having assumed the person of one in sorrow, he might represent as it
were to their eyes his sympathy, he then shows that he would be the avenger of
the cruelty which the Chaldeans had practiced, as he had already been the
avenger of all the evils which the Assyrians had done to his
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must bear in mind the time &#8212; for the meaning
of this passage depends on history. The Assyrians were stronger than the
Chaldeans when they harassed the kingdom of Israel: for we know that in the time
of Hezekiah the king of Babylon sent to him to seek his favor, and to allure him
to a confederacy. While then the monarchy of Assyria was formidable, the
Assyrians were very hostile to the Israelites and also to the Jews: what
followed? Nineveh was overthrown, and Babylon succeeded in its place; and so
they who had ruled were constrained to bear the yoke, and thus Babylon made the
Assyrians captive to itself. God now refers to this judgment, which was known to
all. The Assyrians themselves did not indeed think that the God of Israel was
the avenger of his people, but yet it was so. Hence God here declares that he
had already given a manifest proof of the solicitude which he had for the
welfare of his people: as then he had punished Assyria, so he declares that he
would take vengeance on the Babylonians. And thus, by an example, he confirms
what might have appeared incredible. For who could have thought that that
monarchy could so suddenly fall? And yet it happened beyond what any could have
anticipated. God here repeats what had taken place, that the faithful might feel
assured that the judgment which the Assyrians had experienced, awaited the
Babylonians. This is the plain meaning of the Prophet. It follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah pursues here the same subject, and sustains
the minds of the faithful in their miseries, lest they should wholly despond. It
is then the same as though he stretched forth his hand to the shipwrecked, or
gave support to those lying down as it were lifeless; for exile to God&#8217;s
children was not only sad, but was like death, because they perceived the
vengeance of God as though they had been wholly repudiated. It was therefore
necessary to give them some consolation, that they might not altogether despair.
The object, then, of our Prophet now is, to encourage the Jews to bear patiently
their troubles, and not to think the stroke inflicted on them to be fatal. Hence
God promises a restoration to their own country, which would be an evidence of
pardon and of mercy; for when God gathered his people, it was the same as though
he had openly showed that their adoption remained unchanged, and that the
covenant which seemed for a time to fail was still valid.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see why Jeremiah spoke of the restoration
of the people; and then he adds,
to</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> their own
folds</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or to their own habitation. This
mode of speaking, we know, is found everywhere in the Prophets, for they compare
God to a shepherd, and the Church to a flock of sheep. This similitude then is
sufficiently common, nor could God better express how much he was concerned for
the welfare of his people, than by setting himself forth as their shepherd, and
by testifying that he would take care of his flock. But as we said at the
beginning of the book, Jeremiah had a special reason for using this similitude,
because he was from a town of pastures, and had been from his childhood among
shepherds: there is therefore no wonder that he often uses expressions to which
he had been accustomed; for education in a great measure forms the language of
men. Though then the Prophet speaks according to the usual phraseology of
Scripture, there is yet no doubt but that he retained, as it has been said
elsewhere, his own habitual mode of speaking.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says, that after the people had been
gathered, they would inhabit, rich and fertile mountains, even <i>Carmel </i>and
<i>Bashan. </i>The fruitfulness of these mountains is spoken of in many places,
but it is not necessary to quote them. The meaning however is, that God, after
having again gathered his chosen people, would be as it were a faithful shepherd
to them, so that they might feel assured that there would be not only a free
return to their own country, but that God would be also the guardian of their
safety, so as ever to protect them, to exercise care over them, to defend them
against their enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But that God might more fully set forth his kindness,
he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and satisfied shall be
his soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Soul here is to be taken for
desire, as in many other places. Now the former doctrine ought to be borne in
mind, that God is never so angry or displeased with his Church but that he
remembers his covenant. Then, as to the faithful, after they have undergone
their temporary punishment, God at length stretches forth his hand to them; nor
is he once only propitious to them, but continues his mercy, and so cherishes
them, that he is not less solicitous for their welfare than a shepherd is, to
whom his flock is not less dear than his own life, so that he watches in the
night, endures cold and heat, and also exposes himself to many dangers from
robbers and wild beasts in order that he might protect his flock. But the
Prophet points out as by the finger the very fountain of all this when he adds,

<div><font face="Palatino">As I have already said, the Prophet now shows the
primary cause why God purposed to deal so kindly and mercifully with his people,
even because he would remit their sins. And doubtless whatever is said of the
remission of sins is cold and unmeaning, except we be first convinced that God
is reconciled and propitious to us. The unbelieving indeed seek no other thing
than to be relieved from their evils, as the sick who require nothing from their
physician but that he should immediately remove pain. If the sick man thirsts,
&#8220;Take away thirst,&#8221; he will say. In short, they regard only the
symptom, of the disease they do not say a word. Such is the case with the
ungodly, they neglect the chief thing, that God should pardon them and receive
them into favor. Provided they are exempted from punishment, this is enough for
them. But as to the faithful, they can never be satisfied until they feel
assured that God is propitious to them. In order, then, to free from disquietude
and all misgivings the minds of the godly, our Prophet says that God would be
propitious, so that he would bury all the sins of Israel and Judah, so that they
might no more be remembered or come to judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage is remarkable, and from it we especially
learn this valuable truth, that when God severely chastises us, we ought not to
stop at the punishment and seek only a relief from our troubles, but on the
contrary we ought to look to the very cause of all evils, even our sins. So
David, in many places, when he seeks from God a relaxation of evil, does not
only say, &#8220;Lord, deliver me from mine enemies; Lord, restore to me my
health; Lord, deliver me from death;&#8221; &#8212; he does not simply speak
thus, but he earnestly flees to God and implores his mercy. And on the other
hand, when God promises deliverance from punishment, he does not simply say,
&#8220;I<i> </i>will restore you from exile or captivity, I will restore you to
your own country;&#8221; but he says, &#8220;I<i> </i>will forgive you your
sins.&#8221; For when the disease is removed, the symptoms also which accompany
the disease disappear. So also it happens in this case, for when God shows that
he is propitious to us, we are then freed from punishment, that is, what we have
for a time suffered, or what awaited us, had not God spared us according to his
infinite mercy and goodness.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH63</font></sup><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that since thou
hast been so merciful towards thine ancient <i>people, </i>and however
grievously thou mightest have been offended, yet thou didst preserve some
remnant to whom thou gavest tokens of thy mercy, &#8212; O grant that it may
please thee so to allure us also at this day; and however we may deserve a
thousand times to be condemned by thee, yet deign to receive us in thine
only-begotten Son, and through him show thyself reconciled to us to the end of
our life; and be thou our Father in death itself, so that we may live and die to
thee, and acknowledge this to be the only true way of salvation, until we shall
at length enjoy that celestial inheritance which has been obtained for us by the
blood of the same, thine only-begotten Son. &#8212; Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SECOND</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">IN the last lecture we began to explain what the
Prophet says, that when God redeemed his people he would be so propitious as to
blot out all their sins. We said also that the Prophet shows that the people had
for just reasons been treated with severity. Here then we have to observe the
justice of God in all his judgments. For the Prophet reminds us that the Jews
could not have been reconciled to God, except they acknowledged that they had
been justly punished. And hence we learn also a useful doctrine, that whenever
God smites us with his rods, we are not only to seek that relief may be given us
from external evils or sorrow, but that God may also forgive us. The reason also
is to be observed, for the Prophet teaches us that there would be no iniquity
because God would be propitious. We hence learn that there were also just
reasons why God chastised his people, but that as he designed to forgive their
sins he became their deliverer. Let us then know that we are counted just before
God, not because he sees no iniquities in us, but because he freely forgives
them. It is, in short, the only true way of being reconciled to God, when he
buries as it were our sins so as never to call them to
judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, that this favor properly belongs to the
kingdom of Christ may be gathered from the thirty-first chapter, where the
Prophet, having spoken of the new covenant, lays down this as the principal
thing,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I will pardon their
iniquities,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243134&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
31:34)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and he uses here the same verb. This promise then
ought not to be confined to that short time when the people returned from their
Babylonian exile, but ought on the contrary to be extended to the kingdom of
Christ, for it was then that this prophecy was fully accomplished, because our
sins do not appear before God when he is reconciled to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet the Prophet intimates that this favor would not
be general, for he adds that God would be propitious only to the <i>remnant;
</i>and it was needful to express this, because the faithful after their return
might have otherwise desponded, when they saw that a few only of the people were
restored. Had their restoration been indiscriminately promised, the faith of the
godly might have faltered on seeing that almost the whole people disregarded the
favor offered to them; for a part only of the tribe of Judah availed themselves
of the kindness of Cyrus and Darius; and the ten tribes chose rather to dwell in
Chaldea and in other places. And it was not only once that God restricted the
promise given here; for it is said by Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Were thy people as the sand of
the sea,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">a remnant only shall be
saved.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;231021&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
10:21, 22)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The people gloried in their number and boasted of
what had been said to Abraham,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Number if thou canst the stars of
heaven and the sand of the sea, so shall thy seed be.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
15:5)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God then shows that the Jews were greatly mistaken
when they thought that they would be always in a safe state. Hence the Prophet
says here that God would not be propitious indiscriminately to all, but to those
whom he would <i>make the remnant. </i>And God also intimates that it was to be
ascribed to his gratuitous goodness that any remained alive, according to what
is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:9,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Except some seed had been left to
us, we must have been as Gomorrah, and like to Sodom,&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God then declares here that the remnant would not
otherwise be saved than through his gratuitous mercy, as Paul also says, that
the Jews were not to hope for salvation, except through the free mercy of God.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:5.) And he especially noticed this passage and similar passages, because the
Jews then in opposing the Gospel raised the objection, that they were the seed
of Abraham, and the chosen people; but Paul gave them this answer, that it was
not a new thing that God gathered a small remnant from his people; and he
assigns as the cause his gratuitous election. It now follows, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here undertakes the office of a herald,
and animates the Persians and the Medes to make war with Babylon. This prophecy
indeed never came to these nations, but we have stated why the Prophets
proclaimed war and addressed at one time heathen nations, at another time the
Jews &#8212; now one people, then another; for they wished to bring the faithful
to the very scene of action, and connected the accomplishment with their
predictions. By this mode of speaking, the Prophet then teaches us, that he did
not scatter words into the air, but that the power of God was connected with the
word which he spoke, as though God had expressly commanded the Medes and the
Persians to execute his vengeance on Babylon. And doubtless Jeremiah did not
thus speak; according to his own thoughts, nor did he thus speak in the person
of man; but on the contrary, he introduced God as the speaker, as it appears
front the end of the verse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ascend on the land of the
exasperating</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>others read, &#8220;of<i>
</i>bitterness,&#8221; but improperly. God indeed calls the Chaldeans
rebellious, for though they were for a time the scourges of his wrath, they yet
had cruelly treated many nations, being impelled only by their own pride and
avarice; he justly calls them &#8220;the exasperating,&#8221; and then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Slay the inhabitants of
visitation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some regard
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dwqp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>pekud, </i>as a proper name; and they first imagine that it was a town of
some note in Chaldea, which is groundless; and then they give a frigid
explanation by saying that it was some mean and obscure place. There is then no
doubt but that the Prophet calls the Chaldeans the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>inhabitants of
visitation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because God&#8217;s
vengeance awaited them, nay, it was even suspended over their heads, as he
afterwards declares. But this way of speaking frequently occurs in the
Prophets.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fH64</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and destroy after
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or behind
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>There is an alliteration in the words
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;hyrta
&#181;rjh</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>etherem acheriem; </i>and he means
that the slaughter would be extreme, so that the Medes and Persians would not
cease to destroy until they had extinguished the name of Babylon. Yet we know
that this was not done by Cyrus and Darius; for as we have already stated
several times, the city was taken by fraud and treachery in the night, and the
king and the princes were slain, for Darius, or rather Cyrus, spared the rest of
the people; for though Darius had the name of being king, yet Cyrus was by far
the most renowned, as he was a valiant soldier, and only on account of his fame
accompanied his father-in-law and uncle. As then the sword did not destroy all
the Chaldeans when Babylon was taken, we conclude that the Prophets, when they
denounced slaughter and destruction on Babylon, did not confine what they said
to that time, but included also other slaughters; for Babylon was often taken.
It revolted from the Persians; and when it was recovered, it suffered very
severe punishment; for, by way of reproach, those who were first in power and
authority were hung, and there was also great cruelty exercised towards men and
women. There is no doubt then but that the Prophets, in speaking of the
destruction of Babylon, referred to God&#8217;s judgments inflicted at various
times. However this may have been, we learn that though God may long connive, or
suspend extreme judgments, yet the ungodly cannot possibly escape his hand,
though they may long be spared.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Do to them as I have commanded
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This prophetic mode of speaking
ought also to be noticed; for the Medes and the Persians never thought that they
fought under the authority of God; why then is the word &#8220;commanded&#8221;
used? even because God rules by his secret<i> </i>power ungodly men, and leads
them wheresoever he pleases, though nothing of the kind is ever thought of by
them. To explain the matter more fully, we must observe flint God commands in
two ways; for he commands the faithful when he shows to them what is right and
what they ought to follow. Thus daily God may be said to exercise his authority
or right of ruling, when he exhorts us to do our duty, when he sets his law
before us. And it is the proper way of commanding, or of exercising authority,
when God expresses what he would have us to do, or what he requires from us. But
God commands the unbelieving in another way; for though he does not declare to
them what he would have them to do, he yet draws them, willing or unwilling,
where-ever he pleases. Thus, by his secret operation, he induced Cyrus and
Darius to take up arms against Babylon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand what the Prophet meant by this
expression; for he did not mean that Darius and Cyrus obeyed God from the heart,
because they knew not that he was the leader and author of that war; no such
thing ever entered into their minds. The former mode of commanding, as I have
said, is peculiar to the Church; for God is pleased to bestow on us a peculiar
privilege and favor, when he shows to us what is right, and prescribes the rule
of life. But yet his hidden providence, by which he influences the ungodly,
takes the place of a command, as it is said,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is in the
hand of God.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;202101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Proverbs
21:1)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Solomon speaks of a king rather than of common
men, because, if there be any liberty among mankind, it belongs to kings, for
they seem exempt from every yoke; and Solomon declares that the hearts of kings
are ruled by God. Though then Darius and Cyrus were carried away by their own
cupidity when they made war, yet God, as we shall hereafter see more clearly,
guided their hearts. So also he is said to command the heavens and the earth-not
that the heavens, being without ears and reason, hear his voice, but because God
powerfully moves and influences the heavens; for when he intends to punish us,
he commands the heaven not to rain. This command of God the heaven executes, and
the earth also obeys God; but there is no word of command given to them, &#8212;
what then? it is God&#8217;s providence which is hid from us. It follows,

nations. God afterwards gives an answer, even because &#8220;I<i> </i>am he who
have taken Babylon.&#8221; The question availed to rouse the people to a greater
attention. We neglect God&#8217;s judgments or are blind to them, even because
we do not carefully consider them; for little things often excite us, when that
which God works in an unusual manner is deemed by us as nothing. As then our
apathy as to the works of God is so great, it is necessary to stimulate us. And
this is what is done now by Jeremiah, when he says in astonishment,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?
</i>for he intimates that to cut down Babylon would be incredible, for no one
could have thought that that monarchy could have ever fallen; for it had arrived
to the highest <i>eminence, </i>and was surrounded on all sides by so many
fortresses, that no danger could be feared. In short, all thought that Babylon
could not be endangered without a concussion of heaven and
earth.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here expresses more clearly what he bad
touched upon, even that this war would not be that of the Persians, but of God
himself. He then says, that God had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>opened his
treasure</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>even because he has various
and manifold ways and means, which cannot be comprehended by men, when he
resolves to destroy the ungodly. That monarchy was impregnable according to the
judgment of men; but God here says that he had hidden means by which he would
lay waste Babylon and reduce it to nothing. Then what is by a similitude called
the <i>treasure </i>of God, means such a way as surpasses the comprehension of
men, that is, when God executes his judgments in a way hidden and
unexpected.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, the faithful could hardly conceive what
Jeremiah said, he raises up their thoughts to God&#8217;s providence, which
ought not to be subjected to human judgment; for it is absurd in men to judge of
God&#8217;s power according to the perceptions of the flesh; it is the same as
though they attempted to include heaven and earth in the hollow of their hand.
God himself says, that he takes heaven and earth in the hollow of his hand.
When, therefore, men seek to comprehend the power of God, it is like a fly
attempting to devour all the mountains. Hence the Prophet reproves this
presumption to which we are all by nature inclined, even to determine according
to the comprehension of our minds what God is about or ought to do, as though
his power were not infinite.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the reason why the Prophet says, God

<div><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet again addresses the Persians and the
Medes, and encourages them to come against Babylon. We stated yesterday that the
prophets are went to speak with authority, because they sustained the person of
God; and we mentioned how necessary this mode of speaking was, for the world
does not acknowledge that God speaks effectually.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come ye against
her</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">sbam</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>meabes, </i>means a cornhouse or a repository of any kind: hence some render
it <i>&#8220;granaries.&#8221; </i>But it seems to me that the word is thus too
much restricted, for the Prophet no doubt speaks of the treasures of Babylon.
Now storehouses, <i>(apothecas,) </i>the Greeks call those repositories which
contain all sorts of things, not only wine and oil, but goods of merchants, and
also money. We call them in French, <i>Arrieres-boutiques, </i>or, <i>magasins.
</i>But this word is to be extended to wine, to every kind of fruit, and then to
treasures, and also to arms; for they were repositories of arms, of weapons of
every kind. It is the same as though Jeremiah had said, that nothing would be so
hidden among the Chaldeans but that the Medes and the Persians would find it
out.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Tread her as

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ymr[</font><font face="Palatino">,

he intimates that the Persians and the Medes would act cruelly, and tread them
as corn is trodden on the floor.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

indirectly to set this in contrast with what God promised always to his people,
that there would be some remnant, he then says that nothing would remain when
God had executed his vengeance on the Chaldeans. The sum of what is said is,
that the punishment of which the Prophet speaks would be such as would
obliterate the very name of the Babylonian monarchy. This, as we said yesterday
and also previously, was not completed in one day. But when the Prophets speak
of God&#8217;s judgments, they do not regard only the preludes, but their words
extend to the last judgment that awaits all the reprobate. It now follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">He goes on with the same subject; he bids the
Persians and the Medes to slay every strong man in Chaldea; for by <i>bullocks
</i>he no doubt means by a metaphor all those who excelled in strength, or in
power, or in wealth. The sum of what he says is, that the vengeance of which he
now speaks, would not only be against the common people, but also against the
highest and the choicest among them. He includes then the nobles as well as all
the men of war; for he refers not only to strength of body, but also to power
and authority.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Slay</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

came.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fH70</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He afterwards says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>let them
descend to the slaughter</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We must ever
bear in mind what I have said, that the Prophet gave orders as though he had the
Medes and the Persians under his own hand and authority, because the whole world
is subject to God&#8217;s word. He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woe to them! for their day is
come, and the time of their visitation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>This was added, because the faithful might have disputed with themselves and
said, &#8220;How<i> </i>can it be that Babylon should perish so quickly?&#8221;
For God seemed to have favored that monarchy for a long time, as though he
intended to protect it perpetually. Hence the Prophet speaks here of the time of
visitation, so that the faithful might not doubt respecting this prophecy,
because God had not as yet put forth his band. He then reminded them that God
has his fixed times, and that he does not every day visit nations, that is, that
he does not execute his judgments every moment, but at the time which he has
appointed. Whenever, then, the ungodly securely exult and triumph, let us ever
remember this truth, that the time is not yet come for God to execute his
judgment; how so? because there is a fixed time of visitation, and that is
dependent on God&#8217;s will. Let us then learn to bear patiently all our
trials until it shall please God to show that he is the judge of the world. It

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet again shows, that God in punishing
Babylon, would give a sure proof of his favor towards his Church. For this
prophecy would have been uninteresting to the faithful, did they not know that
God would be an enemy to that great monarchy, because he had undertaken the care
of their safety. Then the Prophet often calls the attention of the faithful to
this fact, that God&#8217;s vengeance on the Babylonians would be to them a sure
proof of God&#8217;s favor, through which he had once embraced them, and which
he would continue to show to them to the end.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This, then, was the design of the Prophet, when he
said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The voice officers and of
those who escape from the land of Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>etc.; as though he had said, &#8220;Babylon<i> </i>is on many accounts
worthy of destruction, but God in destroying it will have a regard to his own
people, and will effectually show that he is the Father of the people whom he
has adopted.&#8221; Jeremiah afterwards exhorts the faithful to show their
gratitude. There are here, then, two things; the first is, that when God
destroyed Babylon, the people would hence with certainty perceive how dear they
were to God; and secondly, from this truth flows an exhortation, that the
faithful were not to be mute at such a singular benefit of God, but were to
proclaim their deliverance. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The voice of fleers and of those
who escape from the land of Babylon, to announce in
Sion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. By saying
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
Sion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he shows for what end God intended
to gather his people, even that he might again be worshipped as formerly-in his
own Temple.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to announce in Sion the vengeance
of our God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The vengeance of God is to
be taken here in an active sense, signifying the vengeance which God would
execute. The vengeance of the Temple, which immediately follows, is to be taken
passively, as meaning the vengeance by which God would avenge the indignity
offered to the Temple. God then takes vengeance, and God&#8217;s Temple is
defended from contempt and reproach.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see the meaning of this passage. The
Prophet first teaches us, that God would have a regard to his people in so
rigidly punishing Babylon; and secondly, he adds an exhortation, lest the
faithful should be unthankful to God, but acknowledge that God, for the sake of
their deliverance had undertaken war against that monarchy; and lastly, he shows
the end, even that the people who had been scattered, as it is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19E702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

<div><font face="Palatino">might again be collected together. As, then, the Jews
were as a mutilated body among the Chaldeans, the Prophet shows that that
monarchy would be dispersed, in order that the faithful might again be gathered,
and that all might worship God together in the Temple, or on mount Sion. It

without reason, because he had to thunder rather than to speak; and then as he
spoke of a thing incredible, there was need of no common confirmation; the
faithful also, almost pining away in their miseries, could hardly entertain any
hope. This is the reason why the Prophet dwells so long and so diffusely on a
subject in itself not obscure, for there was not only need of amplifying, but
also of great vehemence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then, as though he had many heralds ready to obey, he

<i>rebim </i>here but as signifying many or the mighty; and the latter is the
most suitable word. Then the Prophet bids the strong and the warlike to come
together, and then he mentions them specifically<i>, &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all who bend the
bow</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>even all skillful archers. For the
Persians excelled in this art, they were archers of the first order. It was
indeed a practice common among eastern nations, but the Persians surpassed all
others. The Prophet then points them out when he bids <i>archers </i>to
assemble.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fH71</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>encompass
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or besiege
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>her around, that there may be no
escape</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This also was a thing difficult
to be believed, for Babylon was more like a country than a city. Then one could
have hardly thought that it could have been besieged around and at length taken,
as it happened. Therefore the Prophet here testifies that what exceeded the
opinion of all would take place. But he had said before that this would be the
work of God, that the faithful might not form a judgment according to their own
measure, for nothing is more absurd, as it has been said, than to measure the
power of God by our own understanding. As then the Prophet had before
<i>declared </i>that the siege of Babylon would be the work of God, he bids them
now, with more <i>confidence, </i>to <i>besiege it around,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that there might not be an
escape</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is then added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Render to her according to her
work; according to what she has done, do to
her</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words the Prophet shows
that the vengeance which God would execute on the Chaldeans would be just, for
nothing is more equitable than to render to one what he had done to
others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;With what measure ye mete to

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;420638&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Luke
6:38)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, nature itself teaches us that the
punishment is most just which is inflicted on the cruel themselves, hence the
Prophet reminds us here that God would be a just avenger in his extreme violence
against the Babylonians. But he looks farther, for he assumes this principle,
that God is the judge of the world. Since he is so, it follows that they who
unjustly oppress others must at length receive their own reward; as also Paul
says, that the judgment of God, otherwise obscure, will be made evident, when he
shall give relief and rest to the miserable who are now unjustly afflicted, and
when he shall render their reward to oppressors.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;530106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 1:6, 7.) The Prophet then takes occasion of confidence from this
truth to animate the faithful and to encourage them to entertain hope. How so?
Since God is the judge of the world, the Jews ought to have considered what sort
of people the Babylonians had been; nay, they had already sufficiently
experienced how cruel and barbarous they were. As, then, the avarice and cruelly
of the Chaldeans were sufficiently apparent, the Prophet here reminds them, that
as God is in heaven, it could not be otherwise but that he would shortly call
them to judgment, for otherwise he would not be God. Surely he would not be the
judge of the world, were he not to regard the miserable unjustly oppressed, and
bring them help, and stretch forth his hand to relieve them; and were he not
also, on the other hand, to punish the avaricious and the proud and the cruel.
We now understand the meaning of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds, in the last place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because she has acted proudly
against Jehovah, against the Holy One of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By saying that the Babylonians
had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>acted
proudly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he means that they had not only
been injurious to men, but had been also insolent towards God himself; for the
verb here used denotes a sin different from that which happens through levity or
want of thought. When any one sins inconsiderately, he is said to have erred;
but when one sins knowingly, it is a deliberate wickedness, and he is said to be
proud; and this we learn from
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;191912&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
19:12; for David there sets pride in opposition to errors:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;errors,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;who can understand?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and then he asks God to cleanse him from all pride.
David indeed had not designedly raised his horns against God, but he yet feared
lest the wantonness of the flesh should lead him to pride. When, therefore, the
Prophet now says that the Chaldeans had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>acted proudly towards
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it is the same as though he accused
them of sacrilegious pride, even that they designed to be insolent towards God
himself, and not only cruel to his people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But an explanation follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>against the Holy One of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Babylonians might have
raised an objection, and said, that it was not their purpose to act proudly
towards God. But the Prophet here brings forward the word <i>Israel, </i>as
though he had said, &#8220;If<i> </i>there be a God in heaven, our religion is
true; then God&#8217;s name dwells with us. Since, then, the Babylonians have
basely oppressed the people whom God has chosen, it follows that they have been
sacrilegious towards him.&#8221; And he meant the same thing when he said
before, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the vengeance of Jehovah
our God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Why did he add,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>our
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>that the Jews might know that
whatever wrongs they had suffered, they reached God himself, as though he were
hurt in his own person. So also in this place the Prophet takes away from the
Babylonians all means of evasion when he says, that they had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>acted proudly towards the Holy
One of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>When, therefore, the
ungodly seek evasions and say that they do not contend with God, their pretenses
are disproved, when they carry on war with his Church, and fight, against his
faithful people, whose safety he has undertaken to defend. For God cannot be
otherwise the protector of his Church than by setting himself up as a shield in
its defense whenever he sees his people unjustly attacked by the reprobate. It

though Babylon had many nations under its authority, yet there would be no help
given to it, when the time of visitation came. It indeed often happens that many
busy themselves, and make every effort to assist the wicked, but without any
success. When, therefore, God declares that there would be no one to raise up
Babylon when fallen, the meaning is not, that courage would be wanting to all,
but that the efforts of all would be of no avail, even because God, when Babylon
fell, would be against her, so that were the whole world to unite for her
relief, all their attempts would be useless.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Our Prophet returns again to his former subject
&#8212; that God, in destroying the Babylonian monarchy, would have a regard to
his chosen people. But the comparison made here is very important; for in the
first place, the Prophet refers to an occasion of diffidence and even of
despair, which might have closed up the way against all his prophecies. For this
objection might have always been made, &#8220;We<i> </i>are driven into exile,
we are in a far country, and in places distant from one another; it is the same
as though we were in another world, and we can hardly move a foot without our
conquerors being enraged against us.&#8221; Thus the Jews, according to the
aspect of things at that time, could not otherwise than despair of returning to
their own country. This, then, is the reason why the Prophet says here, by way
of concession, &#8220;It<i> </i>is, indeed, true that the children of Judah and
the children of Israel are oppressed with cruel tyranny:&#8221; as when we wish
to secure faith, we state what seems to be opposed to us, and then dissipate it;
so now the Prophet does in this place, as though he had said, &#8220;I<i>
</i>see what his own mind may dictate to every one, even that the children of
Judah, as well as the children of Israel, are held captive, and shut up by such
fastnesses that no way of escape is open to them.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he speaks of the children of Israel and of the
children of Judah, we must remember that the ten tribes had been led into exile,
and also that the whole kingdom had been destroyed; and at length, after a
considerable time, the Chaldeans took possession also of the kingdom of Judah.
Hence then it was, that both the Israelites and the Jews became subject to a
cruel oppression. He therefore adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They who led them captive have
prevailed,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or, as some render the last
word, &#8220;have<i> </i>held them;&#8221; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qzj</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
chesek, </i>means to hold, to lay hold; but the Prophet seems to mean another
thing, even that their conquerors so prevailed as securely to rule over them;
and hence it is added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they have
refused to let them go</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and we learn the
same thing from the next verse, in which the strength and power of God is set in
opposition to the power of their enemies. As far as things appeared to men,
there was certainly no way of deliverance for the people. The Prophet then
concedes what might have taken away every hope from them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he immediately after removes this ground of
despair, and says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their redeemer
is strong</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He then sets this <i>strong,
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qzj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chesek, </i>in opposition to the verb used before, <i>&#8220;prevailed&#8221;
</i>or ruled, </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;b
wqyzjh</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>echesiku beem,</i>
&#8220;prevailed&#8221;<i> </i>or domineered &#8220;over them<i>,</i>&#8221;<i>
</i>so that they were stronger. But now, on the other hand, he calls the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Redeemer of Israel
strong</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for were you only to consider,
he seems to say, how great the power of Babylon is, you might despond; but can
God, in the meantime, do nothing? Is there any power on earth which can overrule
him? Since then their redeemer was strong, he would prove superior to the
Chaldeans.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds what is of the same import,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His name is Jehovah of
hosts;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, neither Babylon nor all
other nations have so much power as can resist the infinite power of God, for he
is always like himself, and perfect; he is the God of hosts. He at length adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their strife by litigating he
will litigate</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, by pleading he will
plead the cause of his people, even so as to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cut
off</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or destroy

land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The verb,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[gr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rego, </i>means indeed sometimes to rest, and so almost all give this
rendering, &#8220;so as to make to rest the land:&#8221; but as I take
&#8220;land&#8221; and &#8220;the inhabitants of Babylon&#8221; to be the same,
I doubt not but that this verb is to be taken here in its proper sense. Then it
is, <i>so</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> as to cut off or

<div><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet proceeds with the same subject, and
employs the same manner of speaking. He denounces war on the Chaldeans as a
celestial herald; and then that what he says might have more force and power, he
sets the Persians and the Medes before us in the act of assailing and destroying
Babylon. He therefore says now in general,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A sword on the
Chaldeans</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and, secondly, he mentions
the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>inhabitants of
Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for that city was the seat and
head of the kingdom, as it is well known; but as the power of that monarchy was
deemed by men unassailable, the Prophet adds, that though the chief men excelled
in counsel and strength, and in the art of war, yet a <i>sword would be </i>upon
them; and in the last place, that though Babylon had its diviners, their
knowledge would yet be in vain. He, indeed, uses an honorable name, yet he no
doubt refers to astrologers and soothsayers, and other kinds of prophets. For we
know that the whole nation was given to many superstitions; but they boasted
themselves to be the chief of all astrologers; and hence soothsayers, who
practice their impostures, are called Chaldeans, and it was formerly a common
designation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then the Prophet means, that neither power nor
warlike skill, nor knowledge of any kind, would be a defense to the Chaldeans,
nor the arts in which they gloried, even though they thought that they were
familiarly acquainted with God; for by the stars they were wont to divine
whatever was to be. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He repeats the same thing, but in other words; and in

calls them now by their true and proper name; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ydb</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
bedim, </i>mean mendacious men as well as falsehoods. He then calls those now
impostors to whom he conceded before the name of wise men. But when he called
them wise men, he spoke according to the common opinion, and he was unwilling to
contend with the Chaldeans as to the character of their wisdom: he, however, at
the same time made known the impositions of those who boasted that they had a
familiar intercourse with God and angels, whilst they pronounced by the stars
what was to be.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH73</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> That art itself is indeed worthy of
praise, were men to preserve moderation. But as the curiosity of men is
insatiable, so they wandered here and there, and overleaped all limits, and thus
perverted the whole order of nature. The Chaldeans, then, were not genuine, but,
on the contrary, spurious astrologers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the reason why the Prophet calls them now
liars; for we have before seen, that it was a mere imposition, when the
Chaldeans held that the whole life of man is subject to the influence of the
stars. Hence he exhorted the faithful to fear no dangers from the stars. It is
then no wonder that the Prophet now charges all the diviners with falsehoods,
who yet proudly arrogated to themselves the name of wise men, <i>they shall be
infatuated, </i>he says. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lay</font><font face="Palatino">,

&#8212; that whatever wisdom Babylon arrogated to itself would become folly, and
that the valor in which it prided, would vanish away. For he says, that they

says, that the valiant would not be able to stand when the sword was upon them,

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the same word is used in a different sense: he

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">brj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chereb,</i> &#8220;sword;&#8221; but now by changing only a point, he uses it
in the sense of waste, or drought.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH75</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But as he mentions waters, the Prophet,
no doubt, means drought; nor was it without reason that he mentioned this,
because the Euphrates, as it is well known, flowed near the city, and it was
also divided into many streams, so that there were many islands, as it were,
made by the skill and hand of men. Thus the city was in no ordinary way
fortified, for it was difficult of access, being on one side surrounded by so
large a river: it had also trenches full of water, and it had many channels. But
Cyrus, as Xenophon relates, when attempting to take the city, used the same
contrivance, and imitated those who had fortified Babylon, but for a different
purpose; for he diverted the streams, so that the river might be forded. Thus,
then, he dried up that great river, which was like a sea; so that Babylon was
taken with no great trouble. Cyrus, indeed, entered in by night, and
unexpectedly invaded Babylon, while they were securely feasting, and celebrating
a festival, as we find in the book of Daniel. However, the way by which Cyrus
contrived to take the city was, by dividing the Euphrates into many streams.
Hence it was, that the Prophet, in order that the Jews might see, as it were,
with their own eyes, spoke nothing without reason, having not only predicted the
slaughter and destruction of the city, but showed also the very way in which it
was done, as though the event had been portrayed before them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The reason is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because it is the land of
carvings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or gravings. God, indeed, took
vengeance on Babylon for other things, as it has before appeared; but the
Prophet here speaks of carvings, that the Israelites might know that there is no
certain salvation anywhere else except in the one true God, who had revealed
himself to them. Jeremiah, in short, means, that when any country is destitute
of God&#8217;s help, though it may excel in arms, in number, in wealth, and in
wisdom, yet everything under heaven is of no avail without the blessing and
favor of God. He has spoken of princes and of wise men, and he has named
chariots, horses, and treasures, &#8212; all these have been mentioned for the
purpose I have just stated, even to show, that were we supplied with all that
may seem necessary to defend us, except God protected us, whatever the world may
offer would be all in vain; for we shall at length find, that without God
neither arms, nor chariots, nor wisdom nor counsel, nor any other helps, can
avail us anything.</font><br></div>

boast or to elate one&#8217;s-self, and also to be mad or to dote. Either sense
would not be unsuitable to this place; for the unbelieving gloried in their
idols, and at the same time were mad: yet the first meaning seems to me the
best, that they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gloried in their

<div><font face="Palatino">It was not, indeed, without reason, that the Prophet
reproaches the Chaldeans, that they gloried in their idols, because they thereby
robbed God of his honor; for what is ascribed to idols is taken away from God.
He intimates, in short, that the Chaldeans would be justly punished as guilty of
sacrilege, because they had impiously transferred the glory of God to their own
idols. And this passage teaches us, that when God is purely worshipped among us,
and when true religion flourishes, it will be our best protection. We shall then
be more impregnable than if we had all the power and wealth of the world:
nothing can hurt us, if we give to God his due honor, and strive to worship him
in sincerity and truth. It now follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophets usually speak thus, when they give no

dwelt there, who afterwards lived in great luxury; for the city, under Cyrus and
his son, was always populous; and then, after its revolt, it was again
inhabited; and when Alexander subdued Asia, Babylon was full of people, and
flourished in luxury and wealth; and when he died there, he left the city very
opulent. We hence, then, conclude, that what Jeremiah declares here, was not
immediately fulfilled. But as the light or moderate punishments which the
unbelieving suffer now are certain preludes of final and eternal destruction; so
the Prophets, when speaking of God&#8217;s vengeance, ever extend what they say
to the last overthrow; and this also appears more clearly from the next verse,

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse confirms and explains the previous verse.
But that the design of the Prophet may be more evident, we must remember what
Jude in his epistle (Jude 7) says, that the destruction of Sodom is as it were a
mirror in which we behold God&#8217;s vengeance on all the ungodly. God
overthrew Sodom; but he does not proceed in the same way with other lands and
nations; yet the same is the lot of all the unbelieving, of the despisers of
God, and reprobates; for they<i> </i>are exposed to his vengeance, which they
cannot escape, though it may be for a time suspended. When, therefore, the
Prophet says now that Babylon would be overthrown, as Sodom was overthrown, he
does not mean that this would be after seventy years, when taken by Cyrus and
Darius, nor when retaken after its revolt, nor when taken by Alexander; for it
remained a long time after this, even to the reign of Augustus Caesar. As, then,
it has been so, it follows that our Prophet does not speak of its first, second,
or third assault, but that he had in view what I have already stated, &#8212;
that when God summons the wicked to judgment, it is a certain prelude of eternal
and final destruction. His way with the godly is another; for though God may
sink them down to the grave, nay, to the center of the earth, yet hope is still
left them; hence their death is never like the destruction of Sodom. And to the
same purpose is what we have already quoted from Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Except<i> </i>a seed had been
left us, we should have been as Sodom, and like to Gomorrah.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
1:9)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That exception shows the difference between
God&#8217;s children and the reprobate, even because he often delivers them from
ruin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand the Prophet&#8217;s meaning
when he says that Babylon would become desolate and solitary, so that no
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one would dwell there, nor
remain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH78</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and that<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from age to
age</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or from generation to
generation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, we learn from what is here said, that the
unbelieving are overwhelmed with despair even under the least punishment,
because they see nothing but the vengeance of God; for though God does not
immediately slay them, yet the least puncture denotes what impends over them;
nay, he inflicts a deadly wound when he seems only to touch them lightly. There
is then only one consolation, which can sustain us in our miseries, even to know
that we are separated from the Sodomites through the mercy of God alone; because
we have deserved the same destruction, and the Lord has spared us according to
his infinite goodness. This, then, is the meaning, It follows, &#8212;

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234428&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
44:28; 45:1), nor does he mention the Persians; but he evidently points out the

</i>and lastly, <i>from the sides of the earth. </i>It is indeed certain that
the war was carried on under the banner and command of Cyrus and Darius. Cyrus
was the chief, but Darius, on account of his age, was deemed the king. To whom
then does Jeremiah refer, when he says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>many
kings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>if we so render the words? even
to the satraps or princes, of whom a great number Darius brought with him; for
Cyrus came from remote mountains, and from a barbarous nation; but the kingdom
of Darius was very wide. There is then no doubt but that he brought with him
many kings, who yet obeyed his authority. But we may take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ybr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rebim, </i>in the sense of being strong. However this may be, the Prophet
means that the Chaldeans would have to carry on war, not with one nation or one
king, but with many nations and with many kings, or certainly with mighty kings.
Hence he mentions the <i>sides </i>of the earth, by which phrase he reminds us
that the army would come, not from one country but from remote parts; and though
the distance might be great, yet the Prophet says, that they would all come
together to attack the Chaldeans.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see that what afterwards happened is
represented as in a picture, in order that the event itself might confirm the
Jews, not only in the truth announced by Jeremiah, but also in the whole law and
worship of God; for this prophecy was ratified to the faithful when they found
that Jeremiah, a faithful interpreter of the law, had thus spoken. And then his
doctrine availed also for another purpose, even that the people might know that
they rebelled against God when they obstinately resisted the holy Prophet; for
we know that they were extremely disobedient. They were then proved, by what
happened, to have been guilty of having contended with God in their pertinacious
wickedness and contempt. There was afterwards given them a sure ground of hope;
for as Jeremiah had spoken of the destruction of Babylon, so, on the other hand,
he had promised a return to the Jews. They had then reason to look for
restoration, when they saw fulfilled what Jeremiah had spoken.</font><br></div>

and he made no end of his cruelty, until he at length miserably died, for he
never ceased to shed innocent blood everywhere. But yet the Lord made use of

barbarous nation; and where barbarity rules, there is no feeling of mercy. Cyrus
indeed wished to appear a magnanimous prince, and not a savage; but it is
sufficiently evident that he was very cruel, though Xenophon in his Life speaks
of him otherwise; but he is not a true historian, for he tells many false things

enemy. It is indeed difficult for the minds of all to be so directed in battle,
that they should unitedly attack an enemy and fight as it were with one hand,
and that they should not look on one another, and yet make an united assault.
This, then, is what the Prophet means when he says, that they would be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prepared</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>against the Chaldeans </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as one

</i>would be not only sufficiently strong against ordinary enemies, but also
against the city itself. For had not this been added, Babylon would have ever
been considered as an exception; for it was deemed impregnable on account of the
multitude of men, the height and breadth of its walls, its towers, and all other
defenses. Now, then, God shows that though Babylon proudly exulted in its
forces, and thought itself exempt from every danger, yet the Persians and the
Medes would possess sufficient power by which they would easily overcome it.

<div><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet means by these words, that as soon as the
report of war reached the Chaldeans, they would be so disheartened through fear
as to become like a conquered people. As they had subjected to themselves many
nations, they had acquired the name of being a warlike people; but the Prophet
declares here that they would have no courage, and that therefore there would be
no need of much valor to attack them, as they would of themselves give way and
flee. The sum of what is said is, that the Persians and the Medes would gain the
victory before they fought, for there would be no need of an attack, as their
enemies would flee as being without any courage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet at the same time intimates that in
God&#8217;s hand are the hearts of men, as I have often said, so that they who
seem to excel in great boldness, melt as wax in a moment. For no doubt the
Chaldeans were not wanting in courage to fight until God had rendered them
effeminate, so that they took to flight through fear as soon as they heard the
report respecting their enemies. It is, indeed, true that this was not
immediately the case, for we know that they had long sustained a siege, and that
Belshazzar was slain in the night, while they were securely and joyfully
feasting as in the greatest quietness and peace; but they were at length taken,
so that they had neither wisdom nor confidence; for the king and his princes
were slain, and the city was in a moment taken, as though all the men were
turned into logs of wood or into statues of stone. It

<div><font face="Palatino">We have explained nearly the same words in the last
chapter; for the Prophet not only used the same similitude respecting the
Humans, but also added all the words which are found here; nay, the Prophet
brings forward nothing new to the end of the chapter, but only repeats what we
have seen before.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He first compares either Darius or Cyrus to a lion,
who, at, the overflowing of Jordan, removes to another place. This passage, like
the former, is indeed variously explained. Some read, &#8220;for<i> </i>the
pride of Jordan.&#8221; But as it appears from other places that lions had their
dens near the banks of Jordan, I have no doubt but that the Prophet here
compares Cyrus to, a lion, forced to leave his own lair because of the
inundation of that river. We know how savage a beast is the lion; but, when he
is forced to change his dwelling and to move to another place, his fury rages
the more. It is the same, then, as though he had said, that not any sort of lion
would attack the Babylonians, but a lion furious through rage. He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the strong
habitation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>When he spoke of the
Idumeans, the allusion might have been to their country, which was elevated, and
they had also mountains as their fortresses. But as Babylon was also strongly
fortified, and nearly impregnable on account of fire various streams of the
Euphrates, what the Prophet says is also suitable, that <i>a lion </i>would
<i>come, </i>though there were hindrances which might impede his course; for
when a lion rambles, being not hungry nor forced by any necessity, he can turn
here and there as he pleases; but when rage drives and constrains him, he will
then surmount all obstacles. So also the Prophet says, that how confident soever
Babylon might be in its fortresses, yet Cyrus would break through them, for he
would be like a lion, who, at the<i> </i>overflowing of Jordan, removes
elsewhere, as he can no longer find his wonted dwelling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive the meaning of the words, &#8212;
that the Babylonians would have to do, not with an idle but a terrible enemy,
and with one who would surmount all obstacles, as when fury excites a lion when
necessity drives him as it were headlong.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What follows is obscure. Some render the words thus,
&#8220;When I shall make Israel to rest, then I will make them to flee from
her.&#8221;<i> </i>In the former place
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;244919&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
49:19), we read &#8220;him,&#8221; in the singular,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wnxyra</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aritsnu; but </i>here the Prophet uses the plural number,
&#8220;them,&#8221;<i>
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;xyra</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aritsem; </i>it is yet certain that the meaning is the same. Some, at the
same time, apply this to the <i>Jews, </i>that God would remove them from
Babylon, purposing to give them rest, that is, by<i> </i>dwelling securely in
their own country; but as there is no mention made here of his people, this view
is forced and far-fetched. I omit other explanations, for the meaning of the
Prophet seems to me to be simply this,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When I shall make an
irruption,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or, after I shall have made
them rest, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will make them to
flee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He speaks, as I think, of the
Chaldeans; and the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ki, </i>is to be taken as an adverb of time, <i>when, </i>or <i>after. </i>It
is, indeed, often a causative, but it has sometimes this
meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, these two clauses may be thus explained:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When I shall make an
irruption,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or, when I shall have made
them rest; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[gr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rego, </i>means both to break and to rest. It is here in the active or
causative conjugation, in <i>Hiphil. </i>If, then, we read, &#8220;After<i>
</i>I shall have made them to rest,&#8221; the sense will be that the:
Babylonians had been long tranquil, as there was no one who infested them or
disturbed their peace; and we know that men having long rested in their idleness
and sloth, become almost stupefied, so that they are touched with no fear. God
then shows that the Babylonians were greatly mistaken, if they thought that the
rest which they had previously enjoyed would be perpetual; for he would make
them to flee from the city, though they had been long there in a tranquil state.
The other sense is by no means unsuitable, &#8220;When<i> </i>I shall
break,&#8221; or make an irruption, then all will flee away, that is, leave the
city, which was before like a paradise. There is still no doubt but that the
Prophet here denounces on the Babylonians a sudden overthrow, which would drive
the people here and there in all directions.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH80</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It now follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is the chosen
</i></font><font face="Palatino">one
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whom I shall set over her?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">God here in a manner deliberates as to the
person whom he should make the leader of the war against the Chaldeans; and by
these words he intimates that there would be ready for him the best general, and
one especially active and also excelling in the art of war. And we know that
even the unwilling are made to serve God, when he employs the ungodly as his
scourges. In short, God shows that though the Babylonians might have brave
leaders and most skillful in war, there yet would be prepared leaders, to whom
he would commit the office<i> </i>of taking that city. And thus he teaches us at
the same time that men are ruled by his hand, so that he chooses them according
to his will and directs them to any work he pleases,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is the chosen
</i></font><font face="Palatino">one, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whom I shall set over her?
</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and who is like me?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet shows that the Babylonians in
vain trusted in their own defenses; for after having tried all things, they
would find that whatever was set up against God and his invincible power, would
be mere smoke. This sentence often occurs; and however common it may appear,
yet, if we examine ourselves, we shall find that the Holy Spirit does not so
often enforce it without reason; for after we have confessed that none is equal
to God or can add to his power, &#8212; as soon as any trial assails us, this
confession vanishes, and we tremble as though God was nothing, and had no power
to bring us help. Diffidence, then, which often creeps in when we are in
difficulties or dangers, sufficiently shows that we do not attribute to God the
praise due to his power. He does not then exclaim here, as in other places,
without reason, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is like me?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">as though he had said, that the Babylonians
would foolishly seek auxiliaries here and there; for when they had made the
utmost exertions, whatever they might think the most useful would all vanish
away, so that they would be destitute of all remedies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And who will protest against
me?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some give this frigid version,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who will prescribe
to</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>me the time? but they wholly pervert
the meaning of the Prophet; for God in this place declares, that men would in
vain contend or litigate with him. It is the same as if he had said,
&#8220;Though all men were to rise up against, me, yet I will not allow them to
litigate with me; and this they would also do in vain.&#8221; In short, God
intimates that men would in vain clamor against his judgments, for he would
nevertheless perform what he has decreed. He does not yet claim for himself that
absolute power about which the sophists prattle, while they separate it from
justice; but he intimates that the causes are not always manifest to men when he
executes his judgments; for it is not without reason that the<i> </i>Scripture
testifies that God&#8217;s judgments are a deep abyss; but by such an expression
it is not meant that anything in God&#8217;s judgments is confused or in
disorder, what then? even that God works in an extraordinary manner, and that
hence his judgments are sometimes hidden from men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then God briefly shows, that though the Babylonians
were to dispute, and start many objections, all this would be useless, because
he would execute what he had decreed, and that without
debating.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then learn from these words, that when
God&#8217;s works have the appearance of being unreasonable, we ought humbly to
admire them, and never to judge them according to our computation; for God is
not to be judged by us. Therefore, as I have already said, we are then only
wise, when we humbly adore him in all his works, without disputing with him; for
when we adduce all possible things, he will close our mouth with one word, and
check all our presumption; nay, he will ever overcome us by being silent, for
his justice will always overthrow whatever may come to our minds. But we must
bear in mind what I have stated, that God never so acts by his absolute power as
to separate it from his justice; for this would be as it were to wound himself;
for these things are undivided, his power and justice, though justice often does
not appeal however this may be, his sole and simple will is to us the rule of
all justice.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And who is that shepherd who will
stand before me? </i></font><font face="Palatino">He alludes to the similitude
he had used, for he compared himself before to a lion. he says now, &#8220;Since
I shall go against Babylon like a lion, what shepherd will dare to oppose
me?&#8221; We see that there is to be understood a contrast, between a lion and
a shepherd; for God would be like a lion to destroy Babylon; hence, by pastor,
he denotes any adversary who might come forth to defend the Chaldean flock. It

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet confirms his previous doctrine, and uses
an oath, for he had already spoken sufficiently at large of the destruction of
Babylon, and his words might seem otherwise superfluous, because the subject had
been explained with abundant clearness. But he introduces God here as making an
oath, for the particles, &#8220;if<i> </i>not,&#8221;
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">al
&#181;a</font><font face="Palatino">,<i> am la, </i>show the sentence to be

God swears, that the Babylonians were already given up to destruction, so that
even the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>least of the flock
</i></font><font face="Palatino">would be superior to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is not without reason that the Prophet speaks
here of the <i>counsel </i>of God and of his <i>thoughts; </i>for we know that
men through their own vanity are held suspended or in doubt, so that they do not
firmly acquiesce in God&#8217;s word, at least they vacillate so as to have no
stability of faith. As, then, men think in themselves that possibly a thing may
happen otherwise than according to the words of the prophets, Jeremiah does here
meet such thoughts, and bids men to <i>hear </i>the <i>counsel </i>of God and
his <i>thoughts. </i>It is, indeed, a mode of speaking transferred from men,
when he speaks of the thoughts of God; for we know that God does not deliberate
on what he is about to do, as the case is with men. But this manner of speaking
so frequently occurs, that it ought to be familiar to us. However this may be,
he intimates that God did not in vain announce terror when speaking of Babylon,
but that the irrevocable decree was declared which God had formed. Hence he
says, that he had already taken counsel, so that men need not deliberate any
more, nor call into question his fixed decree, nor dispute concerning his
thoughts. There is, then, no reason for men to revolve things in themselves, and
to adopt different views; because events must be, he says, as I have predicted;
God then has commanded me to announce this prophecy as brought forth from his
counsel, which can by no means be changed. This is the reason why he mentions
God&#8217;s counsel and thoughts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If they shall not draw them

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bjs</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sacheb, </i>means to draw; and there is no doubt but that the Prophet denotes
by this verb contempt and reproach; as carcasses are drawn through the mud, or a
dead dog is drawn and cast into a river; so now, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Draw forth the Babylonians shall
the least of the flock</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But how can
these things agree together, that there was to be the choicest leader, and that
yet the least of the flock would be the conquerors? God intimates, that though
he would endow Cyrus with warlike valor, yet if it pleased him, there would be
means by which he could destroy the Babylonians, were he to send sheep or lambs
as their enemies. He means, in a word, that the Babylonians would be unwarlike,
when God deprived them of their courage.</font><br></div>

would be, for it would, by its noise, make the whole world to tremble: it would

with many figures, and to inculcate with many repetitions what had been already
said, and also to confirm by many reasons what no one hardly
admitted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I
will</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. God is made the speaker, that
the word might have more force and power.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will raise up a
destroying wind </i></font><font face="Palatino">against the Chaldeans. The
similitude of wind is very appropriate, for God thus briefly reminded them how
easy it was for him to destroy the whole world even by a single blast. The wind
is, indeed, indirectly set in opposition to instruments of war; for when any one
seeks to overcome an enemy, he collects many and strong forces, and procures
auxiliaries on every side; in short, he will not dare to attempt anything
without making every possible preparation. As, then, men dare not attack their
enemies without making strenuous efforts, God here extols his own power, because
it is enough for him to raise up a <i>wind. </i>We now, then, perceive the
design of the similitude, when he says, that he would raise up a wind that would
destroy or scatter the Chaldeans.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the following words there is an obscurity;
literally, they are, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the

for instance, the country of the Chaldeans. But the relative,

occur, we are compelled to read, <i>and

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>inhabitants of the
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>metaphorically, as meaning those
who gloried in their own wisdom? for the Babylonians, as it is well known,
thought other men dull and foolish, and were so pleased with their own
astuteness, as though they were fortified by inclosures on every side. They
dwelt then in their own heart, that is, they thought themselves well fortified
around through their own wisdom. In this sense the Prophet seems to call the
Babylonians </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the inhabitants of

the cause of his Church, and therefore complained that war was made on him by
the ungodly, whenever they molested the faithful. It is also at the same time
generally true, that all who arrogate to themselves wisdom rise up against God,
because they rob God of the honor due to him. But it ought properly to be
referred to the union which exists between God and his Church, when he charges
the Chaldeans, that they <i>rose up </i>against him. It

<div><font face="Palatino">Here he explains himself more clearly, without the
metaphor he had used. He no longer uses the similitude of wind when he declares
that he would send

<i>zarim, </i>in the sense of aliens, who would banish her; but this would be
harsh. I then doubt not but that the Prophet alludes to the wind before
mentioned. He does not indeed continue that metaphor; but yet what he says
corresponds with it. Instead of wind he now mentions fanners, or winnowers; but
this cannot be understood except of enemies. A clearer explanation is still
found in the word <i>empty, </i>after having said that the Persians and the
Medes would <i>fan </i>or winnow Babylon. He compares her, no doubt, to chaff.
As then the chaff, when ventilated, falls on the ground, so he says a similar
thing would happen to the Babylonians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall make empty her

remaining. And he confirms this declaration,

<div><font face="Palatino">It often happens that men stealthily escape, when
pressed by their enemies; for though enemies may watch all passages, yet they
often do not find out all hiding-places. But the Prophet says, that their

with them anything which they might save from their enemies&#8217; hands. He
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the day of
evil.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this phrase he intimates again,
that the Chaldeans were already devoted by God to destruction. It is, then, the

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shows here the cause why God had resolved
to treat the Babylonians with so much severity, even because he would be the
avenger of his own people. He also obviates a doubt which might have disturbed
weak minds, for he seemed to have forsaken his people when he suffered them to
be driven into exile. As this was a kind of repudiation, as we have seen
elsewhere, the Prophet says now, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel
had</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>not been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wholly widowed, nor Judah, by his
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though he had said, that the
Jews and the Israelites were indeed, for a time, like widows, but this was not
to be perpetual. For, as we have said, the divorce was temporary, when God so
forsook his Temple and the city, that the miserable people was exposed to
plunder. As long, then, as the will of their enemies prevailed, God seemed to
have forsaken his people. It is of this widowhood that the Prophet now speaks;
but he yet testifies that Israel would not be wholly widowed by Jehovah his
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He indeed alludes to that spiritual marriage, of
which frequent mention is made; for God had, from the beginning, united the
Church to himself, as it were, by a marriage-bond; and the people, as it is well
known, had been so received into covenant, that there was contracted, as it
were, a spiritual marriage. Then the Prophet now says, that they were not
widowed; in which he refers to the hope of deliverance; for it could not have
been denied but that God had repudiated his people. But he shows that their
chastisement would not be perpetual, because God would at length reconcile to
himself the people from whom he had been alienated, and would restore them to
the ancient condition and honor of a wife. He speaks of both
kingdoms.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by Jehovah of
hosts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By this title he sets forth the
power of God, as though he had said, that as God is faithful in his promises,
and constantly keeps his covenant, so he is not destitute of power, so as not to
be able to save his people and to rescue them, when it pleases him, from death
itself. He confirms this truth, when he says, for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the land
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of the Chaldeans
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is filled with sin on account of
the Holy One of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as though he had
said, that the land was abominable, because it carried on war against God.: For
when he speaks of the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Holy One of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he shows that God had such a
care for his people that he was prepared, when the suitable time came, to show
himself as their avenger. We now perceive what the Prophet means when he says,
that Chaldea was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>filled with
sin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>even because it provoked God when
it thought that the wrong was done only to men.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino">He goes on with the same subject, but illustrates it
by various figures; for otherwise he would not have penetrated into the hearts
of the godly. Were any at this day to predict the destruction of Rome, it could
hardly be believed; and yet we know that it has in our life been stormed, and
now it hangs as it were by a thread, though hitherto it has been supported and
fortified by the greatest forces. But the dignity of the city so confounded the
minds of men, that it was hardly credible that it could have been so soon
subverted. How, then, was it possible for such a thing to have happened at that
time? for Babylon was the mistress of the East. The Assyrians had previously
possessed the empire; but they had been subdued, and had, as it were, been
brought under the yoke. As, then, Babylon now flourished in power so great and
invincible, Jeremiah seemed to be labeling when he spoke of its approaching
destruction. It was hence necessary that what he said should be confirmed, as it
is now done. And so he now turns to foreigners and guests, and exhorts them to
flee lest they should perish in the accursed city.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Flee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the midst of
Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But there was then no safer
place in the land; for had all the regions of the world been shaken, yet Babylon
would have been deemed beyond any danger. But he says that all guests were to
flee from the midst of it, if they wished to save their lives. Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lest ye perish in her
iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He assigns a reason why those
who then dwelt in Babylon could not be safe except they fled, even because God
was about to punish the city for its iniquities. He then sets the iniquity of
Babylon in opposition to the multitude of its men, as well as to its wealth and
defenses, and other means of strength. Babylon was populous; it might also be
aided by many auxiliaries; and there were ready at hand those who might hire
their services. As, then, there was nothing wanting to that city, the Prophet
here shows that wealth and abundance of people, and all other helps would be of
no moment, because it was God&#8217;s will to punish her iniquity. This is the
reason why Jeremiah now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lest ye perish in her
iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, &#8220;do<i> </i>not
mingle with those ungodly men whom God has given up to
destruction.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And for the same purpose he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For it is the time of the
vengeance of Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here, again, he
obviates an objection; for as God had suspended his judgment, no one thought it
possible that a fire could so soon, and, as it were, in a moment be kindled to
destroy Babylon. Then the Prophet says, that it was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
time</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>by which he intimates, that though
God does not immediately execute his judgments, yet he does not he down as it
were idly, so as to forget what he has to do, but that he has his own times. And
this doctrine deserves to be noticed, because through our intemperate zeal we
make much ado, except God brings us help as soon as we are injured; but if he
delays even a short time, we complain and think that he has forgotten our
welfare. And even saints, in depositing familiarly their cares and anxieties in
his bosom, speak thus,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, we are by nature inclined to impatience, we
ought to observe what Scripture so often inculcates, even this &#8212; that God
has his certain and fixed times for punishing the wicked. Hence Jeremiah now
teaches us, that the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>time of
God&#8217;s vengeance </i></font><font face="Palatino">was
come.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A reward will he render to
her</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>as though he had said, that though
Babylon would not have to suffer punishment immediately, yet she would not
escape from God&#8217;s hand, for the reward which God would render her was
already prepared. And this doctrine arises from a general principle, that God
will ever render to every one his just reward. We now, then, perceive the design
of the Prophet.</font><br></div>

from superstitions and the defilements of the world; for the Prophet means no
such thing. A passage might, however, be made from one truth to another. It now

<div><font face="Palatino">Here again he anticipates an objection which might
have been made; for we know that the kingdoms of the world neither rise nor
stand, except through the will of God; as, then, the Prophet threatens
destruction to Babylon, this objection was ready at hand. &#8220;How comes it,
then, that this city, which thou sayest is accursed, has hitherto so greatly
flourished? for who hath honored Babylon with so great dignity, with so much
wealth, and with so many victories? for it has not by chance happened that this
monarchy has been elevated so high; for not only all Assyria has been brought,
under its yoke, but also the kingdom of Israel, and the kingdom of Judah is not
far from its final ruin.&#8221; To this the Prophet answers, and says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Babylon was a cup in God&#8217;s
hand to inebriate the earth;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as though
he had said, that God was by no means inconsistent with himself when he employed
the Babylonians as his scourges, and when he now chastises them in their turn.
And he shows also, that when things thus revolve in the world, they do not
happen through the blind force of chance, but through the secret judgments of
God, who so governs the world, that he often exalts even the ungodly to the
highest power, when his purpose is to execute through them his
judgments.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, understand the design of this passage;
for otherwise what the Prophet says might seem abrupt. Having said that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>time of God&#8217;s
vengeance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>had already come, he now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A golden cup is in God&#8217;s
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; &#8212; </i>to<i> </i>what purpose was
this added? By what has been stated, it appears evident how aptly the words run,
how sentences which seem to be wide asunder fitly unite together; for a doubt
might have crept in as to this, how could it be that God should thus bestow his
benefits on this city, and then in a short time destroy it. As, then, it seems
unreasonable that God should vary in his doings, as though he was not consistent
with himself, the Prophet on the other hand reminds us, that when such changes
happen, God does in no degree change his purposes; for he so regulates the
government of the world, that those whom he favors with remarkable benefits, he
afterwards destroys, they being worthy of punishment on account of their
ingratitude, and that he does not without reason or cause use them for a time as
scourges to chastise the wickedness of others. And it is for this reason, as I
think, that he calls it </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a golden
cup</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for God seemed to pour forth his
benefits on the Babylonians as with a full hand. When, therefore, the splendor
of that city and of the monarchy was so great, all things were there as it were
golden.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says, that it was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a golden
cup</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>but
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the hand of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By saying that it was in
God&#8217;s hand, he intimates that the Babylonians were not under the
government of chance, but were ruled by God as he pleased, and also that their
power, though very great, was yet under the restraint of God, so that they did
nothing but by his permission, and even by his command.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds how God purposed to carry this cup
in his hand, a cup so splendid as it were of gold; his will was that it should
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>inebriate the whole
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>These are metaphorical words; for
the Prophet speaks here, no doubt, of punishments which produce a kind of fury
or madness. When God then designed to take vengeance on all these nations, he
inebriated them with evils, and this he did by the Babylonians. For this reason,
therefore, Babylon is said to have been the golden cup which God extended with
his own hand, and gave it to be drunk by all nations. This similitude has also
been used elsewhere, when Jeremiah spoke of the Idumeans,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;All<i> </i>drank of the cup, yea,
drank of it to the dregs, so that they were inebriated,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;244912&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
49:12)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He there also called the terrible punishment that was
coming on the Idumeans the cup of fury. Thus, then, were many nations inebriated
by the Babylonians, because they were so oppressed, that their minds were
infatuated, as it were, with troubles; for we know that men are stupefied with
adversities, as though they were not in a right mind. In this way Babylon
inebriated many nations, because it so oppressed them that they were reduced to
a state of rage or madness; for they were not in a composed state of mind when
they were miserably distressed.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH84</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To the same purpose is what is added:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The nations who drank of her cup
became mad. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Here he shows that the punishments
were not ordinary, by which divers nations were chastised by the Babylonians,
but such as deprived them of mind and judgment, as it is usually the case, as I
have just said, in extreme evils.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, this passage teaches us, that when the
wicked exercise their power with great display, yet God overrules all their
violence, though not apparently; nay, that all the wicked, while they seem to
assume to themselves the greatest license, are yet guided, as it were, by the
hand of God, and that when they oppress their neighbors, it is done through the
secret providence of God, who thus inebriates all who deserve to be punished. At
the same time, the Prophet implies, that the Babylonians oppressed so many
nations neither by their own contrivance, nor by their own strength; but because
it was the Lord&#8217;s will that they should be inebriated: otherwise it would
have greatly perplexed the faithful to think that no one could be found stronger
than the Babylonians. Hence the Prophet in effect gives this answer, that all
the nations could not have been overcome, had not the Lord given them to drink
the wine of fury and madness. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now declares that the fall of Babylon
would be sudden, that the faithful might understand that God could accomplish in
one moment what he had decreed. For when the prophets spoke of God&#8217;s
judgments, the people questioned among themselves, how could that be which
surpassed the common ideas of men. That men, therefore, might not estimate
God&#8217;s power according to their own thoughts, he introduces this word,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>suddenly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>as though he had said, that God had no need of warlike forces; for though he
makes no preparations, yet he can subvert every power that exists in the
world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Howl for
her</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and this is said, because it could
not be but that many nations would either bewail the ruin of so great a monarch,
or be astonished at her, and thus many things would be said. He then says, that
though the whole world were to howl for Babylon, it would yet fall and be
suddenly broken, whenever it pleased God. And he says, by way of irony,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take balm, if peradventure it can
be healed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yrx</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tsari, </i>is, by some, rendered <i>balsam, </i>but it means rosin, for we
know that it was deemed precious in Judea; and the Prophet no doubt accommodated
what he said to what was commonly known. As then that medicament was in common
use among the Jews, he now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take
rosin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As there is hardly any country
which has not its peculiar remedies; so we see that Jeremiah refers not to what
was usually done at Babylon, or to medicaments used by the Chaldeans, but to
what was commonly used in his own country, as it appears from other places. Now
rosin was a juice which flowed from trees, and it was a thick juice. The best
rosin which we now use is from the terebinth; but in these parts they have what
proceeds from the fir, for here the terebinth is not found. But Judea had a most
valuable rosin, as we learn from many parts of Scripture. And under this one
thing is included everything, <i>Take rosin; </i>as though he had said,
&#8220;Let<i> </i>physicians come together (otherwise she will perish) from
every place, if <i>peradventure she can be healed.</i>&#8221;<i> </i>This is
said ironically, that the faithful might know that the diseases of Babylon would
be incurable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have said elsewhere, that Babylon was not wholly
demolished when taken by Cyrus, and that the people were not then driven away.
They dwelt there as usual, though made tributary, as they were afterwards, under
the dominion of the Persians. Babylon was also grievously oppressed, when
punished for its revolt, until what Jeremiah and others prophesied was
fulfilled. Then the time of which he speaks ought not to be confined to one
calamity only, which was only a prelude to others still greater. He afterwards
adds, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet assumes different characters; he speaks
here in the person of those who of themselves brought help to the Babylonians.
And many, no doubt, would have been ready to assist them, had King Belshazzar
wished to accept aid; and we know also, that the city had a large army. He
compares, then, the nations subject to the Babylonians, and also the hired and
foreign soldiers, to physicians, as though he had said, &#8220;Babylon has been,
with great care, healed.&#8221; As when a great prince is taken ill, he sends
here and there for the best and most skillful physicians; but when the disease
is incurable, they all strive in vain to save his life: so now the Prophet
speaks, using a metaphor; but he speaks in the person of those who either had
set to hire their services, or had come from a sense of duty to heal Babylon.
&#8220;See,&#8221;<i> </i>they said, &#8220;the<i> </i>fault is not with us, for
we have faithfully and carefully done our best to heal her, but she has not been
healed.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Leave her, and let us depart,

language of foreign soldiers and mercenaries. When they saw that the safety of
the city was hopeless, they began to counsel one another, &#8220;What<i> </i>do
we? Ought we not rather to consult our own safety? for our efforts are wholly
useless. It is then time for every one to return to his own country, for the end
of Babylon is come.&#8221; But the change of person has much more force than if
the Prophet had spoken thus, &#8220;The time shall come when the auxiliaries
shall flee away, for they will see that it would be all in vain to defend
her.&#8221; But when he compares them to physicians, this similitude more fully
illustrates the case; and then when he speaks in their person, this renders what
is said still more emphatieal.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at length adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For her judgment has reached to
the heavens</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, and has
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>been elevated to the
clouds.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Jeremiah could not have properly
addressed what he said to the unbelieving, if you explain this of God being
adverse and hostile to the Babylonians; for it never occurred to the hired
soldiers, </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">that Babylon perished through the just judgment of
God. But the Prophet, according to a usual mode of speaking, says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Her judgment
</i></font><font face="Palatino">(that is, her destruction)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reached to the heavens, and has
been elevated to the clouds;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, no
aid shall be found under heaven, which can deliver Babylon, &#8212; how so?
because it will be the same as though destruction came from heaven itself, and
from the clouds. For when danger is nigh either from behind or from before us,
we can turn aside either to the right hand or to the left, so that we may escape
the evils which men may bring on us: but when heaven itself seems to threaten
our heads, then an escape is attempted in vain. This then is the reason why the
Prophet says that the judgment of Babylon had reached to the heavens and had
been elevated to the clouds.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here addresses the faithful, and
especially shows, that the ruin of Babylon would be a sure evidence of
God&#8217;s paternal favor towards his Church. And it was no common consolation
to the faithful, in their extreme miseries, to know, that so dear and precious
to God was their salvation, that he would by no means spare the Babylonians,
whom the whole world regarded as half gods; for, as I have said, the power of
that monarchy filled the minds of men with astonishment. When the faithful,
then, knew that the Babylonians were to perish, because they had oppressed and
cruelly treated them, an invaluable consolation, as I have said, must hence have
been conveyed to them. The Prophet then reminds us here, that it would be a
singular testimony as to God&#8217;s favor to his Church, when he subverted
Babylon, and he also exhorts the faithful to gratitude: for it is the design of
all God&#8217;s benefits, that his name may be celebrated by us, according to
what David says:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;What shall I render to the Lord

<div><font face="Palatino">He then says, first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Brought forth hath Jehovah our
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here, some anxiously toil
to untie a knot, where there is none; for fearing lest the word, righteousness,
should be laid hold on for the purpose of setting up merits, they say that
righteousness is the remission of sins. Then they thus explain the words of the
Prophet,&#8221; God has at length unfolded his mercy towards us, and it is our
righteousness when all our iniquities are buried.&#8221; But this is forced.
When the Prophet speaks here of righteousnesses, he does not mean the merits by
which the Jews were to obtain what had been promised to them; but
righteousnesses he calls their good cause with regard to the Babylonians. For
righteousness has various meanings; and when a comparison is made between men,
God is said to bring forth our righteousness, when he vindicates our integrity
from the calumnies of the wicked. So Jacob said,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The Lord will bring forth my
righteousness as the
dawn.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;013033&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis

<div><font face="Palatino">But in this sense our righteousness has a reference
to our adversaries. So whenever David asked of God to regard his righteousness,
he no doubt compared himself with his enemies. And righteousness here is to be
taken simply with reference to the Babylonians. For though God had punished the
Jews as they<i> </i>deserved, yet<i> </i>as to the Babylonians they were cruel
tyrants and wicked robbers. The cause, then, of the chosen people was just, with
regard to them. This is the reason why he <i>says, </i>that God

Prophet, when he says, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousnesses
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of the people had been brought to light; and we
said, that the word righteousnesses does not refer to God, as though the Jews
had deserved a reward, but is, on the contrary, to be understood of a just cause
as to the Chaldeans, who, being impelled by avarice and pride alone, had made
war against the Church, and without any right, had tyrannically oppressed the
people. As far, then, as it was God&#8217;s will to defend his people, it was a
just cause. Nor is there any need of having here, a long dispute respecting
this, &#8212; how could the people be just, who had, by so many iniquities,
provoked the wrath of God; for, as we have already said, he does not treat now
of their merits, but. of a right which depended on the faithfulness and
protection of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now exhorts the faithful to gratitude; he
would have them at the same time to rise up to the hope of deliverance, and to
cherish the promises which he had given them, when he says, <i>Come, </i>as
though he would set before their eyes the gift of redemption. He also shows the
end, even that the people were to celebrate the grace of God, as though he had
said, that the people, after having obtained mercy, ought to have this in view,
to worship God again in his Temple; as though he had said, that when God
restored his Church, his pure and true worship should, at the same time, be
restored; for the design of his grace is religion, and not the honor or dignity
of the people. This is the reason why he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come and let us declare in Sion
the work of Jehovah our God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now, when
Peter treats of a better redemption, he says, that those who are delivered from
the kingdom of darkness ought to set forth the unspeakable praises of God.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that he might more fully express that men&#8217;s minds are ruled and turned
by the secret power of God, and also that whatever power or boldness is found in
them, proceeds altogether from God; as though he had said, that God would so
prepare the Medes and the Persians, that he would not only strengthen their
arms, hands, and feet, for the war, but would also lead them, and overrule their
passions &#8212; that he would, in short, turn their spirit here and there,
according to his will. He does not now speak of the wind, as before; nor does he
point out the enemies generally, but expressly names the Medes. For though
Cyaxares, or Darius, as he is called by Daniel, was not a very prudent man, nor
skillful in war, yet, as he was higher in dignity, the Prophet here mentions the
Medes rather than the Persians. Cyrus excelled in celerity, and was also a man
of singular wariness, activity, and boldness: but as he was by no means wealthy,
and ruled over a rustic nation, and the limits of his kingdom were confined, the
Prophet rightly speaks here of the Medes only, whose power far exceeded that of
the Persians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we hence learn, that Jeremiah did not speak as a
man, but was the instrument of the Spirit; for it was an indubitable seal to his
prophecy, that he predicted an event a long time before the war took place.
Cyrus was not yet born, who was the leader in this war: nor was Darius as yet
born; for seventy years elapsed from the time the Prophet spoke to the taking of
Babylon. We then see that this passage is a sure proof of his faithfulness and
authority.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds, that God&#8217;s
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thought respecting Babylon
</i></font><font face="Palatino">was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to destroy
her</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He still speaks after the manner of
men, and at the same time obviates an objection which might have disturbed weak
minds, because Babylon not only remained safe and secure for a long time, but
also received an increase of power and dignity. The minds then of the godly
might have desponded, when there seemed to be no accomplishment of this
prophecy. Hence the Prophet calls attention to the <i>thought </i>of God, as
though he had said, that though God did not immediately put forth his hand, if,
was yet enough for the faithful to know what he had decreed. in short, the
Prophet reminded, them, that they ought to acquiesce in God&#8217;s decree,
though his work was yet hid.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he again confirms the Jews, by adding, that it
would be his <i>vengeance, </i>even that of God, because he disregarded not his
<i>Temple. </i>By these words he intimates that the worship, according to the
law, was pleasing to God, because the Jews became a distinct people from heathen
nations, when the rule as to religion was prescribed to them. Then the Prophet
intimates, that though any sort of religion pleased men, there is yet but one
which is approved by God, even that which he himself has commanded. The case
being so, we may conclude, that God cannot long endure his worship to be scoffed
at. For we know how scornfully and proudly the Chaldeans spoke of the Temple, so
that they not only uttered blasphemies, but also heaped every reproach they
could think of on the Temple. Since that religion was founded on God&#8217;s
word, it follows that it could not be but that he must have at length risen and
vindicated the wrongs done to him by the Chaldeans. We now perceive the meaning
of the Prophet, when he says, that it would be the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>vengeance of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because God will avenge his
temple</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He confirms the Jews, when he
declares that God would be the vindicator of his own worship; and he, at the
same time, shows, that the worship according to the law, which had been taught
by Moses, was the only worship in the world which God approved. It afterwards
follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">These words seem to have been addressed to the
Chaldeans rather than to the Medes or the Persians, as some expound them; for
this is favored by the context; for as he bids them first to raise a standard on

the Persians and the Medes, but must be referred to the besieged, as being most
suitable to them. I do not then doubt but that the Prophet here treats, with a
taunt, all the efforts the Chaldeans would make for the defense of their city.
For not only they who attack a city raise a standard, but also they who are
besieged, and this as a sign of confidence, in order to show that they possess
sufficient courage to check their enemies, and to sustain all their attacks. It
was then the design of the Prophet to show, that however strenuously the
Chaldeans might defend themselves, yet all their exertions would be in vain,
because God would, without labor, destroy the city.</font><br></div>

He says again that God had <i>thought, </i>lest the faithful should imagine that
he heedlessly casts forth threatenings; for this thought often occurs to the
mind, that God terrifies without effecting anything, Hence the Prophet, that he
might more fully confirm his prophecy<i>, </i>says, that the thing had been
meditated upon by God; and we said yesterday that God does not deliberate with
himself like men; but as we cannot otherwise understand the certainty and
unchangeableness of his secret counsel, nor form an idea of the validity of his
decrees<i>, </i>the word <i>thought </i>is mentioned. The Prophet, in short,
means, that he brought forth nothing but what God had decreed. For words are
often heedlessly uttered, and the reality and the words are not always
connected; but Jeremiah testifies that he had taken what he announced from the
hidden and immutable counsel of God. Then he adds, <i>what he hath spoken </i>or
said; and this refers to his doctrine or his prediction. It follows, &#8212;

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tnk&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shekenet, </i>a dweller; and the passage is more clear when we take it as the
title of Babylon. And he says that she was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a dweller among
waters</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because the Euphrates not only
flowed by the city, (and we know that it was a very large river,) but it
surrounded it; and it, was indeed divided above Babylon into many streams, so
that it made as it were many islands, and thus access to the city was more
difficult. This circumstance served not only for a defense to it, but also for
other advantages.: For these streams or channels were navigable; and the land
also was made more fertile by the irrigation they supplied. Thus these streams
contributed to its wealth as well as to its defense in time of war. And though
Babylon was deemed on this account impregnable, and was also a very fertile
land, yet the Prophet says here that its
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>end was
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, except he had made this preface, that Babylon
was situated among the rivers or many waters, and that it was also a city full
of wealth, all this might have seemed a hindrance to prevent God from executing
on it his vengeance; for this objection was ready at hand, &#8220;How<i> </i>can
Babylon be taken, which is seated between many waters? for without great force
and number of soldiers it cannot but remain in safety, since it is protected by
so many rivers.&#8221; Then another objection might have been brought forward,
that Babylon was an opulent city, so that it could hire auxiliaries on every
side, and that having such abundance of money, it would never be unprotected.
Hence the Prophet here mentions these two things; but what he says ought to be
taken adversatively, as if he said, &#8220;Though thou dwellest among many
waters, and art great in treasures, that is, hast large treasures, yet
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thine end is
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.&#8221;</i></font><br></div>

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tma</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>amet,</i> &#8220;<i>end</i>,&#8221;<i> </i>but improperly; and the Prophet
has not without reason introduced the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tma</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>amet, </i>which properly means a cubit, but is to be taken here for measure.
<i>Jerome </i>renders it &#8220;a<i> </i>foot,&#8221; a word in use in his age.
But the meaning is sufficiently clear, that though Babylon had exhausted all the
wealth of the world as an insatiable gulf, yet
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the measure of her
cupidity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>would come. For the cupidity of
that nation was unlimited, but God at length brought it to an end &#8212; not
that they were amended, but that God checked their coveting. And according to
this sense the Prophet says, that though they had been hitherto devouring the
wealth of many countries, yet the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>measure of her cupidity was
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>even because the Lord would take
away, together with the monarchy, the power and opportunity of doing wrong. For
the Chaldeans were able to act licentiously, when they had so many nations
subject to them; but the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>measure</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of their cupidity was come, when God in a manner cut off their strength, not
that they then desisted, or that their rapacious disposition was amended &#8212;
for they changed not their nature; but cupidity is to be referred here to its
exercise, even because their power was then taken from them, so that they could
not carry on their plunders as they had used to do. He afterwards adds, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet more fully confirms what he had said by
introducing God as making an oath; and it is the most solemn manner of
confirmation when God swears by his own name. But he speaks of God in the
language of men when he says that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>swears by his own
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for it is a kind of protestation
when men swear by their own souls, as though they laid down or pledged their own
life. Whoever then swears by his own soul, means that as his own life is dear to
him, he thus lays it down as a pledge, that were he to deceive by perjury, God
would be an avenger and take it away. This is suitable to men, not to God; but
what does not properly belong to God is transferred to him; nor is this
uncommon, as we have seen it in other places. And the more familiar is the
manner of speaking adopted by God, the more it ought to touch men when he makes
himself like them, and in a manner assumes their person as though he lived in
the midst of them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must still remember why the Prophet introduces
God as making an oath, even that all doubtfulness might be removed, and that
more credit might be given to his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophecy</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
for it not only proceeded from God, but was also sealed by an oath.

locusts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The multitude of enemies is here opposed to the
multitude of the citizens, which was very large. For we have said elsewhere that
Babylon surpassed all other cities, nor was it less populous than if it were all
extensive country. As then it was full of so many defenders, it might have been
objected and said, &#8220;Whence can come such a number of enemies as can be
sufficient to put to flight the inhabitants? for were a large army to enter, it
would yet be in great danger in contending with so vast a multitude.&#8221; But
the Prophet compares here the Persians and the Medes to locusts; and we know
that Cyrus collected from various nations a very large army, nay, many armies.
Fulfilled then was what had been predicted by the Prophet, for Cyrus made up his
forces not only from one people, but he brought with him almost all the Medes,
and also led many troops from other barbarous nations. Hence then it happened,
that what had been said by Jeremiah was proved by the event.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He also adds, that they would be victorious; for by
the</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> vintage

or shout of triumph. But this song,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ddyh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>eidad, </i>was then in use among the Jews. Then as they did after vintage
sing in token of joy, so also conquerors, exulting after victory over their
enemies, had a triumphant song. And the Greek translators have rendered it

</i>or
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">keleuma</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

with joy and sing, because they have been delivered from the dangers of the Sea,
and also have completed their sailing, which is always perilous, and have come
to the harbor where they more fully enjoy life, where they have pleasant air,
wholesome water, and other advantages. But the simple meaning of the Prophet is,
that when the Persians and the Medes entered Babylon, they would become
immediately victorious, so that they would exult without a contest and without
any toil, and sing a song of triumph. The Prophet now confirms his prophecy in
another way, even by extolling the power of God, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet commends here, as I have already said, in
high terms, the power of God; but we must bear in mind his purpose, for abrupt
sentences would be otherwise uninteresting. His object was to encourage the Jews
to entertain hope; for they were not to judge of Babylon according to its
splendor, which dazzled the eyes of all; nor were they to measure by their own
notions what God had testified, he bids the faithful to raise all their thoughts
above the world, and to behold with admiration the incomprehensible power of
God, that they might not doubt but that Babylon would at length be trodden under
foot; for had they fixed their eyes on that monarchy, they could have hardly
believed the words of prophecy; for the Prophet spoke of things which could not
be comprehended by the human mind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand why the Prophet set forth the
power of God, even that. the faithful might learn to think of something sublimer
than the whole world, while contemplating the destruction of Babylon, for that
would not be effected in a way usual or natural, but through the incredible
power of God. The same words are also found in the tenth chapter; and the five
verses we meet with here were there explained. But Jeremiah had then a different
object in view, for he addressed the Jewish exiles, and bade them firmly to
persevere in the worship of God: though religion was oppressed, and though the
victorious Chaldeans proudly derided God, he yet bade them to stand firm in
their religion, and then said,</font><br></div>

Cursed are all the gods who made not the heaven and the earth.&#8221;

10:11)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And there, indeed, he used a foreign language, and
taught them to speak in the Chaldee, that they might more plainly profess that
they would persevere in the worship of the only true God. He afterwards added
what he now repeats, even that the power of God was not diminished, though he
had chastised for a time his own people. But now, as we have said, he speaks in
sublime terms of the power of God, in order that the faithful might know that
what the judgment of the flesh held as impossible, could easily be done by that
God who can do all things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He who made the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He does not mention God&#8217;s
name; but the expression is more emphatical, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Maker of the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though he had said, &#8220;Who
can be found to be the creator of the heaven and the earth except the only true
God?&#8221; We hence see more force in the sentence than if God&#8217;s name had
been expressed; for he thus excluded all the fictitious gods, who had been
devised by the heathens; as though he had said, &#8220;The only true God is He
who made the earth.&#8221; Then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by his
power</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He speaks of God&#8217;s power in
connection with the earth, as it is probable, on account of its
stability.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who hath constituted the world by
his wisdom, and by his knowledge extended the
heavens</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The wisdom of God is visible
through the whole world, but especially in the heavens. The Prophet indeed
speaks briefly, but he leads us to contemplate God&#8217;s wonderful work in its
manifold variety, which appears above and below. For though it may seem a light
matter, when he says, that the world was constituted by the wisdom of God, yet
were any one to apply his mind to the meditation of God&#8217;s wisdom in the
abundance of all fruits, in the wealth of the whole world, in the sea, (which is
included in the world,) it could not, doubtless, be, but that he must be a
thousand times filled with wonder and admiration: for the more carefully we
attend to the consideration of God&#8217;s works, we ourselves in a manner
vanish into nothing; the miracles which present themselves on every side, before
our eyes, overwhelm us. As to the heavens, what do we see there? an innumerable
multitude of stars so arranged, as though an army were so in order throughout,
all its ranks; and then the wandering planets, not fixed, having each its own
course, and yet appearing among the stars. Then the course of the sun, how much
admiration ought it to produce in us! &#8212; I say, not in those only who
understand the whole system of astronomy, but also in those who see it only with
their own eyes; for when the sun, in its daily course, completes so great and so
immense a distance, they who are not amazed at such a miracle must be more than
stupid; and then the sun, as it is well known, has its own course, which is
performed every year, and never passes in the least beyond its own boundaries;
and the bulk of that body is immense (for, as it is well known, it far exceeds
the earth,) and yet it rolls with great celerity and at the same time in such
order as though it advanced by degrees quietly. Surely it is a wonderful
specimen of God&#8217;s wisdom. The Prophet, then, though he speaks in an
ordinary way, yet suppress the godly with materials of thought, so that they
might apply their minds to the consideration of God&#8217;s works. Some explain
the words, that God expands the heavens whenever they are covered with clouds;
but this is wholly foreign to the meaning of the Prophet; for there is no doubt
but that he points out in this verse the perpetual order of nature, as in the
next verse he speaks of those changes which sometimes happen.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">IN our last Lecture, we stopped where the Prophet
commends the power of God, as manifested in his ordinary works. Having
previously spoken of creation, and briefly shown, that both in heaven and on
earth there are many clear evidences of God&#8217;s wonderful wisdom as well as
of his power, he now comes to the rains and winds. We have further said, that
there is a difference between a fixed order of nature and those changes which
are daily observed; for were the appearance of the heavens and the earth always
the same, God&#8217;s power and wisdom could not appear so wonderful; but when
the heavens are covered with clouds, when the air is now tranquil, and then
disturbed by winds, when storms suddenly arise, and then rains follow, God thus
vividly sets forth his manifold wisdom and power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This, then, is the reason why the Prophet, after
having briefly touched on what we have seen, adds, as evidences of God&#8217;s
power and wisdom, those things which appear to us in their various changes. He
then says, that by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his voice
alone he gives abundance of waters in the
heavens</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and then that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he raises vapors from the
extremity of the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>creates lightnings and the
rain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which yet seem to be contrary
things. At last he says, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>brings the winds out of his
treasures</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Philosophers indeed mention
the causes of these things, but we ought to come to the fountain itself, and the
original cause, even this, that things are so arranged in the world, that though
there are intermediate and subordinate causes, yet the primary cause ever
appears eminently, even the wisdom and power of God. Winds arise from the earth,
even because exhalations proceed from it; but exhalations, by whom are they
created? not by themselves: it hence follows, that God is their sole author. And
he calls hidden places <i>treasures: </i>as when one draws out this or that from
his storehouse, so he says that winds come forth from hidden places, not of
themselves, but through God, who holds them as though they were shut up. I pass
by these things by only touching on them, because I have already reminded you
that we have before explained, in the tenth chapter (Jeremiah 10), what is here
literally repeated. It now follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse is usually explained, as though the
Prophet pointed out how men glide into errors and fancies, even because they
seek to be wise according to their own notions; and Paul, in the first chapter
to the Romans, assigns it as the cause of idolatry, that men become vain in
their own wisdom, because they follow whatever their own brains suggest to them.
This doctrine is in itself true and useful; for men have devised idols for
themselves, because they would not reverently receive the knowledge of God
offered to them, but rather believed their own inventions: and as mere vanity is
whatever man imagines according to his own thoughts, it is no wonder that those
who presumptuously form their own ideas of God, become wholly foolish and
infatuated. But it is evident from the context, that the Prophet means here
another thing, even that the artificers who cast or forge idols, or form them in
any other way, are wholly delirious in thinking that they can, by their own art
and skill, make gods. A log of wood lies on the ground, is trodden under foot
without any honor; now when the artificer adds form to it, the log begins to be
worshipped as a god; what madness can be imagined greater than this? The same
thing may be said of stones, of silver, and of gold; for though it may be a
precious metal, yet no divinity is ascribed to it, until it begins to put on a
certain form. Now when a melter casts an idol, how can a lump of gold or silver
become a god? The Prophet then upbraids this monstrous madness, when he says,
that men are in their knowledge like brute beasts, that is, when they apply
their skill to things so vain and foolish. But he mentions the same thing twice,
according to the common usage of the Hebrew style; for we know that the same
thing is often said twice for confirmation by the prophets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">After then having said that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>men are infatuated by
knowledge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he adds, that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made ashamed by the graven
image</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There seems to be an impropriety
in the words; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lsp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>pesal,</i> &#8220;graven,&#8221; does not well agree with
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;rx</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tsareph, </i>&#8220;the<i> </i>caster,&#8221; or founder; but the Prophet,
stating a part for the whole, simply means, that all artificers are foolish and
delirious in thinking that they can by their own hand and skill cast or forge,
or in any way form gods. And to prove this he says, that there is <i>no spirit
</i>or breath <i>in them; </i>and this was a sufficient proof; for we know that
God is the fountain of life, and hence he is called by Moses</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;the<i> </i>God of the spirits of
all flesh.&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino">Whatever life, then, is diffused through all
creatures, flows from God alone as the only true fountain. What, then, is less
like divinity, or has less affinity to it, than a lump of gold or of silver, or
a log of wood, or a stone? for they have no life nor rigor. Nothing is more
fading than man, yet while he has life in him, he possesses something divine;
but a dead body, what has it that is like God? But yet the form of a human body
comes nearer to God&#8217;s glory than a log of wood or a stone formed in the
shape of man. It is not, then, without reason that the Prophet condemns this
madness of all the heathens, that they worshipped fictitious gods, in whom yet
there was no spirit. It follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">As he had called idols a lie, so now in the same
sense he declares that they were <i>vanity, </i>even because they were nothing
real, but vain pomps, or phantoms, or masks; and he afterwards expresses himself
more clearly by saying that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the work of

the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;y[t[t</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
toroim, </i>in a passive but in an active sense. He then means that it was a
deceptive work, which was a snare to men; as though he had said, that they were
the work of imposture, or impostures.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage, and such as are like it, ought to be
carefully noticed; because the Papists seem to themselves to find a way to
escape when they confess their images are not to be worshipped, but that they
are books for the unlearned. They who are moderate in their views have recourse
to this evasion. This was once suggested by Gregory, but very foolishly; and
they who wish to appear more enlightened than others under the papacy repeat the
same saying, that images ought to be tolerated, because they are the books of
the ignorant. But what does the Holy Spirit, on the other hand, declare here,
and also by the Prophet Habakkuk? that they are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the work of
impostures</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>even mere snares or traps.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;350218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
2:18.) All, then, who seek instruction from statues or pictures gain nothing,
but become entangled in the snares of Satan, and find nothing but impostures.
And doubtless, whatever draws us away from the contemplation of the only true
God, ought justly to be deemed an imposture or a deception; for who by the sight
of a picture or a statue can form a right idea of the true God? Is not the truth
respecting him thus turned into falsehood? and is not his glory thus debased?
For we have then only the true knowledge of God, when we regard him to be God
alone, when we ascribe to him an infinite essence which fills heaven and earth,
when we acknowledge him to be a spirit, when, in short, we know that he alone,
properly speaking, exists, and that heaven and earth, and everything they
contain, exist through his power. Can a stone or wood teach us these things? No;
but on the contrary, I am led by the stone to imagine that God is fixed and
confined to a certain place. And then the life of God, does it appear in the
stone or in the wood? Besides, what likeness has a body, and that lifeless, to
an infinite spirit? It. is, then, not without reason that he complains, as it is
recorded by Isaiah, that he is thus wholly degraded:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;To whom have ye made me like? for
I contain the earth in my fist, and ye confine me to wood or stone.&#8221;

40:12, 18)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If, in a word, the minds of men received no other
error from idols than the thought that God is corporeal, what can be more
preposterous? </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that the Prophet does not here say
without cause, that all idols are vanity, and the work of imposture or
deception.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He lastly adds, that all fictitious gods would perish
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>at the time of
visitation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In this clause he exhorts
the faithful to patience, and in a manner sustains their minds, that they might
not despond; for it was not a small trial to see the monarchy of Babylon
flourishing, when yet it had no other protection than that of idols. As, then,
the Babylonians thought flint fictitious gods were the guardians and defenders
of their safety, and that through them they had subdued all their neighbors,
they became thus more and more addicted to their superstitions, the reward of
which they regarded all their wealth and power. Inasmuch as the minds of the
godly could not have been otherwise than shaken by such a trial, the Prophet
here supports them, and reminds them to wait for the time of visitation when the
idols were to perish. However, a reference may be intended to the Babylonians as
well as to the idols, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall perish at the time of
their visitation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, when the
Chaldeans shall be visited. But it is probable that the time of visitation
refers here especially to idols, because the Prophet had spoken before of all
the wicked and reprobate. However this may be, we understand that his object was
to show that however prosperous idolaters might be for a time, yet the hand of
God was to be patiently borne until the suitable time came, which is here called
the time of visitation. And the metaphor refers to the notions of men, for we
think that God dwells idly in heaven and turns away his <i>eyes </i>from us,
while he spares the ungodly. Hence the Prophet calls the judgment of God a
<i>visitation, </i>because he then shows really, by evident proofs, that he does
not disregard the affairs of men. It now follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Had the Prophet only said that idols were mere
impostures and mockeries, it would have been indeed something; but this part of
his teaching would have been cold and uninteresting, had he not, on the other
hand, proclaimed the glory of the one and only true God. We ought, indeed, to
know that idols are nothing, that men are most foolishly deceived, and are
wholly infatuated, when they imagine that there is in them some divinity. But
the main thing is, that the true God himself is brought before us, and that we
are taught to direct all our thoughts to him. This, then, is what is now done by
the Prophet; for after having exposed the folly of the heathens in worshipping
idols, and having shown that the whole is nothing but deception and falsehood,
he now says, <i>Not as they, </i>the fictitious gods,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is the portion of
Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, the God who had revealed
himself to the chosen people is very far different from all idols.
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And, doubtless, the vanity which the Prophet before
mentioned cannot be adequately understood, except the true God be known. For
though some of the ancient philosophers ridiculed the grossest errors of the
common people, yet they had nothing fixed or certain on which they could rest,
like him, who, when asked, &#8220;What<i> </i>was God?&#8221; requested time to
consider, and who after several delays confessed that the more he inquired into
the nature of God, the more absorbed were all his thoughts. And this must
necessarily be the case with men until they are taught what God is, which can
never be done until he himself represents himself and his glory as it were in a
mirror.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is then the reason why the Prophet, while
setting the only true God in opposition to idols and all the inventions of
mortals, calls him </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the portion of
Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because the law was as it were
the representation of the glory of God. As then he had plainly shown himself
there, as far as it was needful for the salvation of the chosen people, the
Prophet, in order to invite men to the true knowledge of the true God, calls him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the portion of
Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as though he had set the law as a
mirror before their eyes. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
portion of Jacob </i></font><font face="Palatino">then <i>is God, </i>who is not
like fictitious gods; how so? because he is the framer of all things. It is
indeed by a few words that he makes the distinction between the only true God
and the fictitious gods; but in this brief sentence he includes what I have
before explained, even that God is the fountain of life, and the life of all,
and then that his essence is spiritual and also infinite; for as he has created
the heaven and the earth, so of necessity he sustains both by his
power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We then see that the Prophet speaks briefly but not
frigidly; and from this passage we learn a useful doctrine, even that God cannot
be comprehended by us except in his works. As then vain men weary themselves
with speculations, which have not in them, so to speak, any practical knowledge,
it is no wonder that they run headlong into many delirious things. Let us then
be sober in this respect, so that we may not inquire into the essence of God
more than it becomes us. When therefore we seek to comprehend what God is, or
how to attain the knowledge of him, let us direct all our thoughts, and eyes,
and minds to his works.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So also by this passage, when the Prophet calls God
the worker or framer of all things, is exposed the vanity of all superstitions;
and how? because we hence learn that the power which made not the heaven and the
earth, is vain and worthless; but the only maker of heaven and earth is God,
then he is God alone. Since he is the only true God, it follows that the
inventions or figments of men are altogether delirious, and are therefore the
artifices and impostures of the devil to deceive mankind. We hence see that the
doctrine of the Prophet is exclusive, when he says that God is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the maker of all
things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for where the maker of all
things is not found, there certainly no divinity can be.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the rod of his
inheritance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This seems to refer to God,
but in the tenth chapter the word <i>Israel </i>is introduced; otherwise these
five verses literally agree, but in that passage the Prophet says that Israel
was the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rod of God&#8217;s
inheritance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here the rod means a
measuring pole; for the similitude is taken from lands being measured; for the
ancients used poles of certain length for measuring. Hence the Hebrews called an
inheritance the rod of inheritance, because it was what had been measured and
had certain limits: as when one possesses a field, he knows how many acres it
contains, it having been measured. But both things may be fitly and truly said,
even that Israel is the rod of God&#8217;s inheritance, and also that God
himself is a rod of inheritance; for there is a mutual union. For as God favors
us with this honor, to make us his inheritance, and is pleased to have us as his
own, so also he offers himself to us as an inheritance. David says often,
&#8220;The<i> </i>Lord is my portion,&#8221; and &#8220;The Lord is the portion
of mine inheritance,&#8221; that is, my hereditary portion. So in this place the
meaning would not be unsuitable were we to apply the words to God. As, however,
the word <i>Israel </i>is found in the former place, it may be deemed as
understood here.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fH87</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says at last,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah of hosts is his
name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There is implied a contrast here;
for he does not honor God with this character, as though it was a common or
ordinary name; but he claims for him his own right, and thus distinguishes him
from all idols. By saying, then, that this name belongs only to the true God,
even the God of Israel, he intimates that by this distinction he differs from
all idols, and that men are sacrilegious when they transfer any power to idols,
and expect safety from them, and flee to them. As then this name belongs only to
God, it follows that in Him dwells a fullness of all power and might. Since it
is so, then wholly worthless is everything that the world has ever imagined
respecting the number and multitude of gods. It now follows,

objected, that the monarchy which was fortified by so many defenses, and which
had subjugated all the neighboring nations, was impregnable. Hence the Prophet
here shows that the power and wealth of Babylon were no hindrances that God

45:4;) and then we have seen the metaphor of the potter and his vessels. When
the Prophet went down to the potter, he saw a vessel formed and then broken at
the will and pleasure of the potter
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;241802&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
18:2-4.) So also now God shows that the destruction was as it were in his hand,
because the Chaldeans had not raised themselves to eminence through their own
power, but he had raised them, and employed them for his own purpose. In short,
he compares the Babylonians in this passage to a formed vessel, and he makes
himself the potter:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I am he who has raised Babylon to
so great a height; it therefore belongs to me to pull it down whensoever it
pleases me.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand the design of this passage, though
the Prophet employs different words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that Babylon was a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hammer and weapons of war to
break in pieces </i></font><font face="Palatino">the nations. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#8776;pn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nuphets, </i>means to break in pieces, and carelessly to scatter here and
there, and also violently to scatter. He says then, &#8220;I<i> </i>have by thee
scattered the nations, and by thee have destroyed kingdoms.&#8221; But as the
Chaldeans had enjoyed so many victories and had subjugated so many nations, he
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have by thee broken in
pieces the horse and his ride,; the chariot and its
rider</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have broken in pieces men and
women, old men and children, the young men and the maidens, the shepherds and
also their flocks</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He enumerates here
almost all kinds of men. He then mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>husbandmen
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yokes of
oxen</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or of horses; and lastly, he
mentions </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>captains and
rulers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH88</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>All these things are said by way
of concession; but yet the Prophet reminds us that no difficulty would prevent
God to destroy Babylon, because Babylon in itself was nothing. According to this
sense, then, it is called a hammer. In short, the Prophet takes away the false
opinion which might have otherwise disturbed weak minds, as though Babylon was
wholly invincible. He shows at the same time that God executed his judgments on
all nations by means of Babylon. Thus the faithful might have been confirmed;
for otherwise they must have necessarily been cast down when they regarded the
formidable power of Babylon; but when they heard that it was only a hammer, and
that they would not have been broken in pieces by the Babylonians had they not
been armed from above, or rather had they not been driven on by a celestial
power, it then appeared that the calamity which the Jews had suffered was
nothing more than a punishment inflicted by God&#8217;s hand. When, therefore,
they heard this, it was no small consolation; it kept them from succumbing under
their miseries, and from being swallowed up with sorrow and despair. But it now
follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

they seemed doubtless to have deserved praise rather than punishment; nay, we

<div><font face="Palatino">for Nebuchadnezzar had afflicted the Jews, therefore
he obtained this, says Ezekiel, as his reward. It seems then an inconsistent
thing when God declares that the Chaldeans deserved punishment because they had
afflicted the Jews. But both declarations agree well together; for when God
declared by Ezekiel that he gave Egypt as a reward to his servant
Nebuchadnezzar, he had a regard to the Jews and to their perverseness, because
they had not as yet been sufficiently humbled; nay, they thought that it was by
chance that they had been subdued by the Babylonians. God then declares that he
had executed his judgment on them by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar. It was
afterwards necessary that the faithful should be raised up in their extreme
distress; and this was regarded by our Prophet when he <i>said &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I will render to
Babylon and to the Chaldeans all their
evils</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>They then obtained Egypt for a
short time, but afterwards all the evils they had brought on other nations
recoiled on their own heads.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this promise was in a peculiar manner given to
the Church; for though the vengeance executed on the Chaldeans was just, because
they exercised extreme cruelty towards all nations; yet God, having a care for
his own Church, thus undertook its cause; therefore he speaks not here generally
of the punishment inflicted on the Chaldeans for their cruelty; but God, as I
have said, had a regard to his own Church. Hence, he says, I will render to the
Babylonians and to all the Chaldeans, all the evil
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which they had done in
Sion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We now see that this punishment
had a special reference to the chosen people, in order that the faithful might
know that they had been so chastised by God, that yet the memory of his covenant
had never failed, and that thus in the midst of death they might have some hope
of salvation, and that they might feel assured that God would at length be
merciful; not that God would ever restore the whole body of the people; but this
promise, as it has been elsewhere stated, is addressed only to the remnant. Yet
fixed remains the truth, that God, after having broken in pieces the Jews and
other nations by means of one nation, would yet be the avenger of his Church,
because he could never forget his covenant. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before your

calmer minds wait for the vengeance of which they themselves would be
eye-witnesses.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">THERE is no doubt but that the Prophet speaks of
Babylon. But it may seem strange to call it a mountain, when that city was
situated in a plain, as it is well known; nay, it has no mountains near it. It
was a plain, so that streams might be drawn here and there in any direction.
Hence they think that the city was called a mountain on account of the height of
its walls and also its great buildings. And this is probable, as though the
Prophet called it a great mass; for historians tell us that its walls were very
high, about two hundred feet, and a foot commonly exceeded three fingers. Then
the towers were very high. In short, Babylon was a prodigy for the quantity of
its bricks, for the walls were not built with squared stones, but formed of
bricks. Their breadth also was incredible; for chariots drawn by four horses
could go along without touching one another. Their breadth, according to Strabo
and also Pliny, was fifty feet. Then this metaphor was not used without reason,
when the Prophet, regarding in one respect the state of the city, called Babylon
a <i>mountain, </i>as though Ninus, or Semiramis, or others, had contended with
nature itself. The beginning of Babylon was that memorable tower mentioned by
Moses, but then the work was left off. (Genesis 11) Afterwards, either because
such a beginning inflamed the desire of men, or because the place was very
pleasant and fertile, it happened that a city of great size was built there. In
short, it was more like a country than a city; for, as Aristotle says, it was
not so much a city as a country or a province. This much as to the word
<i>mountain.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now God himself declares war against Babylon, in
order that more credit might be given to this prophecy; for the Prophet had no
regard to the Chaldeans, but to his own nation, and especially to the remnant of
the godly. The greater part derided his prophecy, but a few remained who
received the Prophet&#8217;s doctrine with becoming reverence. It was then his
object to consult their good and benefit; and, as we shall see at the end of
this chapter, he wished to lay up this treasure with them, that they might
cherish the hope of restoration while they were as it were lost in exile. God
then does here encourage them, and declares that he would be an enemy to the
Babylonians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am against
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
O mountain of perdition</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The mountain of
perdition is to be taken in an active sense, for destroying mountain, as also a
clearer explanation follows, when he says that it had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>destroyed all the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For the Babylonians, as it is
well known, had afflicted all their neighbors, and had transferred the imperial
power of the Medes to their own city. When they subdued the Assyrians they
extended their power far and wide, and at length advanced to Syria, Judea, and
Egypt. Thus it happened that the Babylonians enjoyed the empire of the east till
the time of Cyrus; and then the monarchy was possessed by the Persians. But our
Prophet had respect to the former state of things; for he said that the
Chaldeans had been like a hammer, which God had employed to break in pieces all
the nations; and, according to the same meaning, he now says that all the earth
had been destroyed by the Babylonians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But God here declares that he would be their judge,
because he would </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>extend his hand
over Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>roll it down from the
rocks</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he proceeds still with the same
metaphor; for as he called Babylon a mountain on account of its great buildings,
and especially on account of its high walls and lofty towers, so now he adopts
the same kind of language, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
cast thee down,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or rather roll thee,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the
rocks</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>make thee a mountain of
burning.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He thus intimates that Babylon
would become a heap of ashes, though this was not immediately fulfilled; for as
we have said, it was so taken as not to be entirely laid waste. For in the time
of Alexander the Great, many years after, Babylon was standing, and there
Alexander died. It then follows that it was not reduced to solitude and ashes by
Darius and Cyrus. But we have already untied this knot, that is, that the
Prophet does not only speak of one vengeance of God, but includes others which
followed. For Babylon soon after revolted and suffered a grievous punishment for
its perfidy, and was then treated with great contempt. Afterwards, Seleucus
tried in various ways to destroy it, and for this end Seleucia was built, and
then Ctesiphon was set up in opposition to Babylon. Babylon then was by degrees
reduced to that solitude of which the Prophet here speaks. Pliny says that in
his time the temple of Bel was there, whom they thought to have been the founder
of the city; but he afterwards adds that the other parts of the city were
deserted. If Jerome, as he says, visited it, we ought; to believe what he had
seen; and he says that Babylon was a small ignoble town, and ruins only were
seen there. There is, then, nothing unreasonable in this prophecy, for it ought
not to be restricted to one calamity only; for God ceased not in various ways to
afflict Babylon until it was wholly laid waste, according to what our Prophet
testifies. According to this view, then, he says that Babylon would become a
<i>mountain of burning, </i>or a burnt
mountain,</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH89</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for ruins only would remain; and in the
same sense he immediately adds, &#8212; </font><br></div>

perpetual destruction. By

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here confirms what he had before taught,
even that Babylon, however proud on account of its strongholds, would not yet
escape God&#8217;s hand. Had he used a simple mode of speaking, hardly any one
would have ventured to look for what the Prophet said. It was then necessary to
introduce figurative expressions, of which we have before spoken. Here, then,
with the highest authority, he commands the nations to raise up war against
Babylon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must observe, as I have before reminded you, that
by such modes of speaking, the effect of prophetic doctrine is set forth. For
the unbelieving deride whatever <i>they </i>hear, because the voice of God is
the same to them as though it were a sound flowing through the air. Hence the
Prophet shows that he was endued with the power of God, and that the hand of God
was connected with his mouth, so that he fulfills whatever he predicts.
<i>Raise, </i>he says, <i>a standard. </i>This might have appeared ludicrous,
for we know that the Prophet was despised, not only at Jerusalem, but also in
his own town where he had been born: by what right, then, or on what ground does
he now boldly command all nations, and bid the banners to be raised? But as I
have said, he shows that a false judgment would be formed of what he said,
except the people thought that God himself spoke.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sound with the

nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and further, <i>assemble,
</i>literally, &#8220;make to hear,&#8221; but it means, in <i>Piel, </i>to
collect, to assemble. As to the word <i>Ararat, </i>it may be taken for Armenia.
I know not why some have taken Minni to be the lower Armenia, for there is no
creditable author for such an opinion. Nor is it certain what country the
Prophet designates by <i>Ashchenaz. </i>But it is evident from histories, that
the great army which Darius, or Cyrus under the authority of Darius, led with
him, had been collected from various and even remote nations. For he brought
with him the Hyrcanians and the Armenians, and some from many unknown places.
As, then, heathen authors declare that this army was collected indiscriminately
from many nations and almost unknown, it is nothing strange that the Hebrew
names are at this day unknown. And there is no doubt but that the Prophet here
indirectly intimates some great shaking of the world, as though he had said,
that even barbarous nations, The name of whom hath not hitherto been heard of,
would come like all overwhelming flood to destroy Babylon. He will hereafter
speak of the Medes; but here he treats the subject in a different way, as though
he had said, that so great would be the multitude of enemies, that Babylon,
notwithstanding its largeness, would be easily overthrown. We now perceive the
Prophet&#8217;s design as to these obscure words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says afterwards,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Set up a leader against
her</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is to be understood of Cyrus,
whose vigor was especially apparent in that war. Nor is there a doubt but that
he led his uncle and father-in-law to undertake the war. For those historians
fable, who say that Cyrus was cast away by his grandfather, and that he was
brought up privately by Astyages, and that he afterwards made war with his
grandfather. All these things have been invented. For it is quite evident that
Darius, the king of the Medes, was the chief in that war, and Daniel is our best
witness on this point. Heathen writers imagine that there was no king of the
Medes except under the authority of Cyrus. But Cyrus did not rule until after
the death of his father-in-law, or his uncle, whose daughter he had married. It
then follows, that he was the general, so that he carried on the war under the
authority of Darius. Cyrus then was, as it were, the hired soldier of his uncle
and father-in-law, but at length he obtained the kingdom of the Medes and the
whole empire of the East. Of this leader, then, I understand this passage, when
the Prophet says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Set up

though he had said, Bring forth against Babylon horses without number, who shall
be as locusts. He compares them to locusts, not for strength or skill in war,
but only with regard to their number. But as the locusts are frightful, he
applies to them the word

them in the plural number, the

<div><font face="Palatino">And it tended, in no small degree, to show the
certainty of this prophecy, that Jeremiah declared, before Cyrus or even Darius
was born, that the Medes would come. But we have stated, that though Cyrus,
being singularly active and a good warrior, carried on the war, yet Darius was
the first in authority. Then Babylon obeyed the Medes for a time; but as Darius
was now old, Cyrus succeeded him; and then the monarchy was transferred to
Persia; and laws issued thence until the time of Alexander the Great, who,
together with his catamite, burnt the tower. Nor is there a doubt but that many
memorable transactions were deposited there. But Alexander being drunk, seized a
torch and burnt the tower; for he thought that the memory of the Oriental
monarchy could thus be abolished.</font><br></div>

his doctrine. It might have occurred to the minds of all, that the whole world
would sooner come to nothing than that Babylon should fall. Though it were so,
says the Prophet, that the whole earth trembled, yet Babylon will be destroyed.

craft than by open force; for after a long siege, Cyrus was laughed to scorn by
the Babylonians; then they securely held a feast. In the meantime two eunuchs of
Belshazzar passed over to Cyrus; for; as Xenophon relates, the tyrant had slain
the son of one, and by way of disgrace castrated the other. Hence, then, it was
that they revolted from him; and Cyrus was instructed by them how he could take
the city. The fords were dried-up, when Belshazzar suspected no such thing, and
in the night he heard that the city was taken. Daniel gives a clearer
description; for he says that there was held a stated feast, and that the hand
of a writer appeared on the wall, and that the king, being frightened, had heard
from Daniel that the end of his kingdom was near at hand, and that the city was
taken that very night.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;270525&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
5:25-30.) hence the Prophet says now that the valiant men desisted, so that they
did not fight. He indeed speaks of what was future, but, we know what was the
manner of the prophets, for they related what was to come as though it had
already taken place.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sat down in their

the fords, and the soldiers entered into the middle of the city; the king was
slain together with all his satraps, and then all parts of the city were taken
possession of. We now, then, see that the Spirit of God spoke by the mouth of
Jeremiah, as of a thing that had already taken place.</font><br></div>

still been carried on by so large a multitude, yea, they might have engaged with
their enemies in hundred or in thousand of the streets of the city, for it would
have been easy in the night to distress them: but the Prophet says, that they
all became women as to courage. At last, he adds, that that<i>

<div><font face="Palatino">This also was fulfilled according to the testimony of
heathen authors, as well as of Daniel. They do not indeed repeat these words,
but according to the whole tenor of history we may easily conclude that
messengers ran here and there, for the Babylonians never thought that the enemy
could so suddenly penetrate into the city, for there was no entrance. We have
seen how high the walls were, for there were no muskets then, and the walls
could not have been beaten down. There were indeed battering-rams; but what was
the breadth of the walls? even fifty feet, as already stated, so that four
horses abreast could pass without coming into contact. There was then no
battering-ram that could throw down walls so thick. As to the fords, the thing
seemed incredible; so that they kept<i> </i>a feast in perfect security. In such
an irruption, what our Prophet testifies here must have necessarily happened.
But it is quite evident that he was the instrument of the Holy Spirit; for Cyrus
was not as yet born when this prophecy was announced. We hence then know, that
the holy man was guided from above, and that what he said was not produced in
his own head, but was really celestial; for he could not have divined any such
thing, nor was it through probable conjecture that he was able thus to speak and
lead the Jews, as it were, into the very scene itself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor is there a doubt but that this authority was
afterwards confirmed when the fathers told their children, &#8220;So have we
heard from the mouth of the Prophet what we now see with our eyes; and yet no
man could have conjectured any such thing, nor have discovered it by reason or
clearsightedness: hence Jeremiah must have necessarily been taught by the Spirit
of God.&#8221; This, then, is the reason why God designed that the destruction
of Babylon should be, as we see, so graphically described.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A runner ran to meet a
runner</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a messenger to meet a messenger,
to tell the king of Babylon that his city was taken at its
extremity</i></font><font face="Palatino">?</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH94</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Had this been said of a small
city, it might have appeared ridiculous: why are these runners? one might say.
But it has been sufficiently shown, that so extensive was that city, that
runners, passing through many fields, might have come to the king, and convey
the news that the city was <i>taken </i>at one of its extremities. And heathen
writers cannot sufficiently eulogize the contrivance and skill of Cyrus, that,
he thus took possession of so great a city;<i> </i>for he might have only
secured one half of it, and Belshazzar might have retained the other half, and
might have bravely contested with Cyrus and all his forces; and he would have no
doubt overcome him, had it not been for the wonderful and unusual expedition of
Cyrus. This haste, then, or expedition of Cyrus, is what the Prophet now sets
forth, when he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>messengers ran to the king to
tell him that the city was taken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He now

dried up, as though one burned wood by applying fire to it. This, indeed, is not
suitable to water; but he, by a hyperbole, expresses more fully the miracle
which might have otherwise exceeded human comprehension. He then says, that the
fords were dried up, and then adds, that the pools were burnt. The same thing is
expressed twice, but in a different way; and as I have already said, he states

<div><font face="Palatino">BY this similitude the Prophet confirms what he had
before said, even that God would be the avenger of his Church, and would justly
punish the Babylonians, but at the suitable time, which is usually called in
Scripture the time of visitation, He then compares Babylon to a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>threshing-floor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>not indeed in the sense which interpreters have imagined, but because the
threshing-floor only serves for the time of harvest, and is afterwards closed up
and not used. Babylon, then, had been for a long time like a threshing-floor,
because there had been no treading there, that is, no noise or shouting. But God
declares that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the time of harvest
would come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>when the threshing-floor
would be used. Oxen did then tread the corn; for the corn was not beaten out
with flails, as with us and in most places in France, though the inhabitants of
Provence still use the treading. In Judea they tread out the corn on floors, and
oxen were used for the purpose. Now, the reason for the similitude seems
evident; for the time would come when God would smite Babylon, as oxen after
harvest tread out with their feet the corn on the threshing-floor, which for the
rest of the year is not wanted, but remains closed up and quiet. Hence I have
said that what we have before seen as to the time of visitation is confirmed;
for it was strange at the first view to promise deliverance to the Jews, while
yet Babylon was increasing more and more and extending the limits of its
monarchy.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;232824&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
28:24-26.) God shows in that passage that it was no matter of wonder if he did
not daily exercise his judgments in an equal degree; and he bids us to consider
how husbandmen act, for they do not sow at the same time wheat and barley and
other kinds of grain; nor do they always plough, or always reap, but wait for
seasonable times. &#8220;Since<i>, </i>then, husbandmen are endowed with so much
care and foresight as I have taught them, why may not I also have my times
rightly distributed, so that there may be now the harvest, and then the treading
or threshing? and should I not at one time sow wheat, and at another
cumin?&#8221; for the Prophet adds these several sorts. The same is the mode of
reasoning in this place, though the Prophet speaks more
briefly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says that Babylon would be like a
threshing-foor, and how? because it had been as a place closed up and wholly
quiet; for God had spared the Chaldeans, and, as we shall hereafter see, they
had been so inebriated with pleasures that they feared no
danger.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And then immediately he explains himself, &#8212; it
is </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>time to
tread</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or thresh <i>her. </i>Then Babylon
became like a threshing-fioor, for she had not been trodden or threshed for a
long time, as the threshing-floor is not used for nine or ten months through the
whole year. But he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yet a
little while, and come will her
harvest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We learn from this and other passages that treading
or threshing was in use among the Jews and other eastern nations only during
harvest. In other places, corn is often kept in the ears for five and six years.
Some thresh the corn after six, or eight, or nine months, as it suits their
convenience. But there are many countries where the corn is immediately
threshed; it is not stored up, but is immediately<i> </i>conveyed to the
threshing-floor, and there it is trodden by oxen or threshed with flails. As
then it was usual immediately to tread the corn, hence God declares that the
time of harvest would come when Babylon would be trodden, as the threshing-floor
is trodden after harvest.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino">We<i> </i>must observe that a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>little while
</i></font><font face="Palatino">is not to be understood according to the
notions of men; for though God suspends his judgments, he yet never delays
beyond the time; on the contrary, he performs his work with all due celerity<i>.

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Yet a<i> </i>little while, and I

the judgment of men, who make too much haste, and are even carried away headlong
by their own desires. But God performs his work with sufficient celerity,
provided we allow him to arrange the times according to his own will, as it is
just and right for us to do. Whenever, then, the ungodly enjoy ease and securely
indulge themselves, let this fact come to our own minds, that the
threshing-floor is not always trodden, but that the time of harvest will come
whenever it pleases God. This is the use we ought to make of what is here said.

<div><font face="Palatino">Here is mentioned the complaint of the chosen people,
and this was done designedly by Jeremiah, in order that the Jews might feel
assured that their miseries were not overlooked by God; for nothing can distress
us so much as to think that God forgets us and disregards the wrongs done to us
by the ungodly, hence the Prophet here sets the Israelites in God&#8217;s
presence, that they might be convinced in their own minds that they were not
disregarded by God, and that he was not indifferent to the unjust and cruel
treatment they received from their enemies. For this complaint is made, as
though they expostulated with God in his presence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Devoured me and broken me in
pieces has Nebuchadnezzar, the king of
Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH97</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The word, <i>to eat, </i>or
devour, was enough; but Jeremiah wished to express something more atrocious by
adding the word, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to break in
pieces</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH98</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for he intimates that Babylon had
not been like a man who devours meat set before him, but that she had been a
cruel wild beast, who breaks in pieces the very bones. We now, then, understand
the design of the Prophet; he amplifies the savageness of the king of Babylon,
by saying that God&#8217;s people had not only been devoured by him as men
swallow down their food, but that they had also been torn in pieces by his
teeth, as though he had been a lion, or a bear, or some other wild animal; for
these not only devour their prey, but also with their teeth break in pieces
whatever is harder than flesh, such as bones.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For the same purpose he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He has set me an empty
vessel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, he has wholly exhausted
me, as when one empties a flagon or a cask. Then he says, he has
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>swallowed me like a
dragon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH99</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is a comparison different from
the former, but yet very suitable; for dragons are those who devour a whole
animal; and this is what the Prophet means. Though these comparisons do not in
everything agree, yet as to the main thing they are most appropriate, even to
show that God suffered his people to be devoured, as though they had been
exposed to the teeth of a lion or a bear, or as though they had been a prey to a
dragon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Filled has he his belly with my
delicacies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, whatever delicate
thing I had, he has consumed it. He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he has cast off the
remnants</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>like wolves and lions and
other wild beasts, who, when they have more prey than what suffices them, choose
what is most savory; for they choose the head of man that they may eat the
brain; they suck the blood, but leave the intestines and whatever they do not
like. So also the Prophet says here of the miserable Jews, that they had been so
devoured that the enemy, having been satiated, had cast. off the
remainder.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fH100</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence learn that God&#8217;s people had been so
exposed to plunder, that the conqueror was not only satisfied, but cast away
here and there what remained; for satiety, as it is well known, produces
loathsomeness. But the Prophet refers to the condition of the miserable people;
for their wealth had been swallowed up by the Chaldeans, but their household
furniture was plundered by the neighboring nations; and the men themselves had
been driven into exile, so that there came a disgraceful scattering. They were
then scattered into various countries, and some were left through contempt in
the land; thus was fulfilled what is said here, &#8220;He<i> </i>has cast me
out,&#8221; even because these wild beasts, the Chaldeans, became satiated; meat
was rejected by them, because they could not consume all that was presented to
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By these figurative terms, as it has been stated, is
set forth the extreme calamity of the people; and the Prophet no doubt intended
to meet such thoughts as might otherwise have proved very harassing to the Jews.
For as they found no end to their evils, they might have thought that they had
been so cast away by God as to become the most miserable of men. This is the
reason why our Prophet anticipates what might have imbittered the minds of the
godly, and even driven them to despair, he then says, that notwithstanding all
the things which had happened, yet God had not forgotten his people; for all
these things were done as in his sight.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to us, were God not only to double the
calamities of his Church, but also to afflict it in an extreme degree, yet what
the Prophet says here ought to afford us aid, even that God&#8217;s chosen
people were formerly so consumed, that the remainder was cast away in contempt;
for the conqueror, though insatiable, could not yet consume all that he got as a
prey, because his cupidity could not contain it. It now follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah goes on with the same subject; for, after
having shown that the calamities of the people were not unknown to God, he now,
in an indirect way, exhorts the faithful to deposit their complaints in the
bosom of God, and to apply, or appeal to him, as their defender. The design,
then, of the Prophet is, (after having explained how grievously the Jews had
been afflicted,) to show them that their only remedy was, to flee to God, and to
plead their cause before him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this passage is entitled to particular notice, so
that we may also learn in extreme evils, when all things seem hopeless, to
discover our evils to God, and thus to unburden our anxieties in his bosom. For
how is it, that sorrow often overwhelms us, except that we do not follow what
God&#8217;s Spirit prescribes to us? For it is said in the
Psalms,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Roll thy cares into God&#8217;s
bosom, and he will sustain thee, and will not give the righteous to a perpetual
change.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;195523&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
55:23)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may, then, by prayer, unburden ourselves, and this
is the best remedy: but we murmur, and sometimes clamor, or at least we bite and
champ the bridle, according to a common proverb; and, in the meantime, we
neglect the chief thing, and what the Prophet teaches us here.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We<i> </i>ought, then, carefully to mark the design
of what is here taught, when it is said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>my violence and my flesh
</i></font><font face="Palatino">be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>upon
Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>When he adds, <i>Say will
</i>(or let) </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the daughter of
Sion,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he no doubt shows that the
faithful have always this consolation in their extreme calamities, that they can
expostulate with God as to their enemies and their cruelty. Then he says, <i>my
plunder </i>or violence; some render it &#8220;the<i> </i>plunder of me,&#8221;
which is harsh. But the meaning of the Prophet is not ambiguous, for it follows
afterwards, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>my
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Then violence was that which was
done by enemies. But the people is here spoken of under the name of a woman,
according to what is commonly done,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let the inhabitress of Sion say,
My plunder and my flesh.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By the second
word the Prophet shows sufficiently plain what he understood by plunder.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says, (even that which the
Chaldeans had devoured and consumed,) be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on
Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is of the greatest weight,
for by these words he intimates, that though the Chaldeans thought that they had
exercised with impunity their cruelty towards the Jews, yet their innocent blood
cried, and was opposed to them as an enemy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To the same purpose he afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let Jerusalem say, My blood is
upon the Chaldeans.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then follows a clearer explanation, when God promises
that he would be the avenger of his chosen people, and that whatever the Jews
had suffered would be rendered to Babylon:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore thus saith Jehovah,
Behold, I will litigate thy quarrel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>By<i> </i>this passage we are taught to present our complaints to God, if we
wish him to undertake our cause; for when we are silent, he will in his turn
rest, as he considers us unworthy of being helped. But if we cry to him, he will
doubtless hear us. Then we must remember the order of things, for the Prophet
says on the one hand, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let
Jerusalem cry, let the daughter of Sion say</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>and on the other hand he says, Therefore God will come and hear the cry of
his people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I will plead thy
cause</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and then, I <i>will vindicate or
</i>avenge <i>thy vengeance. </i>These are hard words to Latin ears; but yet
they contain more force and power than if we were to follow the elegance of the
Latin tongue. It is then better to retain the genuine terms than to study
neatness too much.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, God promises to be the defender of his
people, and by using the demonstrative particle, he doubtless removes every
doubt, as though the thing was now present. We know that more than seventy years
had elapsed since God had spoken thus; for as it has been already stated, it was
not after the taking of the city that Jeremiah prophesied against the Chaldeans:
but though God suspended his judgment and vengeance for seventy years after the
destruction of the city, yet this was said, <i>Behold, I, </i>as though he
brought the faithful to witness the event; and this was done for the sake of
certainty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, we hence learn, that though God humbles his
people, and suffers them even to be overwhelmed with extreme miseries, he will
at length become the avenger of all the wrongs which they may have endured; for
what has been said of the destruction of the people has a reference to us; nay,
what is here said, has not been left on record except for our benefit. And
further, let us learn, as I have before reminded you, to prepare our minds for
patience whenever God seems to forsake us. Let us, at the same time exercise
ourselves constantly in prayer, and God will hear our groans and complaints, and
regard our tears.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is afterwards added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will make dry her
sea</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for Babylon, as it has been already
stated, was surrounded by the streams of the Euphrates; and there was no easy
access to it. The Prophet then compares the fortifications of Babylon to a
<i>sea </i>and <i>a fountain. </i>For who would have thought that the Euphrates
could be dried up, which is so large a river, and has none equal to it in all
Europe? Even the Danube does not come up to the largeness of that river. Who
then would have thought it possible that such a river could be made dry, which
was like a sea, and its fountain inexhaustible? God then intimates by these
words, that such was his power, that all obstacles would vanish away, and that
he was resolved at the same time to execute his judgment on the Babylonians. It
afterwards follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms what he had said, that when God raised
his hand against Babylon, such would be its destruction, that the splendor,
which before astonished all nations, would be reduced to nothing. Perish, he
says, shall all the wealth of Babylon &#8212; its towers and its walls shall
fall, and its people shall disappear; in short,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it shall become heaps of
stones</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as he said before, that it would
become a mountain of burning. It is then for the same purpose that he now says
that it would become heaps. But we must bear in mind what we observed yesterday,
that it would become such heaps that they would not be fit for corners, that
they could not be set in foundations; for the ruins would be wholly useless as
to any new building.</font><br></div>

had said of the destruction of Babylon, even that in the middle of the
slaughter, they would have no strength to resist: they would, at the same time,
perish amidst great confusion; and thus he anticipates what might have been
advanced against his prophecy. For the Babylonians had been superior to all
other nations; how then could it be, that a power so invincible should perish?
Though they were as lions, says the Prophet, yet that would avail nothing; they
will indeed roar, but roaring will be of no service to them; they will roar as

<div><font face="Palatino">Here, also, he describes the manner in which Babylon
was taken. And hence we learn, that the Prophet did not speak darkly or
ambiguously, but so showed, as it were by the finger, the judgment of God, that
the prophecy might be known by posterity, in order that they might understand
that God&#8217;s Spirit had revealed these things by the mouth of the Prophet:
for no mortal, had he been a hundred times endowed with the spirit of
divination, could ever have thus clearly expressed a thing unknown. But as
nothing is past or future with God, he thus plainly spoke of the destruction of
Babylon by his Prophet, that posterity, confirmed by the event, might
acknowledge him to have been, of a certainty, the instrument of the Holy Spirit.
And Daniel afterwards sealed the prophecy of Jeremiah, when he historically
related what had taken place; nay, God extorted from heathen writers a
confession, so that they became witnesses to the truth of prophecy. Though
Xenophon was not, indeed, by design a witness to Jeremiah, yet that unprincipled
writer, whose object was flattery, did, notwithstanding, render service for God,
and sealed, by a public testimony, what had been divinely predicted by
Jeremiah.</font><br></div>

their feasts; for when the king of Babylon was drunk, he was slain, together
with his princes and counselors. I will inebriate them that they may exult, that
is, that they may become wanton. This refers to their sottishness, for they
thought that they should be always safe, and ridiculed Cyrus for suffering so
many hardships. For he lived in tents, and the siege had been now long, and
there was no want in the city. Thus, then, their wantonness destroyed them. And
hence the Prophet says that God would make them hot, that they might become
wanton in their pleasures; and then, that they might
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sleep a perpetual
sleep</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, that they might perish
in their luxury: </font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fH102

they should never awake; for Babylon, as we observed yesterday, might have
resisted for a long time, but it was at once taken. The Babylonians were not
afterwards allowed to have arms. Cyrus, indeed, suffered them to indulge in
pleasures, but took away from them the use of arms, deprived them of all
authority, so that they lived in a servile state, in the greatest degradation:
and then, in course of time, they became more and more contemptible, until at
length the city was so overthrown, that nothing remained but a few cottages, and
it became a mean village. We hence see that whatever God had predicted by his
servant Jeremiah was at length fulfilled, but at the appropriate time, &#8212;

the Prophet said that they would be like lions, but as to roaring only. But he
now shows how easy would that ruin be when it should please God to destroy the
Babylonians. Then as to their cry, they were like lions; but as to the facility
of their destruction, they were like lambs led to the slaughter. God does not
mean here that they would be endued with so much gentleness as to give
themselves up to a voluntary death; but he means, that however strong the
Babylonians might have previously been, and however they might have threatened
all other nations, they would then be women in courage, and be led to the
slaughter as though they were lambs or rams.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is a comparison which occurs often in the
prophets, for sacrifices were then daily made; and then the prophets considered
the destruction of the ungodly as a kind of sacrifice; for as sacrifices were

a judge and takes vengeance on the reprobate, it is the same as though he
erected an altar, and thus exhibited an evidence of the worship that is due to
him; for his glory and worship is honored, yea, and celebrated by such
sacrifices. Then the destruction of all the ungodly, as we have said, may be
justly compared to sacrifices; for in such instances the glory of God shines
forth, and this is what especially belongs to his worship. It at length follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the wonder expressed by the Prophet tended to
confirm what he had said, for he thus dissipated those things which usually
disturbed the minds of the godly, so as not to give full credit to his
predictions. There is indeed no doubt but that the godly thought of many things
when they heard Jeremiah thus speaking of the destruction of Babylon. It ever
occurred to them, &#8220;How<i> </i>can this be?&#8221; Hence Jeremiah
anticipated such thoughts, and assumed himself the character of one filled with
wonder<i> &#8212; </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How is
Shesbach taken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>as though he had said,
&#8220;Though<i> </i>the whole world should be astonished at the destruction of
Babylon, yet what I predict is certain; and thus shall they find who now admit
not the truth of what I say, as well as posterity.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he calls Babylon here Sheshach, as in Jeremiah
25. Some think it to be there the proper name of a man, and others regard it as
the name of a celebrated city in Chaldea. But we see that what they assert is
groundless; for this passage puts an end to all controversy, for in the first
clause he mentions Sheshach, and in the second, Babylon. That passage also in
Jeremiah 25 cannot refer to anything else except to Babylon; for the Prophet
said,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Drink<i> </i>shall all nations of
God&#8217;s cup of fury,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and after
them the king of Sheshach,&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">that is, when God has chastised all nations, at
length the king of Babylon shall have his turn. But in this place the Prophet
clearly shows that Sheshach can be nothing else than Babylon. The name is indeed
formed by inverting the alphabet. Nor is this a new notion; for they had this
retrograding alphabet in the time of Jerome. They put
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">t</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tau, </i>the last letter, in the place of
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aleph, </i>the first; then
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shin, </i>for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>beth, </i>thus we see how they formed Shesbach. The
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shin, </i>is found twice in the word, the last letter but one being put for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
beth, </i>the first, letter but one; and then
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">k</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>caph, </i>is put in the place of
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lamed, </i>according to the order of the retrograde alphabet. There is no
good reason for what some say, that the Prophet spoke thus obscurely for the
sake of the Jews, because the prophecy was disliked, and might have created
dangers to them; for why did he mention Sheshach and then Babylon in the same
verse? </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Many understand this passage enigmatically; but there
is no doubt but that that alphabet was then, as we have stated, in common use,
as we have <i>Ziphras, </i>as they call it, at this day. In the meantime, though
the Prophet was not timid, and encouraged his own people to confidence, it yet
pleased God that this prophecy should in a manner be hidden, but not that it
should be without evidence of its certainty, for we shall see in the last verse
but one of this chapter that he commanded the volume to be thrown into the
Euphrates, until the event itself manifested the power of God, which for a long
time remained as it were buried, until the time of visitation which of which he
had spoken.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that since thou art

<div><font face="Palatino">God again declares that he would take vengeance on
the idols of Babylon; not that God is properly incensed against idols, for they
are nothing but things made by men; but that he might show how much he detests
all superstitious and idolatrous worship. But he speaks of Bel as though it was
an enemy to himself; yet God had no quarrel with a dead figure, void of reason
and feeling; and such a contest would have been ridiculous. God, however, thus
rises up against Bel for the sake of men, and declares that it was an enemy to
himself, not because the idol, as we have said, of itself deserved any
punishment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we hence learn how detestable was that corruption
and that false religion. It appears evident from beathen writers that Bel was
the supreme god of the Chaldean nation; nay, that idol was worshipped throughout
all Assyria, as all testify with one consent. They thought that there had been a
king skillful in the knowledge of the stars, and hence he was placed by erring
men among the gods. But we learn from the prophets that this was a very ancient
superstition; and it is hardly probable that there had been any king of this
name &#8212; for otherwise Isaiah and Jeremiah, when predicting the ruin of this
idol, would not have been silent on the subject. That common opinion, then, does
not appear to me probable; but I think that on the contrary this name was given
to the idol according to the fancies of men; for no reason can be found why
heathen nations so named their false gods. It is indeed certain that divine
honor was given to mortals by the Greeks and the Romans, and by barbarous
nations. But the worship of Bel was more ancient than the time when such a thing
was done. And in such veneration was that idol held, that from it they called
some of their precious stones. They consecrated the eye-stone to the god of the
Assyrians, because it was a gem of great price. <i>(See Plin. </i>lib. 37, chap.
10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah, then, now declares that Bel would be
exposed to God&#8217;s vengeance, not that God, as we have said, was angry with
that statue, but he intended in this way to testify how much he abominated the
ungodly worship in which the Chaldeans delighted. Nor did he so much regard the
Chaldeans as the Jews; for I have often reminded you that it was a hard trial,
which might have easily endangered the faith of the people, to think that the
Chaldeans had not obtained so many and so remarkable victories, except God had
favored them. The Jews might on this account have had some doubts respecting the
temple and the law itself. As then the Babylonians triumphed when success
accompanied<i> </i>them, it was necessary to fortify the minds, of the godly,
that they might remain firm, though the Babylonians boasted of their victories.
Lest the faithful should succumb under their trials, the prophets supplied a
suitable remedy, which is done here by Jeremiah. God then declares that he would
<i>visit Bel; </i>for what reason and to what purpose? that the Jews might be
convinced that that idol could do nothing, but that they had been afflicted by
the Babylonians on account of their sins. That true religion, then, might not be
discredited, God testified that he would some time not only take vengeance on
the Chaldeans themselves, but also on their idol, which they had devised for
themselves; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>visit Bel in
Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and I will bring
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or<i> </i>draw
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>out of his mouth what he has
swallowed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">y[b</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>belo, </i>means indeed what is devoured; but the Prophet refers here to the
sacred offerings by which Bel was honored until that time. And there is no doubt
but that many nations presented gifts to that idol for the sake of the Chaldean
nation, as we find that gifts were brought from all parts of the world to
Jupiter Capitolinus when the Roman empire flourished; for when the Greeks, the
Asiatics, or the Egyptians, wished to obtain some favor, they sent golden
crowns, or chandeliers, or some precious vessels; and they sought it as the
highest privilege to dedicate their gifts to Jupiter Capitolinus. So, then,
there is no doubt but that many nations offered their gifts to Bel, when they
wished to flatter the Chaldeans. And hence the Prophet declares that when God
visited that idol, he would make it disgorge what it had before swallowed. This
is indeed not said with strict propriety; but the Prophet had regard to the
Jews, who might have doubted whether the God of Israel was the only true God,
while he permitted that empty image to be honored with so many precious
offerings; for this was to transfer the honor of the true God to a dead figure.
Then he says, I </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will draw
out</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as though Bel had swallowed what
had been offered to it, &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will draw out from its mouth what it has
swallowed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Though the language is not
strictly correct, yet we see that it was needful, so it might not disturb the
minds of the Jews, that almost all nations regarded that idol with so much
veneration.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards expresses his meaning more clearly by
adding, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the nations shall no more
flow
together</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH104</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We hence then see what he meant
by the voracity of Bel, even because there was a resort from all parts to this
temple, for the nations, seeking to ingratiate themselves with the Babylonians,
directed their attention to their god. We, indeed, know that the temple of Bel
remained even after the city was conquered; there is yet no doubt but that the
predictions of Jeremiah and of Isaiah have been accomplished. For Isaiah
says,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Lie prostrate does Bel, Nebo is
broken.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
46:1)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He names some other god, who is not made known by
heathen writers; but it is sufficiently evident from this testimony that Bel was
in high repute. He afterwards says that it would &#8220;be<i> </i>a burden to
the beasts even to weariness.&#8221; We hence learn that Bel was carried away,
not that it was worshipped by the Medes and the Persians, but because all the
wealth was removed, and probably that idol was made of gold.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It afterwards follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even the wall of Babylon has
fallen</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We have said elsewhere that this
prophecy ought not to be restricted to the first overthrow of Babylon, for its
walls were not then pulled down except in part, where the army entered, after
the streams of the Euphrates had been diverted. However, the ancient splendor of
the city still continued. But when Babylon was recovered by Darius, the son of
Hystaspes, then the walls were pulled down to their foundations, as Herodotus
writes, with whom other heathen authors agree. For Babylon had revolted together
with the Assyrians when the Magi obtained the government; but when Darius
recovered the kingdom, he prepared an army against the Assyrians who had
resorted to Babylon; and their barbarous cruelty is narrated, for they strangled
all the women that they might not consume the provisions. Each one was allowed
to keep one woman as a servant to prepare food and to serve as a cook; but they
spared neither matrons nor wives, nor their own daughters. For a time the
Persians were stoutly repulsed by them. At length, through the contrivance of
Zopyrus, Darius entered the city; he then demolished the walls and the gates,
and afterwards Babylon was no better than a village. Then also he hung the chief
men of the city, to<i> </i>the number of three or four thousand, which would be
incredible were we not to consider the extent of the city; for such a slaughter
would be horrible in a city of moderate size, even were men of all orders put to
death. But it hence appears what an atrocious cruelty it must have been, when
all the chief men were hung or fixed to crosses; and then also the walls were
demolished, though they were, as it has been elsewhere stated, of incredible
height and width. Their width was fifty feet; Herodotus names fifty cubits, but
I rather think they were feet; and yet their feet were longer than
common.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, Jeremiah now says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wall of Babylon had
fallen</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>there is no doubt but his
prophecy includes this second calamity, which happened under Darius; and this
confirms what I have referred to elsewhere. It now follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet exhorts the Israelites to flee from
Chaldea and Assyria. Yet this exhortation was intended for another purpose, to
encourage them in the hope of deliverance;<i> </i>for it was hardly credible
that they should ever have a free exit, for Babylon was to them like a
sepulcher. As then he exhorts them as to their deliverance<i>, </i>he intimates
that God would be their redeemer, as he had promised. But he shows that
God&#8217;s vengeance<i> </i>on Babylon would be dreadful, when he says, Flee
from the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>indignation of
God&#8217;s wrath.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must, however, observe, that the faithful were
thus awakened, lest, being inebriated with the indulgences of the Chaldeans,
they should obstinately remain there, when God stretched forth his hand to them;
for we know what happened when liberty to return was given to the Israelites
&#8212; a small portion only returned; some despised the great favor of God;
they were so accustomed<i> </i>to their habitations, and were so fixed there,
that they made no account of the Temple, nor of the land promised them by God.
The Prophet, then, that he might withdraw the faithful from such indulgences,
says, that all who, in their torpor, remained there, would be miserable, because
the indignation of God would kindle against that city. We now perceive the
object of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It appears, indeed, but a simple exhortation to the
Jews to remove, that they might not be polluted with the filth of Babylon, but
another end is also to be regarded, proposed by the holy Prophet. This
exhortation, then, contains in it a promise of return, as though he had said,
that they were not to fear, because liberty would at length be given them, as
God had promised. In the meantime, a stimulant is added to the promise, lest the
Israelites should be delighted with the pleasures of Chaldea, and thus despise
the inheritance promised them by God; for we know how great was the pleasantness
of that land, and how great was the abundance it possessed of all blessings; for
the fruitfulness of that land is more celebrated than that of all other
countries. No wonder, then, that the Prophet so strongly urged the Jews to
return, and that he set before them the vengeance of God to frighten them with
terror, in case they slumbered in Chaldea. And he afterwards adds,

lest the Jews should be disturbed in their minds, when they saw those dreadful
shakings which afterwards happened; for when their minds were raised to an
expectation of a return, great commotions began to arise in Babylon. Babylon, as
it is well known, was for a long time besieged, and, as is usual in wars, every
day brings forth something new. As, then, God, in a manner, shook the whole
land, it could not be, especially under increasing evils, but that the miserable
exiles should become faint, being in constant fear; for they were exposed to the

through trials, when they heard of grievous commotions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there is a doctrine here especially useful; for
when God designs to aid his Church, he suffers the world to be, in a manner,
thrown into confusion, that the favor of redemption may appear more remarkable.
Unless, then, the faithful were to have some knowledge of God&#8217;s mercy,
they could never endure with courageous minds the trials by which God proves
them, and while Satan, on the other hand, seeks to upset their faith. There is
the prelude of this very thing to be seen in the ancient people: God had
promised to be their redeemer; when the day drew nigh, war suddenly arose, and
the Medes and the Persians, as locusts, covered the whole land. We know what
various evils war brings with it. There is, then, no doubt but that the children
of God sustained many and grievous troubles, especially as they were exiles
there; they must have suffered want, they must have been harassed in various
ways. Now, as the event of war was uncertain, they might have fainted a hundred
times, had they not been supported by this prophecy. But, as I have said, so now
also God deals with his Church; for when a deliverer appears, all things seem to
threaten ruin rather than to promise a joyful and happy deliverance. It is then
necessary, that these prophecies should come to our minds, and that we should
apply, for our own benefit, what happened formerly to our fathers, for we are
the same body. There is, therefore, no reason for us at this day to wonder, if
all things seem to get worse and worse, when yet God has promised that the
salvation of his Church will ever be precious to him, and that he will take care
of her: how so? because it is said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let not your heart be faint, fear
ye not when rumors arise</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>one after
another; when one year brings tumults, and then another year brings new tumults,
yet let not all this disturb your minds.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH105</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And Christ seems to allude to these words of the
Prophet, when he says,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Wars<i> </i>shall arise, and
rumors of wars: be ye not troubled.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
24:6)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These words of Christ sufficiently warn us not to
think it strange, if the Church at this day be exposed to violent waves, and be
tossed as by continual storms: why so? because it is right and just that our
condition should be like that of the fathers, or at least approach to it. We
now, then, understand the design of the Prophet, and the perpetual use that
ought to be made of what is here taught.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Violence in the
land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ruler
upon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or after a <i>ruler. </i>This
refers to Cyrus, who succeeded Darius, whom some call Cyaxares. They, indeed, as
it is well known, both ruled; but Darius, who was older, had the honor of being
the supreme king. Afterwards Cyrus, when Darius was dead, became the king of the
whole monarchy. And Darius the Mede lived only one year after Babylon was taken.
But I doubt not but that the Prophet here bids the Jews to be of good courage
and of a cheerful mind, though the land should often change its masters; for
that change, however often, could take away nothing from God&#8217;s authority
and government. It afterwards follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

hand against idols, which were yet mere inventions of no account. This he did
for the sake of men, that the Israelites might know that they had been deceived
by the wiles of Satan, and that the faithful might understand that they ought
not to ascribe it to false gods, when God for a time spared the ungodly. However
wanton, then, they might be, in their prosperity, yet when they perished

<div><font face="Palatino">That, he might more fully convince the Jews of the
truth of all that he has hitherto said of the destruction of Babylon, he
declares that God would effect it, and that it would be applauded by all the
elements.

personification &#8212; for he ascribes knowledge to heaven and earth. It might,
indeed, be more refinedly explained, that angels and men would shout for joy,
but it would be a frigid explanation; and the Prophet removes every ambiguity,
by adding, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and all that is in
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>he includes, no doubt, the stars,
men, trees, fishes, birds, fields, stones, and rivers. And the expression is
very emphatical when he says, that all created things, though without reason and
understanding, would yet be full of joy, so that they would, in a manner,
rejoice and sing praise. If such would be the feeling in dead creatures, when
God put forth his hand against Babylon, would it be possible for that city to
remain safe, which was so hated by heaven and earth, and which was accursed by
birds and wild beasts, by trees, and everything void of understanding!
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that the Prophet heaps together all
kinds of figures and modes of speaking, in order to confirm weak minds, so that
they might confidently look forward to the destruction of Babylon. He at the
same time intimates that Babylon was hated by all creatures, because it had
reached to the highest pitch of wickedness. He then shows the cause by the
effect, as though he had said that Babylon was hated by heaven and earth, so
that heaven and earth seemed as though they deemed themselves in a manner
polluted by the sight of that city. As long, then, as Babylon stood, heaven and
earth sighed: but, on the contrary, when God appeared as an avenger, then heaven
and earth, and all things in them, would shout with joy. Could it then be that
God, the judge of the world, would always connive at its sins? If heaven and
earth could not endure it, and Babylon was so loathsome to all, and joy would
arise from its destruction, could God possibly allow that city, filled with so
many sins, and detested by heaven and earth, to escape with impunity his
judgment? </font><br></div>

things.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">THE words literally read thus, &#8220;As<i>

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lamed, </i>in the second clause, render the passage thus, &#8220;As the slain
of Israel have fallen through Babylon, so by Babylon shall they fall: &#8220;and
others render the last like the first, &#8220;through Babylon.&#8221; But the
simpler rendering is that which I have given, even that this would be the reward
which God would render Babylon, that they would fall everywhere through its
whole land, as it had slain the people of Israel. For the Prophet no doubt had
this in view, to alleviate the sorrow of the godly by some consolation; and the
ground of consolation was, that God would be the avenger of all the evils which
the Babylonians had brought on them. For it is a heavy trial when we think that
we are disregarded by God, and that our enemies with impunity oppress us
according to their own will. The Prophet, then, testifies that God would by no
means suffer that so many of the Israelites should perish unpunished, for he
would at length render to the Babylonians what they deserved, even that they who
destroyed others should in their turn be destroyed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may now easily gather what the Prophet means,
&#8220;As Babylon,&#8221; he says, &#8220;has made many in Israel to fall, so
now the Babylonians themselves shall fall.&#8221; To render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lamed, </i>by &#8220;through,&#8221;<i> </i>or, on account of, is improper.
Then he says the Babylonians themselves shall fall, the slain of the whole land.
By the whole land, I do not understand the whole world, as other interpreters,
but Chaldea only. Then everywhere in Chaldea, they who had been so cruel as to
shed innocent blood everywhere would perish.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH107</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And though that saying is generally
true, Whoso sheddeth man&#8217;s blood shall be punished; yet the word is
especially addressed to the Church. God, then, avenges all slaughters, because
he cannot bear his own image to be violated, which he has impressed on men. But
as he has a paternal care for his Church, he is in an especial manner the
avenger of that cruelty which the ungodly exercise towards the
faithful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, the Prophet means, that though God may
suffer for a time the ungodly to rage against his Church, yet he will be at the
suitable season its avenger, so that they shall everywhere be slain who have
been thus cruel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we hence learn that we ought by no means to
despair when God allows so much liberty to the ungodly, so that they slay the
miserable and the innocent, for the same thing happened formerly to the ancient
people. It was the Church of God in which the Chaldeans committed that carnage
of which the Prophet speaks: the children of God were then slain as sheep. If
the same thing should happen to us at this day, there would be no reason for us
to despond, but to wait for the time of vengeance of which the Prophet speaks
here; for experience will then show how precious to God is the life of all the
godly. It now follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

from Chaldea; but he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
who remain from the sword</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He then
intimates that the slaughter would be such, that it would include many of
God&#8217;s people, and that they would be destroyed. And we know that many
among them deserved such a sad end; but the Prophet now turns to address those
who had been preserved through God&#8217;s special favor. He then bids them to
<i>depart </i>and not to stand still or stay.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, we said yesterday what was the object of this
exhortation, even that the faithful might feel assured of their free return to
their own country, from which, nevertheless, they thought they were perpetually
excluded; for they had wholly despaired of deliverance, though it had been so
often promised. This exhortation, then, contains a promise; and in the meantime
the Prophet reminds us, that though God inflicted a temporary punishment on the
chosen people, yet his vengeance on the Babylonians would be perpetual. For God
not only tempers his rigor towards the faithful when he chastises them, but he
also gives them a happy issue, so that all their afflictions become helps to
their salvation, as Paul also teaches us.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450828&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:28.) In short, the punishments inflicted by God on his children are so many
medicines; for he always consults their safety even when he manifests tokens of
his wrath. But the case with the ungodly is different; for all their punishments
are perpetual, even those which seem to have an end. How so? because they lead
to eternal ruin. This is what the Prophet means when he bids those who
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>remained, to flee from
Chaldea</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>according to what we observed
yesterday, when he said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Flee ye
from the indignation of God&#8217;s wrath.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>There is, then, an implied comparison between the punishment which brings
ultimate ruin on the reprobate, and the temporary punishment inflicted by God on
his children.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He bids them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>remember Jehovah from
afar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some apply this to the seventy
years, but, in my view, in a sense too restricted. I then doubt not but that the
Prophet bids them to entertain hope and to look to God, however far they may
have been driven from him, as though he were wholly alienated from them. The
Israelites had then been driven into distant lands, as though God never meant to
restore them. As, then, the distance was so great between Chaldea and Judea,
what else could come into the minds of the miserable exiles but that God was far
removed from them, so that it was in vain for them to seek or call upon him? The
Prophet obviates this want of faith, and raises their confidence, so that they
might not cease to flee to God, though they had been driven into distant lands:
<i>Be, </i>then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mindful of
Jehovah from afar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let Jerusalem ascend on your
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, though so many obstacles
may intercept your faith, yet think of Jerusalem. The condition of the people
required that they should be thus animated, for they might otherwise, as it has
been said, have a hundred times despaired, and have thus become torpid in their
calamities. Then the Prophet testifies that an access to God was open to them,
and that though they were removed far, he yet had a care for them, and was ready
to bring help whenever called upon And for the same reason he bids them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>direct their minds to
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so as to prefer the Temple of
God to all the world, and never to rest quiet until God restored them, and
liberty were given them of worshipping him there.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this passage deserves special notice, as it
applies to us at this day; for when the scattering of the Church takes place, we
think that we are forsaken by God, and we also conclude that he is far away from
us, so that he is sought in vain. As, then, we are wont, being inclined to
distrust, to become soon torpid in our calamities, as though we were very remote
from God, and as though he did not turn his eyes to look on our miseries, let us
apply to ourselves what is here said, even to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>remember Jehovah from
afar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, when we seem to be
involved in extreme miseries, when God hides his face from us and seems to be
afar off; in short, when we think ourselves forsaken, and circumstances appear
as proving this, we ought still to contend with all such obstacles until our
faith triumphs, and to employ our thoughts in remembering God, though he may be
apparently alienated from us. Let us also learn to direct our minds to the
Church; for however miserable our condition may be, it is yet better than the
happiness which the ungodly seek for themselves in the world. When, therefore,
we see the ungodly flattering themselves as to their possessions, when we see
them pleased and delighted as though God were dealing indulgently with them, let
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jerusalem come to our
minds</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>That is, let us prefer the state
of the Church, which may be<i> </i>yet sad and deformed, and such as we would
shun, were we to follow our own inclinations. Let then the condition of the
Church come to our minds, that is, let us embrace the miseries common to the
godly, and let it be more pleasant to us to be connected with the children of
God in all their afflictions, than to be<i> </i>inebriated with the prosperity
of those who only delight in the world, and are at the same time accursed by
God. This is the improvement which we ought to make of what is here taught. It

<div><font face="Palatino">It is thought that these words were spoken by the
Prophet to the faithful, to confirm them as to their return. But I rather think
that they were spoken by way of anticipation. They who think that they were
spoken as a formula to the Israelites, that they might with more alacrity
prepare<i> </i>themselves for their return, suppose a verb understood,
&#8220;Say ye, we are confounded (or ashamed), because we have heard
reproach;&#8221; even that sorrow would wound the minds of the faithful, to the
end that they might nevertheless go through all their difficulties. But as I
have said, the Prophet here repeats what the faithful might have of themselves
conceived in their own minds; and he thus speaks by way of concession, as though
he said, &#8220;I<i> </i>know that you have in readiness these words,
&#8216;We<i> </i>are ashamed, we are overwhelmed with reproaches; strangers have
entered into the sanctuary of God: since the temple is polluted and the city

supply reasons for despair.&#8217;&#8221; </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, the thoughts of the flesh suggested to the
faithful such things as might have dejected their minds, the Prophet meets them

have heard reproach</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, because we
have been harassed by the reproaches of our enemies. For there is no doubt but
that the Chaldeans heaped many reproaches on that miserable people; for their
pride and their cruelty were such that they insulted the Jews, especially as
their religion was wholly different. As, then, the ears of the people were often
annoyed by reproaches, the Prophet declares here that they had some cause
according to the flesh, why they could hardly dare to entertain the hope of a
return.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To the same purpose is what he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shame hath covered our
faces</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, because
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>strangers have come into the
sanctuaries of Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> For it was the
chief glory of the chosen people that they had a temple where they did not in
vain call upon God; for this promise was like an invaluable
treasure,</font><br></div>

132:13, 14)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, God was pleased to choose for himself that
throne and habitation in the world, it was, as I have said, the principal
dignity of the people. But when the temple was overthrown, what more remained
for them? it was as though religion was wholly subverted, and as though God also
had left them and moved elsewhere; in short, all their hope of divine aid and of
salvation was taken away from there.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, understand why the Prophet speaks thus
according to the common thoughts of the people, even that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>covered with shame, because
strangers had come into God&#8217;s
sanctuaries</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for that habitation, which
God had chosen for himself, was polluted. And he says
&#8220;sanctuaries,&#8221;<i> </i>in the plural number, because the temple had
many departments, as the tabernacle had; for there was rite vestibule or the
court where they killed the victims; and then there was the holy place, and
there was the holy of holies, which was the inner sanctuary. It was then on this
account that he said that the <i>sanctuaries </i>of the house of God were
possessed by strangers; for it was a sad and shameful pollution when strangers
took possession of God&#8217;s temple, where even the common people were not
admitted; for though the whole of the people were consecrated to God, yet none
but the priests entered the temple. It was therefore a dreadful profanation of
the temple, when enemies entered it by force and for the sake of degrading it.
What then remained for the people, except despair?</font><br></div>

to raise up the minds of the godly that they might not succumb under their
trials, on seeing that they were exposed to shame and were destitute of all
honors. He then says that the time would come when God would take vengeance on
the <i>idols </i>of Babylon. And thus God claims for himself that power which
seemed then to have almost disappeared; for the temple being overthrown, the
Babylonians seemed in a manner to triumph over him, as God&#8217;s power in the
temple was overcome. Then as the ruin of it, as we have said, seemed to have
extinguished God&#8217;s power, the Prophet applies a remedy, and says that
though the temple was overthrown, yet God remained perfect and his power
unchangeable. But among other things he bids the faithful patiently to wait, for
he invites their attention to the hope of what was as yet
hidden.</font><br></div>

again sing joyfully his praises. But he says, &#8220;the days will come;&#8221;
by these words he reminds us that we are to cherish the hope of the promises
until God completes his work; and thus he corrected that ardor by which we are
seized in the midst of our afflictions, for we wish immediately to fly away to
God. The Prophet, then, here exhorts the faithful to sustain courage until the
time fixed by God; and so he refers them to God&#8217;s providence, lest they
assumed too much in wishing him to act as their own minds led them.

<div><font face="Palatino">The reason for the crashing is now added, even
because God had resolved to lay waste Babylon, and to reduce it to nothing.
Jeremiah again calls the faithful to consider the power of God. He then says,
that it would not be a work done by men, because God would put forth his great
power, which cannot be comprehended by human minds. He then sets the name of God
in opposition to all creatures, as though he had said, that what exceeds all the
efforts of men, would yet be easily done by God. He, indeed, represents God here
as before our eyes, and says that Babylon would perish, but that it was God who
would lay it waste. He thus sets forth God here as already armed for the purpose
of cutting off Babylon. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he
will destroy from her the magnificent voice,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>that is, her immoderate boasting.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What follows is explained by many otherwise than I
can approve; for they say that the waves made a noise among the Babylonians at
the time when the city was populous; for where there is a great concourse of
men, a great noise is heard, but solitude and desolation bring silence. They
thus, then, explain the words of the Prophet, that though now waves, that is,
noises, resounded in Babylon like great waters, and the sound of their voice
went forth, yet God would destroy their great or magnificent voice. But I have
no doubt but that what the Prophet meant by their great voice, was their
grandiloquent boasting in which the Babylonians indulged during their
prosperity. While, then, the monarchy flourished, they<i> </i>spoke as from the
height. Their silence from fear and shame would follow, as the Prophet
intimates, when God checked<i> </i>that proud glorying.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what follows I take in a different sense; for I
apply it to the Medes and the Persians: and so there is a relative without an
antecedent &#8212; a mode of speaking not unfrequent in Hebrew. He then
expresses the manner in which God would destroy or abolish the grandiloquent
boasting of the Babylonians, even
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because their
waves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, of the Persians,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>would make a noise like great
waters;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, the Persians, and the
Medes would rush on them like impetuous waves, and thus the Babylonians would be
brought to silence and reduced to desolation.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH109</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> When they were at peace, and no enemy
disturbed them, they then gave full vent to their pride; and thus vaunting was
the speech of Babylon as long as it flourished; but when suddenly the enemies
made an irruption, then Babylon became silent or mute on account of the
frightful sound within it. We hence see why he compares the Persians and the
Medes to violent waves which would break and put an end to that sound which was
before heard in Babylon. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms the former verse; for as the thing of

says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>desolators shall come

what he now transfers to the Medes and the Persians. He had said,

Persians and the Medes; yea, with vast forces assembled from many nations, Now
that the same name is given to God and to the Persians, this is done with regard
to the ministration. Properly speaking, God was the desolator of Babylon; but as
in this expedition he employed the services of men, and made the Persians and
the Medes, as it were, his ministers, and the executioners of his judgment, the
name which properly belongs to God is transferred to the ministers whom he
employed. The same mode of speaking is also used when blessings are spoken of.
He is said to have raised up saviors for his people, while yet he himself is the
only Savior, nor can any mortal assume that name without sacrilege.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;070315&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Judges
3:15;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;121305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 13:5.) For God&#8217;s peculiar glory is taken away, when salvation is
sought through the arm of men, as we have seen in Jeremiah 17. But though God is
the only author of salvation, yet it is no objection to this truth, that he
employs men in effecting his purposes. So also he converts men, illuminates
their minds by the ministers of the gospel, and also delivers them from eternal
death.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;420117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
1:17.) Doubtless were any one to arrogate to himself what Christ is pleased to
concede<i> </i>to the ministers of his gospel, he could by no means be endured;
but as I have already said, we must bear this in mind, that though God acts by
his own power and never borrows anything from any one, nor stands in need of any
help, yet what properly belongs to him is, in a manner, applied to men, at least
by way of concession. So now, then, the Prophet calls God the desolator, and
afterwards he honors with the same title the Persians and the
Medes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the valiant men of Babylon were
taken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>according to what we have before
seen, that the city was so taken that no one resisted. Then he adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their bow was
broken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>there is a part stated for the
whole; for under the word <i>bow </i>he includes all kinds of armor. But as bows
were used at a distance, and as enemies were driven from the walls by casting
arrows, the Prophet says that there would be no use made of bows, because the
enemies would skew themselves in the middle of the city before the watchmen saw
them, as we know that such was really the case. We now perceive why the Prophet
mentions the bow rather than swords or other weapons.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The reason follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because Jehovah is the God of
retributions, and recompensing her
recompenses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, he will
recompense. The Prophet here confirms all that he had said, and reasons from the
nature or character of God himself. As then the fall of Babylon would hardly be
believed by the faithful, the Prophet does not ask what God is in himself, but
declares that he is the God of retributions, as though he had said, that it
belonged to God, and that it could not be separated from his nature, to be the
God of retributions, otherwise his judgment would be nothing, his justice would
be nothing. For if the reprobate succeeded with impunity, and if the righteous
were oppressed without any aid, would not God be like a stock of wood or an
imaginary thing? For why has he power, except that he may exercise justice? But
God cannot be without power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, see how forcible is this confirmation,
with which the Prophet doses his discourse: for it is the same as if he had
said, that no doubt could possibly be entertained as to the fall of Babylon,
because God is the God of retributions. Either there is no God, he says, or
Babylon must be destroyed; how so? for if there be a God, he is the God of
retributions; if he is the God of retributions, then recompensing he will
recompense. Now, it is well known how wicked Babylon was, and in what various
ways it had provoked the wrath of God. Then it was impossible for it to escape
his hand unpunished, since it had in so many ways sought its own
ruin.</font><br></div>

that when he had inebriated them, they would be overtaken with perpetual sleep;
for death immediately followed that feasting. They had prolonged their feast to
the middle of the night; and while they were sitting at table, a tumult arose
suddenly in the city, and the king heard that he was in the hand of his enemies.
As, then, feasting and death followed in close succession<i>, </i>it is a
striking allusion given by the Prophet, when God threatens the Babylonians with
perpetual sleep, after having inebriated them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he mentions here the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rulers
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>captains</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>as well as the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>counsellors
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wise
</i></font><font face="Palatino">men. We, indeed, know that the Babylonians were
inflated by a twofold confidence, &#8212; they thought themselves endued with
consummate wisdom, and also that they possessed warlike valor. This is the
reason why the Prophet expresses so distinctly, that all the captains and rulers
in Babylon, however superior in acuteness and prudence, would yet be
overtaken<i> </i>with perpetual sleep before they rose from their table. And we
must observe that Jeremiah had many years thus prophesied of Babylon; and hence
we conclude that his mind as well as his tongue was guided by the Spirit of God,
for he could not have possibly conjectured<i> </i>what would be after eighty
years: yet so long a time intervened between the prediction and its
accomplishment, as we shall presently see.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, the Prophet uses here a mode of speaking
which often occurs in Scripture, even that insensibility is a kind of
drunkenness by which God dementates men through his hidden judgment. It ought,
then, to be noticed, that whatever prudence and skill there is in the world,
they are in such a way the gifts of God, that whenever he pleases the wisest are
blinded, and, like the drunken, they either go astray or fall. But we must bear
in mind what I have already said, that the Prophet alludes to that very history,
for there was then an immediate transition from feasting to death. It now
follows,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet again introduces God as the speaker, that
what he said might obtain more attention from the Jews; and for this reason he
subjoined a eulogy to the last verse, and said that the <i>king </i>spoke,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whose name is Jehovah of
hosts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We have stated elsewhere what is
the design of such expressions, even that men may rise above everything seen in
the world when God&#8217;s power is mentioned, that they may not try to contain
it in their own small measure. Then the Prophet now again repeats the name of
God, that the Jews might receive with becoming reverence what he
announced.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And what he says is,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The wall of
Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>however <i>wide </i>it may be,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall yet be surely
demolished.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We have said that the walls
were fifty feet wide, and the feet were indeed long, though Herodotus, as I have
said, mentions cubits and not feet. The width, indeed, was such that four horses
abreast meeting, could pass, there being space enough for them. It hence, then,
appears, that their thickness was so great, that the Babylonians confidently
disregarded whatever had been predicted by the Prophet; for no engines of war
could have ever beaten down walls so thick, especially as they were made of
bricks and cemented by bitumen. As, then, the material, beside the thickness,
was so firm and strong, this prophecy was incredible. It did not indeed reach
the Babylonians, but the Jews themselves regarded as a fable all that they had
heard from the mouth of the Prophet. Yet God did not in vain refer to width of
the wall, in order that the faithful might feel assured that the walls of
Babylon could not possibly resist him, however firm they might be in their
materials and thickness. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
wall</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall surely be
demolished.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards mentions the <i>gates, </i>which
Herodotus says were of brass when Darius took them away. He, indeed, means the
doors, but the Prophet includes the framework as well as the brazen doors. He
then says, they shall <i>be
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>consumed with
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Babylonians might have laughed
at this threatening of Jeremiah, for brass could not have been consumed with
fire, even if enemies had been permitted to set fire to them &#8212; for brass
could not have been so soon melted. But as the Prophet had predicted this by
God&#8217;s command, so at length his prophecy was verified when he was dead,
because it was proved by the event that this proceeded from God; for when the
doors were removed, the gates themselves were demolished; and it may have been
that Darius put fire to them, that he might the sooner destroy the gates and the
towers, which were very high, as well as the walls.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Labor shall the people in vain,
and the nations in the fire; they shall be
wearied</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>So this passage is commonly
explained, as though the Prophet had said, that when the walls of Babylon had
begun to burn, and the gates to be consumed with fire, there would be no remedy,
though the Babylonians might greatly weary themselves and fatigue themselves in
attempting to quench the fire. But this exposition seems to be forced and
unnatural. I therefore take the words, though future, in the past tense. And as
the walls of Babylon had not been erected without great labor, and a vast number
of men had been hired, some to bring bitumen, others to heap up the earth, and
others to make the bricks, the Prophet in this place intimates that all this
labor would be in vain, even because it was spent for the fire, &#8212; that
whatever they did who had been either hired for wages or forced by authority to
erect the walls, was labor for the fire; that is, they labored that their work
might eventually be consumed by fire. This seems to me to be the real meaning of
the Prophet. He then says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the people had labored in
vain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or for nothing, and why? because
they <i>labored for the fire. </i>The second clause is in my view an explanation
of the former.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino">This is a remarkable sealing of the whole of what we
have hitherto found said respecting the destruction of Babylon; for the Prophet
not only spoke and promulgated what the Spirit of God had dictated, but also put
it down in a book; and not contented with this, he delivered the book to Seraiah
the son of Neriah, when he went to Babylon by the command of Zedekiah the king,
that he might read it there, east it into the Euphrates, and strengthen himself
in the hope of all those things which had been divinely
predicted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says first that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commanded Seraiah
</i></font><font face="Palatino">what he was to do, even to read the volume and
to throw it into the Euphrates, as we shall hereafter see. But he points out the
time and mentions the disposition of Seraiah, that we might not think it strange
that the Prophet dared to give an authoritative command to the king&#8217;s
messenger, which a man of another character would have refused. As to the time,
it was the fourth year of the reign of Zedekiah; seven years before the city was
taken, being besieged the ninth year and taken the eleventh. Then seven years
before the destruction and ruin of the city, Seraiah was sent by the king to
Babylon. There is no doubt but that the message was sent to pacify the king of
Babylon, who had been offended with the fickleness and perfidy of King Zedekiah;
an ambassador was then sent to seek pardon. But what the Jews say, that Zedekiah
went to Babylon, is wholly groundless; and we know that Sederola, whence they
have taken this, is full of all kinds of fables and trifles; and on such a point
as this, sacred history would not have been silent, for it was a thing of great
moment; and then the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ta</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>at, </i>expresses no such thing, but may be rendered in this sense, that the
messenger was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sent
for</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or <i>by, </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the place of
Zedekiah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Let us then be satisfied with this
simple and obvious explanation, that Seraiah was the king&#8217;s messenger sent
to remove the offenses taken by the
Babylonians.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH111</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And this happened
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the fourth year of
Zedekiah.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, by calling Seraiah
<i>a</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> prince of
quietness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>I doubt not but that a
reference is made to his gentleness and meekness; and I wonder that in so plain
a thing interpreters have toiled so much. One renders it, even the Chaldean
paraphrase, &#8220;the<i> </i>prince of the oblations,&#8221; as though he was
set over to examine the presents offered to the king. Others imagine that he was
a facetious man who amused the king in his fears; and others think that he was
called &#8220;prince<i> </i>of quietness,&#8221; because he preserved the city
in a quiet state. But all these things are
groundless.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH112</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> No other view, then, seems to me right,
but that he was a prince of a quiet disposition. Therefore the word
&#8220;quietness&#8221; ought not to be referred to any office, but a noun in
the genitive case used instead of an adjective. He was, then, a quiet prince, or
one of a placid disposition. And this commendation was not without reason added,
because we know how haughtily the princes rejected everything commanded them by
the servants of God. Seraiah might have objected, and said that he was sent to
Babylon, not by a private person, and one of the common people, but by the king
himself. He might then have haughtily reproved the Prophet for taking too much
liberty with him, &#8220;Who art thou, that thou darest to command me, when I
sustain the person of the king? and when I am going in his name to the king of
Babylon? and then thou seekest to create disturbances by ordering me to read
this volume. What if it be found on me? what if some were to suspect that I
carry such a thing to Babylon? would I not, in the first place, carry death in
my bosom? and would I not, in the second place, be perfidious to my king? for
thus my message would be extremely disliked.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As then Seraiah might have stated all these things,
and have rejected the command which Jeremiah gave him, his gentleness is
expressly mentioned, even that he was a meek man, and who withheld not his
service &#8212; who,<i> </i>in short, was ready to obey God and his servant.
What, in a word, is here commended<i>, </i>is the meekness of Seraiah, that he
received the Prophet with so much readiness, &#8212; that he suffered himself to
be commanded by him, and that he also hesitated not to execute what he had
commanded, when yet it might have been a capital offense, and it might
especially have been adverse to his mission, which was to reconcile<i> </i>the
king of Babylon. And surely it is an example worthy of being noticed, that
Seraiah was not deterred by danger from rendering immediate obedience to the
Prophet&#8217;s command, nor did he regard himself nor the omee committed to
him, so as to reject<i> </i>the Prophet, according to the usual conduct of
princes, under the pretext of their own dignity; but laying aside his own honor
and forgetting all his greatness, he became a disciple to Jeremiah, who yet, as
it is well known, had been long despised by the people, and had sometimes been
nearly brought to death. It was, then, a remarkable instance of virtue in
Seraiah, that he received with so much modesty and readiness what had been said
to him by the Prophet, and that he obeyed his command, to the evident danger of
his own life. It now follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here we see, on one hand, what courage the Prophet
had, who dared to command the king&#8217;s messenger; for though Seraiah was a
meek man, so as to render himself submissive, yet Jeremiah exposed himself to
danger; for he might have been timid, though he was neither proud nor arrogant;
and thus, as men are wont to do when terrified, he might have referred to the
king what he had heard from the Prophet. Then Jeremiah did what we here read,
not without danger; and hence appears his firmness. We<i> </i>then see that he
was endued with the spirit of invincible courage, so as to discharge his office
freely and intrepidly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">On the other hand, we have to observe not only the
meekness of Seraiah, but also his piety, together with his modesty; for except
he had in him a strong principle of religion, he might have adduced plausible
reasons for refusing. As, then, he was so submissive, and dreaded no danger, it
is evident that the real fear of God was vigorous in his soul.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And these things ought to be carefully noticed; for
who of our cornfly princes can be found at this day who will close his eyes to
all dangers, and resolutely disregard all adverse events, when God and his
servants are to be obeyed? And then we see how pusillanimous are those who
profess to be God&#8217;s ambassadors, and claim to themselves the name of
Pastors. As, then, teachers dare not faithfully to perform their office, so on
the other hand courtly princes are so devoted to themselves and to their own
prudence, that they are unwilling to undertake duties which are unpopular. On
this account, then, this passage, with all its circumstances, ought to be
carefully noticed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wrote in a book all the evil
which was to come on Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>even
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all those
words</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>(he refers to the prophecies
which we have seen;) </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and Jeremiah
said to
Seraiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH113</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>etc. Here the boldness of
Jeremiah comes to view, that he hesitated not to command Seraiah to read this
book when he came to Babylon and had seen it. To see it, is not mentioned here
without reason, for the splendor of that city might have astonished Seraiah.
Then the Prophet here seasonably meets the difficulty, and bids him to disregard
the height of the walls and towers; and that however Babylon might dazzle the
eyes of others, yet he was to look down, as from on high, on all that pomp and
pride: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When thou
enterest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>the city,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and hast seen it, then read this

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">arq</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
kora, </i>means to call, to proclaim, and also to read. Then Seraiah must have
read this book by himself; nor do I doubt but that the words ought to be so
understood, as we shall see. It was not then necessary for Seraiah to have a
pulpit, or in a public way to read the book to an assembled people; but it was
sufficient to read it privately by himself, without any witnesses; and this may
be gathered from the context.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt say, Jehovah, thou
hast spoken against this place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It hence
appears that Seraiah was commanded to read the book, not for the benefit of
hearers, for they would have been doubly deaf to the words of Seraiah. And it is
not probable that the Hebrew language was then familiar to the Chaldeans. There
is a great affinity, as it is well known, in the languages, but there is also
some difference. But we conclude, from this passage, that the reading was in a
chamber, or in some secret place; for Seraiah is bidden to fix all his thoughts
on God, and to address his words to him. He did not then undertake the work or
office<i> </i>of a preacher, so as openly to proclaim all these things to the
Babylonians. But having inspected the city, he was to read the book by himself,
that is, what had been written.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this also deserves to be noticed; for however
courageous we may be, yet our constancy and boldness are more apparent when we
have to do with men than when we are alone, and God is the only witness; for
when no one sees us, we tremble; and though we may have previously appeared to
have manly courage, yet when alone, fear lays hold on us. There is hardly one in
a hundred who is so bold as he ought to be when God alone is witness. But shame
renders us courageous and constrains us to be firm, and the vigor which is
almost extinct in private is roused in public. As, then, ambition almost always
rules in men, this passage ought to be carefully noticed, where the Prophet
commands Seraiah to deal alone with God, and, though no mortal was present, to
strengthen himself, by relying on the certain and infallible fidelity of God;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>say,
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc. </i>And it is doubtless a real
experiment of faith, when we consider within ourselves the promises of God, and
go not forth before the public to avow our firmness; for when any one in silence
acknowledges God to be true, and strengthens himself in his promises, and so
disregards the false judgments of all, that were he alone in the world, he would
not yet despond, &#8212; this is a true and real trial of
faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt

words was, that Seraiah might feel assured that God was true, and embrace in his
presence what he read, and not doubt but that the word, which came from God,
would, in due time, be accomplished: how so? because God is true. The word

and cast it into the Euphrates, and shalt say, Thus sink shall
Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here is added an external
symbol to confirm the faith of Seraiah. We must yet bear in mind, that this was
not said to Seraiah for his own sake alone, but that the people might also know,
that the king&#8217;s messenger, who had been sent for the sake of conciliating,
was also the messenger of God and of the Prophet, who might have otherwise been
despised by the people. When, therefore, the faithful knew this, they were in no
ordinary way confirmed in the truth of the prophecy. Jeremiah, then, not only
consulted the benefit of Seraiah alone, but that of all the godly; for though
this was unknown for a long time, yet the messenger afterwards acknowledged that
this command had been given him by Jeremiah, and that he took the book and cast
it into the Euphrates. This, then, was given as a confirmation to all the
godly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the symbols by which God sealed the prophecies
in former times, we have spoken elsewhere; I therefore pass them by slightly
now: only we ought to bear in mind this one thing, that these signs were only
temporary sacraments; for ordinary sacraments are permanent, as the holy supper
and baptism. But the sign mentioned here was temporary, and referred, as they
say, to a special action: it yet had the force and character of a sacrament, as
to its use, the confirmation of this prophecy. Seraiah was then bidden to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tie a stone
</i></font><font face="Palatino">to the book, and then to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cast it into the
Euphrates</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>why so? that the volume might
not swim on the surface of the water, but be sunk down to the bottom; and the
application follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt
say</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. We see that words ought ever
to be connected with signs. We hence conclude how fatuous the Papists are, who
practice many ceremonies, but without knowledge. They are, indeed, dead and
empty things, whatever signs men may devise for themselves, except God&#8217;s
word be added. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou
shalt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>say, Thus sink shall Babylon, and
shall not rise from the evil which I shall bring upon
her</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In short, Seraiah was commanded, as
the Prophet&#8217;s messenger, to predict by himself concerning the fall of
Babylon; but it was for the sake of all the godly, who were afterwards taught
what had been done.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fH115</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Conclusion follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus far the words of
Jeremiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We have said that the
prophets, after having spoken in the Temple, or to the people, afterwards
collected brief summaries, and that these contained the principal things: from
these the prophetic books were made up. For Jeremiah did not write the volume as
we have it at this day, except the chapters; and it appears evident that it was
not written in the order in which he spoke. The order of time is not, then,
everywhere observed; but the scribes were careful in this respect, that they
collected the summaries affixed to the doors of the Temple; and so they added
this conclusion, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus far the
words of Jeremiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But this, in my view,
is not to be confined to the prophecies respecting the fall of Babylon; for I
doubt not but that the scribe who had collected all his prophecies, added these
words, that he had thus far transcribed the words of Jeremiah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence conclude that the last chapter is not
included in the prophetic book of Jeremiah, but that it contains history only as
far as was necessary to understand what is here taught: for it appears evident
that many parts of the prophecy could not be understood without the knowledge of
this history. As to the book of Lamentations, we know that it was a work
distinct from the prophecies of Jeremiah: there is, then, no wonder that it has
been added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus far the words of
Jeremiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that Since thou
hast deigned to choose us for thy people, we may not doubt but that our enemies
will be before thee like Babylon, so that when thou hast chastised us, thou wilt
at length, by a fatal and perpetual destruction, so lay them prostrate, that
they shall rise up no more; and when thou hast killed the body, manifest thyself
as our deliverer, until we shall at length be gathered into that celestial
kingdom which has been prepared for us by thine only-begotten Son. &#8212;
Amen.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>ON</b></font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">THE LAMENTATIONS
OF JEREMIAH</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">PREFACE</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I undertake now to explain The Lamentations of
Jeremiah. We must inquire when the Book was composed by the Prophet, and also
what was the object of the author. Grossly mistaken was <i>Jerome</i>, who
thought that it is the Elegy which Jeremiah composed on the death of Josiah; for
we see nothing here that is suitable to that event. There is indeed mention made
in one place of a king, but what is said there cannot be applied to Josiah; for
he was never driven into exile, but was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers.
From the whole contents of the Book we may justly conclude, that it was written
after the city was destroyed, and the people led into exile.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some think that Jeremiah, before this calamity
happened, historically described it, and that he thus prophesied of what was
future and yet unknown. But this is by no means probable; for Jeremiah here sets
before the eyes of all, those things which they knew as facts; and we shall
easily discover that his manner of stating things is wholly different from that
used in prophetic writings. There is, then, no doubt but that Jeremiah, after
the city was destroyed and the Temple burnt, bewailed the miserable state of his
own nation, not after the manner of heathens, but that he might shew that even
in so disastrous a state of things some benefit might be derived from what he
says. And this is what ought to be especially noticed; for except we bear this
in mind, the Book will lose its peculiar interest, but if we direct our minds to
that desolation, which wholly dejected not only the people in general, but also
the Prophet himself, so that he lost all hope, we may surely hence derive no
small benefit. It is an easy thing to extol in high terms the favor of God in
prosperity, and also to exhort those who have reasons to hope well to entertain
confidence, and to bring forward God&#8217;s promises, that the minds of the
godly may recumb on them; but when things are in a state of despair, and God
seems to have forsaken his Church, since prophecy still remains in its force,
and God appears as stretching forth his hand to the miserable, and to such as
are almost in a hopeless state, we hence derive much benefit, and this is the
chief use of what is taught here. But. we see that Jeremiah, when the kingdom
had fallen, when the king with all his children was exposed to extreme disgrace,
when in short the covenant of God seemed wholly abolished, still continued to
discharge his office, which he certainly did not do in vain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When, therefore, he understood that his teaching
would not be without fruit, he was thus induced to speak first of God&#8217;s
judgments; secondly, to exhort the people to repentance; thirdly, to encourage
them to hope; and lastly, to open the door for prayer to God, so that the people
in their extremities might venture to flee to God&#8217;s mercy; which could not
have been done without faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now in a measure understand for what purpose this
Book was written by Jeremiah: his object was to shew that though nothing in the
land appeared but desolation, and the Temple being destroyed, the Covenant of
God appeared as made void, and thus all hope of salvation had been cut off, yet
hope still remained, provided the people sought God in true repentance and
faith; and he thus proceeded in the course of his calling, and made it evident
that his doctrine would not be without benefit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He indeed bewails, as I have said, the extreme
calamity of his people; but he mingles with his lamentations the doctrine of
repentance and faith&#8217; For, on the one hand, he shews that the people
suffered a just punishment for the many iniquities, of which they could not have
been healed; and then, on the other hand, he gives them some intimations of
God&#8217;s mercy, that in death itself the Jews might seek life, nay, that in
the lowest depths they might know that God would be propitious to them. He at
length by his own example stimulates them to pray; but prayer is founded on
faith. It then follows, that Jeremiah, when the people had become wholly
alienated from the worship of God, yet spent his labor in collecting together
the remnant. Though, then, the whole Church was not only in the greatest
disorder, but also reduced as it were almost to nothing, yet Jeremiah
constructed some sort of building out of the ruins. This is the substance of
this Book.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Greek Translators call this Book
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Qrh&gt;nouv</font><font face="Palatino">,

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet could not sufficiently express the
greatness of the calamity, except by expressing his astonishment. He then
assumes the person of one who on seeing something new and unexpected is filled
with amazement. It was indeed a thing incredible; for as it was a place chosen
for God to dwell in, and as the city Jerusalem was not only the royal throne of
God, but also as it were his earthly sanctuary, the city might have been thought
exempted from all danger. Since it had been said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Here is my rest
for ever, here will I
dwell,&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
132:14,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God seemed to have raised that city above the clouds,
and to have rendered it free from all earthly changes. We indeed know that there
is nothing fixed and certain in the world, and that the greatest empires have
been reduced to nothing; but, the state of Jerusalem did not depend on human
protection, nor on the extent of its dominion, nor on the abundance of men, nor
on any other defenses whatever, but it was founded by a celestial decree, by the
promise of God, which is not subject to any mutations. When, therefore, the city
fell, uprooted from its foundations, so that nothing remained, when the Temple
was disgracefully plundered and then burnt by enemies, and further, when the
king was driven into exile, his children slain in his presence, and also the
princes, and when the people were scattered here and there, exposed to every
contumely and reproach, was it not, a horrible and monstrous
thing?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was not, then, without reason that the Prophet
exclaimed, <i>How!</i> for no one could have ever thought that such a thing
would have happened; and then, after the event, no one with a calm mind could
have looked on such a spectacle, for innumerable temptations must have come to
their minds; and this thought especially must have upset the faith of all
&#8212; &#8221;What does God mean? How is it that, he has promised that this
city would be perpetual? and now there is no appearance of a city, and no hope
of restoration in future.&#8221; As, then, this so sad a spectacle might not
only disturb pious minds, but also upset them and sink them in the depths of
despair, the Prophet exclaims, <i>How!</i> and then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How sits the city
solitary</i></font><font face="Palatino">, which had much people! Here, by a
comparison, he amplifies the indignity of the fact; for, on the one hand, he
refers to the flourishing state of Jerusalem before the calamity, and, on the
other hand, he shews how the place had in a manner been turned into darkness.
For this change, as I have said, was as though the sun had fallen from heaven;
for the sun has no firmer standing in heaven than Jerusalem had on earth, since
its preservation was connected with the eternal truth of God. He then says that
this city had many people, but that now it was sitting <i>solitary</i>. The verb
to sit, is taken in Hebrew in a good and in a bad sense. Kings are said to sit
on their thrones; but to sit means sometimes to lie prostrate, as we have before
seen in many places. Then he says that Jerusalem was lying solitary, because it
was desolate and forsaken, though it had before a vast number of
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How is she
become,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> etc.</i>; for the word <i>how</i>,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hka</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aike</i>, ought to be repeated, and applied to both clauses.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is she become as a widow,
who was great among the nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>!</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F1</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He
says that Jerusalem had not only been full of citizens, but had also extended
its power through many nations; for it is well known that many contiguous
nations were tributary to it under David and Solomon. And to the same purpose is
what follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>She who ruled among
provinces is become tributary</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>!</i> that is,
is become subject to a tribute. This phrase is taken from Deuteronomy 28, for
the prophets were wont freely to borrow expressions from Moses, that chief
teacher and prophet, as we shall presently see again.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see the meaning of the Prophet. He
wonders at the destruction of the city Jerusalem, and regarded it as a prodigy,
which not only disturbed the minds of men, but in a manner confounded them. And
by this mode of speaking he shews something of human infirmity; for they must be
void of all feeling who are not seized with amazement at such a mournful sight.
The Prophet then spoke not only according to his own feelings, but also
according to those of all others; and he deplored that calamity as it were in
the person of all. But he will hereafter apply a remedy to this astonishment For
when we thus exaggerate evils, we at the same time sharpen our grief; and thus
it happens that we at length become overwhelmed with despair; and despair
kindles rage, so that men clamor against God. But the Prophet so mourned, and
was in such a way amazed, that he did not yet indulge his grief nor cherish his
amazement; but as we shall see, he restrained himself, lest the excess of his
feelings should carry him beyond due bounds. It then follows,

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah still pursues the same subject, for he could
not have spoken briefly and in a few words of things so bitter and mournful; and
he seems to have felt deeply the ruin of his own country. And when we wish to
penetrate into the hearts of those whose sorrow we desire to alleviate, it is
necessary that they should understand that we sympathize with them. For when any
one stronger than another seeks to mitigate another&#8217;s grief, he will be
disregarded if what he adduces seems to proceed from an unfeeling barbarity.
Had, then, Jeremiah spoken as it were in contempt., he could have hardly hoped
for any fruit from his teaching, for the Jews would have thought him void of all
human feelings. This, then, is the reason why he bewails, as one of the people,
the calamity of the city. He did not, however, dissemble in any degree in the
history he related; but we know that God&#8217;s servants, while they speak in
earnest, do not yet forget prudence; for they regard in this respect what is
useful; and their doctrine ought in a manner to be so regulated as to produce
effect on the hearers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says that the weeping of Jerusalem was
continual; for he says first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Weeping she
wept</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the
night</i></font><font face="Palatino">; by which words he means that there was
no intermission. For the night is given us for rest, and God intends some
relaxation to men by the interchange of nights and days. When, therefore, the
Prophet says that Jerusalem,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>weeping, wept in the
night,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he intimates that her sorrow, as I have
stated, was continual. Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>her tears are on her
cheeks</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some render it jaws, but improperly;
the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yjl</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lachi</i>, indeed means a jaw, but it is to be taken for cheeks, or
cheek-bones. Then he means that tears were so profuse as to wet the whole face.
It is possible in weeping to restrain tears; but when they flow over the whole
face and cover the cheeks, it is an evidence of great mourning. This, then, is
the reason why the Prophet says that tears were on her cheeks; for he wished to
shew that tears were profusely shed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says further,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>She has no
comforter</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And this circumstance ought to be
noticed, for nothing is more seasonable in grief than to have friends near us to
shew us kindness, to be partakers of sorrow, and to apply the consolations which
may be had. But when no one feels for us in our evils, our sorrow is much more
increased. The Prophet then says that there was no one seeking to soothe the
griefs of Jerusalem. He adds, <i>of all thy friends</i>. Had Jerusalem been
always forsaken, she could have borne it better when no comforter was present.
For we see that miserable men are not thus soft and tender when very grievous
calamities happen to them; they do not look here and there for friends to come
to them, and why? because they have always been disregarded. It is, then,
nothing new to them, even in the greatest adversities, to have no one to shew
them any tokens of kindness. But when they who have had many friends, and
thought that they would be always ready to bring them aid &#8212; when they see
themselves forsaken, their sorrow becomes much more grievous. This, then, is
what the Prophet means in saying, that of many friends there were none to
comfort Jerusalem in her miseries.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is not yet a doubt but that he indirectly
reproved Jerusalem; and by
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ybha</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aebim</i>, he understood <i>lovers</i>, as we have seen in other places; for
as they thought themselves safe by means of ungodly treaties, the prophets say
that they were like harlots who everywhere prostitute themselves and make gain
by their lasciviousness, and allure lovers on every side. It was, therefore,
right of the Prophet to remind the Jews in this place of that wickedness, even
that they had conciliated at one time the Egyptians, at another, the Assyrians,
like an impudent woman, who is not satisfied with her own husband, but draws
lovers from all quarters. However this may be, he no doubt understands by
<i>friends</i> those who confederated with them; and who were these? even those
with whom the Jews had connected themselves, having disregarded God; for they
had been sufficiently warned by the prophets not to form connections with the
heathens. But, at. the same time, Jeremiah sets forth the atrocity of the thing
by saying that there was none of all her friends a comforter to Jerusalem,
because all her friends had acted perfidiously. It follows, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">Interpreters apply this, but in my view improperly,
to the captivity of the people; on the contrary, the Prophet means that the Jews
had been scattered and sought refuges when oppressed, as they were often, by the
tyranny of their enemies, and then by degrees he advances to their exile; for he
could not have said all things at the same time. Let, then, the order in which
he speaks be observed: before he bewails their exile, he says that Judah had
been scattered; for many, fleeing the cruelty of enemies, went into voluntary
exile. We have before seen that many concealed themselves with the Moabites; nor
is there a doubt but that many went into Egypt: in short, there was no country
in which some of the Jews were not fugitives.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The real meaning, then, of the Prophet here is, that
the Jews had migrated, that is, had left their own country and fled to other
countries, because they were subjected to miseries and cruel
servitude.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some take the words in a passive sense, even that
Judah migrated, because they had inhumanly oppressed their servants. But I
suspect what has led them astray, they thought that exile is meant here; and
then one mistake produces another; for it would have been absurd to say, that
the Jews had migrated into exile on account of affliction, and had migrated
willingly; for we know that they were violently driven by the Chaldeans. They
did not, then, willingly migrate. When these two things could not be connected,
they thought that the cruelty of the Jews is what is referred to, which they had
exercised towards their own brethren. But the migration of which the Prophet
speaks is improperly applied, as I have said, to the captivity; but on the
contrary, he means those who had removed into different parts of the world,
because this was more tolerable than their condition in their own country. And
we hence learn how severely they had been harassed by the Chaldeans, for they
had willingly fled away, though, as we know, exile is hard. We then conclude
that it was a barbarous and a violent oppression, since the Prophet says, that
the Jews thus went into exile of their own accord, and sought hiding-places
either in Egypt or in the land of Moab, or among other neighboring nations. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F2</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds another evil, that they never
found rest; and lastly, that they had been taken by their enemies between
straits, so that no escape was possible. It must have been a sad condition for
the people to live in a foreign land; for we know that such a precarious life
differs but little from death; and there were no contiguous nations by whom the
Jews were not hated. When they then fled to such people, it was no small evil.
But when they had nowhere a quiet abode, the indignity was still greater, and
this is what the Prophet now refers to. But when we flee and tremblingly turn
here and there, it is one of the greatest of evils to fall into the hands of
enemies, and to be taken by them when we are enclosed as it were between two
walls, or in a narrow passage, as some explain the word. It follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah refers here to another cause of sorrow, that
the worship of God had ceased, it having been interrupted; nay, it seemed to
have become extinct for ever. He then says that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ways of Sion
mourned</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because none came to the feasts. The
words are figurative, for we know that feelings belong not to ways; but the
Prophet ascribes feeling to what is inanimate. And this sort of personification
is more emphatical than if he had introduced the people as mourning. But when
the Jews saw that God&#8217;s worship had fallen, it was more grievous than to
find themselves bereaved of children or of wives, or plundered of all their
goods; for the more precious God&#8217;s worship was to them, and the more
religion was thought of, in which consisted the eternal salvation of their
souls, the more severe and mournful was it to see the Church, so scattered, that
God could no longer be worshipped and invoked.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is indeed true that God&#8217;s worship was not
tied to ceremonies; for Daniel never ceased to pray, and he was heard .no less
in his exile than if he came to the sacrifices with great solemnity to make an
offering in the Temple. This is no doubt true; but as God had not in vain
instituted these duties and rites of religion, the Prophet exhibits the thing
itself by its symbols. As, then, feasts were testimonies of God&#8217;s grace,
it was the same as though the Jews were called together by a standard being
lifted up, and as though God appeared in the midst of them. Hence the Prophet,
referring to these external symbols, shews that the worship of God had in a
manner ceased.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Her gates are
solitary</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or desolate;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>her priests are in mourning, her
virgins in afflictions; she is in bitterness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F3</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now this
passage reminds us, that when God afflicts his Church, however grievous it may
be to see innocent men slain, blood shed promiscuously, the sexes, men and
women, killed indiscriminately; and though it be a sad spectacle to see houses
robbed and plundered, fields laid waste, and al! things in a confusion, yet when
all these things are compared with the abolition of God&#8217;s worship, this
passage reminds us that all these things ought to appear light to us. Though
David greatly deplored his condition, because he was banished from the Temple,
and did not as usual lead thither the assembly, when he was not the only one
ejected from the sanctuary of God; yet when the sanctuary itself was destroyed,
together with the altar, when there were no sacrifices, no thanksgiving, no
praises; in short, no prayer, it was surely much more bitter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This lamentation of the Prophet ought then to be
carefully noticed, when he says, that

opposite of that is to be understood, even that they had become the tail, that
is, were under the feet as it were of their enemies. And he says that her

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because Jehovah had afflicted

as ungodly men are wont to do; but he mixes instruction with his mourning, and
shews that God, in a state of things so turbulent and confused, appeared as a
righteous judge. He then recalled them to the consideration of God&#8217;s hand,
when he said that her enemies had acted successfully, because God had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>afflicted

ege</i>, which means to speak or to meditate. But this is an evident mistake, as
we shall find another presently in this very chapter. There is no doubt but that
the Prophet intimates that the cause of all evils was, that God had afflicted
her, even on account of the greatness of her impieties, or of her sins. He now
then begins to shew that there is no reason why the Jews should be swallowed up
with grief and despair, if only they considered whence their evils proceeded. He
thus begins to call their attention to God&#8217;s judgment. This indeed of
itself would not have been sufficient; but he afterwards points out a fruitful
source of consolation. But we shall see these things mentioned in their due
order.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
SECOND</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We began yesterday to explain the passage where the
Prophet says, that the enemies of Jerusalem had become
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
head</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>been
successful</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It was a trial which must have
grievously assailed the minds of the faithful, when they saw their enemies
having fortune, as they commonly say, as it were in their own hand; for it
appeared as though God shewed himself favorable to them. Hence the Prophet
assigns the reason, lest the faithful should fall off from religion and the fear
of God, and says that the whole of this proceeded from the just vengeance of
God, it being his purpose to afflict his own Church; and he states not this
alone, but adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on account of
the greatness of her iniquities</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> For
ungodly men sometimes acknowledge that they have to do with God, but yet they
murmur and think that God is unjust and cruel. Hence the Prophet not only taught
the Jews that God was the author of the calamities which had happened, but at,
the same time reminded them that they were worthy of such a reward, not only
because they had transgressed, but because they had added sins to sins; for this
is what he means by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the greatness
of iniquities</i></font><font face="Palatino">. But he will presently repeat
this sentence and enlarge upon it: it is then enough now to state his object. It
was for this cause, then, as he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>her little ones went into
captivity before the adversary.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was, indeed, an indignity, calculated to embitter
the minds of the faithful, to see not only their young men but also infants so
cruelly treated. :For men always think that they have some just cause to contend
with God, and especially when the case of infants is brought forward; who, then,
is not disposed to say that God&#8217;s vengeance exceeds its due limits?
&#8220;If his purpose be,&#8221; say they, &#8220;to punish men for their
wickedness, why does he not restrain his wrath as to the innocent? for how have
miserable infants sinned?&#8221; But the Prophet here checks such audacity, and
says that God had just reasons for extending his vengeance even to the little
ones.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">F4</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It

<div><font face="Palatino">He continues the same subject. He says here that the
daughter of Sion was denuded of all her ornaments. Now, we know what was the
honor or dignity of that people; for Moses, in order to set forth the greatness

<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, the singular gifts of God had been
conferred on that people, it was a very sad spectacle to see that city, which
once possessed the highest glory, robbed of all its honor and covered with
disgrace, as we shall hereafter see. He then says that all her <i>glory</i> was
taken away from the daughter of Sion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, there is no need to enumerate all the kinds of
honor or glory which belonged to the city Jerusalem. But it may be said first,
that God had chosen there a habitation for himself; and then a sacerdotal
kingdom was there, &#8212; the people were holy to God &#8212; they were his
heritage, &#8212; there God had deposited his covenant, &#8212; he deemed all
the Jews his children, and his will was that they should in return count him as
their Father. As, then, they had been enriched with so many ornaments and so
superior, it is no wonder that the Prophet deplored the state of the city when
stripped of all its glory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>her princes were like famished

when pressed by want run as though they were flying. Since then the swiftness of
that animal is so great, the Prophet says that the princes, who were wont to
walk with so much gravity and to carry the appearance of great authority, had
become swift, like harts oppressed with hunger; for they also labored under the
want of everything. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He adds
that at length they <i>went away</i>, that is, they fled
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before their pursuers without

dared not to contend with their enemies, but that they were so frightened that
they fled, and thus proved that they were wholly disheartened and lifeless. It

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms the former verse when he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jerusalem remembered her
desirable things</i></font><font face="Palatino"> when she was afflicted by
God&#8217;s hand, and reduced to extreme want. And he in-intimates by these
words, that when Jerusalem was in its splendor, it did not sufficiently consider
the blessings of God; for the despisers of God cram themselves with whatever
flows from his bounty, and yet do not acknowledge him; for ingratitude is like
an abyss which absorbs all the fullness of God&#8217;s blessings. Then the
Prophet intimates that when Jerusalem flourished in wealth and in abundance of
all things, when it was adorned with singular gifts, she became as it were
inebriated, and never considered as she ought to have done, the benefits which
God had bestowed on her. And now, when she was reduced to want and surrounded
with extreme miseries, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>she
remembered her desirable things,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> even the glory
before mentioned; for by desirable things he means those gifts in which

<div><font face="Palatino">I wonder how all have given this version,
&#8220;Jerusalem remembered the days,&#8221; etc. Some rightly explain the

sufficiently evident, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jerusalem
remembered her desirable things in the days of her affliction and of her
want</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or of her groaning, or of her
transmigration; for some derive the word from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dwr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rud</i>, which means to complain, or to migrate. Hence they render it
&#8220;exile,&#8221; or migration. But others render it &#8220;complaint.&#8221;
Others, again, derive it from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">drm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mered</i>, which sometimes means to fail, and render it &#8220;want,&#8221;
or indigence. Why some have translated it &#8220;iniquities&#8221; I know not,
and there is no reason for such a version. I do not approve of
&#8220;complaint;&#8221; exile or want is the. best word. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F6</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The days of
affliction</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he more clearly expresses, when he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When the people fell into
the hand of the enemy, and there was no helper</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
We now see what the Prophet means, even that Jerusalem was as it were roused
from her lethargy when God afflicted her. For as the drunken, after being
satiated, so sleep in their excess that they know and feel nothing, but seem
half dead; so prosperity inebriated Jerusalem for a long time; but being at
length awakened, she perceived whence she had fallen. As long, then, as she
stood in her high place of honor, she did not consider God&#8217;s indulgence
towards her; but after she was stripped of all her blessings, and became deeply
afflicted, she then remembered her <i>desirable things</i>, that is, she at
length began to perceive what she had lost, because she had fallen from the
grace of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may hence gather a useful doctrine; for what the
Prophet relates of Jerusalem is seen almost in all mankind; but we must beware
lest this should be true of us. For God has not only in a common manner dealt
liberally hitherto with us, but he has also been pleased to favor us with
evidences of favor even more than paternal; he has separated us from the
unbelieving, and has bestowed on us many of his blessings. Let us now, then,
take heed lest we become stupid while God deals liberally with us; but, on the
contrary, let us learn to appreciate the blessings of God, and consider the end
for which they have been given us, otherwise what is said here of Jerusalem will
happen to us; for being too late awakened, we shall know that we were happy when
God shewed himself a father to us. We see the same thing exemplified in Adam the
first man; for though God adorned him with excellent gifts, yet being not
content with his lot, he wished to exalt himself beyond due limits; after he
fell and was reduced to extreme want, he then began to know what he had
previously been, and what he had become through his fall.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010126&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
1:26, 27; 3:6,7.) But as this testimony of the Prophet is peculiarly suitable to
the Church, let us know that we are warned by the example of Jerusalem, so that
when God shews to us his bounty, his gifts ought as they deserve, to be valued,
lest when too late we shall at length begin to acknowledge how desirable had
been our previous condition. Then, in a word, Jeremiah here reproves the
stupidity of the people, who did not know how desirable was their state, until
they were deprived and plundered of all their blessings. He also says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the days of
old</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By these words he probably intimates that
the course of God&#8217;s kindness had been perpetual; for God had not for a
short time been bountiful to that people, but had shewed them favors
successively and continually.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When her people
fell,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> etc</i>. It was a heavier misery,
because they had so long flourished. It is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Seen, her have enemies, they
laughed at her Sabbath</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or at her cessation,
which I do not dislike. But they who render it &#8220;leisure,&#8221; or
idleness, either pervert or too much obscure the meaning of the Prophet. In the
word &#8220;cessation,&#8221; there is an irony, for the enemies did not simply
laugh at cessation, but did so in mockery, as they took this opportunity to
taunt them for their religion. We know that the Sabbaths of the Jews were always
hated by the heathens; and they were thereby subjected to many reproaches; for
by way of reproach they called the Jews Sabbatharians. And when they wished
ignominiously to traduce the whole service of God, as under the law, they named
it &#8220;Sabbaths.&#8221; There is, then, no doubt but that the heathens
reproachfully taunted the Jews because they observed the Sabbath; &#8220;See,
now is the time to worship God.&#8221; And we also see that God upbraided the
Jews in a similar way by saying,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Until the land
shall enjoy its Sabbaths.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;032643&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Leviticus
26:43.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For when the Jews had the opportunity and leisure
(when no enemies molested them)to observe the worship of God, they
contemptuously profaned the Sabbaths. As, then, God&#8217;s worship had been so
disgracefully neglected by them, God said, &#8220;The land itself shall in your
stead keep the Sabbath;&#8221; how? it shall not be ploughed, it shall not bring
forth fruit.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;032634&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
26:34, 35.) That cessation was called by God Sabbath, but not without a taunt;
for he cuttingly reproved the Jews for having violated the Sabbaths, as was also
done by Jeremiah,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;241722&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
17:22, 27.)  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">F7</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then appears to me probable that taunts were cast
by enemies against the Jews, that they might now have a long and a continual
Sabbath, while the city was deserted and no one dwelt there. For it would have
been cold and unmeaning to say that the enemies laughed at the cessation of it.
The Prophet would have no doubt used a different word, if his purpose had been
to point out the blasphemy of enemies as to God&#8217;s worship.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
enemies</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet expresses more clearly and strongly
what he had briefly referred to, even that all the evil which the Jews suffered
proceeded from God&#8217;s vengeance, and that they were worthy of such a
punishment, because they had not lightly offended, but had heaped up for
themselves a dreadful judgment, since they had in all manner of ways abandoned
themselves to impiety. This is the substance of what is said. We hence learn
that the Prophet did not compose this song to lament the calamity of his own
country as heathens were wont to do. An example of a heathen lamentation we have
in Virgil: &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>&#8220;Come is the
great day and the unavoidable

&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>&#8220;O country! O
Ilium, the house of the gods! and the famous for
war,</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>The camp of the

</i></b></font><sup><font color="Maroon"><b><i>F9</i></b></font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He thus mourns the destruction of Troy; but he
complains of the cruelty of God, and calls Him cruel Jupiter, because he was
himself enraged, and yet the speaker was Pantheus the priest of Apollo. We hence
see how the unbelieving, when they lament their own calamities, vomit forth
blasphemies against. God, for they are exasperated by sorrow. Very different is
the complaint of the Prophet from that of the ungodly; for when he deplores the
miseries of his people, he at the same time adds that God is a righteous
avenger. He does not then accuse God of cruelty or of too much rigor, but
reminds the people to humble themselves before God and to confess that they
justly deserved all their evils.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The unbelieving do indeed sometimes mingle some
words, by which they seem to give glory to God; but they are evanescent, for
they soon return to their perverseness. They are sometimes moderate, &#8220;If
thou art turned by any entreaties.&#8221; In that case they expostulate with
God:, as though he were deaf to the prayers of his servants. At length they
break out into open blasphemies, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>&#8220;After it
seemed good to the gods to subvert the affairs of

&#8212;</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They regarded the nation which had been cut off
unworthy of such a punishment; they called it an undeserved nation. Now, then,
we perceive what is the difference between the unbelieving and the children of
God. For it is common to all to mourn in adversities; but the end of the
mourning of the unbelieving is perverseness, which at length breaks out into
rage, when they feel their evils, and they do not in the meantime humble
themselves before God. But the faithful do not harden themselves in their
mourning, but reflect on themselves and examine their own life, and of their own
accord prostrate themselves before God, and willingly submit to the sentence of
condemnation, and confess that God is just.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence now see how the calamity of the Church ought
to be lamented by us, even that we are to return to this principle, that God is
a just avenger, and does not punish common offenses only, but the greatest sins,
and that when he reduces us to extremities, lie does so on account of the
greatness of our sins, as also Daniel confessed. For it was not in few words
that he declared that the people were worthy of exile and of the punishment
which they suffered; but he accumulated words,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">We have sinned, we have
acted impiously, we have done wickedly, we have been transgressors.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;270905&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Daniel
9:5.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor was the Prophet satisfied without this
enumeration, for he saw how great the impiety of the people had been, and how
mad had been their obstinacy, not for a few years, but for that long time,
during which they had been warned by the prophets, and yet they repented not,
but always became worse and worse. Such, then, is the mode of speaking adopted
here.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>she was made a
commotion</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, that she was removed from
her country. There seems to be implied a contrast between the rest which had
been promised to the Jews, and a wandering and vagrant exile; for, as we have
seen, the Jews had not only been banished, but they had nowhere a quiet
dwelling; it was even a commotion. This may at the same time be referred to the
curse of the law, because they were to be for a commotion &#8212; for even the
unbelieving shook their heads at them. But the word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hdyn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nide</i>, ought properly to be applied to their exile, when the Jews became
unfixed and vagrant. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F11</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is
added, that she was <i>despised</i> and treated reproachfully by <i>all who</i>
before esteemed and <i>honored</i> her. This also did not a little increase the
grievousness of her calamity; she had been repudiated by her friends, by whom
she had before been valued and honored. The reason is mentioned,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because they saw her
nakedness</i></font><font face="Palatino">. But the word properly means
turpitude or ignominy. It is at length added, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>she even groaned and turned
backward</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, that she was so oppressed
with grief, that there was no hope of a remedy; for to turn backward means the
same as to be deprived of all hope of restoration.

<div><font face="Palatino">He continues here, as I think, the same subject; he
had said at the end of the last verse that turpitude or baseness had been seen
at Jerusalem; and now he says that it was on the very <i>fringes</i> or skirts.
The Prophet seems to allude to menstruous women who hide their uncleanness as
much as they can; but. such a thing is of no avail, as nature must have its
course. In short, the Prophet intimates that the Jews had become filthy in no
common degree, being so afflicted that their uncleanness appeared on their
skirts. This seems to be the Prophet&#8217;s meaning. Interpreters think that
Jeremiah speaks of the sins of the people, but they are mistaken; for I doubt
not but that the reference is to their punishment. They say that filthiness was
on the skirts, because the people had shamelessly prostituted themselves to all
kinds of wickedness, and that they remembered not their end, because they had
become altogether foolish, according to what is said in the song of
Moses,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;O that they were
wise, and would foresee their end? (Deuteronomy 32 29.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But let any one duly consider the design of the
Prophet, and he will readily agree with me that he speaks not of guilt, but on
the contrary of punishment. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F13</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet then says that the reproach of the Jews
was on their skirts, because they could not hide their disgrace, For shame often
makes men to hide their evils and silently to bear them, because they are
unwilling to expose themselves to the mockery of their enemies. But the Prophet
says that the miseries of the people could not be kept hidden, but that they
appeared to all, as the case is with women subject to an overflow &#8212; it
issues forth to the extremities of their garments.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And when he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>she remembered not her
end</i></font><font face="Palatino">, I understand this to mean, that the Jews
were so overwhelmed with despair, that they did not raise up their thoughts to
God&#8217;s promises; for it is no ordinary source of comfort, and what even
common sense dictates to us, to take breath in extreme evils, and to extend our
thoughts farther, for misery will not always oppress us &#8212; some change for
the better will happen. As then men are wont thus to sustain themselves in
adversities, he says that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Jews remembered not their end</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, they
were so demented by their sorrow, that they became stupified, and entertained no
hope as to the future. In short, by these words, he denotes extreme despair; for
the Jews were so stupified that they could not raise up their minds to any
hope.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the reason is expressed, because they had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>come down
wonderfully</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, because they had been
cast down in an extraordinary manner. A noun is here put instead of an adverb,
and in the masculine gender,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yalpX</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
pelaim</i>; sometimes we have
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twalp</font><font face="Palatino">,
p<i>elaut</i>, but in the same sense. He then says that the Jews had sunk as it
were miraculously; but by a miracle he means a prodigy, the word being taken in
a bad sense; then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>miraculously
has Jerusalem come down</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It hence followed that
it succumbed under its miseries, so that it could not turn its thoughts to any
hope, nor think of another end; but. became stupid in its miseries, as men
usually become desperate, when they think that there is no deliverance for them.
He repeats what he had said before, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there was no
comforter</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These things ought to be carefully observed, for
Satan at this day uses various means to lead us to despair. In order to avert us
from all confidence in the grace of God, he sets before us extreme calamities.
And when sorrow lays such hold on our minds, that the hope of grace does not
shine forth, from that immoderate sorrow arises impatience, which may drive us
to madness. Hence it comes that we murmur, and then clamor against God. As,
then, at this day Satan supplies materials to harass our minds, that we may
succumb under our griefs, let us bear in mind what the Prophet says, that
Jerusalem, which was then the only true Church of God in the world, was
overwhelmed with so many and so great evils, that she
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>remembered not her
end</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This, indeed, ought to be understood of
external circumstances, for God no doubt sustained the minds of the godly, and
always so mitigated their grief that they had regard to their end. But the
reference is to the people in general, and also to the outward appearance of
things, when the Prophet says that the Jews remembered not their
end.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now encourages them to pray, and suggests words to
them, for he speaks as in the person of
all</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>: See, Jehovah, my affliction,
for the enemy hath highly exalted himself</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
Though the Prophet here represents the Church, yet he exhorts them no doubt,
according to the obligations of his office, to entertain good hope, and
encourages them to pray, for true and earnest prayer cannot be offered without
faith; for when the taste of God&#8217;s grace is lost, it cannot be that we can
pray from the heart; and through the promises alone it is that we can have a
taste of God&#8217;s paternal goodness. There is, then, no doubt but that the
Prophet here promises a sure deliverance to the Jews, provided they turned to
God, and believed and were fully persuaded that he would be their
deliverer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, see what is the right way of teaching,
even that men are to be humbled, and that their just condemnation is to be set
before them, and that they are also to be encouraged to entertain hope, and a
hand is to be stretched out to them, that they may pray to God, and not hesitate
in extreme evils not only to hope for but even to request aid from him. This is
the order observed by the Prophet; we must learn in adversities ever to come
down to ourselves, and to acknowledge our guilt; and then when we are sunk deep,
we must learn to elevate our minds by faith that thence prayer may arise by
which our salvation is to be attained.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">One thing has escaped me; the Prophet, in order to
obtain favor, says, that enemies had greatly exalted themselves. And this
deserves a special notice; for what seems to occasion despair to us, ought, on
the contrary, to encourage us to entertain good hope, that is, when enemies are
insolent and carry themselves with great arrogance and insult us. The greater,
then, is their pride and the less tolerable, with more confidence may we call on
God, for the Holy Spirit has not in vain taught us this truth, that God will be
propitious to us when enemies thus greatly exalt themselves, that is, when they
become beyond measure proud, and immoderately indulge themselves in every kind
of contempt. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet again deplores the profanation of all
sacred things; and this complaint, as I have said, proceeded from the bitterest
sorrow; for though it was a sad thing for the faithful, to lose all their
property, to wander in exile and to suffer the want of all things, yet it must
have been more grievous to them to see the Temple polluted, and all religion
exposed to shame. This calamity, then, the Prophet again deplores, when he says
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>enemies had stretched forth
their hand against all desirable things</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Now,
by desirable things, he does not mean riches, nor anything that belongs to the
condition of an earthly and fading life, but those invaluable treasures which
God had deposited with the chosen people. The enemy, then, had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>extended his
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"> against the altar, against the table,
against the ark of the covenant, against all the sacred
vessels.</font><br></div>

Jerusalem </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saw the heathens

in the feminine gender. But the sanctuary of Jerusalem was God&#8217;s Temple
for, though properly speaking, it was alone God&#8217;s sanctuary, it was yet at
the same time the sanctuary of the people, because God had not caused the Temple
to be built for his own benefit, but rather for the benefit of his people. What
God, then, had consecrated for himself is rightly called the sanctuary of the
people. He still increases the indignity, because God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had forbidden the heathens to
enter the sanctuary</i></font><font face="Palatino">; but they had violently
rushed in there. They did not, however, enter for the sake of worshipping God,

force entered for the purpose of violating the Temple, and also of abolishing
the whole worship of God, and of exposing religion to all kinds of mockery.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here complains that all the citizens of
Jerusalem were constantly groaning through want and famine. He first says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all were
sighing</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The word &#8220;people&#8221; is
collective, and hence he uses the plural
number,</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">
X&#181;yjnan</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>nanechim</i>. Then he says that
they were all sighing; but he expresses also the reason, because they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seeking
bread</i></font><font face="Palatino">. To seek bread is indeed common to all;
but by this word he intimates extreme want., as though he had said, that they
begged their bread. He then compares them to beggars, who go about here and
there to seek bread.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says also, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gave the most precious things for
meat</i></font><font face="Palatino">, to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>recover the soul.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Here he refers more clearly to famine, for he
says that in a manner they suffered want. Others render the last clause,
&#8220;to refresh the soul,&#8221; which is not unsuitable. But the Prophet no
doubt meant to denote a deficiency as to the support of life, when he said, that
they gave whatever precious thing they had to restore their souls, as it were
from death to life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A prayer follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>See, Jehovah, and look, for I am

complaints which humbled the faithful, and, at the same time, raised them to a
good hope, and also opened the door to prayers, were dictated by the Spirit of
God. Otherwise, when men indulge in grief, and torment themselves, they become
exasperated; and then to be kindled by this irritation is a kind of madness. The
Prophet, therefore, in order to moderate the intensity of sorrow, and the raging
of impatience, recalls again the faithful to prayer. And when Jerusalem asks God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to see and to
look</i></font><font face="Palatino">, there is an emphasis intended in using
the two words; and the reason given does also more fully shew this, because she

the Church set nothing else before God, to turn him to mercy, but her own

<div><font face="Palatino">But she addressed those who
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>passed
by</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that she might more fully set forth the
greatness of her calamity. For. had she directed her words to neighbors alone,
there would not have been so much force in them; but when she spoke to
strangers, she thus shewed that her calamity was so great, that it ought to have
roused the sympathy of men from the remotest parts, even while on their journey.
And she asks them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>look</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>see</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
The order is inverted, for she said before, &#8220;See, Jehovah, and
look.&#8221; Then Jerusalem asked God, first to turn his eyes to see her
calamities, and then attentively to notice them: but now for another purpose she
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>look ye and
see</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, consider how evident is my
calamity, which otherwise might have been in a measure hidden from you.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Look
ye</i></font><font face="Palatino">, she says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is there a sorrow like my
sorrow</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> she adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which is come to
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> some render the words actively,
&#8220;which Jehovah has brought on me;&#8221; but the other version is more
correct, for it is more literal. Jerome&#8217;s rendering is, &#8220;who has
gleaned me;&#8221; and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ll[X</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>olal</i>, means sometimes to glean, nor do I wish to reject this
interpretation. But what follows is incorrectly rendered, as in a former
instance, by Jerome, &#8220;of which Jehovah has spoken:&#8221; for he derived
the verb, as before stated, from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hgh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ege</i>; but it comes from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hgy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ige</i>, as it is evident from the letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>vau</i>, being inserted. There is then no doubt but that the Church intimates
that God was the author of that sorrow which she deplored.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And it is necessary to know this, lest men should be
carried away into excesses in their mourning, as it frequently happens. For the
majesty of God imposes a check, when we perceive that we have to do with him.
Simple and bare knowledge of this is not, indeed, sufficient, for, as it has
been said, the ungodly, while they know that their sorrows proceed from God, yet
murmur against him: but it is nevertheless the beginning of patience and
meekness when we have a regard to God. It was, then, for this reason that
Jerusalem said that she had been afflicted by God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And it is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the day of the indignation of
his wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here the Prophet wished to express
the grievousness of God&#8217;s vengeance, by mentioning
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the indignation of
wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;wrj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cherun</i>, &#8220;fury;&#8221; but as the word &#8220;fury&#8221; is too
harsh, the word &#8220;indignation,&#8221; or great heat (<i>excandescentia</i>)
is not unsuitable. We must, however, bear in mind the design of the Prophet,
which was to shew that God&#8217;s vengeance had been so dreadful, as though his
wrath had all been on a flame against Jerusalem: and this is more fully
confirmed in the following verse, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet proceeds with the same subject, that
God&#8217;s vengeance had raged most dreadfully agsinst Jerusalem. But employing
a metaphor she says, that.<i>fire</i> had been sent to her <i>bones</i>. They
who interpret bones of fortified places, weaken the meaning of the Prophet. I
take bones in their proper sense, ss though it was said, that God&#8217;s fire
had penetrated into the inmost parts. This way of speaking often occurs in
Scripture. By bones is denoted strength or valor. Hence David sometimes
deplored, that his bones were vexed or troubled.

37:13.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the same sense the Prophet now says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fire</i></font><font face="Palatino">
had been </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sent by God, which ruled
in his bones</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, which not only burnt the
skin and the flesh, but also consumed the bones.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hdr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rede</i>, means also to take away or to receive: but as the former rendering
is most commonly taken, I am disposed to follow it &#8212; that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fire ruled in his
bones</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is another similitude added, that God had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spread a net before her
feet;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and thus he had taken away every means of
escape. She intimates (for it is Jerusalem who speaks) that she had been
ensnared by God&#8217;s judgments, so that she was bound over to ruin, as though
she had fallen into toils or snares. It is stated in the third place, that she
was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>desolate all the day, so that
she sorrowed perpetually</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By all the day is
meant continually. It is then said, that she sorrowed without end, beyond
measure, because she had been turned back by the nets of God, and her bones had
been consumed by celestial fire: for the expression <i>from above</i>,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;wrmm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>memerumn</i>, is emphatical, for the Prophet means that it was no common or
human burning; because what is ascribed to God exceeds what is human or earthly.
It is, then, as though he had said, that it had been such a vengeance as
betokened the dreadful power of God; for it was the same as though God had
thundered from heaven. We now perceive the import of the words. It follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">Here, again, Jerusalem confesses that God had been
justly displeased. She had ascribed to God&#8217;s vengeance the evils which she
suffered; but now she expresses the cause of that displeasure or wrath. Hence
she says, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yoke</i></font><font face="Palatino">
of her
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>iniquities</i></font><font face="Palatino">
had been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bound</i></font><font face="Palatino">
in God&#8217;s hand. Though interpreters explain the words, yet they touch not
the meaning of the Prophet; for they consider not that there is a continued
metaphor. We ought then to bear in mind the two clauses, &#8212; that
God&#8217;s hand held the yoke tied, and also that the yoke was bound around the
neck of Jerusalem. As when a husbandman, after having tied a yoke to oxen, holds
a rein, and folds it rotund his hand, so that the oxen not only cannot throw off
the yoke, but must also obey the hand which holds the reins; so also it is said,
that the yoke of iniquities was fastened: &#8220;I bear the yoke,&#8221; she
says, &#8220;but it is tied, and so fastened, that it cannot be shaken off; and
then, however furious I may be, or kick, God holds the tied yoke by his own hand
so as to constrain me to bear it.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, see the design and import of the
Prophet&#8217;s words, that God was justly incensed against Jerusalem, and had
justly used so much severity. Expressed at the same time is the atrocity of the
punishment, though wholly just; for, on the one hand, Jerusalem complains that a
yoke was laid on her neck, tied and fastened, and also that it was tied by the
hand of God, as though she had said, that she was under such a constraint, that
there was no relaxation. On the one hand, then, she bewails the grievousness of
her calamity; and on the other, she confesses that she fully deserved what she
suffered; and thus she accused herself, lest any should think that he clamored
against God, as is commonly the case in sorrow. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F17</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He hath made to

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l&ccedil;k</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cashel</i>, in <i>Hilphil</i>, means, as it is well known, to stumble, or to
cause to stumble or fall. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He
hath</i></font><font face="Palatino">, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>weakened my strength; the Lord
hath given me up into the hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"> of my enemies,
from whom <i>I shall not be able to rise</i>; that is, he hath so subjugated me,
and so laid me prostrate under the hands of my enemies, that there is no hope of
rising again. Were any one to ask, &#8220;Why then does she pray, and again will
pray often?&#8221; the answer is, that when she says here, that she will not be
able to rise again, the reference is made to the outward state of things: in the
meantime, the grace of God is not taken to the account. and this goes beyond all
human means. She then says, that according, to the thoughts of the flesh, she
had no hope, because there appeared to be no means of rising. But yet she did
not despair, but that God would at length, by His almighty power, cause her to
rise from fatal ruin. And this is a mode of speaking that ought to be borne in
mind; for hope sees things which are hidden. But at the same time the faithful
speak according to the common appearance of things, and when they seem to
despair, they regard what falls under their own observation and judgment. So
then Jerusalem now says that she could not rise, except God manifested his
extraordinary power, which far exceeds all human means. It follows,

destitute of every protection, and that her valiant men were trodden under foot.

alone;&#8221; that is, because he had avenged the wrongs done to his people. For
we know that the Idumeans had always been incensed against the miserable Jews.
Then God, in order to shew that lie was the defender of his Church, says that he
came from Edom, and was sprinkled and even made wet with blood. As when any one
is red with wine after having toiled in the winepress, so also is the

<div><font face="Palatino">He describes at large the calamities of Jerusalem.
But it is no wonder that the Prophet, thus lengthened his discourse; for we know
that those who are heavily oppressed never satisfy themselves with mourning and
lamentations. If, indeed, we duly consider how great the evils were, the Prophet
will not appear to us wordy, nor will his prolixity be wearisome to us. For when
any one compares the flourishing state of Jerusalem with that desolate ruin
which the Prophet laments, it will surely appear to him that no words, however
many, can fully express what it really was; nay, though the expressions may seem
hyperbolical, yet they do not exceed the greatness of that calamity. This point
is briefly adverted to, lest any one should be wearied with those various modes
of expression which the Prophet employs, when yet he might have at once said
that Jerusalem was destroyed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,

eye! it shall descend into waters</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Others read,
&#8220;Waters will descend from mine eyes;&#8221; but such a rendering is too
loose. I do not, then, doubt but that Jerusalem says that her eyes would be like
fountains of waters. She indeed speaks in the singular number, and repeats the
words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mine eye! mine eye! it

do the duty of humanity by alleviating sorrow; so now again Jerusalem repeats

clauses ought to be read together, that is, that Sion expanded her hands, and
yet no one responded to alleviate her sorrow by consolation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah had commanded respecting
Jacob, that through his circuits adversaries should afflict
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet again reminds us that these
evils did not happen through men, but that God had resolved in this manner to
punish the obstinate impiety of the people. Lest, then, the Jews should give
vent to their sorrow, and ascribe it to the Chaldeans, as it was commonly done,
he recalls their attention to God himself, and says that the Chaldeans, however
cruel they were, yet did nothing merely through their own impulse, but through
God&#8217;s command. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>through the
circuits</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that the Jews might know that there
was no escape, for God held them all as though they were shut up. For we can in
various ways escape from the hands of men; but when God is our enemy, we in vain
seek hiding-places. The Prophet then teaches us that subterfuges did not avail
the Jews, because God on every side kept them shut up.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says at length that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jerusalem was like a menstruous

<i>nede</i>, may be rendered uncleanness, or abomination, and is often a noun
substantive; and I am disposed so to render it, even that Jerusalem was regarded
as filth, as though the Prophet had said that there was no humanity or
moderation in the enemies of the Jews, because they were not counted as men, but
as offscourings, as an abominable filth.

<div><font face="Palatino">Now, if such a thing happened to the ancient Church,
let us not wonder if at this day also God should deal with us more severely than
we wish. It is, indeed, a very bitter thing to see the Church so afflicted as to
have the ungodly exulting over its calamities, and that God&#8217;s children
should be as the refuse and filth of the world. But let us patiently bear such a
condition; and when we are thus contemptuously treated by our enemies, let us
know that God visits us with punishment, and that the wicked do nothing except
through the providence of God, for it is his will to try our faith, and thus to
shew himself a righteous judge: for if we rightly consider in how many ways, and
how obstinately we have provoked his wrath, we shall not wonder if we also be
counted at this day an abomination and a curse. It follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">Jerusalem again acknowledges, and more clearly
expresses, that she suffered a just punishment. She had before confessed that
her enemies were cruel through God&#8217;s command; but it was necessary to
point out again the cause of that cruelty, even that she had too long provoked
the wrath of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">She says, first, that God was <i>just</i>, or
righteous, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F22</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino">
of God we are to understand the prophetic doctrine, as it is well known. But the
phrase is emphatical, for when the word of God was proclaimed by the mouth of
prophets, it was despised as an empty sound. As, then, prophetic doctrine has
not its own majesty ascribed to it, God calls whatever his servants declare his
mouth. This mode of speaking is taken from Moses, and often occurs in his
writings.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
then, <i>is just</i>; how so?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because I have provoked his
mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And it was more grievous and less
excusable to provoke the mouth of God than simply to offend God. The ungodly
often offend God when they labor under ignorance; but when the Lord is pleased
to open his mouth to recall the erring, and to shew the way of salvation, and
then men rush headlong, as it were designedly, into sins, it is certainly a mark
of extreme impiety. We hence understand why the Prophet mentions the mouth of
God, or the teaching of the prophets, even to exaggerate the wickedness of
Jerusalem, which had so obstinately disregarded God speaking by his
prophets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The greatness of her sorrow is again deplored; and
what follows is addressed to all nations,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear, I pray, all ye people; see
my sorrow</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And what was the reason for this
great sorrow?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
she says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>my virgins and my young
men have been driven into captivity</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This might
seem a light thing; for a previous account has been given of other calamities,
which were far more severe; and exile in itself is but a moderate punishment.
But we must bear in mind what we have before stated, that the Jews dwelt in that
land, as though they had been placed there by the hand of God, that Jerusalem
was to be a perpetual rest, which had been granted them from above; in short,
that it was as it were a pledge of the eternal inheritance. When, therefore,
they were driven into captivity, it was the same as though God had cast them
down from heaven, and banished them from his kingdom. For the Jews would not
have been deprived of that land, had not God rejected them and shewed his
alienation from them. It was then the same as repudiation. It is therefore no
wonder that Jerusalem so much lamented because her sons and her daughters were
driven into exile.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the people of God complain in the person of a
woman, as we have before seen, that in their calamity they were left destitute
of every comfort. And it is a circumstance which increases grief, when no one is
present to shew any kindness to the miserable; for it is no small alleviation of
sorrow, when friends offer their kind services, and as far as they can, endeavor
to mitigate the severity of the evil.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Church of God now says, that she was so forsaken
by friends as to be left alone to pine away in her mourning and sorrow. There
may, however, be here an allusion to shameful and impure connections; for by
this term, <i>friends</i>, the Spirit often points out the Egyptians as well as
others in whom the Israelites had foolishly trusted; for in this manner, we
know, they had turned aside from conjugal fidelity. God had bound them to
himself, that they might acquiesce in his favor alone; and so to acquiesce was
their spiritual chastity. Rightly, then, does Scripture compare both the
Egyptians and the Assyrians to harlots, whenever the Israelites sought aid from
them. But as this explanation seems too refined, I am content to view what is
said simply as a complaint., that the people of God, though looking in all
directions, yet could find no comfort in the world.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
cried</i></font><font face="Palatino">, she said,

<div><font face="Palatino">It is then added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My priests and mine elders
expired in the city</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Had they been slain in
battle, it would have been no wonder; for they who go against an enemy, go as it
were to meet death. But God&#8217;s people here deplore a more grievous evil,
that the priests died in the city, not through the enemies&#8217; sword, but
through famine, which is as it were the extreme of evils. It is then said, that
the priests as well as the elders perished through famine, because they could
not find food. And when it is said that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sought food to refresh the
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino">, there is a contrast to be understood
between ordinary food and a remedy for the famine; for we naturally seek food
whenever we feel hungry; but the Prophet refers here to something more than
this, even that the priests and the elders sought food, because long abstinence
urged them; and it was very sad, that the priests, who excelled in honor, and
also the elders, were thus reduced to want. Had such a thing happened to the
common people, it would not have been so wonderful; for the long siege of the
city had consumed all their provisions. But when the priests, and those who had
wealth, were thus oppressed with hunger, we may conclude that the want which the
Prophet wished to describe was extreme. It follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The people turn again to pray God: and what has been
before said ought to be remembered, that these lamentations of Jeremiah differ
from the complaints of the ungodly; because the faithful first acknowledge that
they are justly chastised by God&#8217;s hand, and secondly, they trust in his
mercy and implore his aid. For by these two marks the Church is distinguished
from the unbelieving, even by repentance and faith. To sigh and to mourn in
adversities, and to lament also their miseries, are common to both; but the
children of God differ greatly from the ungodly, because they humble themselves
under his mighty hand, and confess that they deserve to suffer punishment; and
further, they cast not away the hope of salvation, but implore his mercy. Then
the Prophet introduces again the people as praying God to look on them. For the
ungodly pour forth their complaints into the air; and when at any time nature
dictates to them that they ought to address God, yet no prayer arises from a
sincere heart.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is no doubt but that the Prophet here shewed to
the faithful how they were to lament their common miseries, even so as patiently
to bear the chastisements of God, and also to seek deliverance from him, though
they had provoked his wrath. For when we see that we are pressed down by
God&#8217;s hand, we do not murmur, but the knowledge of our sins humbles us,
and faith moderates our mourning, which would otherwise exceed moderation. And
when we thus humbly flee to God, we in a manner unburden our sorrows into his
bosom, as it is said in the Psalms, &#8220;Cast (or roll) on God thy
cares.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;195522&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

affliction, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because his bowels
were bound</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or troubled. The word is from ,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rmj

from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwmj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chemur</i>, an ass, and so render it &#8220;bound,&#8221; as when a. burden
is fastened on an ass. But more probable is the opinion of those who derive the
word from mortar or cement, for as cement is made by mixing water with lime and
sand, and stirring them together, so by a metaphor the bowels are said to be
stirred or troubled; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F23</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and this
explanation agrees better with what follows &#8212; for it is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>my heart is
overturned</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The reason is given, because the
people by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rebelling had
rebelled</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, had been very rebellious
against God. We have said that the complaints of the godly differ from those of
the ungodly, for they not only pray to God, but make also a sincere confession,
so as to make it evident that they are justly chastised by God&#8217;s hand. At
the beginning of the verse the faithful prayed, and now again they declare that
they deserved what they suffered, because they had been very rebellious. Then
Jeremiah proceeds with what he had begun to say respecting the grievousness of
their punishment,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Abroad</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
or without, he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the sword
bereaves, and at home it is like death</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that
is, &#8220;When we go abroad, the sword meets us; and when we hide ourselves at
home, there also many deaths surround us.&#8221; He uses the particle of
likeness, <i>as</i>, or like; as though he had said that nothing met them at

amplifies the grievousness of their punishment, there being no one, as before
said, to administer any consolation. But it is repeated, that

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah seems to intimate, that their enemies, being
fully persuaded that God was displeased with his people, did on this account
more freely rejoice; and at the same time they believed that it was all over
with those miserable people with whom God was displeased. But I know not whether
this view is well grounded. I indeed do not reject it, :nor will I dispute with
any one who may hold that the enemies rejoiced, because they thought that God
was become the enemy of that people, whom he had before chosen and also
protected: nor is this view unsuitable; for the reprobate then fully triumph
when they can boast that God is adverse to us. But when no such thought comes to
their minds, they yet cease not to rejoice when they see that we are oppressed
and afflicted. Though, then, they may not think of God&#8217;s hand, yet they
rejoice that it is <i>done</i>; that is, they rejoice that we are distressed,
though they understand not who the author is. We may then take the meaning
simply to be, that the enemies of the Church rejoiced at that calamity, without
considering who the author of it was.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But, why is it expressed that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God had done
it</i></font><font face="Palatino">? even to shew that while the ungodly think
that fortune is unfavorable to us, it; is our duty to cast our eyes on God, for
we ought not to judge of things according to their blindness. As, then, they
ascribe not to God the glory due to him when they do not acknowledge him as
judge, it ever behooves us to see by the eyes of faith what is hid from the
natural perceptions of men, even that nothing happens to us except through the
righteous judgment of God. Though, then, enemies had not wisdom to know how it
was that the Church was afflicted, yet it behooved the Church itself to use by
means of faith such a language as this, that God had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>done</i></font><font face="Palatino">
it; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they rejoiced that thou hast

short, the faithful now confess not only that they were afflicted by God&#8217;s
hand, but also that what the prophets had so often threatened, and what had been
despised, was now fulfilled. For we have seen with what pertinacity that people
rejected the threatenings given by the prophets: God had often exhorted them to
repent, and also had proclaimed or fixed a time for them, but without effect.
Therefore the faithful now reflect on what had not been sufficiently known
before, even that the day was brought which had been often proclaimed. And thus
they confessed, not only that they were worthy of punishment., but that it was
the proper time for them to be chastised, as they had not repented after having
been so often warned.</font><br></div>

also take the meaning to be simply this, &#8212; that the faithful began to take

their comfort the judgment which God would at length execute on the ungodly; and
there is no doubt but that this kind of imprecation had been suggested to
God&#8217;s children by the Holy Spirit, in order to sustain them when pressed
down by heavy troubles; not that God gave them thus loose reins to desire
vengeance on their enemies, but that while those perished who indulged their
malice, the faithful might derive from their ruin a hope of deliverance; for the
vengeance of God on the reprobate brings with it a token of paternal favor
towards the elect.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And that we may better understand what this

should be also his enemies. But, secondly, it would not be sufficient, except
our zeal were also pure; for when we defend our own private cause, something
excessive will necessarily be in our prayers. Let us, then, know that we are not
to pronounce an imprecation on our enemies, except, first, they are God&#8217;s
enemies; and, secondly, except we disregard ourselves, and plead not our own
cause, but, on the contrary, undertake the cause of public safety, having laid
aside all turbulent feelings; and especially, except our fervor arises from a
desire to glorify God. With these qualifications, then, we may adopt the form of
prayer given us here by the Prophet. But as this subject has been explained
elsewhere, and often and very fully, I touch on it here but
briefly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let all their wickedness come
before thee; do to them as thou hast done to
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here, again, the faithful take upon
themselves the blame for all the evils they were suffering; for they do not
expostulate with God, but pray only that he would become the judge of the whole
world, in order that the ungodly might also at length have their turn, when God
would be pacified towards his children. But they afterwards more clearly express
that they had deserved all that they had suffered &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for all my
sins</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Then they add,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because my sighs are many and my
heart is weak</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We, in short, see that the
faithful lay humbly their prayers before God, and at the same time confess that
what they had deserved was rendered to them, only they set before God their
extreme sorrow, straits, grieves, tears, and sighs. Then the way of pacifying
God is, sincerely to confess that we are justly visited by his judgment, and
also to lie down as it. were confounded, and at the same time to venture to look
up to him, and to rely on his mercy with confidence. Now follows the second
elegy, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet again exclaims in wonder, that an
incredible thing had happened, which was like a prodigy; for at the first sight
it seemed very unreasonable, that a people whom God had not only received into
favor, but with whom he had made a perpetual covenant, should thus be forsaken
by him. For though men were a hundred times perfidious, yet God never changes,
but remains unchangeable in his faithfulness; and we know that his covenant was
not made to depend on the merits of men. Whatsoever, then, the people might be,
yet it behooved God to continue in his purpose, and not to annul the promise
made to Abraham. Now, when Jerusalem was reduced to desolation, there was as it
were all abolition of God&#8217;s covenant. There is, then, no wonder that the
Prophet here exclaims, as on account of some prodigy,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How can it be that God hath
clouded</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or darkened,
etc.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must, however, observe at the same time, that the
Prophet did not mean here to invalidate the fidelity or constancy of God, but
thus to rouse the attention of his own nation, who had become torpid in their
sloth; for though they were pressed down under a load of evils, yet they had
become hardened in their perverseness. But it was impossible that any one should
really call on God, except he was humbled in mind, and brought the sacrifice of
which we have spoken, even a humble and contrite spirit.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;195119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
51:19.) It was, then, the Prophet&#8217;s object to soften the hardness which he
knew prevailed in almost the whole people. This was the reason why he exclaimed,
in a kind of astonishment, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How
has God clouded</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F26</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some render the words, &#8220;How has God raised
up,&#8221; etc., which may be allowed, provided it be not taken in a good sense,
for it is said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in his wrath;
</i></font><font face="Palatino">but in this case the words to raise up and to
cast down ought to be read conjointly; for when one wishes to break in pieces an
earthen vessel, he not only casts it on the ground, but he raises it up, that it
may be thrown down with greater force. We may, then, take this meaning, that
God, in order that he might with greater violence break in pieces his people,
had raised them up, not to honor them, but in order to dash them more violently
on the ground. However, as this sense seems perhaps too refined, I am content
with the first explanation, that God had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>clouded the daughter of Zion in
his wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and then follows an explanation,
that he had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cast her from heaven
to the earth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> So then God covered with darkness
his people, when he drew them down from the high dignity which they had for a
time enjoyed. He had, then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cast
on the earth all the glory of Israel, and remembered not his
footstool</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet seems here indirectly to contend with
God, because he had not spared his own sanctuary; for God, as it has been just
stated, had chosen Mount Sion for himself, where he designed to be prayed to,
because he had placed there the memorial of his name. As, then, he had not
spared his own sanctuary, it did not appear consistent with his constancy, and
he also seemed thus to have disregarded his own glory. But the design of the
Prophet is rather to shew to the people how much God&#8217;s wrath had been
kindled, when he spared not even his own sanctuary. For he takes this principle
as granted, that God is never without reason angry, and never exceeds the due
measure of punishment. As, then, God&#8217;s wrath was so great that he
destroyed his own Temple, it was a token of dreadful wrath; and what was the
cause but the sins of men? for God, as I have said, always preserves moderation
in his judgments. He, then, could not have better expressed to the people the
heinousness of their sins, than by laying before them this fact, that God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>remembered not his
footstool</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the Temple, by a very suitable metaphor, is
called the footstool of God. It is, indeed, called his habitation; for in
Scripture the Temple is often said to be the house of God. It was then the
house, the habitation, and the rest of God. But as men are ever inclined to
superstition, in order to raise up their thoughts above earthly elements, we are
reminded, on the other hand, in Scripture, that the Temple was the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>footstool of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. So in the Psalms,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Adore ye before
his footstool,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;199905&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
99:5;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and again,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;We shall adore in
the place where his feet
stand.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
132:7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We, then, see that the two expressions, apparently
different, do yet well agree, that the Temple was the house of God and his
habitation, and that yet it was only his footstool. It was the house of God,
because the faithful found by experience that he was there present; as, then,
God gave tokens of his presence, the Temple was rightly called the house; of
God, his rest and habitation. But that the faithful might not fix their minds on
the visible sanctuary, and thus by indulging a gross imagination, fall into
superstition, and put an idol in the place of God, the Temple was called the
footstool of God. For as it was a footstool, it behooved the faithful to rise up
higher and to know that God was really sought, only when they raised their
thoughts above the world. We now perceive what was the purpose of this mode of
speaking.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God is said
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not to have remembered his
Temple</i></font><font face="Palatino">, not because he had wholly disregarded
it, but because the destruction of the Temple could produce no other opinion in
men. All, then, who saw that the Temple had been burnt by profane hands, and
pulled down after it had been plundered, thought that the Temple was forsaken by
God; and so also he speaks by Ezekiel,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;261018&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
10:18.) Then this oblivion, or not remembering, refers to the thoughts of men;
for however God may have remembered the Temple, yet he seemed for a time to have
disregarded it. We must, at the same time, bear in mind what I have said, that
the Prophet here did not intend to dispute with God, or to contend with him,
but, on the contrary, to shew what the people deserved; for God was so indignant
on account of their sins, that he suffered his own Temple to be profaned. The
same thing also follows respecting the kingdom, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He pursues the same subject, but in other words. He
first says, that God </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had without
pardon destroyed all the habitations of Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
some read, &#8220;all the beauty (or the ornament) of Jacob.&#8221; But the
other rendering is more suitable, that he had destroyed all the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>habitations</i></font><font face="Palatino">
of Jacob; and then that he had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>demolished in his
indignation</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. The word is derived from what
means excess; but we know that all words signifying wrath are transferred to
God, but they do not properly belong to him. God, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in his violent wrath had
demolished all fortresses</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cast them to the

<div><font face="Palatino">This profanation of the kingdom, and of the princes,
corresponds with the former verse, where he said that God had not remembered his
footstool for we know that the kingdom was sacerdotal and consecrated to God.
When, therefore, it was polluted, it follows that God in a manner exposed his
name to reproach, because the mouth of all the ungodly was thus opened, so that
they insolently poured forth their slanders. That God, then, spared not the
kingdom nor the Temple, it hence followed that his wrath against the Jews was
dreadful. Now, as he is a righteous judge, it follows, that such was the
greatness of the sins of the Jews, that they sustained the blame for this
extreme sacrilege; for it was through their sins that God&#8217;s name was
exposed to reproach both as to the Temple and the kingdom.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah expresses the same thing in various ways;
but all that he says tends to shew that it was an evidence of God&#8217;s
extreme vengeance, when the people, the city, and the Temple, were destroyed.
But it ought to be observed, that God is here represented as the author of that
calamity: the Prophet would have otherwise lamented in vain over the ruin of his
own country; but as in all adversities he acknowledged the hand of God, he
afterwards added, that God had a just reason why he was so grievously displeased
with his own people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>every
horn</i></font><font face="Palatino"> had been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>broken</i></font><font face="Palatino">
by God. We know that by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>horn</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is meant strength as well as excellency or dignity and I am disposed to include
both here, though the word breaking seems rather to refer to strength or power.
But the whole clause must be noticed, that God had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>broken every horn of Israel in
the indignation of his wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet
intimates that God had not been angry with his people as though he had been
offended by slight transgressions, but that the measure of his wrath had been
unusual, even because the impiety of the people had so burst forth, that the
offense given to God could not have been slight. Then, by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>indignation of
wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino"> the Prophet does not mean an excess, as
though God had through a violent impulse rushed forth to take vengeance; but he
rather intimates that the people had become so wicked, that it did not behoove
God to punish in an ordinary way an impiety so inveterate.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds, that God had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>withdrawn, his right hand from
before the enemy</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and that at the same time he
had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>burned like a
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino">, the flame of which had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>devoured all
around</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet here refers to two things;
the first is, that though God had been accustomed to help his people, and to
oppose their enemies, as they had experienced his aid in the greatest dangers,
yet now his people were forsaken and left destitute of all hope. The first
clause, then, declares, that God would not be the deliverer of his people as
formerly, because they had forsaken him. But he speaks figuratively, that God
had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>drawn back his right
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and God&#8217;s right hand means his
protection, as it is well known. But the Prophet&#8217;s meaning is by no means
obscure, even that there was hereafter no hope that God would meet the enemies
of his people, and thus preserve them in safety, for he had drawn back his hand.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F27</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But
there is a second thing added, even that God&#8217;s hand
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>burned like
fire.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Now it was in itself a grievous thing
that the people had been so rejected by God, that no help could be expected from
him; but it was still a harder thing, that he went forth armed to destroy his
people. And the metaphor of fire ought to be noticed; for had he said that
God&#8217;s right hand was against his people, the expression would not have
been so forcible; but when he compared God&#8217;s right hand to fire which
burned, and whose flame consumed all Israel, it was a much more dreadful thing. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F28</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, by these words the Israelites were reminded
that they were not to lament their calamities in an ordinary way, but ought, on
the contrary, to have seriously considered the cause of all their evils, even
the provoking of God&#8217;s wrath against themselves; and not only so, but that
God was angry with them in an unusual degree, and yet justly, so that they had
no reason to complain. It follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He employs now another metaphor, that God, who was
wont to defend his people, now took up arms against them; for stating a part for
the whole, he includes in the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bow</i></font><font face="Palatino">
every other weapon. When, therefore, he says that God had bent his bow, it is
the same as though he said that he was fully armed. The bow, then, as we have
before seen, means every kind of weapon. He then adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his right hand stood as an
adversary</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here he more plainly describes what
he had before touched upon, even that God had not only given up his people to
the will of their enemies, but that he himself had held up a banner to their
enemies, and went before them with an armed hand. Nor is there a doubt but that
by the right hand of God he means all their enemies; for it was necessary
carefully to impress this fact on the minds of the people, that the war had not
been brought by the Chaldeans, but that God had resolved thereby to punish the
wickedness of the people, and especially their desperate obstinacy, for he had
omitted nothing to restore the people to the right way.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whenever, then, there is mention made here of God,
let us know that the people are reminded, as I have already said, that they had
to do with God, lest. they should forget this, or think that it was adverse
fortune, or dream of some other causes of evils, as men are wont in this respect
to be very ingenious in deceiving themselves. And we shall see this more clearly
hereafter, where it is said, that God had thought to destroy the wall of
Jerusalem; but this thought was the same as his decree. Then the Prophet
explains there more fully what is yet here substantially found, even that God
was brought forward thus before the people, that they might learn to humble
themselves under his mighty hand. The hand of God was not indeed visible, but
the Prophet shews that the Chaldeans were not alone to be regarded, but rather
that the hidden hand of God, by which they were guided, ought to have been seen
by the eyes of faith. It was, then, this hand of God that stood against the
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He slew all the chosen
men</i></font><font face="Palatino">; some read, &#8220;all things
desirable;&#8221; but it seems more suitable to consider men as intended, as
though he had said, that the flower of the people perished by the hand of God
<i>in </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the tabernacle of the
daughter of Sion</i></font><font face="Palatino">; though the last clause would
unite better with the end of the verse, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on the tabernacle of the daughter
of Sion God had poured forth his wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or his
anger, <i>as fire</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He repeats the metaphor which he had used in the last
verse; and this is what we ought carefully to notice; for God threatens by
Isaiah that he would be a fire to devour his enemies:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The light of
Israel shall be a fire, and his Holy One a flame of fire, and it shall devour
all briers and all kinds of
wood.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;231007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
10:7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There God threatened the Chaldeans, as though he had
said that his vengeance would be dreadful, when as a patron and defender of his
people he would contend with the Chaldeans. He there calls himself the light of
Israel and the Holy One; and hence he said that he would be a fire and a flame
as to the Chaldeans. But what does he say here? even that God had poured forth
lt is wrath as fire, that its flame had devoured all around whatever was fair to
be seen in Israel. We hence see that the people had provoked against themselves
the vengeance of God, which would have been otherwise poured forth on their
enemies; and thus the sin of the people was doubled. It follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">These words might seem superfluous, since the Prophet
has often repeated, that God was become an enemy to his own people; but we shall
hereafter see, that though they were extremely afflicted, they yet did not
rightly consider whence their calamity arose. As, then, they had become so
stupified by their evils, that they did not turn their eyes to God, they were on
this account often urged and stimulated, that they might at length understand by
their evils that God was a judge. Now, as it was difficult to convince them of
this truth, the Prophet did not think it enough briefly to touch on it, but
found it necessary to dwell on it at large, so that the people might at length
be roused from their insensibility.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says that God himself
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was to them as an
enemy</i></font><font face="Palatino">, lest the Israelites should fix their
eyes on the Chaldeans, and thus think that they had been the chief movers of the
war. He therefore says, that they had undertaken that war through the secret
influence of God, and had carried it on successfully, because God endued them
with his own power. And hence the faithful ought to have concluded, that nothing
could have been more grievous than to have God as their adversary; for as long
as they had suffered themselves to be defended by the hand of God, they were
victorious, we know, over all their enemies, so that they could then brave all
dangers with impunity. The Prophet now reminds them, that as they had been
successful and prosperous under the defense and protection of God, so now they
were miserable, for no other reason but that God fought against them. But we
ought at the same time to bear in mind the truth, which we have noticed, that
God is never angry with men without reason; and since he was especially inclined
to shew favor to his people, we must understand that he would not have been thus
indignant, had not necessity constrained him.</font><br></div>

not resolved to put an end to their obstinate wickedness. He afterwards adds,

<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says first, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his tabernacle had been
overthrown by God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. They who render it
&#8220;cottage&#8221; extenuate too much what is spoken of; nor does the Prophet
simply compare the sanctuary of God to a cottage. Then I take tabernacle in a
good sense. With regard to the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;mj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chemes</i>, as it means to migrate, they properly render it, as I think, who
give this version, that God had removed his tabernacle; nor do I disapprove of
repeating the word tabernacle. God, then, had removed his tabernacle, as though
it were a cottage in a garden. Watchmen, as it appears from the first chapter of
Isaiah, had then cottages in their gardens, but only for a time, as is the case
at this day with those who watch over their vineyards; they have, until the time
of vintage, small chests in which they conceal themselves. The Prophet then
says, that though God&#8217;s tabernacle was honorable, and of high dignity, it
was yet like a cottage in a garden. It is not, however, a simple comparison, as
before stated, and therefore I reject the opinion of those who render it
cottage, for it is not suitable, and it would be unmeaning. <i>God</i>, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hath removed his tabernacle as a
garden</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, the sanctuary where he dwelt.
And how did he remove it? even as a garden-cottage. And as watchers of gardens
were wont to construct their little cots of leaves of trees and slight
materials, so the Prophet, in order to increase commiseration, says, that the
sacred habitation of God was like a cottage in a garden, because it was removed
from one place to another; and thus he intimates that God regarded as nothing
what he had previously adorned with singular excellencies. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F29</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds, that God had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>destroyed his
testimony</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By the word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d[wm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>muod</i>, he means the same throughout; but some confine it to the ark of the
covenant, and of this I .do not disapprove. We must yet bear in mind the design
of the Prophet, which was to shew that by the entire ruin of the Temple the
covenant of God was in a manner abolished. It is, indeed, certain, that God had
not forgotten his faithfulness and constancy, but this abolition of his covenant
refers to what appeared to men. He then says, that the sanctuary which was, as
it were, the testimony of God&#8217;s favor, had been overthrown. Now, as he
repeats again the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d[wm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>muod</i>, it may be that he thus refers to the Tabernacle, either because the
holy assemblies met there, or because it had been solemnly dedicated, that God
might there hold intercourse with his people. For
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d[wm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>muod</i>, means a fixed time, it means an assembly, it means a festival, and
sometimes it means a sacrifice; and all these signification&#8217;s are not
unsuitable: yet when he says that God had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>destroyed his
testimony</i></font><font face="Palatino">, I apply this to the Tabernacle
itself, or, if it seems to any preferable, to the ark of the covenant; though
the former is the most suitable, because it was a place consecrated, as it has
been stated, for mutual intercourse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards says, that God had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>forgotten the
assembly</i></font><font face="Palatino">, the sacrifice, or the tabernacle; for
it is the same word again, but it seems not to be taken in the same sense. Then
I think that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d[wm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>muod</i>, is to be taken here for the assembly. As he had previously said,
that the place where the holy assemblies met had been overthrown or destroyed,
so now he says, that God had no care for all those assemblies, as though they
had been buried in perpetual oblivion; for he mentions also the <i>Sabbath</i>,
which corresponds with the subject. God, then, had forgotten all the assemblies
as well as the Sabbath. There is, again, as to this last word, a part stated for
the whole, for this word was no doubt intended to include all the festivals. The
meaning of the passage then is, that the impiety of the people had been so
great, that God, having, as it were, forgotten his covenant, had inflicted such
a dreadful punishment, that religion, for a time, was in a manner trodden under
foot.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, in the last place, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>king and the
priest</i></font><font face="Palatino"> had been rejected by God. We have
already said, that these were as two pledges of God&#8217;s paternal favor; for,
on the one hand, he who reigned from the posterity of David was a living image
of Christ; and on the other hand, there was always a high-priest from the
posterity of Aaron to reconcile men to God. It was then the same as though God
shewed himself in every way propitious to the chosen people. Then their true
happiness was founded on the kingdom and the priesthood; for the kingdom was, as
it were, a mark of God&#8217;s favor for their defense, and the priesthood was
to them the means by which reconciliation with God was obtained. When,
therefore, God wholly disregarded the king and the priest, it became hence
evident, that he was greatly displeased with his people, having thus, in a
manner, obliterated his favors. It follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

words. He says first, that God had

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F30</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> an
expression not strictly proper, but the Prophet could not otherwise fully shew
to the Jews what they deserved; for had he only spoken of the city, of the
lands, of the palaces, of the vineyards, and, in short, of all their
possessions, it would have been a much lighter matter; but when he says that God
had counted as nothing all their sacred things, &#8212; the altar, the Temple,
the ark of the covenant, and festive days, &#8212; when, therefore, he says,
that God had not only disregarded, but had also cast away from him these things,
which yet especially availed to conciliate his favor, the people must have hence
perceived, except they were beyond measure stupid, how grievously they had
provoked God&#8217;s wrath against themselves; for this was the same as though
heaven and earth were blended together. Had there been an upsetting of all
things, had the sun left its place and sunk into darkness, had the earth heaved
upwards, the confusion would have hardly been more dreadful, than when God put
forth thus his hand against the sanctuary, the altar, the festal days, and all
their sacred things. But we must refer to the reason why this was done, even
because the Temple had been long polluted by the iniquities of the people, and
because all sacred things had been wickedly and disgracefully profaned. We now,
then, understand the reason why the Prophet enlarged so much on a subject in
itself sufficiently plain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds, He
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hath delivered all the
palaces</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc.; as though he had said, that the
city had not been taken by the valor of enemies, but that the Chaldeans had
fought under the authority and banner of God. He, in short, intimates that the
Jews had miserably perished, because they perished through their own fault; and
that the Chaldeans had proved victorious in battle, and had taken the city, not
through their own courage or skill, but because God had resolved to punish that
ungodly and wicked people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows in the last place, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>enemies had made a noise in the
temple of God as in the day of solemnity</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here
also the Prophet shews, that God would have never suffered the enemies
insolently to exult and to revel in the very Temple, had not the Israelites
deserved all this; for the :insolence of their enemies was not unknown to God,
and he might have easily checked it if he pleased. Why, then, did he grant so
much license to these profane enemies? even because the Jews themselves had
previously polluted the Temple, so that he abhorred all their solemn assemblies,
as also he declares by Isaiah, that he detested their festivals, Sabbaths, and
new moons.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:13, 14.) But it was a shocking change, when enemies entered the place which
God had consecrated for himself, and there insolently boasted and uttered base
and wicked calumnies against God! But the sadder the spectacle, the more
detestable appeared the impiety of the people, which had been the cause of so
great evils. For we ought ever to remember what I have often stated, that these
circumstances were noticed by the Prophet, that the people , might at length
acknowledge themselves guilty as to all these evils, which they would have
otherwise ascribed to the Chaldeans. That, then, the Chaldeans polluted the
Temple, that they trod under foot all sacred things, all this the Prophet shews
was to be ascribed to the Jews themselves, who had, through their own conduct,
opened the Temple to the Chaldeans, who had exposed all sacred things to their
will and pleasure. It follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

willfully astray through various false thoughts, and thus withdraw themselves,

had been overthrown through a divine decree, because God had so determined,

&#8220;See, these are the thoughts which God has thought respecting Jerusalem,
which he has thought respecting Babylon.&#8221; The Prophet, then, in these
instances, taught what he now confirms in this place, that when the city
Jerusalem was destroyed, it was not what happened by chance; but because God had
brought there the Chaldeans, and employed them as his instruments in taking and
destroying the city: God, then, has
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thought to destroy the wall of
the daughter of Zion</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is, indeed, true, that
the Chaldeans had actively carried on the war, and omitted nothing as to
military skill, in order to take the city: but the Prophet calls here the
attention of the Jews to a different thought, so that they might acknowledge
that they suffered justly for their sins, and that God was the chief author of
that war, and that the Chaldeans were to be viewed as hired
soldiers.</font><br></div>

God would not have been so displeased with the holy city which he had chosen,

deplores, he mentions this as one, that there was <i>no law</i> or doctrine. The

having said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there is no
law</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>her prophets also have not found

greatest, that they were without doctrine or teaching, and without prophets. The
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrwt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ture</i>, is indeed used often by way of excellency to designate the law, but
it signifies also doctrine or instruction; and the meaning here is the same, as
though the Prophet had said, that the Jews had been so forsaken by God, that
they found no consolation in their evils. This may be better understood by a
similar complaint in the Psalms:</font><br></div>

state, because God shewed them no signs of his favor; and signs were given when
God appeared propitious to them. Now, as God had testified that there would be
always faithful teachers to guide the people, they therefore complained that
there was no Prophet, that there was no one any more who had a vision. And so in
this place the Prophet says, that there was <i>no law</i>, and that <i>the
prophets</i> were without a vision, even because God, as though wearied, had
given up the care of the people: for his paternal favor could not have been
better known than by this evidence, that he sent them prophets; and it is
certain that all prophecies ceased when the people were driven into
exile.</font><br></div>

temporary silence; for all the prophets would be mute, that the people might lie
in a hopeless state, and for this reason, because they had long abused
God&#8217;s patience, and had disregarded that singular blessing, when God
manifested by his servants that he was solicitous for their well-being and
safety, as he had often said, that he rose up early and extended his hand to
them by the prophets. As, then, the gift of prophecy was to the people a sure
pledge not only of God&#8217;s favor, but also of the solicitude which he
entertained for them; so when he withheld prophets from the people, he departed
from them, having forsaken as it were his station among them.

<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand what the Prophet meant by
saying, that there was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>no
doctrine</i></font><font face="Palatino"> any more, and that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino">

vision</i></font><font face="Palatino"> any more
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from

profaned, became silent, and deigned not for a time to open his sacred mouth,
because he had seen that he had been treated with derision.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this passage teaches us, that nothing is more
desirable in evils, and that there is no better remedy, than to have God&#8217;s
promise, that he will at length be merciful to us. For when any promise of God
is set before us, it is like a small light kindled in darkness. Though then our
misery were like a thick darkness, yet when God shews some token of favor by his
promises, that ought to be sufficient to give us hope and joy. On the other
hand, when no promises of God occur to us, it is a sure token of reprobation,
unless that he sometimes thus tries us, as we read here. But the faithful also
themselves, when they perceive no evidence of God&#8217;s paternal favor in his
promises, are as it were in a hopeless state, and sunk in the lowest depths.
Hence it is then only that we arise from death to life, and find support so as
not to be overwhelmed with despair, when God is pleased to speak to us. It now
follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here strikingly represents the

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on the

grievous sorrow, and that the <i>virgins</i> bent their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heads down to the
ground</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The meaning is, that the elders knew
not what to do, and led others. to join them in acts of fruitless and abject
lamentation. We indeed know that young women are over-careful as to their form
and beauty, and indulge themselves in pleasures; and that when they roll
themselves with their face and hair on the ground, it is a token of extreme
mourning. This is what the Prophet means.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They were wont indeed to put on sackcloth as a token
of repentance, and to cast dust on their heads; but their minds were often so
confused, that they only thus set forth their mourning and sorrow, and had no
regard to God; and hypocrites, when they put on sackcloth, pretended to repent,
but it was a false pretense. Now in this place the Prophet does not mean that
the elders by adopting these rites professed to repent and humbly to solicit
pardon; but refers to them only as tokens of sorrow; as though he had said, that
the elders had no resources, and that the young women had no hope nor joy. For
the elders did lie down on the ground, as it is usual with those who have no
remedy. We now understand the meaning of the Prophet.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet himself now speaks, and says that his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>eyes were consumed with
tears</i></font><font face="Palatino">, while weeping on account of the
calamities of the people: even in the deepest grief tears at length dry up; but
when there is no end of weeping, the sorrow, which as it were never ripens, must
necessarily be very bitter. Jeremiah then expresses now the vehemence of his
grief when he says that his </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>eyes
failed through shedding tears</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He said in
Jeremiah 9, &#8220;Who will give me eyes for fountains?&#8221; that is, who will
make my eyes to turn into fountains, that they may continually flow? and this he
said, because he saw how dreadful a vengeance of God impended over the
obstinate. But now, when he sees accomplished what he had dreaded, he says, that
his eyes were consumed with weeping.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To the same purpose is what he adds, that his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bowels were
disturbed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is the same verb as we have seen
before,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wrmrmj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chemermeru</i>; which some render &#8220;bound,&#8221; as we also said then.
I know not why one expositor has changed what he had elsewhere said rightly; he
puts here, &#8220;swollen have my bowels.&#8221; But I see no reason why the
verb should be taken here in a different sense, for it immediately follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>my liver is poured forth on the
ground</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He may, indeed, have included other
parts of the intestines by stating a part for the whole. The word here properly
means the liver, as when Solomon says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He hath pierced my
liver.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;200723&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Proverbs
7:23.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Jeremiah, in short, shews that all his faculties
were so seized with grief, that no part was exempt. He then says that his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>liver was poured
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino">, but in the same sense in which he said
that his bowels were disturbed. They are indeed hyperbolical expressions; but as
to the meaning, Jeremiah simply expresses his feelings; for there is no doubt
but that he was incredibly anxious and sorrowful on account of so great a
calamity; for he not only lamented the adversity in no ordinary way, but he also
considered how wicked was that obstinacy in which the people had hardened
themselves for almost fifty years; for he had spent himself in vain, not for a
short time, but for nearly fifty years he never ceased to speak to them. He
then, no doubt, thought within himself what the people had deserved, so that he
had no common dread of God&#8217;s vengeance. This, then, was the reason why he
said that his bowels were disturbed and his liver poured forth. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F36</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He,
however, mentions the cause of his sorrow, even
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
breach</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or destruction
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the daughter of his
people</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and he mentions one thing in
particular, because the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>little

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;t[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>otheph</i>, which properly means to cover; but its secondary meaning is to
vanish away, as we shall again presently see. It was, indeed, a miserable sight,
when not only men and women were everywhere slain, but when, through famine,
little children also fainted. We, indeed, know that infants move our pity, for
the tears of a child in hunger penetrate into our inmost souls. When, therefore,
little children and those who hung on their mothers&#8217; breasts, cried
through the streets of the city, it must have touched the most iron hearts. It
was then not without reason that Jeremiah referred to this in particular, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>little children and sucklings
vanished away</i></font><font face="Palatino">, not in a deserted and barren

<div><font face="Palatino">There is either a personification in the words of the
Prophet, or he speaks now of another party, for he cannot refer now to children
sucking their mothers&#8217; breasts, for they could not have expressly said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Where is corn and
wine?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and the use of wine is not allowed to
infants. Then the words of the Prophets extend further, for not infants, but
children somewhat grown up, could have thus spoken. And in this view there is
nothing unreasonable or forced, for he spoke of little children, and to little
children he joined infants. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F37</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And now
he refers only to one party, even that children, who could now speak, complained
to their mothers that there was no bread nor wine, that is, no means of support,
no food.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If, however, any one prefers a personification, I do
not object; and this view would not be unsuitable, that even infants by their
silence cried for food; for the tears of children speak more efficaciously than
when one gives utterance to words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">However this may be, the Prophet intimates that such
was the scarcity, that children died in the bosom of their mothers, and in vain
sought food and cried that they were without support. He then says that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>said to their
mothers</i></font><font face="Palatino">; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F38</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by which
expression he means that their complaints were the more pitiable, because their
mothers could afford them no help. And we know how tender and affectionate are
the feelings of mothers, for a mother would willingly nourish her own child, not
only with her own milk, but even, if possible, with her life. When, therefore,
the Prophet says that children cried to their mothers, he means to represent a
sad spectacle, and which ought justly to produce horror in the minds of all.

<div><font face="Palatino">When we wish to alleviate grief, we are wont to bring
examples which have some likeness to the case before us. For when any one seeks
to comfort one in illness, he will say, &#8220;Thou art not the first nor the
last, thou hast many like thee; why shouldest thou so much torment thyself; for
this is a condition almost common to mortals.&#8221; As, then, it is an ordinary
way of alleviating grief to bring forward examples, the Prophet says,
&#8220;What examples shall I set before thee? that is, why or to what purpose
should I mention to thee this or that man who is like thee? or,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What</i></font><font face="Palatino">

will avail thee nothing.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F39</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, then, means that comforts commonly
administered to those in misery, would be of no benefit, because the calamity of
Jerusalem exceeded all other examples, as though he had said, &#8220;No such
thing had ever happened in the world; God had never before thundered so
tremendously against any people; were I, then, to seek to bring examples to
thee, I should be utterly at a loss; for when I compare thee with others in
misery, I find that thou exceedest them all. &#8220;We now, then, perceive the
meaning of the Prophet: he wished by this mode of speaking to exaggerate the
grievousness of Jerusalem&#8217;s calamity, for she had been afflicted in a
manner unusual and unheard of before; as though he had said that the Jews had
become miserable beyond all other nations.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>should I bring witnesses
before thee? and why should I make any one like thee? why should I make other

the reason or the end (for the

<i>vau</i>, here ought to be so rendered)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that I might comfort
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, after the usual manner of men.
He afterwards adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because great
as the sea is thy breach</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or breaking; that is,
&#8220;Thy calamity is the deepest abyss: I cannot then find any in the whole
world whom I can compare to thee, for thy calamity exceeds all calamities; nor
is there anything like it that can be set before thee, so that thou art become a
memorable example for all ages.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But when we hear the Prophet speaking thus, we ought
to remember that we have succeeded in the place of the ancient people. As, then,
God had formerly punished with so much severity the sins of his chosen people,
we ought to beware lest we in the present day provoke him to an extremity by our
perverseness, for he remains ever like himself. But whenever it may happen that
we are severely afflicted and broken down by his hand, let us still know that
there is yet some comfort remaining for us, even when sunk down in the lowest
depth. The Prophet, indeed, exaggerates in this place the evils of the people;
but he had previously begun to encourage the faithful to entertain hope; and he
will again repeat the same doctrine. But it was necessary for the Prophet to use
such words until those who were as yet torpid in their sins, and did not
sufficiently consider the design of God&#8217;s vengeance, were really humbled.

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet condemns the Jews for that
wantonness by which they had, as it were, designedly destroyed themselves, as
though they had willfully drunk sweet poison. They had been inebriated with
those fallacies which we have seen, when impostors promised them a prosperous
condition; for we have seen that false prophets often boldly declared that
whatever Jeremiah threatened was of no account. Since, then, the Jews were
inebriated with such flatteries, and disregarded God&#8217;s judgment, and
freely indulged themselves in their vices, the effect was, that God&#8217;s
wrath had been always and continually kindled by them. Now, then, Jeremiah
reproves them for such wantonness, even because they willfully sought to be
deceived, and with avidity cast themselves into snares, by seeking for
themselves flatterers as teachers. Micah also reproves them for the same thing,
that they sought prophets who promised them a fruitful vintage and an abundant
harvest.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;330210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah

them</i></font><font face="Palatino">; but the verb refers to prophecies, as

insipidity</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F40</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
availed not to extenuate the fault of the people; and Jeremiah does not here
flatter the people, as though they had perished through the fault of others; and
yet this was a common excuse, for most, when they had been deceived, complained
that they had fallen through being led astray, and also that they had not been
sufficiently cautious when subtle men were laying snares for them. But the
Prophet here condemns the Jews, because they had been deceived by false
prophets, as it was a just reward for their vainglory and ambition. For they had
very delicate ears, and free reproofs could not be endured by them; in a word,
when they rejected all sound doctrine, the devil must have necessarily succeeded
in the place of God, as also Paul says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;that those were

<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive the design of the Prophet: he says
that the Jews had indeed been deceived by the false prophets; but this had
happened through their own fault, because they had not submitted to obey God,
because they had rejected sound doctrine, because they had been rebellious
against all his counsels. At the same time, not only their crime seems to have
been thus exaggerated, but also their shame was brought before them, &#8212;
because they had dared to set up these impostors against Jeremiah as well as
other servants of God; for they had boasted greatly of these their false
prophets whenever they sought to exult against God. How great was this
presumption! When the false prophets had promised them security, they
immediately triumphed in an insolent manner over Jeremiah, as though they were
victorious. As, then, their wickedness and arrogance had been such against God,
the Prophet justly retorts upon them, &#8220;Behold now as to your false
prophets; for when they lately promised to you prosperity of every kind, I was
inhumanly treated, and my calling was disdainfully repudiated by you; let now
your false prophets come forward: be wise at length through your evils, and
acknowledge what it is to have acted so haughtily against God and against his
servants.&#8221; We now understand why the Prophet says, &#8220;They have seen
for you vanity and insipidity.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,

thine iniquity.&#8221; There is, indeed, a suitableness in the words in that
language, that they had not applied their revelations to the iniquities of the
people, for they would have been thus restored to the right way, and would have
thus obviated the vengeance of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, this passage ought to be carefully noticed:
Jeremiah spoke of the fallacies of the false prophets, which he said were
insipid: he now expresses how they had deceived the people, even because they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>disclosed not their
iniquities</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Let us then know that there is
nothing more necessary than to be warned, that being conscious of our iniquities
we may repent. And this was the chief benefit to be derived from the teaching of
the prophets. For the other part, the foretelling of future things would have
had but little effect had not the prophets preached respecting the vengeance of
God, &#8212; had they not exhorted the people to repentance, &#8212; had they
not bidden them by faith to embrace the mercy of God. Then Jeremiah in a manner
detects the false doctrines of those who had corrupted the prophetic doctrine,
by saying that they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had not
disclosed iniquities</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Let us then learn by this
mark how to distinguish between the faithful servants of God and impostors. For
the Lord by his word summons us before his tribunal, and would have our
iniquities discovered, that we may loathe ourselves, and thus open an entrance
for mercy. But when what is brought before us only tickles our ears and feeds
our curiosity, and, at the same time, buries all our iniquities, let us then
know that the refined things which vastly please men are insipid and useless.
Let, then, the doctrine of repentance be approved by us, the doctrine which
leads us to God&#8217;s tribunal, so that being cast down in ourselves we may
flee to his mercy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards
adds,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> that they might turn back
thy captivity</i></font><font face="Palatino">; some prefer, &#8220;thy
defection&#8221; &#8212; and this meaning is :not unsuitable; but the Prophet, I
have no doubt, refers to punishment rather than to a crime. Then the captivity
of the people would have been reversed had the people in time repented; for we
obviate God&#8217;s wrath by repentance: &#8220;If we judge ourselves,&#8221;
says Paul, &#8220;we shall not be judged.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461131&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 11:31.) As, then, miserable men anticipate God&#8217;s judgment when
they become judges of themselves, the Prophet does not without reason say that
the false prophets had not disclosed their iniquities, so that they might remain
quiet in their own country, and never be driven into exile. How so? for God
would have been thus pacified, that is, had the people willingly turned to him,
as it is said in Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;And be converted,
and I should heal them.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
6:10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Conversion, then, is said there to lead to healing;
for as fire when fuel is withdrawn is extinguished, so also when we cease to sin
fuel is not supplied to God&#8217;s wrath. We now, then, perceive the meaning of
the Prophet; he, in short, intimates that people had been destroyed because they
sought falsehoods, while the false prophets vainly flattered them; for they
would have in due time escaped so great evils, had the prophets boldly exhorted
the people to repentance. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F41</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they saw for thee prophecies
of vanity and expulsions</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Though the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ta&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>meshat</i>, is often taken in a bad sense for a burden, that is, a hard
prophecy which shews that God&#8217;s vengeance is nigh, yet it is doubtful
whether the Prophet takes it now in this sense, since he speaks of prophecies
which gave hope of impunity to the people; and these were not
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twa&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>meshaut</i>, that is, they were not grievous and dreadful prophecies. But
when all things are well considered, it will be evident that Jeremiah did not
without reason adopt this word; for he afterwards adds an explanation. The word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ha&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>meshae</i>, is indeed taken sometimes as meaning any kind of prophecy, but it
properly means what is comminatory. But now, what does Jeremiah say?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They saw for thee
burdens</i></font><font face="Palatino"> which thou hast escaped. For to render
odious the doctrine of the holy man, they called whatever he taught, according
to a proverbial saying, a burden. Thus, then, they created a prejudice against
the holy man by saying that all his prophecies contained nothing but terror and
trouble. Now, by way of concession, the Prophet says, &#8220;They themselves
have indeed been prophets to you, and they saw, but saw at length
burdens.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">While, then, the false prophets promised impunity to
the people, they were flatterers, and no burden appeared, that is, no trouble;
but these prophecies became at length much more grievous than all the
threatenings with which Jeremiah had terrified them; and corresponding with this
view is what immediately follows, <i>expulsions</i>. For the Prophet, I doubt
not, shews here what fruit the vain flatteries by which the people had chosen to
be deluded had produced: for hence it happened, that they had been expelled from
their country and driven into exile. For if the reason was asked, why the people
had been deprived of their own inheritance, the obvious answer would have been
this, because they had chosen to be deceived, because they had hardened
themselves in obstinacy by means of falsehoods and vain promises. Since, then,
their exile was the fruit of false doctrine, Jeremiah says now that these
impostors saw burdens of vanity, but which at length brought burdens; and then
they saw,

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here reminds the Jews of the miseries by
which they had been already in an extreme measure afflicted, so that these words
seem redundant and somewhat unkind; for unseasonable is reproof when one lies
down, as it were, worn out with evils. As this was the condition of the people,
the Prophet ought not to have made more bitter their grief. But we have already
referred to the reason for this, even because the Jews, though they mourned and
were extremely sorrowful in their calamities, did not yet consider whence their
evils came. It was therefore necessary that they should be more and more
awakened; for it is but of little profit for any one to suffer evils, except he
has regard to God&#8217;s judgment. We hence perceive the design of the Prophet,
why he so much at large speaks of the miseries which were seen by all, and could
not escape the notice of the Jews, who were almost overwhelmed with them; for it
was not enough for them to feel their miseries, except they also considered the
cause of them.</font><br></div>

had been </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>perfect in
beauty</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because God had adorned it with
singular gifts; he had especially favored it with the incomparable honor of
being called by his name. Hence Jerusalem was in a manner the earthly palace of
God, that is, on account of the Temple; and further, it was there that the
doctrine of salvation was to be found; and remarkable was this
promise,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;From Sion shall go
forth the law,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and rite word of God

<div><font face="Palatino">God had also promised to Ezekiel, that this city
would be the fountain and origin of salvation to the whole world.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;264701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
47:1-12.) As, then, Jerusalem had been adorned with so remarkable gifts, the
Prophet introduces here strangers, who ask, &#8220;Could it be that a city so
celebrated for beauty had become a desolation?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls it also
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the joy of the whole
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for God had poured there his gifts so
liberally, that it was a cause of joy to all. For we delight in beautiful
things; and wherever God&#8217;s gifts appear, we ought to have our hearts
filled with joy. Some give a more refined explanation &#8212; that Jerusalem had
been the joy of the whole earth, because men have no peace except God be
propitious to them; and there God had deposited the testimony and pledge of his
favor: and thus Jerusalem made glad the whole world, because it invited all
nations to God. This, at the first view, is plausible; but it seems to me more
refined than solid. I am, therefore, content with this simple view, that
Jerusalem was the joy of the whole earth, because God had designed that his
favor should appear there, which might justly excite the whole world to rejoice.

<div><font face="Palatino">Here, also, the Prophet introduces enemies as
insolently exulting over the miseries of the people. He first says, that they
had opened the mouth, even that they might loudly upbraid them; for he is not
said to open the mouth who only speaks, but who insolently and freely utters his
calumnies. God is, indeed, sometimes said emphatically to open his mouth, when
he announces something that deserves special notice; and so Matthew says, that
Christ opened his mouth when he spoke of true happiness.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
5:2.) But in this place and in others the enemy is said to open his mouth, who,
with a full mouth, so to speak, taunts him whom he sees worn out with evils.
Hence, he refers to petulance or insolence, when he says, that enemies had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>opened their
mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds, that they had <i>hissed</i>. By hissing
he no doubt means scoffing or taunting; for it immediately follows, that they
had <i>gnashed with</i> their <i>teeth</i>, as though he had said, that enemies
not only blamed and condemned them, but had also given tokens of extreme hatred;
for he who gnashes with his teeth thus shews the bitterness of his mind, and
even fury; for to gnash the teeth is what belongs to a wild beast. The Prophet
then says, that enemies had not only harassed the people with taunts and scoffs,
but had also cruelly and even furiously treated them. Now we know that to men of
ingenuous minds, such a treatment is harder than death itself: for it is deemed
by many a hard thing to fall in battle &#8212; and we see how men of war expose
themselves to the greatest danger; but a disgraceful death is far more bitter.
The Prophet, then, no doubt, amplifies the miseries of the people by this
circumstance, that they had been harassed on every side by taunts. And he
mentions this on purpose, because reproofs by the prophets had not been received
by them; for we know how perversely the Jews had rebelled against the prophets,
when they reproved them in God&#8217;s name. As, then, they would not have borne
the paternal reproofs of God, they were thus constrained to bear the reproaches
of enemies, and to receive the just reward of their pride and presumption. Nor
is there a doubt, as I have said, but that the Prophet related reproaches of
this kind, and the scoffs of enemies, that the people might at length know that
they had been exposed to such evils, because they had proudly rejected the
reproofs given them by the prophets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, that enemies spoke thus,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have devoured; surely this is
the day which we have expected</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as though they
triumphed when they saw that they got the victory, and that they could do with
the people as they pleased. And as I have said, this in itself was a very bitter
thing to the people; but. when the Prophet related, as in the person of the
enemies, what was already sufficiently known to them, the people ought to have
called to mind the reason why they had been so severely afflicted; and this is
what the Prophet clearly sets forth in the next verse; for he, adds, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">Had the Prophet related only the boastings of
enemies, the people would have probably become more hardened in their sorrow.
But now, on the other hand, he assumes a different character. After having
represented how insolently the enemies conducted themselves, he now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah hath done what he had
determined</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and thus from the taunts of enemies
he calls the attention of the people to the judgment of God. For when enemies
insult us, we: indeed feel hurt, but afterwards grief in a manner blunts our
feelings. Our best remedy then is, not to have our thoughts fixed on the
insolence of men, but to know what the Scripture often reminds us, that the
wicked are the scourges of God by which he chastises us. This, then, is the
subject which the Prophet now handles. He says that God had <i>done</i>, etc.;
as though he had said, that however enemies might exceed moderation, yet if the
people attended to God there was a just cause why they should humble
themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, first, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah had done what he had
determined</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> for the word to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>think</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is improperly applied to God, but yet it is often done, as we have before seen.
He then says, that he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had
fulfilled the word</i></font><font face="Palatino"> which he had formerly
commanded; for had the Prophet touched only on the secret counsel of God, the
Jews might have been in doubt as to what it was. And certainly, as our minds
cannot penetrate into that deep abyss, in vain would he have spoken of the
hidden judgments of God. It was therefore necessary to come down to the
doctrine, by which God, as far as :it is expedient, manifests to us what would
otherwise be not only hidden, but also incomprehensible; for were we to inquire
into God&#8217;s judgments, we should sink into the deep. But when we direct our
minds to what God has taught us, we find that he reveals to us whatever is
necessary to be known; and though even by his word, we cannot perfectly know his
hidden judgments. yet we may know them in part, and as I have said, as far as it
is expedient for us. This, then, is the reason why the Prophet, after having
spoken of God&#8217;s counsels and decrees, adds <i>the
word</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then hold to this rule, even to seek from the
Law and the Prophets, and the Gospel, whatever we desire to know respecting the
secret judgments of God; for, were we to turn aside, even in the smallest
degree, from what is taught us, the immensity of God&#8217;s glory would
immediately swallow up all our thoughts; and experience sufficiently teaches us,
that nothing is more dangerous and even fatal than to allow ourselves more
liberty in this respect than what behooves us. Let us then learn to bridle all
curiosity when we speak of God&#8217;s secret judgments, and instantly to direct
our minds to the word itself, that they may be in a manner enclosed there.
Moreover, the Prophet was also able, in this manner, more easily to check
whatever the Jews might have been otherwise ready to object: for we know that
they were always wont to murmur, and that as soon as the prophets spake, they
brought forward many exceptions, by which they attempted to confute their
doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, they were an unteachable people, Jeremiah
did not only speak of God&#8217;s hidden judgments, of which some doubt might
have been alleged; but, in order to cut off every occasion for disputes and
contentions, he mentioned <i>the word</i> itself; and thus he held the Jews as
it were convicted; for, as it is said by Moses, they could not have objected and
said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Who shall ascend
into heaven? who shall descend into the deep? who shall pass over the
sea?&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
30:12-14;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">for in their mouth was God&#8217;s word, that is, God
had sufficiently made known his judgments, so that they could not complain of
obscurity. We now then perceive another reason why the Prophet joined the word
to God&#8217;s judgments and decrees or counsel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says that this <i>word</i> had been published
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from ancient
days</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and here he touches on the untameable
obstinacy of the people; for had they been admonished a few days or a short time
before, they might have expostulated with God; and there might have been some
specious appearance that God had as it were made too great haste in his rigor.
But as prophets had been sent, one after another, and as he had not ceased for
many years, nay, for many ages, to exhort them to repentance, and to threaten
them also that they might repent, hence their inveterate impiety more fully
betrayed itself. This is the reason why the Prophet now mentions the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ancient
days</i></font><font face="Palatino">, in which God had published his
word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at length adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he hath subverted and not
spared</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He does not here charge God with too
much rigor, but rather he reproves the Jews, so that from the grievousness of
their punishment they might know how intolerable had been their iniquity. He
would then have them to judge of their sins by their punishment, for God does
not act unjustly towards men. It hence follows, that when we are severely
afflicted by his hand, it is a proof that we have been very
wicked.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then concludes that it was God who had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>exhilarated their enemies, and
raised up their horn</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F46</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By these
words. he confirms the doctrine, on which I have already touched, that we ought
to turn our eyes to God, when men are insolent to us ,and exult over our
miseries; for such a reproach might otherwise wholly overwhelm us. But when we
consider that we are chastised by God, and that the wicked, however petulantly
they may treat us, are yet God&#8217;s scourges, then we resolve with calm and
resigned minds to bear what would otherwise wear us out by its acerbity. It

said, that the heart of the people was oppressed with so much sorrow, that their
feelings burst forth into crying; for crying arises from extreme grief, and when
any one cries or weeps, he has no control over himself. Silence is a token of
patience; but when grief overcomes one, he, as though forgetting himself,
necessarily bursts out into crying. This is the reason why he says that their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heart cried to
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must observe, that the piety of the people is
not here commended, as though they complained of their evils to God in sincerity
and with an honest heart: on the contrary, the Prophet means that it was a
common cry, often uttered even by the reprobate; for nature in a manner teaches
this, that we ought to flee to God when oppressed by evils; and even those who
have no fear of God exclaim in their extreme miseries, &#8220;God be merciful to
us.&#8221; And, as I have said, such a cry does not flow from a right feeling or
from the true fear of God, but from the strong and turbid impulse of nature: and
thus God has from the beginning rendered all mortals inexcusable. So, then, now
the Prophet says, that the Jews <i>cried</i> to God, or
that</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> their heart
cried</i></font><font face="Palatino">; not that they looked to God as they
ought to have done, or that they deposited with him their sorrows and cast them
into his bosom, as the Prophet encourages us to do; but because they found no
remedy in the world &#8212; for as long as men find any comfort or help in the
world, with that they are satisfied. Whence, then, was this crying to God? even
because the world offered them nothing in which they could acquiesce; for it is
indigenous, as it were, in our nature (that is, corrupt nature) to look around
here and there, when any evil oppresses us. Now, when we find, as I have said,
anything as a help, even an empty specter, to that we cleave, and never raise up
our eyes to God. But when necessity forces us, then we begin to cry to God. Then
the Prophet means that the people had been reduced to the greatest straits, when
he says that their </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heart cried to
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards turns to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wall</i></font><font face="Palatino">
of Jerusalem, and ascribes understanding to an inanimate thing.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O wall</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">of Jerusalem, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>draw down tears as though thou
wert a river</i></font><font face="Palatino">; or, as a river; for both meanings
may be admitted. But by stating a part for the whole, he includes under the word
<i>wall</i>, the whole city, as it is well known. And yet there is still a
personification, for neither houses, nor walls, nor gates, nor streets, could
shed tears; but Jeremiah could not, except by this hyperbolical language,
sufficiently express the extent of their cry. This was the reason why he
addressed the very <i>wall</i> of the city, and bade it <i>to
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shed tears like a
river</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F47</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There seems to be some allusion to the ruins; for the
walls of the city had been broken down as though they were melted. And then the
Prophet seems to allude to the previous hardness of the people, for their hearts
had been extremely stupified. As, then, they never had been flexible, whether
addressed by doctrine, or exhortations, or threatenings, he now by implication
brings forward in contrast with them the walls of the city, as though he had
said, &#8220;Hitherto no one of God&#8217;s servants could draw even one tear
from your eyes, so great was your hardness; but now the very walls weep, for
they dissolve, as though they would send forth rivers of waters. Therefore the
very stones turn to tears, because ye have hitherto been hardened against God
and all prophetic instruction.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Spare not thyself, give not
thyself rest day or night, and let not the daughter of thine
eye</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or the pupil of thine eye, <i>cease</i>,
literally, be silent; but to be silent is metaphorically taken in the sense of
ceasing or resting. He intimates that there would be, nay, that there was now,
an occasion of continual lamentation; and hence he exhorted them to weep day and
night; as though he had said, that sorrow would continue without intermission,
as there would be no relaxation as to their evils. But we must bear in mind what
we have before said, that the Prophet did not speak thus to embitter the sorrow
of the people. We indeed know that the minds of men are very tender and delicate
while under evils, and then that they rush headlong into impatience; but as they
were not as yet led to true repentance, he sets before them the punishment which
God had inflicted, that they might thereby be turned to consider their own sins.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now explains himself more clearly, and
confirms what I have lately said, that he mentioned not the calamities of the
people except for this end, that those who were almost stupid might begin to
raise up their eyes to God, and also to examine their life, and willingly to
condemn themselves, that thus they might escape from the wrath of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet then bids them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rise</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
cry</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Doubtless they had been by force
constrained by their enemies to undertake a long journey: why then does he bid
them to rise, who had become fugitives from their own country, and had been
driven away like sheep? He regards, as I have said, the slothfulness of their
minds, because they were still lying torpid in their sins. It was then necessary
to rouse them from this insensibility; and this is what the Prophet had in view
by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rise</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F48</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And then
he bids them to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cry at the
beginning of the watches</i></font><font face="Palatino">, even when sleep
begins to creep on, and the time is quieter; for when men go to bed, then sleep
comes on, and that is the main rest. ut the Prophet bids here the Jews to cry,
and in their uneasiness to utter their complaints at the very time when others
take their rest. et he did not wish them heedlessly to pour forth into the air
their wailings, but bade them to present their prayers to God. hen as to the
circumstances of that time, he repeats what we have already seen, that so great
was their mass of evils, that it allowed the people no relaxation; in short, he
intimates that it was a continual sorrow.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But, as I have said, he would have the Jews not
simply to cry, but after having exhorted them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pour out their hearts like
waters</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before the face of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For the unbelieving make themselves
almost hoarse by crying, but they are only like brute beasts; or if they call on
God&#8217;s name, they do this, as it has been said, through a rash and
indiscriminate impulse. Hence the Prophet here makes a difference between the
elect of God and the reprobate, when he bids them to pour forth their hearts and
their cries
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before</i></font><font face="Palatino">
God, so as to seek alleviation from him, which could not have been done, were
they not convinced that he was the author of all their calamities; and hence,
also, arises repentance, for there is a mutual relation between God&#8217;s
judgment and men&#8217;s sins. Whosoever, then, acknowledges God as a judge, is
at the same time compelled to examine himself and to inquire as to his own sins.
We now understand the meaning of the Prophet&#8217;s words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For the same purpose he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Raise up to him thy
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This practice of itself is, indeed, not
sufficient; but the Scripture often points out the real thing by external signs.
Then the elevation of the hands, in this place and others, means the same thing
as prayer; and it has been usual in all ages to raise up the hands to heaven,
and the expression often occurs in the Psalms,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;192802&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
28:2;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
134:2;) and when Paul bids prayers to be made everywhere, he
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I would have men
to raise up pure hands without
contention.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Timothy 2:8.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God has no doubt suggested this practice to men, that
they may first go beyond the whole world when they seek him; and, second]y, that
they may thus stimulate themselves to entertain confidence, and also to divest
themselves of all earthly desires; for except this practice were to raise up our
minds, (as we are by nature inclined to superstition,) every one would seek God
either at his feet or by his side. Then God has planted in men this feeling,
even to raise upwards their hands, in order that they may go, as I have said,
beyond the whole world, and that having thus divested themselves of all vain
superstition, they may ascend above the heavens. This custom, I allow, is indeed
common among the unbelieving; and thus all excuse has been taken away from them.
Though, then, the unbelieving have been imbued with gross and delirious
fantasies, so as to connect God with statues and pictures, yet this habit of
raising up the hands to heaven ought to have been sufficient to confute all
their erroneous notions. But it would not be enough to seek God beyond this
world, so that no superstition should possess our minds, except our minds were
also freed from all worldly desires. For we are held entangled in our lusts, and
then we seek what pleases the flesh, and thus, for the most part, men strive, to
subject God to themselves. Then the elevation of the hands does also shew that
we are to deny ourselves, and to go forth, as it were, out of ourselves whenever
we call on God. These are briefly the things which may be said of the use of
this ceremony or practice.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must remember what I have referred to, that
the Prophet designates the thing itself by an outward sign, when he bids them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>raise up the
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"> to God. He afterwards shews the necessity
of this, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because of the soul of
thy little ones, who faint in famine</i></font><font face="Palatino">;

then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>through famine
faint</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or fail, and that openly. For it might
have happened that those who had no food pined away at home, and thus fainted
because no one gave them aid, because their want was not known. But when infants
in public places breathed out their souls through famine, hence was evident that
extreme state of despair, which the Prophet intended here to set forth by
mentioning </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>at the head of all the

<div><font face="Palatino">Here, also, Jeremiah dictates words, or a form of
prayer to the Jews. And this complaint availed to excite pity, that God had thus
afflicted, not strangers, but the people whom he had adopted. Interpreters do,
indeed, give another explanation, &#8220;See, Jehovah, To whom hast thou done
this?&#8221; that is, Has any people been ever so severely afflicted? But I do
not think that the comparison is made here, which they seek to make, but that
the people only set before God the covenant which he had made with their
fathers, as though they said, &#8220;O Lord, hadst thou thus cruelly raged
against strangers, there would have been nothing so wonderful; but since we are
thine heritage, and the blessed seed of Abraham, since thou hast been pleased to
choose us as thy peculiar people, what can this mean, that, thou treatest us
with so much severity?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, perceive the real meaning of the
Prophet, when, in the person of the people, he speaks thus,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>See, and look on, Jehovah, to
whom thou hast done this</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for thou hast had to
do with thy children: not that the Jews could allege any worthiness; but the
gratuitous election of God must have been abundantly sufficient to draw forth
mercy. Nor do the faithful here simply ask God to see, but they add another
word, <i>Look on</i>. By the two words they more fully express the indignity of
what had happened, as though they said, that it was like a prodigy that
God&#8217;s people should be so severely afflicted, who had been chosen by him:
<i>see</i>, then, <i>to whom thou hast done this</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this mode of praying was very common, as we find
it said in the Psalms,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Pour forth thy

Prophet.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;241025&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
10:25.) The sum of what is said is, that there was a just reason why God should
turn to mercy, and be thus reconciled to his people, because he had not to do
with aliens, but with his own family, whom he had been pleased to adopt. But the
rest I shall defer until tomorrow.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as thy Church
at this day is oppressed with many evils, we may learn to raise up not only our
eyes and our hands to thee, but also our hearts, and that we may so fix our
attention on thee as to look for salvation from thee alone; and that though
despair may overwhelm us on earth, yet the hope of thy goodness may ever shine
on us from heaven, and that, relying on the Mediator whom thou hast given us, we
may not hesitate to cry continually to thee, until we really find by experience
that our prayers have not been ill vain, when thou, pitying thy Church, hast
extended thy hand, and given us cause to rejoice, and hast turned our mourning
into joy, through Christ our Lord. &#8212; Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE
EIGHTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We explained yesterday the complaint of the Prophet,
when he set before God his own covenant. For it might have appeared unreasonable
that God should deal with so much severity with the Church which he had adopted.
Hence the Prophet said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>See,
Jehovah, to whom thou hast done this</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He now
mentions some things calculated to produce horror, and thus to obtain pardon
from God, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Should women eat their
own fruit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> that is, their own foetus,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the infants of
nursings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> This, as I have said, was a
horrible thing: for we see that mothers often forget their own life in their
concern for the safety of their infants. That a child, then, should be devoured
by its mother, was a most abominable thing; and yet we know that it was done. It
hence appears, that; the Israelites, when blinded by God, had fallen into this
barbarity: for it happened in the siege of Samaria, as sacred history declares;
and the Prophet now mentions the same thing as having taken place in his time,
and he repeats the same in the fourth chapter. And Josephus also says, that when
the city was besieged by Titus, the state of things was such, that mothers
agreed to eat their own children, and that they cast lots who should first slay
their child, and that they stole a leg or an arm from one another. Though it was
so inhuman a thing, yet the Prophet seeks to turn God to mercy by adducing so
great; an enormity. He then says, that it was by no means right, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mothers should eat their own
children, the children of nursings</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or
nurturings.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">F50</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Should the priest and the prophet
be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i>
This was another indignity, by which he sought to lead God to shew mercy. We
indeed know that the priests and the prophets were deemed sacred; and in the
Psalms, where Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are referred to, God, in order to shew
how much they were to be regarded, says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Touch not my
Christ&#8217;s, and to my prophets do no
harm.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19A515&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
105:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, the priests and the prophets were
especially under the protection of God, what is here said was an intolerable
atrocity. But when the profanation of the Temple was added, it was still a
greater prodigy. Jeremiah then complains, not only that the priests and the
prophets were slain, but that they were slain in the sanctuary. It now follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">Here he relates in the person of the Church another
calamity, that the young and the aged were lying prostrate in the streets; and
he joins children to the old men, to shew that there was no difference as to
age. Then he says that dead bodies were lying promiscuously in public places. He
adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>virgins</i></font><font face="Palatino">

clause, for there is nothing new said here, but only the manner is shewn by
which they had been slain; for slain by the sword had been the young men and
young women without any distinction; the enemies at the same time had not spared
the old, while they killed the very flower of the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet at the same time shews that all this
was to be ascribed to God, not. that the Jews might expostulate with him, but
that they might cease vainly to lament their calamities, and in order that they
might on the contrary turn to God. Hence he does not say that the young and the
old had been slain by the enemies, but by God himself. But it was difficult to
convince the Jews of this, for they were so filled with rage against their
enemies, that they could not turn their thoughts to the consideration of
God&#8217;s judgments. This, then, is the reason why the Prophet makes God the
author of all their calamities;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hast slain in the day of
thy wrath; thou hast killed and not spared</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And
though the people seem here in a manner to contend with God, we must yet bear in
mind the design of the Prophet, even to teach the people to look to God himself,
so that they might know that they had to do with him. For there ought to be a
passing from one truth to another, so that men, conscious of their sins, should
first give glory to God, and then humbly deprecate the wrath which they have
deserved. It follows at length, &#8212;</font><br></div>

referred to, that though enemies terrified the Jews, yet this was to be ascribed

<div><font face="Palatino">The word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrb[</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>obere</i>, properly means assault, passing over limits; but what is peculiar
to man is often in Scripture ascribed to God. Here also he changes the person,
for he spoke before of the people under the person of a woman, as it is often
done; but now the Prophet himself comes before us. At the same time there is no
doubt but that by his own example he exhorted all others to lamentation, which
was to be connected with true repentance. And this chapter, as we shall see, is
full of rich instruction, for it contains remarkable sentiments which we shall
consider in their proper places.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some think that this Lamentation was written by
Jeremiah when he was cast into prison; but this opinion seems not probable to
me; and the contents of the chapter sufficiently shew that this ode was composed
to set forth the common calamity of the whole people. Jeremiah, then, does not
here plead his own private cause, but shews to his own nation what remedy there
was for them in such a state of despair, even to have an immediate recourse to
God, and on the one hand to consider their sins, and on the other to look to the
mercy of God, so that they might entertain hope, and exercise themselves in
prayer. All these things we shall see in their due order.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet then says that he was an
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>afflicted
man</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or a man who saw affliction. This mode of
speaking, we know, is common in Scripture &#8212; to see affliction &#8212; to
see good and evil &#8212; to see life and death. He then says that he had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>experienced</i></font><font face="Palatino">
many afflictions, and not only so, but that he had been given up as it were to
miseries, &#8212; how? </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by the rod
of his fury</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He does not mention the name of
God, but Jeremiah speaks of him as of one well known, using only a pronoun. Now,
then, at the very beginning, he acknowledges that whatever he suffered had been
inflicted by God&#8217;s hand. And as all the godly ought to be convinced of
this, that God is never angry without just reasons, there is included in the
word <i>wrath</i> a brief confession, especially when it is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by the
rod</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or staff. In short, the Prophet says that
he was very miserable, and he also expresses the cause, for he had been severely
chastised by an angry God.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The letters of the alphabet are tripled in this
chapter, which I had omitted to mention. In the first two chapters each verse
begins with the successive letters of the alphabet, except that in the last
chapter there is one instance of inversion, for Jeremiah has put

<i>phi</i>, before
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[</font><font face="Palatino">,

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms here the last verse, for lie shews the
cause or the manner of his afflictions, for he had been led into darkness and
not into light. This kind of contrast has not :The same force in other languages
as it has in Hebrew. But when the Hebrews said that they were in darkness and
not in the light, they amplified that obscurity, as though they had said that
there was not even a spark of light in that darkness, it being so thick and
obscure. This is what the Prophet now means. And we know what is everywhere
understood in Scripture by darkness, even every kind of Lamentation: for the
appearance of light exhilarates us, yea, the serenity of heaven cheers and
revives the minds of men. Then darkness signifies all sorts of adversities and
the sorrow which proceeds from them. He afterwards adds,

distresses except that God was their enemy &#8212; and this was true; for God
had often exhorted them to repentance; but upon those whom he had found

Prophet&#8217;s meaning, as the dead of ages. The word

decayed, and whose memory has become nearly extinct. For as long as the dead
body retains its form, it seems more like a living being; but when it is reduced
to ashes, when no bone appears, when the whole skin and nerves and blood have
perished, and no likeness to man remains, there can then be no hope of life. The
Scripture then calls those the dead of ages, who have wholly decayed. So also in
this place the Prophet says, that he dwelt in darkness, into which he had been
cast by God&#8217;s hand, and that he dwelt there as though he had been long
dead, and his body had become now putrid.</font><br></div>

reason why he defers and delays his aid.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is no wonder, then, that God did not hear the
prayers of his servant, that is, according to the judgment of the flesh. For God
never rejects his own, nor is he deaf to their prayers and their sighs; but the
faithful often speak according to what the flesh judges. As, then, the Prophet
found that he obtained nothing by prayer, he says that his prayer was shut out,
or that the door was closed against him, so that his prayer did not come to
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, this passage is worthy of special notice; for
except God immediately meets us, we become languid, and not only our ardor in
prayer is cooled but almost extinguished. Let us, then, bear in mind, theft
though God may not help us soon, yet our prayers are never repudiated by him;
and since we see that the holy fathers experienced the same thing, let us not
wonder, if the Lord at this day were to try our faith in the same manner. Let
us, therefore, persevere hi calling on Him; and should there be a longer delay,

<div><font face="Palatino">Other metaphors are used. Some think that the Prophet
refers to the siege of Jerusalem, but such a view is not suitable. The metaphors
correspond with one another, though they are somewhat different. He had said
before, that he was enclosed by God, or surrounded as with a mound; and now he
transfers this idea to his ways. When the life of man is spoken of, it is, we
know, compared to a way. Then the Prophet includes under this word all the
doings of his life, as though he had said, that all his plans were brought into
straits, as though his way was shut up, so that he could not proceed:
&#8220;Were I to proceed ill any direction, an obstacle is set before me; I am
compelled to remain as it were fixed.&#8221; So the Prophet now says, his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ways were
enclosed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> because God allowed none of
His counsels or His purposes to be carried into effect.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And to the same purpose he adds, that. God had
perverted his ways, that is, that he had confounded all his doings, and all his
counsels.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But these words are added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with a squared
stone</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">zzg</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>gizaz</i>, means to cut; hence the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tyzg</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
gizit</i>, signifies a polished stone, or one trimmed by the hammer. And we know
that such stones are more durable and firmer than other stones. For when
unpolished stones are used, the building is not so strong as when the stones are
squared, as they fit together better. Then the Prophet intimates that the
enclosures were such that he could by no means break through them, as they could
not be broken. he, in short, means that he was so oppressed by God&#8217;s hand,
that whatever he purposed God immediately reversed it. We now, then, perceive
what he means by saying, that all his ways were subverted or overturned by God. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F54</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This is
not to be understood generally, for it is God who directs our ways. But he is
said to pervert our ways, when he disconcerts our counsels, when all our
purposes and efforts are rendered void; in a word, when God as it were meets us
as an adversary, and impedes our course; it is then that he is said to pervert
our ways. But this ought not to be understood as though God blinded men
unjustly, or as though he led them astray. The Prophet only means that he could
find no success in all his counsels, in all his efforts and doings, because he
had God opposed to him. here I stop.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Harsh is the complaint when Jeremiah compares God to
a. bear and a lion. But we have said that the apprehension of God&#8217;s wrath
so terrified the faithful, that they could not sufficiently express the atrocity
of their calamity; and then borne in mind must also be what we have stated, that
they spoke according to the judgment of the flesh; for they did not always so
moderate their feelings, but that something fell from them worthy of blame. We
ought not, then, to make as a rule in religion all the complaints of holy men,
when they were pressed down by the hand of God; for when their minds were in a
state of confusion, they uttered much that was intemperate. But we ought, on the
other hand, to acknowledge how great must be our weakness, since we see that
even the strongest; have thus fallen, when God exercised severity towards
them.</font><br></div>

for travelers, or as lions in their dens; yet, if we consider how much the
faithful dreaded the tokens of God&#8217;s wrath, we shall not wonder at this
excess. It is then certain that rite Prophet brings before us here not only
evidences of the fear of God, of religion and humility, but also of the corrupt
feelings of the flesh; for it cannot be, but that the infirmity of men will
betray itself ill extreme evils. He adds, what is of the same import,

anything, a way is open to us; but when there is no success, our way is said to
be perverted. And this is done by God, who has all events, prosperous as well as
adverse, in his own hand. As, then, God directs our ways when he blesses our
counsels and our actions; so, on the other hand, he perverts them, when all
things turn out unsuccessfully, when our purpose is not done and events do not

the other two things; for he who is reduced to desolation, does not hold on his

evils, for there was no hope of deliverance left. He adds,

against them all his arrows. It is, indeed, a fearful thing when God aims at us,
that he may discharge his darts and arrows in order to hit and wound us. But as
God had so grievously afflicted his people, that he seemed to have poured forth
all his vengeance, the Prophet justly complains that the people had been like

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet again complains of the reproaches to
which God had exposed the Jews. We have said that of all evils the most grievous
is reproach, and experience teaches us that sorrow is greatly embittered when
scoffs and taunts are added to it; for he who silently bears the most grievous
sorrows, becomes broken in heart when he finds himself contumeliously treated.
This, then, is the reason why the Prophet again amplifies the miseries of the
people, because they were exposed to the scoffs of all men. But it may seem a
strange thing that the Jews were derided by their own people. This is the reason
why some think that the Prophet complains of his own private evils, and that he
does not represent the whole people or the public condition of the Church. But
it may also be said in reply, that the Prophet does not mean that the people
were derided by themselves, which could not be; but it is the same as though he
had said, that their state was so disgraceful, that while they looked on one
another, they had a reason for taunting, if this their condition was allowed to
continue.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, the Prophet does not mean what. was
actually done, but he simply complains that their calamity was liable to all
kinds of reproaches, so that any one looking on Jerusalem might justly deride
such a disgraceful spectacle. And it was, as we have said, a most equitable
reward, for they had not ceased to reproach God. Then rendered to them was what
they had deserved, when God loaded them in turn with dishonor.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We hence also gather that the faithful were not free
from sorrow in their evils, for bitterness and gall sufficiently shew that their
minds were so disturbed that they did not bear their troubles with sufficient
patience. But they struggled with their own infirmity, and the example is set
before us that we may not despond when bitterness and gall lay hold on our
minds; for since the same thing happened to the best servants of God, let us
bear in mind our own infirmity, and at the same time flee to God. The
unbelieving nourish their bitterness, for they do not unburden their souls into
the bosom of God. But the best way of comfort is, when we do not flatter
ourselves in our bitterness and grief, but seek the purifying of our souls, and
in a manner lay them open, so that whatever bitter thing may be there, God may
take it away and so feed us, as it is said elsewhere, with the sweetness of his

<div><font face="Palatino">Many renderings are given of these words&#8217; there
is, however, no over-statement here; for, as it has been often said, the grief
of the people under such a mass of evils could not be sufficiently expressed.
The Prophet, no doubt, extended here his hand to the weak, who would have
otherwise lain down as dead; for under such evils the ruin of the whole nation,
the fall of the city, and the destruction of the temple, it could not be but
such thoughts as these must have occurred. Now, as to any one unacquainted with
such a trial, he would soon succumb, had no remedy been presented to him. The
Prophet then dictates for all the godly such complaints as they might, so to
speak, pour forth confidently and freely into the bosom of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that here is even expressed whatever
might occur to the minds of God&#8217;s children, so that they might not
hesitate in their straits to direct their prayers to God, and freely confess
whatever they suffered in their souls. For shame closes up the door of access;
and thus it happens; that we make a clamor as though God were far away from us;
hence impatience breaks out almost to a rage. But when an access to God is
opened to us, and we dare to confess what burdens our minds, this, as I have
said, is the best way for obtaining relief and comfort. We must then understand
the design of the Prophet, that he suggests words to the faithful, that they
might freely cast their cares and sorrows on God, and thus find some
alleviation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For this reason, he says that his teeth had been
broken by a little stone or pebble. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F56</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The same
expression, if I mistake not, is found in Job. It is a metaphor taken from those
who press stones instead of bread under their teeth; for when grit lies hid in
bread, it hurts the teeth. Then inward and hidden griefs are said to be like
small stones, which break or shatter the teeth. For the Prophet does not speak
here of large stones, but on the contrary he speaks of pebbles or small stones,
which deceive men, for they lie hid either in bread or in meat, or in any other
kind of food. As, then, the teeth are hurt by pressing them, so the Prophet says
that his sorrows were most bitter, as that part, as it is well known, is very
tender; and when any injury is done to the teeth, the pain spreads instantly
almost through the whole body. This is the reason why he says that his teeth
were broken.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds, that he was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>covered with
dust</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or that he was lying down or
dragged along in the dust. The expression is taken from those who are drawn by
way of reproach along the ground, as a carcass is, or some filthy thing which we
abhor.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">F57</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

good</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> and this forgetfulness ought to be
understood, so to speak, as real or entire; for if there had been any reason for
rejoicing, it would not have been forgotten; for all are naturally pleased with
what is pleasant, nay, they with avidity seek what delights them. It would then
be contrary to nature to forget things good and pleasant, to us. But the Prophet
means here a privation. Hence the forgetfulness of which he speaks is nothing
else but alienation from everything good, as though he had said (as the previous
clause shews) that he was removed from every hope of peace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the expression is much more emphatical, when he

peace, and no hope appears to me.&#8221; Hence it was, that all the faculties of
his soul were far removed from all experience of good things. It follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse shews what I have before reminded you of,
that the Prophet does not here speak as though he was divested of every sin, and
prescribed a perfect rule for prayer. But, on the contrary, in order to animate
the faithful to seek God, he sets before them here an instance of infirmity
which every one finds true as to himself. It was yet a most grievous trial,
because the Prophet almost despaired; for since faith is the mother of hope, it
follows, that when any one is overwhelmed with despair, faith is extinct.
Nevertheless the Prophet. makes this declaration,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Perished</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he says,<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has my strength
and my hope from God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F58</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He does not speak through some inconsiderate impulse,
as though he was suddenly carried away, as many things happen to us which we
have had no thought of; but he speaks what was, as it were, fixed in his mind.
As he said, &#8220;Perished has my hope and strength from Jehovah,&#8221; it is
evident that his faith was not slightly shaken, but had wholly failed&#8217; but
the expression,<i> I said,</i> renders the thing still stronger; for it means,
as it is well known, a settled conviction. The Prophet was then fully persuaded
that he was forsaken by God; but what does this mean? We ought indeed to
maintain this, that faith sometimes is so stifled, that even the children of God
think that they are lost, and that it is all over with their salvation. Even
David confesses the same thing; for it was an evidence of despair, when he
declared,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I said in my
haste, Vanity is every man.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19B611&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
116:11.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He had almost failed, and he was not master of
himself when he was thus agitated. There is no doubt but that the Prophet also
expressly reminded the faithful that they ought not to despair, though despair
laid hold on their minds, or though the devil tempted them to despair, but that
they ought then especially to struggle against it. This is indeed, I allow, a
hard and perilous contest, but the faithful ought not to faint, even when such a
thing happens to them, that is, when it seems to be all over with them and no
hope remains; but, on the contrary, they ought nevertheless to go on hoping, and
that, indeed, as the Scripture says elsewhere, against hope, or above hope.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450418&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:18.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then learn from this passage, that the
faithful are not free from despair, for it enters into their souls; but that
there is yet no reason why they should indulge despair; on the contrary, they
ought courageously and firmly to resist it; for when the Prophet said this, he
did not mean that. he succumbed to this trial, as though he had embraced what
had come to his mind; but lie meant, that lie was as it were overwhelmed for a
short time. Were any one to ask, How can it be that hope and despair should
reside in the same man? the answer is, that when faith is weak, that part of the
soul is empty, which admits despair. Now, faith is sometimes not only enfeebled,
but is also nearly stifled. This, indeed, does not happen daily, but there is no
one whom God deeply exercises with temptations, who does not feel that his faith
is almost extinguished. It is often no wonder, that despair then prevails; but
it is for a moment. In the meantime, the remedy is, immediately to flee to God
and to complain of this misery, so that he may succor and raise up those who are
thus fallen. He then adds, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The verb may be considered as an imperative; it is an
infinitive mood, but it is often taken in Hebrew as an imperative. Thus, many
deem it a prayer, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Remember my
affliction and my trouble, the gall and the
poison</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This might be admitted; but what
others teach I prefer: that this verse depends on the last. For the Prophet
seems here to express how he had almost fallen away from hope, so that he no
longer found strength from God, even because he was overwhelmed with evils; for
it is very unreasonable to think, that those who have once experienced the mercy
of God should cast away hope, so as not to believe that they are to flee to God
any more. What seems then by no means congruous the Prophet here in a manner
excuses, and shews that it was not strange that he succumbed under extreme
evils, for he had been so pressed down by afflictions and troubles, that his
soul became as it were filled with poison and gall. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F59</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But in the meantime, he shews by the word
<i>remember,</i> how such a trial as this, when it comes, lays hold on our
minds, that is, when we think too much of our evils. For the faithful ought to
hold a middle course in their afflictions, lest they contract a torpor; for as
hence indifference and stupidity arise, they ought to rouse themselves to a due
consideration of their evils; but moderation ought to be observed, lest sorrow
should swallow us up, as Paul also warns us
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:7.) They then who fix their minds too much on the remembrance of
their evils, by degrees open the door to Satan, who may fill their hearts and
all their thoughts with despair. The Prophet then describes here the fountain of
evils, when he says, that he remembered his affliction and trouble; and suitable
to this is what immediately follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet seems in other words to confirm what he
had said, even that the memory of afflictions overwhelmed his soul. For the soul
is said to be humbled in or upon man, when he lies down under the burden of
despair. It is the soul that raises man up, and as it were revives him; but when
the soul is cast as it were on man, it is a most grievous thing; for it is
better to lie down a dead body than to have this additional burden, which makes
the case still worse. A dead body might indeed lie on the ground without
strength and motion, but it may still retain its own place; but when the soul is
thus cast down, it is said to press down man, though lifeless, more and more.
This then is what the Prophet means. And yet he says that he was so occupied
with this remembrance, that he could not thence withdraw his
mind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is no doubt but that he also intended here to
confess his own infirmity, and that of all the faithful; and the reason of this
we have already explained. Then relying on this doctrine, even when all our
thoughts press us down, and not only lead us to despair, but also hurry us on
and cast us headlong into it, let us learn to flee even then to God and to lay
before him all our complaints, and let us not be ashamed, because we see that
this mode of proceeding is suggested to us by the Holy Spirit. It follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">We see here what I have already stated, that if we
struggle against temptations, it will be a sure remedy to us, because our faith
will at length emerge again, and gather strength, yea, it will in a manner be
raised up from the lowest depths. This is what the Prophet now shews.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will recall
this</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to my heart, and therefore will I
hope</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>How can despair produce hope from
itself? This would be contrary to nature. What then does the Prophet mean here,
and what does he understand by the pronoun <i>this,</i>
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">taz</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
zat?</i> Even that being oppressed with evils, he was almost lost, and was also
nearly persuaded that no hope of good anymore remained. As then he would recall
this to mind, he says that he would then have new ground of hope, that is, when
he had recourse to God; for all who devour their own sorrows, and do not look to
God, kindle more and more the hidden fire, which at length suddenly turns to
fury. Hence it comes that they clamor against God, as though they were doubly
insane. But he who is conscious of his own infirmity, and directs his prayer to
God, will at length find a ground of hope.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When therefore we recall to mind our evils, and also
consider how ready we are to despair, and how apt we are to succumb under it,
some hope will then arise and aid us, as the Prophet here says. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F60</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must still be observed, that we ought to take heed
lest we grow torpid in our evils; for hence it happens that our minds become
wholly overwhelmed. Whosoever then would profit by his evils, should consider
what the Prophet says here came to his mind. for he at length came to himself,
and surmounted all obstacles. We see then that God brings light out of darkness,
when he restores his faithful people from despair to a good hope; yea, he makes
infirmity itself to be the cause of hope. For whence is it that the unbelieving
east away hope? even because security draws them away from God; but a sense of
our own infirmity draws us even close to him; thus hope, contrary to nature, and
through the incomprehensible and wonderful kindness of God, arises from despair.

TENTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the last lecture the Prophet said that the
<i>mercies</i> of God are renewed daily. This must indeed be viewed according to
the apprehension of men, for to God belongs no charge. But the mercies of God
seem to be renewed when he for a time hides his face, and again becomes
reconciled to us. The Prophet mentions <i>morning;</i> and he alludes, as I
think, to this passage in the Psalms &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;If weeping dwells

God&#8217;s mercy can never come to us except he offers it to us. Were then God
to take away the promise, all the miserable would inevitably perish; for they
can never lay hold on his mercy except through his word. This, then, is the
reason why Scripture so often connects these two things together, even
God&#8217;s mercy and his faithfulness in fulfilling his promises. It now

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet intimates in this verse that we cannot
stand firm in adversities, except we be content with God alone and his favor;
for as soon as we depart from him, any adversity that may happen to us will
cause our faith to fail. It is then the only true foundation of patience and
hope to trust in God alone; and this is the case when we are persuaded that his
favor is sufficient for our perfect safety. In this sense it is that David calls
God his portion.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;191605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
16:5.) But there is in the words an implied contrast, for most men seek their
happiness apart from God. All desire to be happy, but as the thoughts of men
wander here and there, there is nothing more difficult than so to fix all our
hopes in God so as to disregard all other things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This then is the doctrine which the Prophet now
handles, when he says, that those alone could hope, that is, persevere in hope
and patience, who have so received God as their portion as to be satisfied with
him alone, and to seek nothing else besides him. But he speaks emphatically,
that his <i>soul</i> had thus <i>said.</i> Even the unbelieving are ashamed to
deny what we have stated, that the whole of our salvation and happiness is found
in God alone. Then the unbelieving also confess that God is the fountain of all
blessings, and that they ought to acquiesce in him; but with the mouth only they
confess this, while they believe nothing less. This then is the reason why the
Prophet ascribes what he says to his soul, as though he had said, that lie did
not boast, like hypocrites, that God was his portion, but that of this lie had a
thorough conviction. <i>My soul</i> has said, that is, I am fully convinced that
God is <i>my portion;</i> therefore will I hope in him. We now understand the
meaning of this passage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It remains for us to make an application of this
doctrine. That we may not then fail in adversities, let us bear in mind this
truth, that all our thoughts will ever wander and go astray, until we are fully
persuaded that God alone is sufficient for us, so that lie may become alone our
heritage. For all who are not satisfied with God alone, are immediately seized
with impatience, whenever famine oppresses them, or sword threatens them, or any
other grievous calamity. And for this reason Paul also says,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;If God be for us, who can be
against us? I am persuaded that neither famine, nor nakedness, nor sword, nor
death, nor life, can separate me from the love of God, which is in
Christ.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450831&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
8:31, 35-39.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then Paul lays hold of the paternal favor of God as a
ground of solid confidence; for the words in Christ sufficiently show that those
are mistaken interpreters who take this love passively, as though he had said,
that the faithful would never cease to love God, though he exercised them with
many afflictions. But Paul meant that the faithful ought so to fix their minds
on God alone, that whatever might happen, they would not yet cease to glory in
him. Why? because God is their life in death, their light in darkness, their
rest in war and tumult, their abundance in penury and want. It is in the same
sense our Prophet now says, when lie intimates that none hope in God but those
who build on his paternal favor alone, so that they seek nothing else but to
have him propitious to them. It afterwards follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He continues the same subject: he however adds :now
something to it, even that God always deals mercifully with his servants, who
recumb on him, mid who seek him. We hence see that the last verse is confirmed,
where he said that he was content with God alone, while suffering all kinds of
adversity: How so? for God, he says, is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good to those who wait for
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F62</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It might
have been objected and said, that adversities produce sorrow, weariness,
sadness, and anguish, so that it cannot be that they retain hope who only look
to God alone; and it is no doubt true that, when all confess that they hope in
God, they afterwards run here and there; and the consequence is, that they fail
in their adversities. As, then, this might have been objected to the Prophet, he
gives indirectly this answer, that God is good to those who wait for him, as
though he had said, that the confidence which recumbs on God alone cannot
disappoint us, for God will at length shew his kindness to all those who hope in
him. In short, the Prophet teaches us here, that the blessings of God, by which
he exhilarates his own children, cannot be separated from his mercy or his
paternal favor. Such a sentence as this, &#8220;Whatever can be expected is
found in God,&#8221; would be deemed frigid by many; for they might object and
say, as before stated, that they were at the same time miserable. Hence the
Prophet reminds us here that God&#8217;s blessings flow to us from his favor as
from a fountain, as though he had said, &#8220;As a perennial fountain sends
forth water, so also God&#8217;s goodness manifests and extends
itself.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, understand the Prophet&#8217;s meaning.
He had indeed said, that we ought to acquiesce in God alone; but now he adds, by
way of favor, regarding the infirmity of men, that God is kind and bountiful to
all those who hope in him. The sum of what he states is, as I have said, that
God&#8217;s goodness brings forth its own fruits, and that the faithful find by
experience, that nothing is better than to have all their thoughts fixed on God
alone. God&#8217;s goodness, then, ought to be understood, so to speak, as
actual, even what is really enjoyed. As, then, God deals bountifully with all
who hope in him, it follows that they cannot be disappointed, while they are
satisfied with him alone, and thus patiently submit to all adversities. In
short, the Prophet teaches here what the Scripture often declares, that hope
maketh not ashamed.

<div><font face="Palatino">But the second clause must be noticed: for the
Prophet defines what it is to hope in God, when he says that he is good to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the soul that seeks
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Many indeed imagine hope to be I know not
what &#8212; a dead speculation; and hypocrites, when God spares them, go on
securely and exult, but their confidence is mere ebriety, very different from
hope. We must then remember what the Prophet says here, that they alone hope hi
God who from the heart seek him, that is, who acknowledge how greatly they need
the mercy of God, who go directly to him whenever any temptation harasses them,
and who, when any danger threatens them, flee to his aid, and thus prove that
they really hope in God. It now follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">It is, indeed, an abrupt phrase when he says, Good
and he will wait; for these words are without a subject; but as it is a general
statement, there is no ambiguity. The Prophet means that it is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good to hope and to be silent as

future tense ought to be rendered its subjunctives, as though it was said,

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F63</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But; the Prophet here reminds us, that we are by no
means to require that God should always appear to us, and that his paternal
favor should always shine forth on our life. This is, indeed, a condition sought
for by all; for the flesh inclines us to this, and hence we shun adversities.
We, then, naturally desire God&#8217;s favor to be manifested to us; how? In
reality, so that all things may go on prosperously, that no trouble may touch
us, that we may be tormented by no anxiety, that no danger may be suspended over
us, that no calamity may threaten us: these things, as I have said, we all
naturally seek and desire. But in such a case faith would be extinguished, as
Paul tells us in his Epistle to the Romans,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;For we hope
not,&#8221; he says, &#8220;for what appears, but we hope for what, is

<div><font face="Palatino">It is necessary in this world that the faithful
should, as to outward things, be miserable, at one time exposed to want, at
another subject to various dangers &#8212; at; one time exposed to reproaches
and calumnies, at another harassed by losses: why so? because there would be no
occasion for exercising hope, were our salvation complete. This is the very
thing which the Prophet now teaches us, when he declares that it is good for us
to learn in silence to wait for the salvation of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But to express more clearly his mind, he first says,
He will wait, or hope. He teaches the need of patience, as also the Apostle
does, in Hebrew 10:36; for otherwise there can be no faith. It hence appears,
that where there is no patience, there is not even a spark of faith in the heart
of man; how so? because this is our happiness, to wait or to hope; and we hope
for what is hidden. But in the second clause he explains himself still more
clearly by saying, and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will be
silent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> To be silent means often in
Scripture to rest, to be still; and here it signifies no other thing than to
bear the troubles allotted to us, with a calm and resigned mind. He is then said
to be silent to God, who remains quiet even when afflictions supply occasion for
clamoring; and hence this quietness is opposed to violent feelings; for when
some trouble presses on us, we become turbulent, and are carried away by our
fury, at one time we quarrel with God, at another we pour forth various
complaints. The same thing also happens, when we see some danger, for we
tremble, and then we seek remedies here and there, and that with great
eagerness. But he who patiently bears his troubles, or who recumbs on God when
dangers surround him, is said to be silent or to rest quietly; and hence the
words of Isaiah, &#8220;In hope and silence;&#8221; for he there exhorts the
faithful to patience, and shews where strength is, even when we trust in God, so
as willingly to submit to His will, and to be ready to bear his chastisements,
and then when we doubt not but that he will be ready to bring us help when we
are in danger.

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse admits of two meanings; for the word yoke
may be explained as signifying teaching, or the scourges of God. We, indeed,
undertake or bear in two ways the yoke of God, even when we are taught to
receive his doctrine, or when we are resigned when he chastises us, when we are
not obstreperous, but willingly submit to his corrections. As then some take the
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lw[</font><font face="Palatino">,
for the yoke of instruction, and others for the yoke of chastisement, two
explanations, as I have said, are given; and both are admissible. It is indeed
truly said, that it is good for man to be accustomed from his youth to
God&#8217;s corrections; but Jeremiah seems rather to speak of that obedience
generally, which the faithful render to God when they submit to his will. It is
then our true happiness when we acknowledge that we are not our own, and allow
God, by his sovereign power, to rule us as he pleases. But we ought to begin
with the law of God. Hence, then, it is, that we are said to bear the yoke of
God, when we relinquish our own judgment, and become wise through God&#8217;s
word, when, with our affections surrendered and subdued, we hear what God
commands us, and receive what he commands. This, then, is what Jeremiah means by
bearing the yoke.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says, in youth. For they who have lived
unrestrained throughout their life, can hardly bear to be brought into any
order. We indeed know, that, the aged are less tractable than the young; nay,
whether we refer to the arts or to the liberal sciences, the youthful age is the
most flexible. The aged are also much slower; and added to this is another evil,
they are very obstinate, and will hardly bear to be taught the first rudiments,
being imbued with a false notion, as though they must have lived long in vain.
As, then, the disposition in the old is not easily changed, the Prophet says
that it is good for us to be formed from childhood to bear the yoke. And this is
also seen in brute animals; when a horse is allowed full liberty in the fields,
and not in due time tamed, he will hardly ever bear the curb, he will be always
refractory. The oxen, also, will never be brought to bear the yoke, if they be
put under it in the sixth or eighth year. The same is found to be the case with
men. Jeremiah, then, does not say, without reason, that it is good for every one
to be trained from his youth in the service of God; and thus he exhorts children
and youth not to wait for old age, as it is usually the case. For it has been a
common evil, in all ages, for children and youth to leave the study of wisdom to
the old. &#8220;Oh! it will be time enough for me to be wise, when I arrive at a
middle age; but some liberty must be given to childhood and youthful
days.&#8221; And for this reason, Solomon exhorts all not to wait for old age,
but duly to learn to fear God in childhood. So also our Prophet declares that it
is good for one to bear the yoke in his childhood. It then follows. &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">Here he shews the fruit of teachableness; for when
God deals severely with his children, they yet do not rebel, but even then they
willingly submit to his authority. For whence comes it that so much impatience
rages in men, except that they know not what it is to obey God, to prepare
themselves to bear the yoke? so, then, men become furious like wild beasts,
never tamed, therefore the Prophet now says, &#8220;Whosoever is thus habituated
to the yoke of God, will also be silent in extreme evils, and remain
quiet.&#8221; We now perceive what I have just said, that the fruit of docility
and obedience is set forth in this verse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But when he says that those who are thus trained to
obey God <i>will sit apart,</i> he expresses most fitly the strength and
character of patience. For they for the most part who wish to appear magnanimous
make a great display, and think that their valor is nothing except they appear
as on a theater; they allow themselves at the same time an unbridled liberty
when they are alone; for they who seem the most valorous, except God&#8217;s
fear and true religion prevail in their souls, rage against God and champ the
bridle in adversities, though they may not make a clamor before men, for, as I
have already said, they regard display. But here a very different account is
given of patience, even that we are to sit alone and be silent, that is, even
were no one present as a witness, whose presence might make us ashamed; were we
even then to sit, and to submit with calm minds to God, and to take his yoke, we
should thus prove our patience. This verse then distiguishes between the
simplicity of the godly and that will display in which they delight who seek to
obtain the praise of courage, patience, and perseverance, from the world; for
these also sit and speak words as from heaven, and as though they had put off
the flesh. He who has lost a son will say, that he had begotten a mortal: he who
is stripped of all his goods will say, &#8220;All my things I carry with
me.&#8221; Thus magnanimously do ungodly men speak, so that they seem to surpass
in fortitude and firmness all the children of God. But when they give utterance
to these swelling words, what they regard is the opinion which men may form of
them. But the faithful, what do they do? They sit apart, that is, though they
might shamelessly clamor against God, yet they are quiet and submit to his will.
We now understand what is meant by <i>sitting apart.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because he will carry it on
himself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Some take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lfn</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>nuthel,</i> in a transitive sense, &#8220;he will cast it upon him.&#8221;
But this is a forced rendering. It would be a simpler meaning, were we to say,
because he will carry or raise it on himself. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lfn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nuthel,</i> means not only to carry, but also elevate or raise up. When,
therefore, the Prophet says, that it is an example of real patience when we
carry it on ourselves, he means that we succumb not under our adversities, nor
are overwhelmed by them; for it is patience when it is not grievous to us to
undergo any burdens which God may lay on us; and on this account we are said to
regard his yoke as not grievous &#8212; how so? because it is pleasant to us.
As, then, meekness thus extenuates the heaviness of the burden, which would
otherwise overwhelm us, the Prophet says that those who raise up on themselves
all their troubles <i>sit apart.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I do not, however, know whether this passage has been
corrupted; for the expression seems not to me natural. Were we to read
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wl[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>olu</i>, his yoke, it would be more appropriate, and a reason would be given
for what goes before, that the faithful sit apart and are silent before God,
because they bear his yoke; for the pronoun may be referred to God as well as to
man. But this is only a conjecture.

<div><font face="Palatino">He continues the same subject; for he describes to us
men so subdued to obedience that they are ready to bear whatever God may lay on
them. He then says that the sitting and the silence of which he spoke, so far
prevailed, that the children of God, though in extreme evils, did not yet cease
to persevere in their obedience. For it sometimes happens that those who have
made some progress in the fear of God, give proof of their obedience and
patience in some small trial; but when they are greatly tried, then breaks forth
the impatience which they had previously checked. Then the Prophet teaches us
here, that the children of God do not sufficiently prove their patience, when
they bear with a calm mind a moderate correction, except they proceed to a
higher degree of perseverance, so as to remain quiet and resigned even when the
state of things appears hopeless.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying that the faithful
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>put their mouth in the
dust</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he means that they lie down humbly
before God and confess themselves to be as dead. The import of what is said is
this: In time of extreme affliction the wise will put his mouth in the dust,
while seeing things in such confusion that all his thoughts vanish away on
account of the atrocity of evils; and thus he intimates that the wise would have
nothing to say. To put the mouth, then, in the dust is to become mute, as though
he had said, that the faithful shut their mouth, when they do not murmur against
God nor abandon themselves to complaints, when they do not expostulate that
injury is done them, nor allege what the unbelieving usually do when God deals
severely with them. In short, to put the mouth in the dust, means to bring no
complaints, and so to check ourselves that no clamorous words proceed from our
mouth. Thus another phrase is used to set forth the silence mentioned
before.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And that the Prophet here speaks of extreme trials,
may be easily gathered from the next clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If so be that there is
hope</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> not that the faithful doubt
whether God would give them hope, for they have no doubt but that God, who
shines in darkness itself by his word, would at length by, the effect prove that
he is not unfaithful. But the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ylwa</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>auli,</i> as it is well known, expresses what is difficult; for when anything
appears to be incredible, the Hebrews say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If it may
be.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> But here, as I have said, it does not
intimate a doubt; for when the mind of a godly man fluctuates or doubts, how is
it that he puts his mouth in the dust? but the Prophet shews that those who are
taught to obey God, persevere even in extreme trials, so that while nothing but
despair appears, they yet lie down humbly before God, and patiently wait until
some hope shines forth. And here hope is to be taken for the ground or occasion
of hope.

<div><font face="Palatino">Here he mentions another fruit of patience, that the
faithful, even when injuries are done to them by the wicked, would yet be calm
and resigned. For there are many who submit to God when they perceive his hand;
as, for instance, when any one is afflicted with a disease, he knows that it is
a chastisement that proceeds from God; when pestilence happens, or famine, from
the inclemency of the weather, the hand of God appears to them; and many then
conduct themselves in a suitable manner: but when an enemy meets one, and when
injured, he instantly says, &#8220;I have now nothing to do with God, but that
wicked enemy treats me disgracefully.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is then for this reason that the Prophet shews

assailed, and not only so, but when they are dealt with reproachfully by the
wicked. This, then, he says of patience. Now follows another confirmation,

Christ thy Son shall reveal it at his coming. &#8212; Amen.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We saw in the last Lecture that the best and the only
true remedy for sorrows is, when the faithful are convinced that they are
chastised only by the paternal hand of God, and that, the end of all their evils
will be blessed. Now this they cannot of themselves assume; but God comes to
their aid, and declares that he will not be angry for ever with his children.
For this promise extends generally to the whole Church,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;For a moment I
afflicted thee, in the time of mine indignation, but with perpetual mercies will
I follow thee,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
54:7, 8 :)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and again,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I will visit their
iniquities with a rod, yet my mercy I will not take away from them&#8221; (Psalm
89 33, 84.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When therefore the faithful feel assured that their
punishment is only for a time, then they lay hold on hope, and thus receive
invaluable comfort in all their evils.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah now pursues the same subject, even that God
will </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shew compassion according to
the multitude of his mercies, though he causes sorrow to
men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This may indeed be generally explained as
to all mankind; but, as we have said, God has promised this to his own Church.
All miseries, regarded in themselves, are tokens of the wrath and curse of God;
but as all things turn out for good and for salvation to the children of God,
when they embrace this truth, that God, as the Prophet Habakkuk says, remembers
mercy in wrath,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;350302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
3:2,) so they restrain themselves and do not despond, nor are they overwhelmed
with despair. We now then understand the Prophet&#8217;s object in saying, that
though God afflicts he yet remembers mercy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must at the same time bear in mind what I have
before shewed, that the faithful are exposed to various evils, because it is
profitable for them to be chastised by God&#8217;s hand. Hence appears the
necessity of this doctrine, for were we exempt frown all adversities, this
admonition would be superfluous. But as it cannot be but that God will smite us
with his rods, not only because we deserve to be smitten, but also because it is
expedient, it is necessary to flee to this consolation which is offered to us,
even that God having afflicted us with grief will again shew us compassion, even
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to the multitude of his
mercies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He confirms the truth of what
he alleges by a reference to the very nature of God himself. Hence, that the
faithful might not debate with themselves whether God would be propitious to
them, after having inflicted on them a temporary punishment, the Prophet comes
to their aid, and sets before them the mercy of God, or rather mercies, in the
plural number; as though he had said, that it could not be that God should deny
himself, and that therefore he would be always merciful to his people; for
otherwise his mercy would be obliterated, yea, that mercy which is inseparable
from his eternal essence and divinity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And hence, when God is pleased briefly to shew what
he is, he sets forth his mercy and patience; for except his goodness and mercy
meet us, when we come to him, dread would immediately absorb all our thoughts;
but when God comes forth as if clothed and adorned with mercy, we may then
entertain hope of salvation; and though conscious of evil, yet while we recumb
on God&#8217;s mercy, we shall never lose the hope of salvation. We not:
apprehend the Prophet&#8217;s meaning. It follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This is another confirmation of the same truth, that
God takes no delight in the evils or miseries of men. It is indeed a strong mode
of speaking which the Prophet adopts, but very suitable. God, we know, puts on,
as it were, our form or manner, for he cannot be comprehended in his
inconceivable glory by human minds. Hence it is that he transfers to himself
what properly can only apply to men. God surely never acts unwillingly nor
feignedly: how then is that suitable which Jeremiah declares, &#8212; that God
does </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not afflict from his
heart?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>But God, as already said, does
here assume the character of man; for though he afflicts us with sorrow as he
pleases, yet true it is that he delights not in the miseries of men; for if a
father desires to benefit his own children, and deals kindly with them, what
ought we to think of our heavenly Father?</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Ye,&#8221; says
Christ, &#8220;who are evil,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">know
how to do good to your children,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400711&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
7:11;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">what then are we to expect from the very fountain of
goodness? As, then, parents are not willingly angry with their children, nor
handle them roughly, there is no doubt but that God never punishes men except
when he is constrained. There is, as I have said, an impropriety in the
expression, but it is enough to know, that God derives no pleasure from the
miseries of men, as profane men say, who utter such blasphemies as these, that
we are like balls with which God plays, and that we are exposed to many evils,
because God wishes to have as it were, a pleasant and delectable spectacle in
looking on the innumerable afflict, ions, and at length on the death of
men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That such thoughts, then, might not tempt us to
unbelief, the Prophet here puts a check on us, and declares that God does
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not afflict from his
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, willingly, as though he
delighted in the evils of men, as a judge, who, when he ascends his throne and
condemns the guilty to death, does not do this from his heart, because he wishes
all to be innocent, and thus to have a reason for acquitting them; but. yet he
willingly condemns the guilty, because this is his duty. So also God, when he
adopts severity towards men, he indeed does so willingly, because he is the
judge of the world; but he does not do so from the heart, because he wishes all
to be innocent &#8212; for far away from him is all fierceness and cruelty; and
as he regards men with paternal love, so also he would have them to be saved,
were they not as it were by force to drive him to rigor. And this feeling he
also expresses in Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Ah! I will take
consolation from mine
adversaries.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230124&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
1:24.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls them adversaries who so often provoked him
by their obstinacy; yet he was led unwillingly to punish their sins, and hence
he employed a particle expressive of grief, and exclaimed Ah! as a father who
wishes his son to be innocent, and yet is compelled to be severe with
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But however true this doctrine may be, taken
generally, there is yet no doubt but that the Prophet here addresses only the
faithful; and doubtless this privilege peculiarly belongs to God&#8217;s
children, as it. has been shown before. It follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Many interpreters think that these three verses are
connected with the previous doctrine, and show the connection thus, &#8212; that
God does not see, that is, does not know what it is to pervert the good cause of
a man, and to oppress the innocent; and, doubtless, God is said not to know what
iniquity is, because he abhors all evil; for what is the nature of God but the
perfection of justice? It may then be truly said, that. God knows not what it is
to turn man aside in judgment. Others take not to see, as meaning, not to
approve.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If we subscribe to the opinion of those who say that
injustice is contrary to the nature of God, there is here an exhortation to
patience; as though the Prophet had said that afflictions ought to be borne with
resignation, because the Jews had fully deserved them. For the liberty taken to
complain arises from this, that men imagine that they are without fault; but he
who is convicted dares not thus to rise up against God; for the chief thing in
humility is the acknowledgment of sin. This, then, is one meaning. But they who
give this explanation, that God does not approve of those who pervert judgment,
think that there is here a ground of consolation, because God would at length
succor the miserable who were unjustly oppressed. And doubtless it avails not a
little to encourage patience when we are persuaded that God will be an avenger,
so that he will at length help us, after having for a time suffered us to be
severely treated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But these expositions seem to me to be too remote; we
may give a correcter explanation by supposing a concession to be made, as though
the Prophet had said, &#8220;It is indeed true that the wicked take much
license, for they imagine that God is blind to all evil deeds.&#8221; For this
madness is often ascribed to the ungodly, that they think that they can sin with
impunity, because God, as they suppose, cares not for the affairs of men. They
then imagine that God is asleep, and in a manner dead, and hence they break out
into all kinds of wickedness. And for this reason it was that David so
vehemently rebuked them:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He who has formed
the ear, will he not hear? He who has created the heaven, will he not
see?&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;199409&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
94:9.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This explanation also I cannot approve of, it being
forced and not obvious.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I therefore think that the reference is to the
impious words of those who complain that God is not moved by any compassion. For
this thought almost lays hold on us wheel pressed down by adversities, &#8212;
that God has forgotten us, that he is either asleep or lies down inactive. In
short, there is nothing more difficult to be assured of than this truth, that
God governs the world by his counsel, and that nothing happens without a design.
This is indeed what almost all confess; but when a trial comes, this doctrine
vanishes, and every one is carried away by some perverted and erroneous
thoughts, even that all things roll round fortuitously through blind fate, that
men are not the objects of God&#8217;s care. Nor is there a doubt but that in
Jeremiah&#8217;s time words of this kind were flying about; and it appears
evident from the context that those Jews were reproved who thought that their
miseries were disregarded by God, and hence they clamored; for men are
necessarily carried away into a furious state of mind, when they do not believe
that they have to do with God. The Prophet, then, refers to such impious words,
or if they dared not to express in language what they thought, he refers to what
was believed almost by all, &#8212; that the wicked
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>perverted the judgment of
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>turned aside a man in his
cause,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they tore under their feet all
the bound of the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F68</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that is,
that all those things were done by the connivance of God. The plain meaning,
then, is, that judgment is perverted before the face of the Most High, &#8212;
that the bound of the earth such as are helpless, are despised, trodden under
foot by the wicked, &#8212; that a man in his cause is unjustly dealt with, and
that all this is done because </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God
does not see</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F69</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We now,
then, perceive what the Prophet means.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But whence came such madness? even because the Jews,
as I have said, would not humble themselves under the mighty hand of God; for
hypocrisy had so blinded them, that they proudly clamored against God, thinking
that they were chastised with unjust severity,. As then, they thus flattered
themselves in their sins, this expostulation arose which the Prophet mentions,
that man&#8217;s judgment was perverted, that the innocent failed in a good
cause, that the miserable were trodden under foot; and whence all this? because
God did not see, or did not regard these things. Now follows the reproof of this
delirious impiety, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, after having mentioned the blasphemy
which prevailed everywhere at that time, strongly condemns so gross a stupidity.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is
this?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he says. He checks such madness by a
sharp rebuke &#8212; for the question implies an astonishment, as though the
Prophet had said, that it was like a prodigy to find men who imagined that God
was content with his own leisure, and exercised no care over the world; for this
was to annihilate him altogether. God is not a dead being, he is not a spectre;
what then? God is the judge of the world. We hence see that it was a monstrous
thing, when men entertained the notion that God is idle or forgetful, that he
gives up the world to chance. This is the reason why the Prophet asks as of a
thing absurd and extremely disgraceful.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is
this?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he says; Could it be that men should give
themselves up to such a degree of madness? for when they said, that anything
could happen without God&#8217;s command, it was the same as if they denied his
power; for what is God without his judgment?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The other verse may be explained in two ways; but as
to the meaning, there is but little difference. It may, then, be read as a
question, &#8220;Cannot good and evil proceed from the mouth of the most
High?&#8221; or it may be rendered thus, &#8220;As though good and evil should
not proceed from the mouth of God.&#8221; As to the substance of what is said,
we see that there is no need of disputing, for the Prophet confirms what he had
said, that men are to be abhorred who imagine God to be as it were dead, and
thus rob him of his power and of his office as a judge. And, doubtless, except
we hold this truth, no true religion can exist in us; for except all the sayings
and doings of men come to an account before the tribunal of God, and also their
motives and thoughts, there will be first. no faith and, secondly, there will be
no integrity, and all prayer to God will be extinguished. For if we believe that
God does not regard what is done in the world, who will trust in him? and who
will seek help from him? besides, who will hesitate to abandon himself to
cruelty, or frauds, or plunder? Extinguished, then, is every sense of religion
by this impious opinion, that God spends his time leisurely in heaven, and
attends not to human affairs. This is the reason why the Prophet is so indignant
against those who said, that anything could be done without the command of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now see how God commands what is wrongly and
foolishly done by men. Surely he does not command the ungodly to do what is
wicked, for he would thus render them excusable; for where God&#8217;s authority
interposes, there no blame can be. But God is said to command whatever he has
decreed, according to his hidden counsel. There are, then, two kinds of
commands; one belongs to doctrine, and the other to the hidden judgments of God.
The command of doctrine, so to speak, is an evident approbation which acquits
men; for when one obeys God, it is enough that he has God as his authority,
though he were condemned by a hundred worlds. Let us, then, learn to be
attentive to the commands of doctrine, by which we ought to regulate our life,
for they make up the only true rule, from which it is not right to depart. But
God is said to command according to his secret decrees what he does not approve,
as far as men are concerned. So Shimei had a command to curse, and yet he was
not exempt from blame; for it was not his purpose to obey God; nay, he thought
that he had offended God no less than David.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;101605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 16:5, 6.) Then this distinction ought to be understood, that some things
are commanded by God, not that men may have it as a rule of action, but when God
executes his secret judgments by ways unknown to us. Thus, then, ought this
passage to be understood, even that nothing is carried on without God&#8217;s
command, that is, without his decree, and, as they say, without his
ordination.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It hence appears, that those things which seem
contingent, are yet ruled by the certain providence of God, so that nothing is
done at random. And what philosophers call accident, or contingent,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejndeco&gt;menon</font><font face="Palatino">)
is necessary as to God; for God decreed before the world was made whatever he
was to do; so that there is nothing now done in the world which is not directed
by his counsel. And true is that saying in the Psalms, that our God is in
heaven, and doeth whatsoever he pleaseth,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19B603&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
116:3;) but this would not be true, were not all things dependent on God&#8217;s
counsel. We hence see that nothing is contingent, for everything that takes
place flows from the eternal and immutable counsel of God. It. is indeed true,
that those things which take place in this or that manner, are properly and
naturally called contingencies, but what is naturally contingent, is necessary,
as far as it is directed by God; nay, what is carried on by the counsel and will
of men is necessary. Philosophers think that all things are contingent
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejndeco&gt;mena</font><font face="Palatino">)
and why? because the will of man may turn either way. They then, conclude, that
whatever men do is contingent, because he who wills may change his will. These
things are true, when we consider the will of man in itself, and the exercise of
it; but when we raise our eyes to the secret providence of God, who turns and
directs the counsels of men according to his own will, it is certain that how
much soever men may change in their purposes, yet God never
changes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then hold this doctrine, that nothing is done
except by God&#8217;s command and ordination, and, with the Holy Spirit, regard
with abhorrence those profane men who imagine that God sits idly as it were on
his watch-tower and takes no notice of what is done in the world, and that human
affairs change at random, and that men turn and change independently on any
higher power. Nothing is more diabolical than this delirious impiety; for as I
have said, it extinguishes all the acts and duties of religion; for there will
be no faith, no prayer, no patience, in short;, no religion, except we believe
and know that God exercises such care over the world, of which he is the
Creator, that nothing happens except through his certain and unchangeable
decree.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now they who object, and say that God is thus made
the author of evils, may be easily refuted; for nothing is more preposterous
than to measure the incomprehensible judgment of God by our contracted minds.
The Scripture cries aloud that the judgments of God are a great deep; it exhorts
us to reverence and sobriety, and Paul does not in vain exclaim that the ways of
God are unsearchable.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451133&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:33.) As, then, God&#8217;s judgments in their height far surpass all our
thoughts, we ought to beware of audacious presumption and curiosity; for the
more audacious a man becomes, the farther God withdraws from him. This, then, is
our wisdom, to embrace only what the Scripture teaches. Now, when it teaches us
that nothing is done except through the will of God, it does not speak
indiscriminately, as though God approved of murders, and thefts, and sorceries,
and adulteries; what then? even that God by his just and righteous counsel so
orders all things, that he still wills not iniquity and abhors all injustice.
When, therefore, adulteries, and murders, and plunders are committed, God
applies, as it were, a bridle to all those things, and how much soever the most;
wicked may indulge themselves in their vices, he still rules them; this they
themselves acknowledge; but for what end does he rule them? even that he may
punish sins with sins, as Paul teaches us, for he says that; God gives up to a
reprobate mind those who deserve such a punishment, that he gives them up to
disgraceful lusts, that he blinds more and more the despisers of his word.

since the cause of them is hid from us, our highest wisdom is modesty and

<div><font face="Palatino">Thus we see that God is not the author of evils,
though nothing happens but by his nod and through his will, &#8212; for far
different is his design from that of wicked men. Then absurd would it be to
implicate him as all associate ill the same crime, when a murderer, or a thief,
or an adulterer is condemned, &#8212; and why? because God has no participation
in thefts and adulteries; but the vices of men are in a way wonderful and
incomprehensible as his judgments. In a word, as far as the heavens are from the
earth, so great is the difference between the works of God and the deeds of men,
for the ends, as I have said, are altogether different.

he is a judge; he has often executed punishment on the wicked, as it were, in
silence; for there were no prophets among the heathens to proclaim the judgments
he brought on them. But though God does not always speak when he punishes the
wickedness of men, it is yet said that good and evil proceed from his mouth;
because he allots to men their punishment as it seems good to him; and then he
spares others or bears with them for a time. It follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">Some explain the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;nwaty</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>itaunen,</i> by giving it the sense of lying, &#8220;Why should man
lie?&#8221; others, &#8220;Why should man murmur?&#8221; But I see not what
sense there can be in rendering it lying or murmuring. Others translate thus,
&#8220;Why should man harden himself?&#8221; but it is a mere conjecture. Now,
this verb sometimes means to weary one&#8217;s self, in <i>Hithpael</i>. So in
the eleventh chapter of Numbers, &#8220;The people murmured,&#8221; as some
render the words; but I think differently; nor is there a doubt but that Moses
meant that the people were wearied, so that they in a manner pined away; and
this meaning is the most suitable here. For the Prophet had before rebuked those
who imagined that God, having relinquished the care of the world, led an
inactive and easy life in heaven; but now, in order to rouse the minds of all,
he points out the remedy for this madness, even that men should not willingly
weary themselves in their sins, but acknowledge that their wickedness is shewn
to them whenever any adversity comes upon them. And surely men would not be so
infatuated as to exclude God from the government of the world, were they to know
themselves and seriously to call to mind their own deeds and words; for God
would soon exhibit to them sure and notorious examples of his judgment. Whence
then comes it, that we are so dull and stupid in considering the works of God?
nay, that we think that God is like a spectre or an idol? even because we rot in
our sins and contract a voluntary dullness; for we champ the bit, according to
the old proverb.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, perceive why the Prophet joins this
sentence, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why does a living man

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F71</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and a man in his

own dregs, they will never acknowledge God as the judge of the world, and thus
they always go astray through their own perverse imaginations. If, then, we wish
to dissipate all the mists which prevent us from seeing God&#8217;s providence,
(that is, by the eyes of faith,) let every one be his own witness and the judge
of his own life, and carefully examine himself; it will then immediately occur
to us, that God is not without reason angry with us, and that we are afflicted
with so many adversities, because our sins will come forth before us. We here
see the cause of that madness which makes men to exclude God&#8217;s providence
from human affairs, even because they look not on themselves, but torment
themselves without any benefit and become wearied in their sins, and do not
raise up their eyes to God. The rest, connected with our subject, I must defer

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now shews more clearly what the reproof
meant which we shortly explained yesterday: he said that men act absurdly while
they weary themselves in their sins; he now adds that they would do rightly if
they inquired into their own life, and faithfully examined
themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For hence is trouble and weariness, when men feel and
deplore their outward evils, but consider not the cause, that is, when they
consider not that they are justly chastised by God&#8217;s hand. Then the
examination now mentioned is set in opposition to the torpor and weariness with
which men in vain torment themselves, and in which they pine away, because they
reflect not on their vices. Hence it is that they attain nothing but weariness
&#8212; and that is a sorrow to death, as Paul says; but sorrow to life proceeds
from the self-examination to which the Prophet now invites and exhorts
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says that the only true remedy in adversities
is when men carefully examine themselves, and consider what they deserve. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F72</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He also
mentions conversion; for they who are really touched with the fear of God do not
stop at this examination, but rise higher; for as God calls them back to the
right way, when they acknowledge that they have departed from him, they flee to
his mercy, loathe themselves on account of their vices, and seek after newness
of life. Thus our Prophet prescribes to us a certain order, &#8212; that we are
to examine our whole life, and that, being influenced by the fear of God, we are
to return to him; for while he treats us with severity, he still kindly invites
us by ever offering to sinners a free pardon. He afterwards adds,

<div><font face="Palatino">To conversion he joins prayer; for we cannot be
reconciled to God except he buries our sins; nor can repentance and faith be
separated. Moreover, to taste of God&#8217;s mercy opens to us the door of
prayer. And this ought to be carefully noticed, because the unbelieving seem at
times to be very busy in seeking to return to God&#8217;s favor, but they only
attend to the outward change of life; and at the same time they are not anxious
about pardon, but go boldly before God, as though they were not exposed to his
judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And we see under the Papacy that while they make long
sermons on repentance, they hardly ever make any account of faith, as though
repentance without faith were a restoration from death to life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence I said that we ought to notice the mode of
teaching which our Prophet adopts: he begins with self-examination, then he
requires conversion; but he does not separate it from faith. For when he exhorts
us to pray, it is the same thing as though he had set before us the judgment of
God, and had also taught us that we cannot escape death except God be propitious
to us. How then is pardon to be obtained? by prayer: and prayer, as it is well
known, must be always founded on faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By telling us to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>raise up our hearts to God
together with our hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he bids us to
banish all hypocrisy from our prayers. For all without a difference raise up
their hands to God; and nature itself, when we are pressed down with evils,
leads us to seek God. But the greater part stifle this feeling of nature. When
affliction comes, it is a common thing with all to raise up their hands to
heaven, though no one should bid them to do so; but still their hearts remain
fixed on the earth, and they come not to God. And the greater part of men are
included in that class mentioned by Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;This people come
to me with their tongue,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">but their
heart is far away.&#8221;

29:13.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, men deal thus formally with God, and
present a naked ceremony, as though God had changed and suffered his eyes to be
covered, the Prophet bids all dissimulation to cease from prayer;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let us raise up
hands,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he says, <i>to God,</i> and also
<i>hearts.</i> Joel speaks somewhat differently, when he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Rend your hearts
and not your garments,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;290213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Joel
2:13;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">for he seems to exclude the outward rite, because
men, wishing to shew that they were guilty before God, rent their garments. Joel
says that this was superfluous and useless; and doubtless the rite itself was
not so very necessary. But as prayers, when they are earnest, move the hands,
our Prophet refers to that practice as useful. At the same time he teaches us
that the chief thing ought not to be omitted, even to raise up the hearts to
God: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let
us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> then, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>raise up our hearts together with
our hands to God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to God who is in
heaven:</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for it is necessary that men
should rise up above the world, and to go out of themselves, so to speak, in
order to come to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand the meaning of the Prophet,
&#8212; that those who repent from the heart ought not to go before God, as
though they were not guilty before his tribunal, but that on the contrary they
ought to be penitent and humble, so that they may obtain pardon. He afterwards
shews that the right way of praying is, when we not only perform the outward
ceremonies, but when we open our hearts and raise them up as it were to heaven
itself. It is, then, the right way of praying, when the inward feeling
corresponds with the external posture. It follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The faithful do not here expostulate with God, but on
the contrary acknowledge that God&#8217;s severity was just. That God then had
dealt with them severely, they ascribe to their own sins, This is the substance
of what is said.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence learn that an ingenuous confession ever
accompanies repentance, as also Paul teaches us,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470711&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 7:11.) For when a sinner is either secure or tries to cover his
wickedness, and flatters himself, as we see but a few who willingly humble
themselves before God, he contracts the hardness of obstinacy. For this reason
the Prophet requires confession; nay, he suggests here the words suitable to be
used, when we desire to obtain pardon from God.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have done
wickedly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he says,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and have been
rebellious</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The pronoun, we, is here
emphatical, as though the faithful had taken on themselves the blame of all the
evils, which the greater part ever sought to disown. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F73</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here then the Prophet shews that there is no other
way of being reconciled to God, than by confessing ourselves to be the authors
of all our evils; and he also teaches us, that it is an evidence of true
repentance, when we do not allege vain pretences as it is commonly done, nor
flatter ourselves, but confess that we are guilty. He now shows that guilt ought
by no means to be extenuated, so that our confession may be real and complete:
but in this respect the world trifle with God. The most wicked are, indeed,
ashamed to deny that they are sinners; but as they are forced to make some kind
of confession, this they do lightly; and it seems an extorted confession, and is
therefore jejune, or at least not complete. But the Prophet here shews that they
who seek to be reconciled to God, ought not only in words to acknowledge and
confess their guilt, but also ingenuously to open their hearts. Hence he
connects perverseness with sin: as though he had said, &#8220;We have not sinned
simply or in one way, but we have exasperated God himself; and by sinning in
many ways and constantly, we have provoked him against us.&#8221; He says, in
short, that there is then an access open to us to obtain favor, when we do not
murmur against God nor contend with him as though he had dealt severely with us,
but when we confess that he has been hard and rigid with us, because he had a
reason to be so on account of our sins and wickedness. He adds,

<div><font face="Palatino">At the first view, this complaint may seem to proceed
from a bitter heart; for here the faithful complain that they had been slain,
and then that God had executed his judgment as it were in darkness, without any
indulgence; and the next verse confirms the same thing. But it is a simple
acknowledgment of God&#8217;s righteous vengeance for in their extreme
calamities the faithful could not declare that God dealt mercifully with them,
for they had been subjected to extreme rigor, as we have before seen. Had they
said that they had been leniently chastised, it would have been very strange,
for the temple had been burnt, the city had been demolished, the kingdom had
been overthrown, the people for the most part had been driven into exile, the
remainder had been scattered, the covenant of God had been in a manner
abolished; for it could not have been thought otherwise according to the
judgment of the flesh. Had, then, the exiles in Chaldea said that God had
smitten them leniently, would not such an extenuation have appeared very
strange? and had also the Prophet spoken in the same strain? For the causes of
sorrow were almost innumerable: every one had been robbed of his goods; then
there were many widows, many orphans; but the chief causes of sorrow were the
burning of the temple and the ruin of the kingdom. No wonder, then, that the
faithful set forth here their aggravated evils: but yet they seek out no other
cause than their own sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence they say now, that God had<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>covered them over in
wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> It is a most suitable metaphor;
as though he had said, that God had executed his vengeance in thick darkness.
For an object presented to the eye produces sympathy, and we are easily inclined
to mercy when a sad spectacle is presented to us. Hence it is, that even the
most savage enemies are sometimes softened, for they are led by their eyes to
acts of humanity. The Prophet, then, in order to set forth the horrible
vengeance of God, says that there had been a covering introduced, so that God
had punished the wicked people in an implacable manner. But as I have said, he
does not charge God with cruelty, though he says that he had covered them over
in wrath.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">F74</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast pursued us and killed
us, and hast not spared</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> They intimate,
in short, that God had been a severe judge; but they at the same time turned to
themselves and sought there the cause, even that they might not, by their own
hardness, provoke God against themselves, as hypocrites are wont to do. And the
consciousness of evil leads us also to repentance; for whence is it that men
grow torpid in their sins, except that they flatter themselves? When, therefore,
God suspends his judgments, or when he moderates them, and does not punish men
as they deserve, then, if there be any repentance, it is yet frigid, and soon
vanishes. This, then, is the reason why God inflicts deadly strokes, because we
feel not his hand except the stroke be as it were deadly. As, then, simple
chastisement is not sufficient to lead us to repentance, the Prophet introduces
the faithful as speaking thus, &#8220;Behold, thou hast in wrath covered us
over, so as not to look on us,&#8221; so that there might be no opportunity for
mercy, that is, that they might be the judges of themselves, and conclude from
the atrocity of their punishment how grievously they must have provoked the
wrath of God. It follows in the same sense, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet confirms the same thing, but the words
are different. He again repeats the word to cover; but, that the metaphor might
be clearer and more fully explained, he says, <i>with a cloud.</i> He simply
intimates, that a cloud interposed, that God might more unrestrainedly punish
the Jews, as they had deserved. Isaiah speaks somewhat otherwise, but for the
same purpose:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The hand of God,&#8221; he says,

thing as our Prophet, even that God&#8217;s nature never changes; and,
therefore, that when he seems to rage against his people, the cause ought to be
ascribed to their sins, because God ever remains like himself. We know what is
said in the Psalms,</font><br></div>

chapter, as we have seen; for there the Prophet said, in the name of the whole

not because God had changed his purpose, but because the people had, in a
manner, rejected his favor.<i> Thou hast,</i> then, he says, covered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thyself with a
cloud</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, thou hast made for
thyself a covering, that prayer may not pass through. This seems, indeed, very
strange, because God advances to meet all the miserable, and promises to hear
their prayers: what, then, can this mean, that a cloud interposed that prayer
might not go through to him? even that the Jews did not pray aright, and that
they had closed up against themselves every access by which God could admit
them. In short, the faithful do not here contend with God, as though they had
been deceived by his promises, but confess that they were unworthy to pray to
God, and they also acknowledge that they did not pray aright. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F75</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And
according to this sense they say, that they were hindered, as though a cloud
interposed, so that their prayer could not ascend to God. It follows,

water, as it is well known, descends when it flows. And there is a change of

deeply affected them, as it ought to have done, there would have been no serious

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here makes a distinction between his
weeping and that blind sorrow by which the unbelieving are affected and
violently agitated: they have no regard to God. Then the Prophet says here that
he not only wept, but that he also prayed and waited for God to put an end to
evils. As I have already said, the unbelieving grieve abundantly in adversities,
nay, they abandon themselves to sorrow; but they turn away wholly from God, and
are like wild beasts. Then the Prophet points out the right way to mourn: our
eyes must flow down to weariness and without rest, but at the same time we must
wait until God be propitious to us. Therefore this verse connects well with the
former,  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">F77</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>until Jehovah look down and see
from heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for otherwise tears would
draw us to despair, and despair would become the cause of fury; for we see that
the ungodly murmur against God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus, then, ought we to weep, in order that we may at
the same time cherish hope while we wait for God to look down on us and to see
our miseries from heaven. The word <i>heaven</i>, is not added uselessly,
because men in their evils, when they seek God, are filled with terror, for they
do not think that they can ascend to him: hence, then, it is, that they despond,
for they imagine that God is too remote from them. The Prophet therefore
anticipates here this false notion, and says that we ought nevertheless to wait
until God looks down from heaven; which corresponds with what is said in the
Psalms: that God is high and yet has respect to low things.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19B304&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

men, denotes a comparison, as it is also a causative. He says, then, that he was
given to grief more than all the young women. As the female sex, as it is well
known, are more tender and softer than men, the Prophet amplifies his
lamentation by this comparison, that in weeping he exceeded all the young women
of the city, so that he had almost forgotten his manhood. Had he said, the
daughters of the people, it might be explained as before, as referring either to
the cities, or to the whole people, that is, the whole community. But when he
mentions </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all the daughters of his

passage but as setting forth a comparison, that is, that he could not moderate

Jews like sparrows: and we know that there is neither prudence nor courage in
birds. He, then, means that the Jews had been destitute of all help, having been

no hope of coming out; and thus the pit was like a grave. Here, then, he means
that lie was reduced to the last extremity, because he had not only been taken

<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds a third comparison, &#8212; that he had
been overwhelmed, as it were, with a flood of evils. This similitude occurs
often in Scripture, especially in the Psalms; for when David wished to set forth
his despair, lie said that he was sunk in deep waters.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;196915&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
69:15, 16.) So also in this place the Prophet complains, that waters had flowed
over his head, so that he thought himself lost. Though, indeed, this was the
saying of a man in a hopeless state, it is yet evident from the context that the
Prophet was firm in the hope of God&#8217;s mercy. But he speaks according to
the judgment of the flesh; and we know that the faithful are as it were divided;
for as they have not put off the flesh, they must necessarily be acquainted with
adversities, be stormed by fear and feel anxieties; in short, when death hangs
over them, they must in a manner be exposed to fear. In the meantime, faith in
their hearts obtains the victory, so that they do not succumb under terrors, or
cares, or anxieties.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When, therefore, the Prophet says that in his own
judgment he was lost, he does not mean that his faith was so extinguished that
he ceased to pray to God; for in the next verse he shews that he persevered in
prayer. How, then, did he say or believe that he was lost? even, as I have
already said, according to human judgment. And we often see that the faithful
complain that they are forsaken, that God is asleep in heaven, that he has
turned away from them. All these things are to be referred to the perception of
the flesh. While, then, the faithful cast their eyes on dangers, when death
comes, they not only tremble, but fear greatly and faint also. In the meantime,
as I have said, they struggle by faith against all these temptations. So, then,
is this passage to be understood, &#8212; that the Prophet believed that he was
lost, that is, as far as he could judge by the aspect of things at that time,
for no hope appeared then to the Church. But we yet see that the Prophet did not
indulge himself in this despair; for he immediately adds,

<div><font face="Palatino">We certainly see that the Prophet had an inward
conflict, which also all the faithful experience, for the spirit fights against
the flesh, as Paul teaches us.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480517&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
5:17.) Though, then, he on the one hand apprehended death, he yet ceased not to
flee to God; for faith strengthened his mind so that he did not succumb, but on
the contrary he firmly rejected the temptation presented to him. Though, then,
he was, according to the flesh, persuaded as to his own ruin, he:. on the other
hand, called on the name of God; for the faithful do not measure the power and
grace of God by their own thoughts, but give glory to God by recumbing on him
even in the greatest extremities.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this passage ought to be carefully noticed; for
when Satan cannot in any other way turn us aside from prayer, he alleges our
weakness; &#8220;What meanest thou, miserable being? will God hear thee? for
what canst thou do? thou tremblest, thou art anxious, nay, thou despairest; and
yet thou thinkest that God will be propitious to thee.&#8221; Whenever,
therefore, Satan tries to shut the door against us so as to prevent us to pray,
let this example of the Prophet come to our minds; for he, though he thought
himself lost, did not yet cast aside the confidence he entertained as to
God&#8217;s help and aid. For whence arose his perseverance, except that he in a
manner rebuked himself when he found himself so overwhelmed, and as it were
dead. These two states of mind are seen in this short prayer of
David,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;My God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken
me?&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;192201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
22:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For when he addressed God, and called him his God, we
see his rare and extraordinary faith; and when he complains that he was
forsaken, we see how, through the infirmity of the flesh, he thought that it was
all over with him as to his salvation. Such a conflict, then, is described here;
but faith overcame and gained the victory, for the Prophet ceased not to cry to
God, even from <i>the pit of depths</i> &#8212; from the pit, that is, from
death itself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this also ought to be carefully observed; for
when God bears us on his wings, or when he carries us in his bosom, it is easy
to pray; but when we seem to be cast into the deepest gulfs, if we thence cry to
him, it is a real and certain proof of faith and hope. As such passages often
occur in the Psalms, they may be compared together; but I touch but slightly on
the subject, for it is not my object to heap together all the quotations which
are appropriate; it is enough to present the real meaning of the Prophet. It

the same as though he said, that he had so prayed that God became a witness of
his earnestness and solicitude; for many boast in high terms of their
earnestness and fervor and constancy in prayer, but their boastings are all
empty and vain. But the Prophet summons God as a witness of his crying, as
though he had said that he was not so overwhelmed by his adversity, but that he
always fled to God.</font><br></div>

two words mean crying; for in groaning the spirit of man dilates itself, and the
soul, compressed by grief, expands. But when we cast our cares and troubles into
the bosom of God, then the spirit forcibly emerges. This, then, is what the

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet tells us that he had experienced the
goodness of God, because he had not suffered a repulse when he prayed. And this
doctrine is especially useful to us, that is, to call to mind that we had not in
time past prayed in vain. For we may hence feel assured, that as God ever
continues like himself, he will be ever ready to help us when- ever we implore
his protection. This, then, is the reason why the Prophet declares here that he
had experienced the readiness of God to hear prayer:<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou didst come
nigh,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he says,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the day when I called on
thee; thou didst say, Fear not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> And this
approach or coming nigh refers to what was real or actually done, that God had
stretched forth his hand and helped his servants. Since, then, they had been
confirmed by such evidences, they had the privilege of ever fleeing to God. God,
indeed, supplies us with reasons for hope, when he once and again aids us; and
it is the same as though he testified that he will ever be the same as we have
once and again found him to be.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds an explanation,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou didst say, Fear
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He does not mean that God had
spoken; but, as I have said, he thus sets forth the fact, that he had not sought
God in vain, for he had relieved him. Though God may not speak, yet when we find
that our prayers are heard by him, it is the same as though he raised us up and
removed from us every fear. The sum of what is said is, that God had been
propitious to his servants whenever they cried to him. It now follows,

defender and a helper, not only in one instance, but whenever he had been in

us, we imagine that God is turned away from us; and thus our flesh tempts us to

with themselves and feel assured that God has seen them. Though, then, human
reason may say, that God does not see, but neglect and disregard his people, yet

God&#8217;s knowledge is always connected with his office as a judge. We hence

<div><font face="Palatino">He adds here a conclusion; for he has hitherto been
relating, as I have said, the evils which he suffered, and also the reproaches
and unjust oppressions, in order that; he might have God propitious to him; for
this is the way of conciliating favor when we are wrongfully dealt with; for it
cannot be but that God will sustain our cause. He indeed testifies that he is
ready to help the miserable; it is his own peculiar work to deliver captives
from prison, to illuminate the blind, to succor the miserable and the oppressed.
This is the reason, then, why the Prophet now confidently asks God to render to
his enemies </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their reward,
according to the work of their
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Were any one to object, and say, that another rule is
prescribed to us, even to pray for our enemies, even when they oppress us; the
answer is this, that the faithful, when they prayed thus, did not bring any
violent feelings of their own, but pure zeal, and rightly formed; for the
Prophet here did not pray for evil indiscriminately on all, but on the
reprobate, who were perpetually the enemies of God and of his Church. He might
then with sincerity of heart have asked God to render to them their just reward.
And whenever the saints broke forth thus against their enemies, and asked God to
become an avenger, this principle must be ever borne in mind, that they did not
indulge their own wishes, but were so guided by the Holy Spirit &#8212; that
moderation was connected with that fervid zeal to which I have referred. The
Prophet, then, as he speaks here of the Chaldeans, confidently asked God to
destroy them, as we shall again presently see. We find also in the Psalms the
same imprecations, especially on Babylon, &#8212; &#8220;Happy he who shall
render to thee what thou hast brought on us, who shall dash thy children against
a stone.&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Jeremiah, following the order of the alphabet
the fourth time, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F84</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> deplores
the ruin of the city, and the destruction of the priesthood and of the kingdom.
For they are mistaken who think that the death of Josiah is here lamented; for
there are here many things, which we shall see as we proceed, which do not suit
that event. There is no doubt but that this mournful song refers to the
destruction of the Temple and city; but when Josiah was killed, the enemy had
not come to the city, and the stones of the Temple were not then east forth into
the streets and the public roads. There are also other things which we shall
see, which did not then happen. It follows then that here is described the
terrible vengeance of God, which we have had already to
consider.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He begins by expressing his astonishment,
<i>How</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> obscured is the gold!
and the precious gold!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> for</i>
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;tk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>catam,</i> is properly the best gold, though the word
<i>good</i>,</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">
bwfh</font><font face="Palatino"> <i>ethub</i>, is added to it. We may hence
conclude that it generally denotes gold only. He mentions, then, gold twice, but
they are two different words in Hebrew,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bhz</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>zaeb,</i> and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;tk</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>catam.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F85</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now he
speaks figuratively in the former part of the verse; but there is no doubt but
that by the gold, and the finest gold, as it :is rendered, he means the splendor
of the Temple; for God had designed the Temple to be built, as it is well known,
in a very magnificent manner. Hence he calls what was ornamental in the Temple
gold.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then speaks without a figure, and says, that
the</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> stones were
thrown</i></font><font face="Palatino"> here and there in all directions. Some,
indeed, think that these words refer to the sacred vessels, of which there was a
large quantity, we know, in the Temple. But this opinion is not probable, for
the Prophet does not complain that the gold was taken away, but that it was
obscured, and changed. It is then, no doubt, a metaphorical expression. But he
afterwards explains himself when he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the stones of the sanctuary were
cast forth</i></font><font face="Palatino"> here and there along all the
streets. It was indeed a sad spectacle; for God had consecrated that temple to
himself, that he might dwell in it. When therefore the stones of the sanctuary
were thus disgracefully scattered, it must have grievously wounded the minds of
all the godly; for they saw that God&#8217;s name was thus exposed to
reproaches. Nor is there a doubt but that the Chaldeans vomited forth many
reproaches against God when they thus scattered the stones of the temple. It
hence appears, that the Prophet did not without reason exclaim, How has this
happened! for such a sight must have justly astonished all the godly, seeing as
they did the degradation of the temple connected with a reproach to God himself.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>work of the potter&#8217;s

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>precious</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>or glorious, he means the chief men and the king&#8217;s counselors and
those who were most eminent. And he seems to allude to that prophecy which we
before explained&#8217; for he had said that the people were like earthen
vessels; and he went into the house of the potter, that he might see what was
made there. When the potter made a vessel which did not please him, he remodeled
it, and then it assumed another form; then God declared that the people were in
his hand and at his will, as the clay was in the hand of the potter.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;241802&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
18:2; 19:11.) When he now says, that the chief men were stripped of all dignity,
and reduced to another form, so as to become like earthen vessels, he no doubt
sets forth by this change the judgment of God, which the Jews had for a time
disregarded.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And we must bear in mind the Prophet&#8217;s object:
he described the ruin of the Temple and city, that he might remind the people of
the punishment which had at length been inflicted; for we know that the people
had not only been deaf, but had also scoffed at and derided all prophecies and
threatenings. As, then, they had not believed the doctrine of Jeremiah, he now
shews that what he had predicted was really fulfilled, and that the people were
finding to their cost that God did not trifle with them when he had so often
threatened what at length happened. And hence we may conclude, that there was
then a superfluous splendor in garments, for we read that they had been clad or
clothed in gold; surely it was a display too sumptuous. There is, however, no
wonder, for we know that Orientals are far too much given to such
trumperies.</font><br></div>

<i>beth,</i> is well known to be feminine. He says that the daughter of the
people had come to a savage or cruel one, the latter word is masculine. Then the
Prophet seems to mean that the whelps (such is the word) of serpents are more
kindly dealt with than the Jews. Serpents are void of all humanity, yet they
nourish their brood and give them the breast,. Hence the Prophet by this
comparison amplifies the miseries of the people, that their condition was worse
than that of serpents, for the tender brood are nourished by their mothers; but
the people were without any help, so that they in vain implored the protection
of their mother and of others. &#8216;We now see the real meaning of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;g</font><font face="Palatino">,

nourish their young, it would not have been so wonderful; but so great seems to
be the savageness and barbarity of serpents, that they might be expected to east
away their brood. Now he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>even serpents draw out the
breast</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Jews say that the breasts of
serpents are covered with scales, as though they were hidden; but this is one of
their figments. It is a common phrase, taken from t common practice; for a woman
draws out the breast when she gives suck to her infant; so serpents are said to
draw out the breast when they give suck to their whelps; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yrwg</font><font face="Palatino">,

nothing but cruelty, there being no one to bring them help or to succor them in
their miseries. He, then, does not accuse the people of cruelty, that they did
not nourish their children, but on the contrary he means that they were given up
to cruel enemies  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">F87</font></sup><br></div>

wilderness. If we understand the ostrich to be intended, we know that bird to be
very stupid; for as soon as she lays an egg, she forgets and leaves it. The
comparison, then, would be suitable, were the daughter of the people said to be
cruel, because she neglected her children; but the Prophet, as I think, means,
on the contrary, that the Jews were so destitute of every help, as though they
were banished into solitary places beyond the sight of men; for birds in
solitude in vain seek the help of others. As, then, the ostrich Or the owl has
in the desert no one to bring it help, and is without its own mother, so the
Prophet intimates that there was no one to stretch forth a hand to the
distressed people to relieve their extreme miseries. It follows,

Jews with their former perverseness. He afterwards adds,

said generally that infants found nothing in their mothers&#8217; breasts, but
pined away with thirst, and also that children died through want of bread. But
he now amplifies this calamity by saying, that this not only happened to the
children of the common people, but also to those who had been brought up

their own children and devoured them as beef or mutton. There is no doubt but
that the siege, of which we have before read, drove the people to acts too
degrading to be spoken of, especially when they had become blinded through so
great a pertinacity, and had altogether hardened themselves in their madness
against God. It follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet says first,, that the punishment of his
people was heavier than that of Sodom. If any one prefers the other version, I
will not contend, for it is not unsuitable; and hence also a most useful
doctrine may be drawn, that we are to judge of the grievousness of our sins by
the greatness of our punishment for God never exceeds what is just when he takes
vengeance on the sins of men. Then his severity shews how grievously men have
sinned. Thus, Jeremiah may have reasoned from the effect to the cause, and
declared that the people had been more wicked than the Sodomitites. Nor is this
unreasonable; for if the Jews had not fallen into that great wickedness of which
the Sodomites were guilty, yet the Prophets everywhere charged them as men who
not only equaled but also surpassed the Sodomites, especially Ezekiel,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;261646&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
16:46, 47.) Isaiah also called them the people of Gomorrha, and the king&#8217;s
counselors and judges, the princes of Sodom,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:9, 10.) This mode of speaking is then common in the Prophets, and the meaning
is not unsuitable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as he dwells only on the grievousness of their
punishment, the other explanation seems more simple; for I regard not what is
plausible, but accept the true meaning. Let us then repeat the Prophet&#8217;s
words: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>greater is the punishment
of my people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;w[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>oun</i>, means punishment as well as iniquity; this is certain, beyond
dispute. Now
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tafj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chethat</i>, means also both sin and punishment. It is hence applied to
expiations; the sacrifice for sin is called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tafj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chethat</i>. As to the words, then, they designate punishment as well as sin,
the cause of it. But the reason which follows leads me to consider punishment as
intended, for he says that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sodom
was overthrown</i></font><font face="Palatino"> as in a moment. Here, doubtless,
we see that the sins of the Jews are not compared to the sins of the Sodomites,
but their destruction only: God had overthrown Sodom, as afterwards he overthrew
Jerusalem; but the ruin of Sodom was milder, for it perished in a moment &#8212;
for when God had dreadfully thundered, the Sodomites and their neighboring
citizens were immediately destroyed; and we know that the shorter the
punishment, the more tolerable it is. As the Prophet here compares the momentary
destruction of Sodom with the prolonged ruin of the city and slaughter of the
people, we see that what is spoken of is not sin, but on the contrary
God&#8217;s judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is yet no doubt but that the Prophet summoned
the Jews to God&#8217;s tribunal, that they might know that they deserved such a
vengeance, and that they might perceive that they were worse than the Sodomites.
For it was not the Prophet&#8217;s object to expostulate with God, or to charge
him with having been too rigid in destroying the city of Jerusalem. As, then,
the Prophet does not charge God either with injustice or with cruelty, it is
certain that punishment is what is here set forth, in order that the people
might know what they deserved. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F90</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the words declare nothing more than that
God&#8217;s vengeance had been severer towards the Jews than towards the
Sodomites. How so? it is evident from this reason,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because Sodom was consumed as in
a moment;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and then it is added,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and strokes remained not on
her</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>id</i>, as it is well known, means hand, a place, but sometimes,
metaphorically, a stroke. Interpreters vary here, but I shall not recite the
opinions of all, nor is it needful. Those who seem to come nearest to the words
of the Prophet, render them thus, &#8220;and hands (or forces) have not encamped
against her.&#8221; But this is a forced and far-fetched meaning. It would run
better, &#8220;have not remained.&#8221; The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lwj</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>chul</i>, means sometimes to encamp and sometimes to remain, to settle. Then
the most appropriate meaning would be<i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that strokes settled not on
the Sodomites</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> while the Jews pined away
in their manifold evils. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F91</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For they
did not immediately perish like the Sodomitites; but when God saw them so
obstinate in their wickedness, he destroyed some by famine, some by pestilence,
and some by the sword; and then the city was not immediately demolished
altogether, as it often happens when enemies make a slaughter and kill men,
women, and children; but this people were not so destroyed. Many of them were
driven into exile, and some of the common people were left to inhabit the ruined
cities, for there was dreadful desolation. The king himself, as it has before
appeared, was removed to Babylon, but his eyes had previously been pulled out,
and his children slain in his presence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that the destruction of the city was
like a slow consumption: and that thus strokes remained there as it were fixed,
which did not happen to Sodom; for Sodom suddenly perished when God thundered
against it; but the hand of God did not depart from the Jews, and the strokes or
smitings, as I have said, were fixed on them and continued. It follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet speaks of Nazarites, by whom we know
the worship of God was honored; for they, who were not content with the common
observance of the Law, consecrated themselves to God, that by their example they
might stimulate others. It was then a singular zeal in a few to consecrate
themselves, so as to become Nazarites, or separated. What this custom was may be
known from the sixth chapter of Numbers. For God, who has always repudiated all
fictitious forms of worship, prescribed to the Nazarites what he approved in
every particular. Hence Moses carefully men-honed all those things which were to
be observed by the Nazarites.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the present passage, it is enough to say, that
the Nazarites were peculiarly devoted to God&#8217;s service during the time of
their separation, for it was only a temporary service.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then the Prophet brings them forward, that it might
hence be evident how sad was the change, which he never could have made the Jews
to believe. He says that the Nazarites were purer than snow, and whiter that
milk, and also ruddier than precious stones, so that they might be corn-pared to
sapphire; for, by saying sapphire was their cutting, he means that they were
like sapphires well polished. Now we know that the Nazarites abstained from wine
and strong drink: hence abstinence might have lessened somewhat of their
ruddiness. For he who is accustomed to drink wine, if he abstains for a time, is
apt to grow pale; lie will then lose almost all his color, at least he will not
be so ruddy; nor will there appear in his face and in his members so much rigor
as when he took his ordinary support. Jeremiah, in short, teaches us flint the
blessing of God was conspicuous in the Nazarites, for he wonderfully supported
them while they were for a time abstinence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, on the contrary, he says that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nazarites were become withered,
that their skin clave to their bones</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that, in short, they were so deformed that they could not be known, not only
in obscure corners, but even in the open street, hi the middle of the
market-place. We hence learn that as the favor of God had before appeared as to
the Nazarites, so now also his vengeance might be certainly known, because they
had fallen off from their vigor, and were reduced to a degrading deformity. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F92</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet at the same time shews that worship
according to the law had in a manner deteriorated on account of the vices of the
people; and this is the design of the whole, as I reminded you at the beginning.
For there is no doubt but that he wished to rouse the Jews, that they might at
length raise up their eyes to God; for they had long grown torpid in their
vices, and had been even inflated with diabolical pride; hence was their
inveterate obstinacy. As long as the Temple stood, they thought that they
satisfied God by the sacrifices they offered. When the Prophet now tells them
that the stones of the Temple were thrown down, it hence follows that the Temple
was profaned&#8217; whence this profanation? from the wickedness of the people.
The Chaldeans, indeed, thought that they brought a great reproach on God when
they demolished the Temple; but,, as long pollution had preceded, our Prophet
now represents to the Jews their sins as in a mirror or a living form; for they
had polluted the Temple before the Chaldeans. So also he shews that the worship
according to the law was no longer pleasing to God, for they had mocked him with
empty specters; for it was only a vain display when there was no integrity
within. The Prophet then shews to them what, he could before by no means have
persuaded them to believe, that God was in no way pleased with the external
worship of the Jews, while they were audaciously violating the whole law. It
afterwards follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The beginning of the verse is without any difficulty;
for the Prophet. says that it happened better to those who immediately perished
by the sword than to others who had to struggle with famine, according to what
he had lately said, that the punishment of Sodom was more tolerable, because it.
was suddenly executed. Sudden death is the easiest And the Prophet, when
complaining that the ungodly prospered, so that the faithful sometimes envied
them, says that they die as it were in a moment, and are taken away from the
world; but he says that the faithful are held, as it were, captive by the snares
of death, and protract life in perpetual languor. For this reason the Prophet
now says that the punishment of death would have been light to the Jews. And yet
we know that. a violent death is regarded by us with horror. For he who dies on
his bed is said to yield to his fate, as he seems to pay what he owes to nature;
but, he who is slain by the sword is violently snatched away, and, as it were,
contrary to nature. Violent death, then, is always horrible. But the comparison
used by the Prophet amplifies the atrocity of their punishment, because it would
have been more desirable to have been killed at once than to remain alive to
struggle with famine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he expresses himself more clearly by saying that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they pined away, having been
pierced through by the fruits of the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>There is here some obscurity, but
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by the fruits of the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> we are no doubt to understand all
kinds of food. Some consider that &#8220;defect,&#8221; or failure, is to be
understood. But the Prophet speaks much more emphatically, even that all the
productions of the earth took vengeance on this wicked people, by refusing the
usual supply. The earth is the servant of God&#8217;s bounty and kindness; for
it is the same as though he with his hand extended food to us, when the earth
opens its bowels; so also the productions of the earth are evidences of
God&#8217;s paternal love towards us. Now, when the fruits of the earth withdraw
themselves from us, they are as it were the weapons to execute God&#8217;s
vengeance. So, then, the Prophet means that the Jews had been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pierced through by the fruits of
the earth, and thus had pined away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> as
though he had said, that they had not been pierced by the sword, but had been
wounded by famine, for the productions of the earth became, as it were, swords,
while yet they sustain, as we have said, the life of men.

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Jeremiah refers to that disgraceful and
abominable deed mentioned yesterday; for it was not only a barbarity, but a
beastly savageness, when mothers boiled their own children. That it was done is
evident from other writers; but. the Prophet is to us a sufficient witness, who
had seen it with his own eyes. He then says that the mothers were merciful, that
no one might think that they were divested of every natural feeling; but he
meant thus to set forth the blindness which proceeds from God&#8217;s dreadful
vengeance. He does not, then, praise the mothers for their clemency, as though
they felt as they ought to have done for their offspring; but. he intimates that
though they would have been otherwise humane, they were yet seized with unusual
madness, so that they boiled their own children, even their own bowels. We now,
then, perceive the meaning of the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>merciful</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
as applied to the mothers by the Prophet. It is not then to be deemed as a
praise to them, as though they had a maternal love for their children; but his
object was to set forth that monstrous act, which would not have sufficiently
touched their minds, had he not testified that the mothers of whom he speaks
were not so brutal as not to have gladly given food to their children; but that
they were supernaturally blinded by furious madness. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">He at length concludes that nothing was wanting to
complete the extreme vengeance of God; for had the Jews been chastised in an
ordinary way, they would have still extenuated their sins, as we know that they
were not easily led to repentance. Hence the Prophet, to shew that their
offenses had not been slight, but that they had been extremely wicked before
God, says that the whole of God&#8217;s wrath had been executed:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah has completed his
wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The expression is indeed harsh to
Latin ears; but the meaning is, that he had executed his extreme
judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He has poured forth the
indignation of his wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God is indeed content
with moderate punishment, provided men be awakened from their torpor; but when
he pours forth his wrath, there is no hope of repentance. It is then a sign of
final despair when God&#8217;s vengeance overflows like a deluge. But when
Jeremiah thus speaks, he does not contend with God, but rather reminds the Jews
of what they deserved, as it was stated yesterday. There is, then, no doubt but
that he argues, from the grievousness of their punishment, that there was no
reason for the Jews to flatter themselves any longer, since God had dealt so
severely with them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then, in other words, points out the same thing,
that God had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>kindled a fire which
devoured </i></font><font face="Palatino">or consumed
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the very
foundations.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Fire is wont rather to take hold
on the roofs of houses, or, when it creeps farther, it does not proceed beyond
the surface. It is a very rare thing for it to penetrate into the foundations.
Let us at the same time know that the Prophet speaks metaphorically of the
destruction of the city, for it was such as left nothing remaining. For when
some ruins remain, there is some intimation of a future restoration at least the
minds of beholders are inclined to hope that what has fallen is to be restored;
but when the buildings are not only pulled down, but also demolished from their
foundations, then the destruction seems to be without any hope of restoration.
And this is what the Prophet means when he says, that the

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms the same thing; for when a thing
incredible happens, either we are extremely stupid, or we must be moved and
affected. The Prophet, then, now says that the destruction of the city of
Jerusalem had been incredible, because God had defended it by his power; it was
also so fortified that no one believed that it could be taken, and the grandeur
of the city was known everywhere.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says that Jerusalem had been taken and
overthrown, which no one of the heathens, neither their kings nor their people,
had thought possible. It then follows that the city had been destroyed by
God&#8217;s hand rather than by the power of enemies. Nebuchadnezzar had indeed
brought a strong army, but the city was so well fortified that they thought that
all attempts would be in vain. That the city, then, was taken and demolished,
could not have been ascribed to human forces, but to a power hidden from the
eyes of men. It then follows that it was God&#8217;s work, and indeed singular.
We now, then, understand the design of the Prophet in saying that it was not
believed by kings nor people that enemies could storm Jerusalem. And in

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, as in a matter fully proved, rebukes the
Jews, that he might, as it was necessary, bring down their pride. Had he at
first condemned the wickedness of the prophets and the priests, no credit would
have been given to his word. But after he had set before them what we have
observed, and especially after he had shewn that the ruin of the city was a kind
of prodigy, what he now adds must have been certainly inferred, even that the
Jews had in so many ways and with such pertinacity provoked God, that it became
necessary that they should be wholly destroyed, as it happened.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he points out here the sins by which God&#8217;s
wrath hart been kindled against. the people. He then says that the fountain or
the origin was ill the prophets and priests. Now, we have elsewhere explained
that the fault was not removed from the people when the prophets and the priests
were thus condemned. Indeed, the common people readily exonerate themselves when
they can plead ignorance, or say that they have been deceived by their teachers
and leaders. But when Jeremiah imputes the chief part of the evils to the
prophets and priests, he does not, as I have said, devolve on them the fault of
the people, but intimates that their physicians had been as it were impostors.
For when the people corrupted themselves, the prophets were sent for this end,
to apply a remedy to their evils, and so also were the priests; for we know that
it was a duty enjoined on them to retain the people in true religion and in the
worship of God. In short, Jeremiah shows that the people had been ruined,
because corruption had begun with the prophets and the priests; or, which is the
same thing, that die sins of the people had proved fatal, because their heads or
chiefs were diseased; <i>because</i>, he
says,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> of the sin of the prophets,
and the iniquity of the priests,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
etc.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He mentions one kind of sins, that<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shed the blood of the
righteous in the midst of Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>They had no doubt led the people astray in other things, for they flattered
their vices, and gave loose reins to licentiousness; but the Prophet here fixed
on one particular sin, the most grievous; for they had not only, by their errors
and false doctrines and flatteries, led away the people from the fear of God,
but had also obstinately defended their impiety, and by force and cruelty
repressed their faithful teachers, and put to death the witnesses of God; for by
the <i>righteous</i> or just he no doubt means the prophets. For what Jerome and
others say, that blood had been shed because false teachers draw souls to
perdition, is frivolous and wholly foreign to what Jeremiah had in view; for the
word righteous cannot be applied to those miserable men who were ensnared to
their own ruin. Then Jeremiah, after having denounced the sin of the prophets
and the iniquity of the priests, mentions the savage cruelty, which was as it
were the summit of all their riches. Though, then, they had in various ways
provoked God, yet this was their extreme wickedness, that they exercised so
great a cruelty against God&#8217;s servants, that they constrained as it were
the Holy Spirit to be silent. For when the despisers of God went so far as to
give themselves up to shed innocent blood, it was a proof of a diabolical
obstinacy. We now, then, understand what the Prophet had here in
view.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this passage teaches us, that Satan has from the
beginning polluted the sanctuary of God by means even of sacred names: for the
prophetic office was honorable &#8212; so also was the sacerdotal. God had
established among his people the priesthood, which was as it were a living image
of Christ: there was then nothing more excellent than the priesthood under the
Law, if we regard the institution of God. It was also a singular blessing that
God promised that his people should never be without prophets. As, then,
prophets and priests were two eyes as it were in the Church, the devil turned
them to every kind of profanation. This example then reminds us how much we
ought to watch, lest empty titles deceive us, which are nothing but masks or
specters. When we hear the name of Church and of pastors, we ought reverently to
regard the office as well as the order which has proceeded from God, provided we
are not content with naked titles, but examine whether the reality also
corresponds. Thus we see that the whole world has for many ages degenerated from
true religion; under what pretext? even this, &#8212; that those who led astray
miserable souls, boasted that they were the vicars of Christ, the successors of
the apostles, so that they still arrogantly boast of these titles, and are
inflated with them. But we see what happened in the time of
Jeremiah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have had before similar passages; but this ought
to be carefully noticed, for it says, that prophets and priests had destroyed
the very Church of God. It was, indeed, a very grievous trial, and therefore a
powerful instrument, as it were, for subverting the faith of the simple, when
they saw that the very prophets and priests were the cause of ruin; but it
behooved the faithful constantly to persevere in their obedience to the law. And
we ought at the same time to remember what I have said, that the Prophet
enhances the wickedness of the people, because the priests and the prophets
themselves had been infected with impiety and contempt of God, and not only so,
but they had exercised tyrannical cruelty towards the servants of God. It

<div><font face="Palatino">They who simply read, that the blind had wandered,
deduce this meaning, that the blind were polluted in the streets, even because
there was filth everywhere. They, indeed, come near to the meaning of the
Prophet, but they do not clearly explain what he intended. I regard it therefore
beyond dispute, that the people are here compared to the blind, but it does not
yet appear for what purpose. But my opinion is this, that the whole city was so
full of defilement&#8217;s, that they could not avoid uncleanness; for a blind
man would touch a carcass, he would touch an unclean beast, he would touch a man
infected with some disease; how so? because he could not see to distinguish
between a dead and a living man, between the clean and unclean. Our Prophet now
compares the people to the blind, and why? because wherever they went,
uncleanness met them, so that their eyes were in a manner dazzled by thick
darkness. For when pestilence does not spread everywhere, we can avoid an
unclean place; but when there is no corner where there is not a dead corpse or
some sickness, we must pass on anyhow, having no choice to make, &#8212; and
why? because uncleanness surrounds us everywhere. So, then, the Prophet says
that the citizens of Jerusalem were everywhere polluted, as though they were
blind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows the reason, which has not been understood
by interpreters, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They were
polluted</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with blood, because they could
not but touch their garments.</i> </font><font face="Palatino">They all give
this version, &#8220;They could not touch their garments :&#8221; and as there
is much obscurity and almost absurdity in this rendering, they say that the
meaning is that they were to avoid to touch their garments, because the law
forbade them to touch the unclean. But the Prophet meant another thing. The
words are literally thus, &#8220;They could not, they will touch their garments,
that is, they will inevitably touch their garments. But the particle which I
have mentioned is to be understood, and the passage will read thus,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They could not but touch
their garments</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> and we know that the
language will bear this. And as this is consistent with the :subject which the
Prophet handles, every one, judging rightly, will readily receive what I have
stated. The meaning then is, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wandered as the blind, and were
polluted in all the streets of the city, because they could not escape
uncleanness,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> which met them everywhere; that
is, because the city, as I have said, was full of so many pollutions, that they
could not turn either here or there and avoid uncleanness.

<div><font face="Palatino">As to the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>polluted with
blood,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> they refer to the ceremonial law. There
were indeed various kinds of pollutions, but this was the chief. He accommodates
his expressions to his own age, and follows what was prescribed by the law. He,
however, alludes to the sins designated by blood. We, in short, see that the
whole of Jerusalem was so polluted with defilements, that no one could go forth
without falling on some uncleanness. A confirmation follows, which also
interpreters have not understood, &#8212;</font><br></div>

said, even that no part of the city was free from filth, because they cried
everywhere, &#8220;Depart, depart &#8212; unclean!&#8221; That what is said may
be more evident to us, we must notice that the Prophet alludes (which also has
not been perceived) to
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;031345&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
13:45. For it is said there of the lepers, whose disease was incurable, that
they were to go with rent garments, with a bare head, with covered lips, and
cry, &#8220;Unclean, unclean,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">arqy amf
amf</font><font face="Palatino"> <i>thema, thema, ikora.</i> God, then, would
have the leprous to be driven from the assembly; and hence came into use the
exclamation, Unclean, unclean,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">amf
amf</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>thema, thema.</i> But here the Prophet
says, &#8220;Depart, depart &#8212; unclean
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">amf wrws
wrws</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>suru suru thema;</i> which is
substantially the same as commanded in the law. Now the Prophet speaks
metaphorically when he says, that the city was infected with uncleanness, as
though lepers were everywhere. We hence see how all these things agree together,
&#8220;They cried, Depart ye &#8212; unclean; depart ye, depart;&#8221; that is,
no one can move a foot from his house, or go forth in public, but some
uncleanness will appear to him, so that it might be rightly exclaimed,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Unclean, depart ye,
depart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The Prophet, after having thus
spoken, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Depart ye, come not
nigh</i></font><font face="Palatino"> says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they have
fled</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is a striking allusion to the exile of
the people, as though he had said, that they were driven afar off by their
defilements. As then they were removed to a distant land, he says that this
happened through their own fault; how so? because they could no longer endure
these defilement&#8217;s of their sins; they had so contaminated the holy city,
that it was foetid through their filth. As, then, the city Jerusalem was so
polluted, the citizens, he says, at length fled away: and thus exile proceeded
from themselves, that is, the cause of exile was their filth, because they
contaminated the city. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have
fled</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and have also
wandered</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, so great was their haste,
that they kept not the right way, but turned here and there, as they usually do
who hasten with trembling. For when any one travels, and his mind composed, he
attends to the road that he may not go astray; but he who trembles, or is filled
with fear, forgets the way, and wanders from the right course. So, then, our
Prophet. now says, that the Jews
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fled</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and also
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wandered</i></font><font face="Palatino">;

which they were smitten.</font><br></div>

the Jews had no reason to complain of their exile, because they had so infected
the holy city with their vices, that they were hence driven by their own filth;
this is one thing: and, then, that so great was the mass of their evils, that
they were seized with fear; and thus they did not keep on the right way, but
turned into devious paths and met darkness; and, in the last place, he adds, as
a continuation of what he had said, that there was no hope of a
return.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He explains himself by saying, that they had been
scattered from the face of Jehovah. He had said, that they had fled into foreign
lands, and that they believed their exile to be perpetual; he now assigns the
reason that God had thus banished them. But he had promised by Moses, that
though they were dispersed through the four quarters of the world, he would yet
be propitious to them, so as to gather them when dispersed, as it is said in the
Psalms, &#8220;He will gather the dispersed of Israel.&#8221;

30:4;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19E702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
147:2.) And we know that the time of exile had been prefixed; for the Prophet
had often testified that God would at length become a deliverer to his people,
so as to stretch forth again his hand, and draw them forth from Chaldea as he
did from Egypt: how then does he say, that they had been scattered from the face
of Jehovah, and then, that they had been so rejected, that he would not favor
them hereafter with his paternal countenance? the obvious answer is this, that
the Prophet here regards only the extremely dispersed state of the people. For
though the promise of God as to their return was certain and clear, yet, when
any one cast his eyes on the state of things at that time, he could have hoped
no such thing; for the desolation, the ground of despair, was immense: no name
had remained for the people, the priesthood had been extinguished, the royal
dignity had been degraded, the city also and the Temple had been completely
overthrown. As, then, there was nothing remaining as to the nation and the
place, and also as to God&#8217;s worship, how could they do otherwise than
despond?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then the Prophet, viewing the desolation, says, that
nothing else could be concluded, but that the Jews would be perpetually exiles,
and that all the ways were closed up, to prevent them to return to their
country, and also that the eyes of God were shut, so as never to look on them.
We now, then, perceive what he means by saying, that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>scattered from the face of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">, so that he should no longer look on
them. And this mode of speaking is often found in Scripture; for, on the one
hand, it; sets before us the wrath of God, which brings death; and then on the
other, it sustains us, or when we are fallen it raises us up, by setting before
us the favor of God even in death itself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, then, considers now no other thing than
the dreadful calamity which was sufficient to sink the minds of all into the
lowest abyss of despair.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>respected not the face of the
priests, and shewed no pity to the elders.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Some think that the reason is given why God had so severely punished the
people, even because they had despised the aged and the priests; but this is a
forced view. I, then, have no doubt but that the Prophet here intimates, that
the Jews had been treated reproachfully, so that there had been no account made
of the aged, and no respect shewn to the priests. It is, indeed, true, that
Daniel was held in great repute; but he speaks here of the priests who had
impiously despised all sound doctrine; and he speaks of the aged who were in
authority when the kingdom was yet standing. He then says that they had been, as
it were, trodden under feet. He hence concludes, that, all hope of restoration
was taken away from the Jews, if they only considered their extreme calamity. He
afterwards adds, &#8212;</font><br></div>

crime, that neglecting God, and even despising his favor, they had always
attached themselves to vain and false hopes. And this was a sacrilege not to be
endured, because they thus robbed God of his rights: and what does he demand
more than that we should depend on him, and that our minds should acquiesce in
him alone? When, therefore, salvation is expected from others rather than from
God alone, he is, in a manner. reduced to nothing. The Prophet, then, accuses

while we remain alive, God is disregarded, and we seek help here and there, and
think our safety beyond all danger. The Prophet then says, that the Jews had
been inebriated with false confidence, so that they disregarded God, and in the
meantime fled to the Egyptians.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we were standing, our
eyes failed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc</i>. We have before seen
what this phrase means: the eyes are said to fail, when with unwearied
perseverance we pursue a hope to the last, as it is said in the
Psalms,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Our eyes have
failed for the living God,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;196903&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
69:3;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">that is, We have persevered, and though many trials
may have wearied us, yet we have been constant in our hope in God. So now the
Prophet says, that the eyes of the people had failed; but he adds, for a vain
help, or a help of vanity, by which term he designates the Egyptians: and there
is an implied contrast between empty and fallacious help and the help of God,
which the people rejected when they preferred the Egyptians.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Our
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>failed</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
that is, we were unwearied in hoping vainly, for we always thought that the
Egyptians would be a sufficient, defense to us. This is one
thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards
adds</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, In our looking out, we
looked out to a nation which could not save us.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He. repeats the same thing in other words. Some
consider a relative to be understood, &#8220;In our expectation with which we
have expected,&#8221; etc.; but it seems not necessary. I, then, so connect the
words of the Prophet, that the meaning is, that the Jews always turned their
eyes to Egypt, as long as they stood as a state and kingdom and thus they
willfully deceived themselves, because they took delight in their own vanity.
The other clause which follows has the same meaning,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In our expectation we expected a
nation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc.; and this clause is added
as an explanation; for the Prophet explains how their eyes failed for a vain
hope, or for a vain help, even because the people did not look to God, but only
to the Egyptians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the words, to look out and looking out, are not
unsuitable, for they refer to those vain imaginations to which the unbelieving
give heed; for God called them, but turning away from him they transferred their
hope to the Egyptians. It was, then, their own looking out or speculation, when,
through a foolish conceit, they imagined that safety would be secured to them by
the Egyptians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that they were
a</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> nation which could not
save</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and there is no doubt but that the
Prophet here puts them in mind of the many warnings which had not been received
by the Jews, for God had tried to call them back from that ruinous confidence,
but without any success; for we know how much the Prophets labored in this
respect, but they were never believed until at length experience proved how vain
was the help of Egypt, as God had testified by his servants.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Many apply this verse to the Egyptians, that they
insidiously enticed the Jews to flee to them in their difficulties. It is
indeed, true, that the Jews had been deceived by their false promises; and, as a
harlot draws to herself young men by wicked arts, so also the Jews had been
captivated by the enticements of the Egyptians. But the meaning of the Prophet
seems to be different, even this, &#8212; that the Chaldeans followed the Jews
as hunters, so that they observed their footsteps; and I connect together the
two verses, for it immediately follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here, then, the Prophet means, that the Jews were so
straitened, that there was no escape for them, because their steps were observed
by their enemies, and also because the Chaldeans had recourse to the greatest
celerity, that they might take them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then, says, first, that their enemies were like
hunters, for the Jews could not go even through the streets of their own city.
We know that they were reduced to the greatest straits; but how hard the siege
was is better expressed by this similitude, even that they dared not walk
through the city; for there is an implied comparison, as though he had said,
&#8220;We had no liberty in the very city, much less were we allowed to go out
and ramble through the open fields.&#8221; he, in the second place, adds what
corresponds with the first clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Approach did our end, fulfilled
were our days; surely come did our end</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F96</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
concludes, that no hope remained since their enemies were thus oppressing them.
He, then, infers that the end was at hand, by which he means final ruin or
destruction; and he adds, that the days were fulfilled, where, he seems to
compare the state of Jerusalem with the life of man; for he is said to have
fulfilled his day who leaves the world &#8212; for a certain time for cur
sojourn has been prefixed. God, when it pleases him, calls us to himself. Hence,
our time is then fulfilled, as our course is said to be finished; for, as the
life of man is compared in .Scripture to a race, so death is like the goal. So
now, speaking of the city, the Prophet says that its time was fulfilled, for it
was not God&#8217;s will that it should remain any longer. In the third place,
he says, that the end had come. He said before, that it was nigh, but he says
now, that it had come. he, in short, shows that God, having long spared the
Jews, when he saw that they made no end of sinning, at length had recourse to
rigor, for they had shamefully abused his forbearance; for he had long suspended
his judgment, and had often tried whether they were healable. The Prophet, then,
reproves now their obstinacy, when he says that their <i>end</i> had
<i>come</i>, and that their </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>time
was fulfilled.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards, for the same purpose, adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>swifter than eagles had been
their persecutors</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or pursuers. The Prophet, no
doubt;, continues the same subject. As, then, he had made the Chaldeans to be
like hunters, so he says now, that in flying they exceeded the eagles. It is,
indeed. a hyperbolical expression, but the Prophet could not otherwise express
the incredible celerity with which the Chaldeans hastened in pursuing the Jews.
Nor is there a doubt but that he indirectly derided the security of the foolish
people; for we know, that. whenever the prophets threatened them, this false
opinion ever prevailed, that the Chaldeans would not come, because they were far
away, the journey was long and difficult, time were many hinderances. The
Prophet, then, now taunts them for this confidence, by which they had been
deceived, when he says, that swifter titan the eagles of the heavens were their
enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He mentions the ways they adopted,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Through the mountains they
pursued, and laid in wait in the desert.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>He means that every way of escape was closed up. For when enemies come, many
hide themselves on mountains and thus escape; and others, betaking themselves to
the desert, find there some hiding-places. But the Prophet says that such was
the velocity of the Chaldeans, that the Jews in vain looked to the mountains or
to deserts, for snares were everywhere prepared, and they were present
everywhere to pursue them. Thus he confirms what he had said, that the time was
fulfilled, for the Lord kept them shut up on every side.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, though the Prophet speaks here of the ruin of
the city, yet we may gather a useful doctrine: When the hand of God is against
us, we in vain look around in all directions, for there will be no safety for us
on mountains, nor will solitude protect us in the desert. As, then, we see that
the Jews were closed up by God&#8217;s hand, so when we contend with him, we in
vain turn our eyes here and there; for, however we may for a time entertain good
hopes, yet God will surely at last disappoint us. It follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse, as I have said elsewhere, has been
ignorantly applied to Josiah, who fell in battle long before the fall of the
city. The royal dignity continued after his death; he was himself buried in the
grave of his fathers; and though the enemy was victorious, yet he did not conic
to the city. It is then absurd to apply to that king what is here properly said
of Zedekiah, the last king; for though he was wholly unlike Josiah, yet he was
one of David&#8217;s posterity, and a type of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As it was, then, God&#8217;s will that the posterity
of David should represent Christ, Zedekiah is here rightly called the Christ of
Jehovah, by which term Scripture designates all kings, and even Saul; and though
his kingdom was temporary, and soon decayed, yet he is called &#8220;the
Anointed of Jehovah;&#8221; and doubtless the anointing, which he received by
the hand of Samuel, was not altogether in vain. But David is properly called the
Anointed of Jehovah, together with his posterity. Hence he often used these
words, &#8220;Look on thy Christ.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
84:10.) And when Hannah in her song spoke of the Christ of Jehovah, she had no
doubt a regard to this idea.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;090210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 2:10.) And, at length, our Lord was called the Christ of the Lord, for so
Simeon called him.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;420226&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
2:26.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, then, we perceive that this passage cannot be
understood except of king Zedekiah. It ought at the same time to be added, that
he is called the Christ of Jehovah, because his crown was not as yet cast down,
but he still bore that diadem by which he had been adorned by God. As, then, the
throne of David still remained, Zedekiah, however unworthy he was of that honor,
was yet the Christ of Jehovah, as Manasseh was, and others who were wholly
degenerated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, however, seems to ascribe to Zedekiah
far more than he deserved, when he calls the life of the people. But this
difficulty may be easily removed; the man himself is not regarded according to
his merits, but as he was called by God, and endued with that high and singular
honor; for we know that what is here said extended to all the posterity of
David, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I have made him
the first-begotten among all the
kings</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">of the earth.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198927&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
89:27.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For though the kings of the earth obtained not their
authority, except as they were established by God&#8217;s decree, yet the king
from David&#8217;s posterity was first-begotten among them all. In short, it was
a sacerdotal, and even a sacred kingdom, because God had peculiarly dedicated
that throne to himself. This peculiarity ought then to be borne in mind, that we
may not look on the individual in himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then the passage runs consistently, when he says,
that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Messiah</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
or the anointed </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of Jehovah, had
been taken it snares</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for we know that
he was taken; and this is consistent with history. He had fled by a hidden way
into the desert, and he thought that lie had escaped from the hands of his
enemies; but he was soon seized, and brought to king Nebuchadnezzar. As, then,
he had unexpectedly fallen into the hands of his enemies, rightly does the
Prophet say metaphorically, that he was taken in their snares.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls him the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit of the
nostrils</i></font><font face="Palatino"> of the people, because the people
without their king was like a mutilated and an imperfect body. For God made
David king, and also his posterity, for this end, that the life of the people
might in a manner reside in him. As far, then, as David was the head of the
people, and so constituted by God, he was even their life. The same was the case
with all his posterity, as long as the succession continued; for the favor of
God was not extinguished until all liberty vanished, when the city was
destroyed, and even the name of the people was as it were abolished. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F97</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must observe what we have before said, that
these high terms in which the posterity of David were spoken of, properly belong
to Christ only; for David was not the life of the people, except as he was the
type of Christ, and represented his person. Then what is said was not really
found in the posterity of David, but only typically. Hence the truth, the
reality, is to be sought in no other but in Christ And we hence learn that the
Church is dead, and is like a maimed body, when separated from its head. If,
then, we desire to live before God, we must come to Christ, who is really the
spirit or the breath of our nostrils; for as man that is dead does no longer
breathe, so also we are said to be dead when separated from Christ. On the other
hand, as long as there is between him and us a sacred union, though our life is
hid, and we die, yet we live in him, and though we are dead to the world, yet
our life is in heaven, as also Paul and Peter call us thither.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
3:3, 4;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;610316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Peter 3:16.) In short, Jeremiah means that the favor of God was as it were
extinguished when the king was taken away, because the happiness of the people
depended on the king, and the royal dignity was as it were a sure pledge of the
grace and favor of God; hence the blessing of God ceased, when the king was
taken away from the Jews.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows at length,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of whom we have said, Under thy
shadow we shall live among the nations</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The
Prophet shews that the Jews in vain hoped for anything any more as to their
restoration; for the origin of all blessing was from the king. God had bereaved
them of their king; it then follows that they were in a hopeless state. But the
Prophet that he might more clearly express this, says, that the people thought
that they would be safe, provided the kingdom remained,
&#8212;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> We shall
live</i></font><font face="Palatino">, they said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>even among the nations under the
shadow of our king</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is,
&#8220;Though we may be driven to foreign nations, yet the king will be able to
gather us, and his shadow will extend far and wide to keep us safe.&#8221; So
the Jews believed, but falsely, because by their defection they had cast away
the yoke of Christ and of God, as it is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;190203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
2:3. As then they had shaken off the heavenly yoke, they in vain trusted in the
shadow of an earthly king, and were wholly unworthy of the guardianship and
protection of God.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet in this verse intimates that the Jews
were exposed to the reproaches and taunts of all their enemies, but he
immediately moderates their sorrow, by adding a consolation; and it was a sorrow
that in itself must have been very bitter; for we know that nothing&#8217; is
harder to bear, in a state of misery, than the petulant insults of enemies;
these wound us more than all other evils which we may suffer. The Prophet then
intimates, that the Jews had been so reduced, that all the ungodly and
malevolent were able, with impunity, to exult over them, and to taunt them with
their troubles. This is done in the former clause but its it was a prophecy, or
rather a denunciation, extremely bitter, he mitigates the atrocity of the evil,
when he says that their enemies would have soon in their turn to undergo
punishment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some explain the whole verse as spoken ironically, as
though the Prophet had said tauntingly, &#8212; &#8220;Go now, ye Idumeans, and
rejoice; but your joy shall be evanescent.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F99</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But I
rather think that he refers to the very summit of extreme misery, because the
Jews had been thus exposed to the taunts of their enemies; but he afterwards
adds some alleviation, because all their enemies would at length be punished.
There is, in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;330708&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah
7:8, a similar mode of speaking, though there is no mention made there of Edom;
for there the Prophet speaks generally to all those who envied the people, and
were their adversaries: he compares the people, according&#8217; to what was
usual, to a woman; and we know that in that sex there is much more jealousy than
in men; and then, when there is a grudge, they fiercely urge their pleas, that
they may have an occasion to speak evil of others. Therefore the Church, after
having acknowledged that she had been deservedly chastised, adds, &#8220;Rejoice
not over me, mine enemy.&#8221; But I have already fully explained the
Prophet&#8217;s meaning, &#8212; that the Church calls all her enemies an enemy,
or an inimical woman, as though there had been some quarrel or jealousy between
women. Hence she says,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Though I have fallen, yet rejoice
thou not, my enemy; though I lie in darkness, yet the Lord will be my light
&#8212; though then my enemy has rejoiced, yet my eyes shall see when she shall
be trodden down.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;330708&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Micah
7:8, 10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet no doubt meant there to mitigate the
sorrow of the godly, who saw that they were insolently taunted by all their
neighbors. He then shews the necessity of a patient endurance for a time; for
God would at length stretch out his hand, and render to enemies the reward of
their barbarity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But why in this place mention is made of Edom, rather
than of other nations, is not evident. The Jews were, indeed, surrounded on
every side with enemies, for they had as many enemies as neighbors. But the
Idumeans, above others, had manifested hostility to the chosen people. And the
indignity was the greater, because they had descended from the same father, for
Isaac was their common father; and they derived their origin from two brothers,
Esau and Jacob. As, then, the Idumeans were related to the Jews, their cruelty
was less tolerable; for they thus forgot their own race, and raged against their
brethren and relatives. Hence it is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
137:7,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Remember, O Lord,
the children of Edom, who said, in the day of Jerusalem, Down with it, down with
it, to the very foundation.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, then, after having imprecated
God&#8217;s vengeance on all the ungodly, mentioned especially the Idumeans; and
why? because they indulged their cruelty above all others; for they were
standard-bearers, as it were, to enemies, and were like falls, by which the fire
was more kindled; for this address was no doubt made to the

<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, the Idumeans had behaved most cruelly
towards their own relatives, the Prophet complains of them, and asks God to
render to them what they deserved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So now in this place our Prophet says,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be glad and rejoice, thou
daughter of Edom, who dwellest in the land of
Uz</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> By this clause, as I have already
said, Jeremiah intimates that the Jews were exposed to the taunts of their
enemies, because the Idumeans could now insult them with security. But he
immediately adds, <i>also</i>: here he begins a new subject, and this is
intimated by the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;g</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>gam</i>, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To thee also shall
pass the cup</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He employs a common
metaphor; for adversity is denoted in Scripture by the word cup; for God,
according to his will, gives to drink to each as much as he pleases. As when a
master of a family distributes drink to his children and servants; so also God,
in a manner, extends his cup to every one whom he chastises; nor does he allow
any one either to reject the cup offered, .or to throw away the wine, but he
constrains him to drink and to exhaust to the very dregs as much as he gives to
each to drink. Hence it is for this reason that the Prophet says now that the
cup would pass over to the Idumeans; for we know that, shortly after, they were
subdued by the Chaldeans, with whom they had before been united. But when they
had by their perfidy fallen off from their treaty, they were in their turn
punished. As, then, the agreement they had made with the Chaldeans did not
continue, the Prophet says, that to them also the cup would pass
over.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt be inebriated and made
naked</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> God is wont thus to distinguish
between his own children and aliens or the reprobate; for he indeed gives a
bitter potion to his own children to drink, but it is as much as they are able
to drink; but he altogether chokes others, because lie constrains them, as it
has been already said, to drink to the very dregs. So, then, the Prophet now
compares the extreme miseries which the Idumeans suffered to drunkenness; and to
the same purpose are the words which follow<i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt be made
naked</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> For he thus intimates, that they
would be so confounded with the atrocity of their evils, as to have no care for
decency, and to be dead to all shame: as a drunken man, who is overpowered by
wine, disregards himself, and falls and exposes himself as Noah did; so also the
Prophet says, that so great would be the calamities of Edom, that the people,
exposed to every reproach, would afford occasion to all around them for taunts.
As when a sot lies down in the mire, casts away his garments, and makes an
exposure of himself, it is a spectacle both sad and shameful; so the Prophet
says, that the Idumeans would be like the drunken, because they would lie down
in their reproach. It follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse, in my judgment, is incorrectly explained;
and the Jews have toiled much, for there seems to be a kind of inconsistency,
since it is certain that they were afterwards scattered into exile, not only
once, but several times. Hence they interpret. this place of the second
dispersion by Titus, under the authority of his father Vespasian. They then say
that the iniquity of the people was then completed, for after that exile no
change has followed. Otherwise they do not think that this prediction of the
Prophet accords with the reality or the event; for, as I have said, they have
been driven into all lands. They had been, indeed, before fugitives, as Moses
had declared concerning them. For we know that Jews dwelt in Greece and in
Macedonia; we know that many of the cities of Italy were full of this people,
until by the edict of Claudius Caesar they were expelled from Italy; for he
thought that Italy was infected by them, and he drove them afar off, as though
they were contagious. But the Jews lay hold on these refinements to no purpose
for the Prophet simply meant to say, that such would be, the punishment of the
people, that it would not be necessary then to repeat it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When, therefore, he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their
iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or the punishment of their iniquity,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was
completed</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he intimates that God had dealt so
severely with them, that there was nothing short of extreme rigor: and this mode
of speaking occurs elsewhere. To the same purpose is what immediately follows:
The enemy, or God, which is the same,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will no more add to draw thee
into exile, </i></font><font face="Palatino">&#8212; why? for what need was
there of a second exile when the whole land had been reduced to solitude? since
also the poor who had been left in the land had at length gone into Egypt,
whence they were brought again into Chaldea; but they were, at the time,
fugitives from the Holy Land. Then the Prophet means, that God&#8217;s judgment
was, in all its parts, completed, that nothing short of extreme calamity had
happened to the Jews.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It afterwards follows in the second clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will
visit</i></font><font face="Palatino">, which is, indeed, in the past tense,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he hath
visited</i></font><font face="Palatino">, but he speaks of what was future.
According to the usual manner of the prophets, in order to confirm the
prediction, he speaks of the event as already past, He has visited the iniquity
of the daughter of Edom; so that thy wickedness has been uncovered. The meaning
will be clearer if we add the particles of comparison, &#8220;As thy punishment,
daughter of Sion, has been completed; so thine iniquity, daughter of Edom, shall
be visited;&#8221; or if we render the words thus, by way of concession,
&#8220;The punishment of thine iniquity, daughter of Sion, has indeed been
completed; but thy sin, daughter of Edom, shall be uncovered.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F100</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We, in short, see that the reason is explained why
the Prophet, in the last verse, alleviated, with comfort, the sorrow of the
people, that though the Jews were very miserable, it would yet be nothing better
with Edom, when the time of visitation came. And in saying that the punishment
of iniquity was completed, he refers not to their sin, but says that they had
been thus chastised, as it seemed good to God to execute all his rigor towards
them; and nearly the same manner of speaking is found in the fortieth chapter of
Isaiah. Then the Prophet does not deny but that the Jews might at a future time
become exiles; but he says that their transmigration now was complete, so that
it was not necessary that Nebuchadnezzar should again denude the land of its
inhabitants: this had been done, as it were, by a sudden whirlwind; for by one
sweep they had been snatched away. The land, indeed, was before made desolate,
but when Nebuchadnezzar took possession of the city, he only left behind the
dregs of the people. And he did this on purpose that he might have there some
people as tributaries. Then that transmigration was complete.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet means not here, that God would not
afterwards banish and scatter the Jews as they deserved. There is then no
inconsistency, that the Jews afterwards became fugitives and wanderers through
the whole world, and that yet the enemy would not again draw them into
captivity, for he speaks here only of the Chaldeans: and this was said, because
Jeremiah wished to compare the Jews with the Idumeans, and to shew, that though
the Idumeans insolently exulted over them, yet their own calamity was nigh,
which would wholly overwhelm them, as the case had previously been with the
Jews. There is no time now to begin with the prayer of Jeremiah: I must
therefore defer it till the next Lecture.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This prayer ought to be read as unconnected with the
Lamentations, for the initial letters of the verses are not written according to
the order of the Alphabet. yet it is a complaint rather than a prayer; for
Jeremiah mentions those things which had happened to the people in their extreme
calamity in order to turn God to compassion and mercy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Remember</i></font><font face="Palatino">
what has happened to us; and then in the second part he explains himself,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Look and see our
reproach</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Now the words, though brief
and concise, yet contain a useful doctrine &#8212; that God is pleased to bring
help to the miserable when their evils come to an account before him, especially
when they are unjustly oppressed. It is, indeed, certain that nothing is unknown
to God, but this mode of speaking is according to the perceptions of men; for we
think that God disregards our miseries, or we imagine that his back is turned to
us when he does not immediately succor us. But as I have said, he is simply to
be asked to look on our evils, for we know what he testifies of himself; so that
as he claims to himself the office of helping the miserable and the unjustly
oppressed, we ought to acquiesce in this consolation, that as soon as he is
pleased to look on the evils we suffer, aid is at the same time prepared for
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is mention especially made of reproach, that
the indignity might move God the more: for it was for this end that he took the
people under his protection, that they might be for his glory and honor, as
Moses says. As, then, it was God&#8217;s will that the riches of his glory
should appear in that people, nothing could have been more inconsistent that
that instead of glory they should have nothing but disgrace and reproach. This,
then, is the reason why the Prophet makes a special mention of the reproach of
the people. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">A catalogue of many calamities is now given by the
Prophet, and as I have reminded you, for this end, that he may obtain
God&#8217;s favor for himself and for the whole people. It was by no means a
reasonable thing, that the inheritance of the elect people should be given to
aliens; for we know that the land had been promised to Abraham four hundred
years before his children possessed it; we know that this promise had been often
repeated, &#8220;This land shall be to you for an inheritance.&#8221; For though
God sustained all nations, yet he was pleased to take a peculiar care of his
people. In short, no land has ever been given to men in so singular a way as the
land of Canaan to the posterity of Abraham. As, then, this inheritance had been
for so many ages possessed by the chosen people, Jeremiah does not without
reason complain that it was turned over to aliens.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the second clause he repeats the same thing; but
he shews that the Jews had not only been robbed of their fields, but had been
cast out of their houses, a more grievous and disgraceful thing. For it
sometimes happens, that when one loses his farm, his fields, and vineyards, his
house remains to him untouched; but the Prophet here amplifies the misery of his
own nation, that they were not only deprived of their fields and possessions,
but that they were also ejected from their own houses, and others had possession
of them. For it is a sight deemed affecting even among heathens, when one
unworthy of any honor succeeds in the place of another eminent in wealth and
dignity. Well known are these words, &#8212;</font><br></div>

dwelt in the houses of the people. It follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

members, though every one of the people might have said that widows and orphans
were everywhere seen.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, this usually happens when a nation is consumed
either by pestilence or by war; for in one battle all do not so fall that a
whole country becomes full of orphans. But the Prophet sets forth here the
orphanage and widowhood occasioned through the continued vengeance of God, for
he had not ceased to afflict the people until by degrees they were exhausted. It
was, indeed, a sad spectacle to see among the chosen people so many widows, and
also so many children deprived of their fathers. It, follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here relates, that the people were
denuded, that. they labored under the want of water and of wood. He does not say
that they were only deprived of corn and wine, he does not complain that any of
their luxuries were lessened; but he mentions water and wood, the common things
of life; for the use of water, as it is said, is common to all; no one is so
poor, if he dwells not in a land wholly dry, but that he has water enough to
drink. For if there be no fountains, there are at least rivers, there are wells;
nor do men perish through thirst, except in deserts and in places uninhabitable.
As, then, water might be had everywhere, the Prophet here sets forth the extreme
misery of the people, for water was even sold to them. In stony and high places
water is sold; but this is a very rare thing. The Prophet here means that the
people were not only deprived of their wealth, but reduced to such a state of
want that they had no water without buying it,.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time he seems to express something worse
when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Our water we drink
for money</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and our
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wood is brought to us for a
price</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is not strange that wood should be
bought; but the Prophet means that water was sold to the Jews which had been
their own, and that they were also compelled to buy wood which had been their
own. Thus the possessive pronouns are to be considered as emphatical. Then he
says, &#8220;Our own waters we drink,&#8221; etc. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F102</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
calls them the waters of the people, which by right they might have claimed as
their own; and he also calls the wood The same; it was that to which the people
had a legitimate right. He then says that all things had been so taken away by
their enemies, that they were forced to buy, not only the wine which had been
taken from their cellars, and the corn which had been taken from their
granaries, but also the water and the wood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But were any one disposed to take the words more
simply, the complaint would not. be unsuitable, &#8212; that the people, who
before had abundance of wine and all other things, were constrained to buy
everything, even water and wood. For it is a grievous change when any one, who
could once cut wood of his own, and gather his own wine and corn, is not able to
get even a drop of water without buying it. This is a sad change. So this

<div><font face="Palatino">Here he says that the people were oppressed with a
grievous bondage. It is, indeed, a metaphorical expression when he says, that
people suffered persecution on their necks. Enemies may sometimes be troublesome
to us, either before our face, or behind our backs, or by our sides; but when
they so domineer as to ride on our necks, in this kind of insult. there is
extreme degradation. Hence the Prophet here complains of the servile and even
disgraceful oppression of the people when he says, that the Jews
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>suffered persecution on their

<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning is, that the enemies so domineered at

indeed, worthy of this reward &#8212; for we know that they had an iron neck;
for when God would have them to bear his yoke, they were wholly unbending; nay,
they were like untameable wild beasts. As, then, their hardness had been so
great, God rendered to them a just reward for their pride and obstinacy, when
their enemies laid such a burden on their necks

he might turn God to mercy; that is, that the Chaldeans thus oppressed as they

<div><font face="Palatino">He adds, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>labored and had no

pressed down with evils for a short time, a relaxation comes. But the Prophet.
says that there was no end to the miseries of the people. Then to labor without
rest is the same as to be pressed down with incessant afflictions, from which
there is no outlet. Their obstinacy was worthy also of this reward, for they had
fought against God, not for a few months or years only, but for many years. We
know how long the Prophet called them without any success. Here, however, he
seeks favor with God, by saying that the people were miserable without limits or
end.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He speaks here of the mendicity of the people, that
they sought bread from every quarter. To give the hand, is explained in three
ways: some say that it means humbly to ask; others, to make an agreement; and
others, to extend it in token of misery, as he who cannot ask for help,
intimates his wants by extending his hand. But the Prophet seems simply to mean
that the people were so distressed by want, that they begged bread. I then take
the expression, to give the hand, as meaning that they asked bread, as beggars
usually do.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now says that they <i>gave</i> or extended
<i>the</i> <i>hand</i> both to the <i>Egyptians</i> and to the <i>Assyrians</i>,
which was a most unworthy and disgraceful thing; for the Egyptians had been
their most troublesome enemies, and the Assyrians afterwards followed their
example. At that time, indeed, the Egyptians pretended to be the friends of the
chosen people, and made a treaty with them; but the Jews were held in contempt
by them as they deserved, for they had prostituted as it were themselves like
harlots. As, then, they had been despised by the Egyptians, it was a disgrace
and reproach the most bitter, when they were compelled to beg bread in Egypt,
and then in Assyria; for this might have been turned to the bitterest
taunts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, perceive the meaning of the Prophet;
even this reward also God justly rendered to them. He had promised them a
fruitful land, in which he was ready to support them to the full. How often is
mention made by Moses of corn, wine, and oil; and why? in order that God might
shew that that land exceeded every other in fertility. It was, then, an evidence
of an extreme curse when the people were compelled to beg bread here and there,
while yet the abundance of all things ought to have been sufficient to supply
even aliens,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet seems here to contend with God, and to
utter that blasphemy mentioned by Ezekiel. For when God severely chastised the
people, that proverb was commonly used by them,</font><br></div>

that the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fathers who sinned were
no more</i></font><font face="Palatino">; but as we shall presently see, the
Prophet confesses also the sins of those who were yet alive. As, then, an
ingenuous confession is made by the Prophet, he no doubt abstained here from
that blasphemy which is so severely reproved by Ezekiel. Jeremiah had nothing
farther from his purpose than to free the people from all blame, as though God
had dealt cruelly with them, according to what is said by a heathen poet,

<div><font face="Palatino">They mean that the people of their age were wholly
innocent, and seek in Asia and beyond the sea the cause of evils, as though they
never had a sin at Rome. But the meaning of Jeremiah was not this, but he simply
intended to say that the people who had been long rebellious against God were
already dead, and that it was therefore a suitable time for God to regard the
miseries of their posterity. The faithful, then, do not allege here their own
innocency before God, as though they were blameless; but only mention that their
fathers underwent a just punishment, for that whole generation had perished.
Daniel speaks more fully when he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;We have sinned,
and our fathers, and our
kings.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;270908&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Daniel

<div><font face="Palatino">He involved in the same condemnation both the fathers
and their children.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But our Prophet&#8217;s object was different, even to
turn God to mercy, as it has been stated; and to attain this object he says,
&#8220;O Lord, thou indeed hast hitherto executed just punishment, because our
fathers had very long abused thy goodness and forbearance; but now the time is
come for thee to try and prove whether we are like our fathers: as, then, they
have perished as they deserved, receive us now into favor.&#8221; We hence see
that thus no quarrel or contention is carried on with God, but only that the
miserable exiles ask God to look on them, since their fathers who had provoked
God and had experienced his dreadful vengeance, were already dead. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F106</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And when he says that the <i>sons bore the
iniquity</i> of the fathers, though it be a strong expression, yet its meaning
is not as though God had without reason punished their children and not their
fathers; for unalterable is that declaration,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The son shall not
bear the iniquity of the father, nor the father the iniquity of the son; but the

18:20.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may yet be said that children are loaded with the
sins of their fathers, because God, as he declares by Moses, extends his
vengeance to the third and fourth generation.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;022005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
20:5.) And he says also in another place,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">God then continued his vengeance to their posterity.
But yet there is no doubt but that the children who had been so severely
punished, bore also the punishment of their own iniquity, for they deserved a
hundred deaths. But these two things well agree together, that God returns the
iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children, and yet that the
children are chastised for their own sins.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Another circumstance aggravated the calamity of the
people, that they came under the power of servants, which is more degrading than
when the rich and the eminent in wealth and power make us their servants. For it
is no shame to serve a king, or at, least a man who possesses some eminence; for
that servitude which is not apparently degrading is deemed tolerable. But when
we become the servants of servants, it is a most afflicting degradation, and
most grievously wounds our minds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is, then, for this indignity that Jeremiah now
expostulates, and says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>servants ruled over
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There is, indeed, no doubt but that they
were driven into exile by some of the lowest; for the Chaldeans thought it right
to exercise towards them every kind of cruelty. But it was yet a very mournful
thing for God&#8217;s children to be the slaves of servants; for they were
before a sacerdotal kingdom, and God had so taken them under his protection,
that their condition was better and more desirable than that of any other
kingdom. As, then, they had been robbed of their liberty, and not only so, but
also made subject to servants, the change was sad in the extreme.

<i>sword</i> the word means here; and I wonder that the word sword had occurred
to any; they could not have regarded the context.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says that the people sought bread with the
soul, that is, at the hazard of their own life. If danger be preferred, I do not
object. But as he simply says, with the soul, he seems to express this, that for
food they hazarded their own life. Food, indeed, is the support of life, for why
is bread sought but for sustaining life? But the hungry so rush headlong to
procure food, that they expose themselves to thousand dangers, and they also
weary themselves with many labors; and this is to seek bread with their soul,
that is, when men not only anxiously labor to procure food, but pour forth as it
were their own blood, as when one undertakes a long journey to get some support,
lie is almost lifeless when he reaches the distant hospital. As, then, the Jews
nowhere found food, the Prophet says that they sought bread with their life,
that is, at the hazard of life. This is the view I prefer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the dryness of the
wilderness</i></font><font face="Palatino">. What has the sword to do with
wilderness? We see that this is wholly unsuitable; there was then no reason why
interpreters should pervert this word. But what he calls the dryness of the
wilderness was the want by which the people were distressed, as though they were
in the wilderness. This is said by way of comparison, &#8212; that on account of
the dryness of the desert, that is, on account of sterility, they were under the
necessity of exposing their life to death, only that they might anywhere find
bread.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">F108</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may also be, that the Prophet meant, that they
were fugitives, and thus went in hunger through woods and forest, when they
dared not to go forth into the open country lest the enemy should meet them. But
what I have said is most suitable, that is, that they were so famished as though
they were in a vast desert, and far away from every hospital, so that bread
could nowhere be found. We now, then, perceive the meaning of the Prophet. He

&#8220;from the face of tremors.&#8221; Jerome renders it, &#8220;tempests
:&#8221; but the word &#8220;burnings&#8221; is the most suitable; for he says
that their skins were darkened, and he compares them to an oven. This metaphor
often occurs in Scripture,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Though ye have

<div><font face="Palatino">God says that his people had contracted blackness, as
though they had touched smoky pots, because they had been burnt as it were by
many afflictions; for when we pine away in our evils, filthiness itself deforms
us. But here he compares to an oven (which is the same thing) their skins or
skin. He then says that the skin of every one was so wrinkled and darkened by
blackness, that it was like an oven which is black through constant fire and
smoke. The Prophet or whoever was the author of the 119th Psalm, uses another
comparison, that he was like a bottle or a bladder, contracted by the smoke, and
had wrinkles together with blackness. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F109</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning is, that there was a degrading deformity
in the people, for they were so famished that no moisture remained in them; and
when moisture fails, then paleness and decay follow; and then from paleness a
greater deformity and blackness, of which the Prophet now speaks. Hence I have
said, that the word &#8220;burnings&#8221; is the most proper. For, if we say
tempests or storms, a tempest does not certainly darken the skin; and if we
render it tremors or tremblings, this would be far remote; but if we adopt the
word burnings, the whole passage will appear consistent; and we know, that as
food as it were irrigates the life of man, so famine burns it up, as Scripture
speaks also elsewhere. It follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

was far more grievous, that they were slain by their own hand. I certainly do
not doubt but that the Prophet says here, that some of the princes had laid
violent hands on themselves. For it would be a frigid expression, that the
princes were hung by the hand of enemies; but if we read, that the princes were
hung by their own hand, this would be far more atrocious, as we have before seen
that even women, excelling in humanity, devoured their own offspring. So he says
now that princes were hung, not by enemies, for it was a common thing for the
conquered to be slain by their enemies, and be also hung by way of reproach; but
the Prophet, as it appears to me, meant to express something more atrocious,
even that the miserable princes were constrained to lay violent hands on
themselves.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">F111</font></sup><br></div>

we know that some honor is always rendered to old age, and that time of life is
commonly regarded with reverence. When, therefore, no respect is shown to the
aged, the greatest barbarity must necessarily prevail. It is the same, then, as
though the Prophet had said that the people had been so disgracefully treated,
that their enemies had not even spared the aged. We also now understand why he
adds this, for it would have otherwise appeared incredible, that the princes
hung themselves by their own hand. But he here intimates that there was no
escape for them, except they in despair sought death for themselves, because all

<i>thechen</i>, means to grind or to tear. He thought that it means here
something base, which could not be named, as though the enemies had shamefully
abused the young men; but we may gather from the second clause of the verse that
such an idea does not accord with the passage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>young

as drudges were wont to be; and it was a vile work. As, then, he said
previously, that the young men were employed in grinding, so now he says that
boys succumbed under the wood, because they carried burdens on their shoulders
too heavy for them, which they were not able to bear. We now, then, apprehend
what the Prophet means. It follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet briefly shews that the city was
reduced to ruins, so that nothing but desolation could be seen there. For when
cities are inhabited, judges sit at the gate and young men exercise themselves
in ]awful pursuits; but he says that there were no judgments; for at that time,
as it is well known, they were wont to administer justice and to hold assemblies
at the gates of cities. It was then the same as though all civil order had been
abolished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds, the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>young men had ceased from their
own beating</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or musical songs. The meaning is,
that there was so great a desolation in the city, that, it was no more a city.
For men cannot dwell together without laws and without courts of justice. Where
courts of justice are closed up, where laws are mute, where no equity is
administered, there barbarity prevails, which is worse than solitude; :and where
there are no assemblies for legitimate amusements, life becomes brutal, for we
know that man is a sociable being. By these words, then, the Prophet shews that
a dreadful desolation appeared in the city after the people had gone into exile.
And among the Chaldeans, and in Assyria, they had not their own judges nor any
form of government, for they were dispersed and scattered, and that designedly,
that they might not unite together any more; for it was the purpose of the
Chaldeans to obliterate by degrees the very name of the people; and hence they
were not there formed into a community. So justly does the Prophet deplore their
desolation even in exile. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

those ornaments by which that people had been adorned. They had a kingdom and a
priesthood, which were like two luminaries or two precious jewels; they had also
other things by which the Lord had adorned them. As, then, they were endued with
such excellent things, they are said to have borne a

a diadem, &#8212; it was also a symbol of joy and of honor; for not only kings
then wore crowns, but men were crowned at weddings and feasts, at. games also,
and theatres. The Prophet, in a word, complains, that though many ornaments did
belong to the people, yet now they were denuded of them all:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
crown</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,

and at the same time shews that all hope of restoration was taken away. He,
however, mentions the cause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because they had done
wickedly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> By saying this he did not
intend to exasperate their sorrow, so that they who were thus afflicted might
murmur against God; but, on the contrary, his object was to humble the
afflicted, so that they might perceive that they were justly punished. It is the
same as though he had summoned them as guilty before the tribunal of God, and
pronounced in one word that they justly suffered or sustained so grievous a
punishment; for a just God is an avenger of wickedness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence conclude, that when he said yesterday that
the fathers who had sinned were dead, and their iniquity was borne by their
children, he did not so speak as to exempt the living from all blame; for here
he condemns them and includes himself in the number. But I explained yesterday
the meaning of that verse; and here the Prophet ingenuously confesses that the
people were justly punished, because they had by their sins provoked the wrath
of God. And this doctrine ought to be carefully observed; because when we are
pressed down by adversities, Satan will excite us to sorrow, and at the same
time hurry us on to rage, except this doctrine comes to our minds, that we have
to do with God, who is a righteous Judge. For the knowledge of our sins will
tame our pride and also check all those clamorous complaints, which the
unbelieving are wont to utter when they rise up against God. Our evils, then,
ought to lead us to consider God&#8217;s judgment and to confess our sins; and
this was the end which our Prophet had in view. It follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">He connects sorrow here with the acknowledgment of
sin, that the people under the pressure and agony of sorrow might apply their
minds so as to consider their own sins. At the same time the Prophet, no doubt,
includes here all that we have already observed, as though he had said that the
people were not without reason wearied with sorrow, for they had ample and
manifold reasons for their grief.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For this reason, he says, that is, we do not exceed a
due measure in our sorrow, for our afflictions are not ordinary, so that our
grief cannot be moderate; but as we are come to an extremity, it cannot then be
but our minds should be overwhelmed with sorrow. As, then, the curse of God
appeared everywhere, he says that this was the cause of the fainting heart; and
he says also, Therefore were our eyes darkened. This is a common metaphor, that
the eyes become dim through sorrow; for the senses through sorrow are blunted.
Hence it is that the sight of the eyes is injured; and David especially makes
use of this mode of speaking. Our Prophet then says that the eyes were darkened,
because their grief was, as it were, deadly. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Though he had in general included all kinds of evils,
he yet mentions now the principal cause of sorrow, that <i>mount</i> Sion had
lost its beauty and its excellency. For that place had been chosen by God, as
though he had descended there from heaven, that he might dwell there; and we
know also that its beauty is spoken of in high terms. For there the face of God
shone forth, as Moses and the Prophets often speak. It was then an extremely sad
change, that as God had dwelt in mount Sion, foxes should lodge there as in a
deserted cave. For on mount Sion was the tabernacle or the sanctuary; and God
says that it was the tabernacle of meeting,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d[wm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>moud</i>, because there he wished to hold intercourse with his people. As,
then, that place included God and his Church, it was, as I have said, a dreadful
and monstrous thing, that it had become so desolate, that foxes succeeded in the
place of God and the faithful. It was not, then, without reason that Jeremiah,
after having spoken of so many and so bitter calamities, mentioned this as the
chief, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mount Sion was
reduced to desolation, so that foxes ran there hither and
thither</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F114</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For as it is the principal thing, and as it were the
chief of all blessings, to be counted God&#8217;s people, and to have a familiar
access to him, so in adversities nothing is so sad as to be deprived of
God&#8217;s presence. When David testified. his gratitude to God, because he had
been enriched by every kind of blessing, he added this,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I shall dwell in
the house of God.&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino">For though he had spoken of wealth and riches and of
the abundance of all things, yet he saw that his chief happiness was to call on
God together with the faithful, and to be deemed one of his people. So, also, on
the other hand, the Prophet here shews that nothing can be sadder to the godly
than when God leaves his dwelling and makes it desolate, in order to terrify all
who may see it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This had been predicted to them by Jeremiah himself,
as we have seen in the seventh chapter of his prophecies, &#8220;Go ye to
Shiloh,&#8221; he said, where the ark of the covenant had long been; though that
place had been a long time the habitation of God, yet it was afterwards rejected
with great disdain. Jeremiah then declared to the Jews, while they were yet in
safety, that such would be the condition of Jerusalem; but his prophecy was not
believed. He now, then, confirms, by the event, what he had predicted by
God&#8217;s command, when he says that mount Sion was become the den of foxes.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here raises up his eyes to God, and, by
his example, he encourages all the godly, that they might not cease,
notwithstanding their extreme calamities, to look to God, as we find in the
hundred and second Psalm, where the Psalmist speaks of the destruction of the
city of Jerusalem. Indeed the subject of that psalm is similar to that of this
chapter; nor is there a doubt but that it was composed when the people, as it
clearly appears, were in exile in Babylon. There the Psalmist, after having
spoken of the ruin of the city, and calamities of the people, says, that the
heavens were growing old and wasting as it were with rottenness, together with
the whole world; but he afterwards adds,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;But thou, O Lord,
remainest
perpetually.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19A227&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
102:27-29.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time he speaks more clearly than
Jeremiah, for he applies his doctrine to the consolation of the Church,
&#8220;Children&#8217;s children,&#8221; he says, &#8220;shall inhabit
it.&#8221; Hence, from the perpetuity and immutability of God, he infers the
perpetuity of the Church. This is not done by Jeremiah, though it is implied;
and for this reason, no doubt, he exclaims, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God dwells for ever,</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">and that<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his throne remains fixed in
all ages</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or through all
ages.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For when we fix our eyes on present things, we must
necessarily vacillate, as there is nothing permanent hi the world; and when
adversities bring a cloud over our eyes, then faith in a manner vanishes, at
least we are troubled and stand amazed. Now the remedy is, to raise up our eyes
to God, for however confounded things may be in the world, yet he remains always
the same. His truth may indeed be hidden from us, yet it remains in him. In
short, were the world to change and perish a hundred times, nothing could ever
affect the immutability of God. There is, then, no doubt but that the Prophet
wished to take courage and to raise himself up to a firm hope, when he
exclaimed, &#8220;Thou, O God, remainest for ever.&#8221; By the word sitting or
remaining, he doubtless meant that the world is governed by God. We know that
God has no body, but the word sitting is to be taken metaphorically, for He is
no God except he be the judge of the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This, also, he expresses more clearly, when he says,
that God&#8217;s throne remains through all ages. The throne of God designates
the government of the world. But if God be the judge of the world, then he doeth
nothing,, or suffereth nothing to be done, but according to his supreme wisdom
and justice. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F115</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We
hence see, that inasmuch as the state of present things, as thick darkness, took
away all distinction, the Prophet raises up his eyes to God and acknowledges him
as remaining the same perpetually, though things in the world continually
change. Then the throne of God is set in opposition to chance or uncertain
changes which ungodly men dream of; for when they see things in great confusion
in the world, they say that it is the wheel of fortune, they say that all things
happen through blind fate. Then the Prophet, that he might not be cast down with
the unbelieving, refers to the throne of God, and strengthens himself in this
doctrine of true religion, &#8212; that God nevertheless sits on this throne,
though things are thus confounded, though all things fluctuate; yea, even though
storms and tempests mingle as it were heaven and earth together, yet God sits on
his throne amidst all such disturbances. However turbulent, then, all the
elements may be, this derogates nothing from the righteous and perpetual
judgment of God. This is the meaning of the words; and hence fruit and benefit
may be easily gathered. It. follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He seems, indeed, here to expostulate with God; but
the faithful, even when they patiently bear their evils, and submit to
God&#8217;s scourges, do yet familiarly deposit their complaints in his bosom,
and thus unburden themselves. We see that David prayed, and no doubt by the real
impulse of the Spirit, and at the same time expostulated,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Why dost thou

13:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor is there a doubt but that the Prophet. took this
complaint from David. Let us, then, know, that though the faithful sometimes
take this liberty of expostulating with God, they yet do not put off reverence,
modesty, submission, or humility. For when the Prophet thus inquired why God
should for ever forget his people and forsake them, he no doubt relied on his
own prophecies, which he knew had proceeded from God, and thus he deferred his
hope until the end of the seventy years, for that time had been prefixed by God.
But it was according to human judgment that he complained in his own person, and
in that of the faithful, that the affliction was long; nor is there a doubt but
that he dictated this form of prayer to the faithful, that k might be retained
after his death. He, then, formed this prayer, not only according to his own
feeling, and for the direction to those of his own age; but his purpose was to
supply the faithful with a prayer after his own death, so that they might flee
to the mercy of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, perceive how complaints of this kind
ought to be understood, when the prophets asked, &#8220;How long.?&#8221; as
though they stimulated God to hasten the time; for it cannot be, when we are
pressed down by many evils, but that we wish help to be accelerated; for faith
does not wholly strip us of all cares and anxieties. But when we thus pray, let
us remember that our times are at the will and in the hand of God, and that we
ought not to hasten too much. It is, then, lawful for us on the one hand to ask
God to hasten; but, on the other hand, we ought to check our impatience and wait
until the suitable time comes. Both these things the Prophet no doubt joined
together when he said,<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why
shouldest thou, perpetually forget us and forsake us?
</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">F116</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We yet see that he judged according to the evils then
endured; and doubtless he believed that God had not forsaken his own people nor
forgotten them, as no oblivion can happen to him. But, as I have already said,
the Prophet mentioned these complaints through human infirmity, not that men
might indulge themselves in their own thoughts, but that they might ascend by
degrees to God and overcome all these temptations. It follows,

whence is it that despair weakens us, so that we cannot call on God? because we
think that it is all over with us; and whence is this? because we impiously
confine the power of God; nay, we in a manner, through our unbelief, repel his
power, which would otherwise be exerted in our behalf. As, then, we thus close
the door against God, when we extenuate his power, and think that our evils will
prevail; it is, therefore, as I have said, the beginning of hope to believe that
all the issues of death are in God&#8217;s hand, and that were we a hundred
times swallowed up, yet he, by stretching forth his hand to us, can become the
author of salvation to us at any moment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is now the argument which the Prophet handles,
when he says, Turn us, O Jehovah, and we shall be turned; that is, &#8220;If
thou, O Jehovah, be pleased to gather us, salvation is already certain to
us.&#8221; And he does not speak here of repentance. There is, indeed, a twofold
turning or conversion of men to God, and a twofold turning of God to men. There
is all inward turning when God regenerates us by his own Spirit; and turning
with respect to us is said to be the feeling of true religion, when, after
having been alienated from him, we return to the right way and to a fight mind.
There is also all exterior turning as to God, that is, when he so receives men
into favor, that his paternal favor becomes apparent; but the interior turning
of men to God takes place when they recover life and joy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Of this second turning, then, does the Prophet now
speak, Turn us, O Jehovah, and we shall be turned; that is, If thou, Jehovah,
lookest on us, our condition will immediately become prosperous, for in thy hand
there is a sure salvation for us.&#8221; As, then, the Jews were at that time
like the dead, the Prophet says, that if it pleased God to gather them, they
could in a moment, as they say, have been restored, as it is said also in the
Psalms,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Thou takest away
life, and all things change; send forth thy Spirit, and renew the face of the
earth.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19A429&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
104:29, 30.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, God renews the face of the earth and
restores it by only looking at it, hence now the Prophet says, that the Jews,
though they had been destroyed, could yet be immediately restored, if it were
the will of God to receive them into favor. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F117</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds, Renew our days as of old. This is an
explanation of the former clause &#8212; the renewing of days was restoration to
their former state. God had been for many ages the deliverer of his people;
under David had been their greatest happiness; under Solomon also they had
greatly flourished; but from the time when God had redeemed his people, he had
given, as we know, many and constant proofs of his favor and mercy. As, then,
God&#8217;s goodness had, by so many evidences been made conspicuous, the
Prophet now says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Renew our days
as formerly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, &#8220;Restore us
to that happiness, which was formerly a testimony of thy paternal favor towards
thy people.&#8221; We now then perceive the meaning of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it ought to be noticed, that he grounds his hope
on the ancient benefits of God; for as God had formerly redeemed his people, had
often helped the miserable, had poured forth on them, posterity fullness of
blessings, hence the Prophet encourages himself to entertain good hope, and
suggests also to others the same ground of confidence. We see that this was done
often by David; for whenever he mentions ancient testimonies of God&#8217;s
favor towards his people, he hence gathered, that God would extend the same
goodness and kindness to posterity. It follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The two words
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;a
yk</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>ki am,</i> are differently explained: some
render them, &#8220;but if,&#8221; or &#8220;certainly if,&#8221; and thus
separate the verse into two parts, &#8220;Surely if thou hast rejected us, thou
art very angry;&#8221; but this is a forced meaning, not intended, as I think,
by the Prophet. And these seem to have been compelled by necessity to pervert
the Prophet&#8217;s words; because it appears hard simply to declare that the
people had been wholly rejected by God. As, then, this harshness offended them,
they contrived this comment, &#8220;If thou hast rejected us, thou art very
angry.&#8221; But as I have said, this exposition I do not approve of, because
it is a very forced one; and the greater part of interpreters follow what I
stated in the first place, for they take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;a
yk</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>ki</i> <i>am</i>, adversatively. The two
particles are often connected together, and rendered, &#8220;though&#8221; or
although, &#8212; &#8220;Though thou hast rejected us:&#8221; and hence the last
verse has been repeated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For the Jews labor under this superstition, that when
a book ends with a hard and severe sentence, or one containing a dreadful
threatening, grating to the ears, in order to avoid the sad omen, they repeat
the last verse but one. So they do at the end of Isaiah, and at the end of
Malachi. As Isaiah says, &#8220;It shall be a horror (or abomination) to all
flesh;&#8221; they therefore repeat the previous verse. So in Malachi; as he
says, &#8220;Lest I come and smite the earth with a curse &#8212;
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;rj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cherem</i>,&#8221; they think that as he pronounces there an anathema, it is
a sort of charm that may absorb this curse, to have the previous verse repeated
after it. There is, then, no doubt but that they took this passage in the same
sense, &#8220;Though thou hast rejected us,&#8221; etc.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If this explanation be approved, we must hold that
the Prophet here exceeded due limits, as also the faithful, in their prayers, do
not always so restrain themselves, but that some heat bubbles up; for we see how
David, in the Psalms, too often shewed this kind of feeling; and it is hence
evident, that his mind was not always sufficiently calm. We must then say, that
the Prophet was impelled by a turbulent feeling when he uttered these
words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;a
yk</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>ki</i> <i>am</i>, may also be rendered,
&#8220;Unless,&#8221; or except&#8217; and it is singular that no one has
perceived this, though it be not an unsuitable meaning, &#8220;Except it may be
thou rejecting hast rejected us, and hast become very angry with us,&#8221; or
above measure angry; for </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dam
d[</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>od mad </i>in Hebrew, means the same as
above measure (<i>supra</i> <i>modum</i>) in Latin. Though the Prophet seems to
speak doubtingly, by laying down t, his condition, there is vet no doubt but
that he struggled against all unbelief, when he said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Except it may
be</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for he reasons from what is
impossible, &#8220;Turn thou us to thee and we shall be turned, renew our days
as formerly; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>except it may be
thou hast rejected us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:&#8221; </i>but this
was impossible. Then, as I have said, the Prophet here strengthens himself by
setting up a shield against all the assaults of temptations when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Except it may be thou hast
rejected us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F118</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it cannot be that God will reject his people, and
be so angry with them, as never to be reconciled. We hence see that the Prophet
does not simply set down the condition, as though he said, &#8220;O God, if thou
art to be perpetually angry with us, and wilt never be reconciled, it is there
all over with our salvation; but if thou wilt be reconciled to us, we shall then
entertain good hope.&#8221; No, the Prophet did not thus keep his own mind and
the minds of others in suspense, but had a sure confidence as to God&#8217;s
favor; for it cannot be that God will ever forsake those whom he has chosen, as
Paul also shews in the eleventh chapter of the Epistle to the
Romans.</font><br></div>

<i>Syr., </i>and the idea of impudence or folly, is conveyed by the <i>Sept.

The verb means to turn to or from. Being a reduplicate here, it means to turn
away resolutely; hence &#8220;rebellious&#8221; would be no improper rendering.
&#8220;Her&#8221; before &#8220;treasures,&#8221; refers to

copies of the words, &#8220;Who hast said in thine heart,&#8221; and all the

form, the y <i>iod </i>being wanted, and the m <i>mem </i>before it being
omitted, which is not uncommon. Discerning rather than &#8220;prudent,&#8221; or

means to spread, to stretch out; and spreading here is in the sense of
dissipating or scattering, and the verb here is passive. So
&#8220;vanished&#8221; would convey the meaning. The first line is a question,
and the two following contain the answer. A tautology cannot be otherwise
avoided. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>

this verse as addressed to the people of Israel, of whom there is no mention
here. <i>Blayney </i>supposes a typographical mistake, joins

<div><font face="Palatino">The questions he considers as strong negatives. The
simpler view seems to be this: in the preceding verse the destruction not only
of Esau, but also of his brethren and neighbours, is announced. His
&#8220;seed&#8221; means his posterity, the nation, and he was <i>was not to be,
</i>that is, as a kingdom. There would be still some &#8220;orphans&#8221; and

&#8220;neighbors&#8221;<i> </i>would be destroyed as well as Esau himself, as to
all grown up people, forming the nation, and thus orphans and widows would be
left helpless, God was pleased to give the promise here stated:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Leave thy orphans, I will preserve
<i>them, </i>Thy widows also, in me let them trust.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The last verb is both masculine and feminine, and
refers both to the orphans and widows. This is substantially the explanation
given by Venema, and is the most satisfactory. &#8212;

reason for his petition in the preceding verse; as though he had said, &#8220;I

of the previous verse, &#8220;Restore us to our land, and renew the ancient
days,&#8221; &#8212; &#8220; Thou hast wholly rejected us.&#8221; He speaks of
things as they were then. Then the last line in this verse bears a relation to
the first part of the preceding verse, &#8220;Restore us to thy favor,&#8221;
&#8212; &#8220; Thou hast been<i> </i>exceedingly displeased with us.&#8221;
Thus, for displeasure he asked favor, and for repudiation, a restoration.
