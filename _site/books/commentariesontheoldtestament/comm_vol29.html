<div><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">TRANSLATOR&#8217;S
PREFACE.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE present Volume, though it contains the Works of
THESE PROPHETS, is yet considerably smaller in size than the preceding Volumes;
but the last will more than compensate for this deficiency.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The two first Prophets, HABAKKUK and ZEPHANIAH, lived
before the Captivity; and the other, HAGGAI began his prophetic office about
sixteen years after the return of the great body of the people from Babylon by
the permission given them by King Cyrus.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is commonly thought that HABBAKUK prophesied
<i>after </i>ZEPHANIAH, though placed before him in our Bibles. The reign of
JEHOIAKIN is assigned as his age, about 608 years before Christ, while Zephaniah
performed his office in the reign of JOSIAH, about 30 years earlier. Like the
other prophets he is mainly engaged in reproving the extreme wickedness of the
people, on account of which he denounces on them the judgments of God, while he
gives occasional intimations of a better state of things, and affords some
glimpses of the blessings of the gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>first </i>CHAPTER he begins with a
complaint as to the oppression which he witnessed, foretells the dreadful
invasion of the CHALDEANS, describes the severity which would be exercised by
them, and appeals to God on the subject. In the <i>second </i>he waits for an
answer, receives it, and predicts the downfal of the Chaldeans, and refers to
blessings in reserve for God&#8217;s people. The <i>third </i>contains what is
called the &#8220;Prayer<i> </i>of Habakkuk,&#8221; an ode of a singular
character, in which he briefly describes, for the encouragement of the faithful,
the past interpositions of God on behalf of his people, and concludes with
expressing a full and joyful confidence in God, notwithstanding&#8217; the evils
which were coming on the nation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;The style of HABAKKUK,&#8221; Says Bishop
<i>Lowth, </i>&#8220;is poetical, especially in his Ode, which may justly be
deemed one of the most complete of its
kind.&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh1a</font><font face="Palatino">
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">And in <i>describing </i>the character of
this ode he says  &#8212;  &#8220;The Prophet indeed embellishes the whole of
this poem with a magnificence equal to its commencement, selecting from so great
an abundance of wonderful events the grandest, and setting them forth in the
most splendid dress, by images and figures, and the most elevated diction; the
high sublimity of which he augments and <i>enhances </i>by the <i>elegance
</i>of a <i>remarkable conclusion: </i>so that hardly any thing of this kind
would be more beautiful or more perfect than this poem, were it not for one or
two spots of obscurity which are to be found in it, occasioned, as it seems, by
its
ancientness.&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh1b</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">ZEPHANIAH was in part contemporary with JEREMIAH,
that is, during the former portion of the reign of JOSIAH. He foretells the FALL
OF NINEVEH,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;360213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zephaniah
2:13,) and mentions &#8220;the<i> </i>remnant of Baal,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;360104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zephaniah
1:4,) two things which prove that he prophesied during the former half of that
king&#8217;s reign; for NINEVEH was destroyed about the sixteenth year of his
reign, and it was after that time that the worship of Baal was demolished by
that king.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sins of THE JEWS and their approaching judgments
occupy <i>the first </i>Chapter. The <i>second </i>contains an exhortation to
Repentance, encouraged by a promise of protection during the evils that God
would bring on neighboring nations. In the <i>third </i>the Prophet
particularizes the sins of JERUSALEM, announces its punishment, and then refers
to the future blessings which God would freely confer on His
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The style of ZEPHANIAH has been represented as being
in some parts prosaic; and <i>Lowth </i>says that &#8220;he seems to possess
nothing remarkable or superior in the arrangement of his matter or in the
elegance of his
diction.&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh1c</font><font face="Palatino">
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">But it is <i>Henderson&#8217;s </i>opinion
that <i>&#8220;many </i>of the censures that have been passed on his language
are either without foundation or much exaggerated.&#8221; He appears to be as
poetic in his ideas as most of the Prophets, and in the manner in which he
arranges them, though he deals not much in parallelisms, which constitute a
prominent feature in Hebrew poetry.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The matters handled by the Prophet are said by
<i>Marckius </i>to be &#8220;most worthy of God, whether we regard His serious
reproofs or His severe threatenings, or His kind warnings, or His gracious
promises, which especially appertain to the dispensation of the New Testament.
In all these particulars he not only agrees with the other prophets, but also
adopts their
expressions.&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh1d</font><font face="Palatino">
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">He then gives the following examples: &#8212;

</b></font><font face="Palatino">compared with Ezekiel 22:26, 27, 28,
etc.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It does not appear at what time HAGGAI returned from
exile, though probably at the first return of the Jews under ZERUBBABEL, before
Christ 536. But he did not commence his prophetic office till about sixteen
years after; and he delivered what his Book contains in the space of <i>three
</i>months. His messages, which are
<i>five,</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh1e</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font></sup><font face="Palatino">are very short; and hence some have
concluded that they are but summaries of what he had delivered.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Much of this Book is historical, interspersed with
what is conveyed in a poetic style. The Prophet, in the <i>first </i>Chapter,
remonstrates with the people, who were very attentive to their own private
concerns, but neglected to build the Lord&#8217;s Temple; he refers to the
judgments with which they had been visited on this account, encourages them to
undertake the work, and promises them the favor of God; and then he tells us of
his success. In the <i>second </i>Chapter he removes an apparent ground of
discouragement, the temple then in building being not so splendid as the former,
and promises an additional glory to it, evidently referring to the Gospel times.
He then warns them against relaxing in their work and thinking it enough merely
to offer sacrifices, assures them of God&#8217;s blessing, and concludes with a
special promise to Zerubbabel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>What Lowth </i>says of this Prophet&#8217;s style,
that <i>&#8220;it </i>is altogether prosaic,&#8221; is not strictly true; for
there are some parts highly poetical. See
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;370106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Haggai
1:6<i>, </i>and from 8 to 11 inclusive. &#8220;The style of HAGGAI<i>,&#8221;
</i>observes <i>Henderson, </i>&#8220;is not distinguished by any peculiar
excellence; yet he is not destitute of pathos and vehemence, when reproving his
countrymen for their negligence, exhorting them to the performance of
duty.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though in some instances our COMMENTATOR may not give
the precise import of a passage, yet he never advances but what is consistent
with Divine Truth, and always useful and practical, and often what betokens a
profound acquaintance with the operations of the human mind under the various
trials and temptations which we meet with in this life; so that the observations
made are ever interesting and instructive. CALVIN never deduces from a passage
what is in itself erroneous or unsound, though in all cases he may not deduce
what the text may legitimately warrant. There is, therefore, nothing dangerous
in what he advances, though it. may not be included in the passage explained.
But for the most part his application of doctrine is what may be fully
justified, and is often very striking, and calculated to instruct and
edify.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some may think that our Author does not always give
that full range of meaning to the promises and predictions which he explains. A
reason for this may probably be found in the fact, that most of the Commentators
who had preceded him had indulged in very great extravagancies on the subject;
and a reaction generally drives men to an opposite extreme. But it is very
seldom that CALVIN can be justly charged with a fault of this kind; for,
entertaining the profoundest veneration for the Word of God, he strictly
followed what he conceived the words imported, and what he apprehended to be the
general drift of a passage. Possibly, in the estimation of those who possess a
very vivid imagination, he may be thought to have kept too closely to what the
text and the context require; but in explaining the Divine Oracles, nothing is
more to be avoided than to let loose the imagination, and nothing is more
necessary than to possess a sound judgment, and to exercise it in the fear of
God, and with prayer for His guidance and direction.</font><br></div>

HABAKKUK</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows THE PROPHET HABAKKUK; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh1</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but the
time in which he discharged his office of a Teacher is not quite certain. The
Hebrews, according to their usual manner, unhesitatingly assert that he
prophesied under the king MANASSEH; but this conjecture is not well founded. We
are however led to think that this prophecy was announced when the contumacy of
the people had become irreclaimable. It is indeed probable, from the complaint
which we shall have presently to notice, that the people had previously given
many proofs of irremediable wickedness. To me it appears evident that the
Prophet was sent, when others had in vain endeavored to correct the wickedness
of the people. But as he denounces an approaching judgement on the CHALDEANS, he
seems to have prophesied either under Manasseh or under the other kings before
the time of ZEDECHIAH; but we cannot fix the exact time. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh2</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The substance of the Book may be thus stated: &#8212;
In the First chapter he complains of the rebellious obstinacy of the people, and
deplores the corruptions which then prevailed; he then appears as the herald of
God, and warns the Jews of their approaching ruin; he afterwards applies
consolation, as God would punish the Chaldeans when their pride became
intolerable. In the second chapter he exhorts the godly to patience by his own
example, and speaks at large of the near ruin of Babylon; and in the third
chapter, as we shall see, he turns to supplication and prayer.</font><br></div>

words.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">CHAPTER

<div><font face="Palatino">THE greater part of interpreters refer this burden to
the Chaldeans and the monarchy of Babylon; but of this view I do not approve,
and a good reason compels me to dissent from their opinion: for as the Prophet
addresses the Jews, and without any addition calls his prophecy a burden, there
is no doubt but that he refers to them. Besides, their view seems wholly
inconsistent, because the Prophet dreads the future devastation of the land, and
complains to God for allowing His chosen and elect people to be so cruelly
treated. What others think is more correct &#8212; that this burden belonged to
the Jews.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What the Prophet understood by the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">a&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mesha</i>, has been elsewhere stated. Habakkuk then reproves here his own
nation, and shows that they had in vain disdainfully resisted all God&#8217;s
prophets, for they would at length find that their threatening would be
accomplished. The burden, then, which the Prophet Habakkuk saw, was this &#8212;
That God, after having exercised long forbearance towards the Jews, would at
length be the punisher of their many sins. It now follows

</table></div>
<div><br><font face="Palatino">As I have already reminded you, interpreters
think that the Prophet speaks here of future things, as though he had in his
view the calamity which he afterwards mentions; but this is too strained a
meaning; I therefore doubt not but that the Prophet expostulates here with God
for so patiently indulging a reprobate people. For though the Prophets felt a
real concern for the safety of the people, there is yet no doubt but that they
burned with zeal for the glory of God; and when they saw that they had to
contend with refractory men, they were then inflamed with a holy displeasure,
and undertook the cause of God; and they implored His aid to bring a remedy when
the state of things had become desperate. I therefore consider that the Prophet
here solicits God to visit these many sins in which the people had hardened
themselves. And hence we conclude that he had previously exercised his office of
a teacher; for it would have been otherwise improper for him to begin his work
with such a complaint and expostulation. He had then by experience found that
the people were extremely perverse. When he saw that there was no hope of
amendment, and that the state of things was becoming daily worse, burning with
zeal for God, he gave full vent to his feelings. Before, then, he threatens the
people with the future vengeance of God, he withdraws himself, as it were, from
intercourse with men, and in private addresses God himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must bear this first in mind, that the Prophet
relates here the secret colloquy he had with God: but it ought not to be
ascribed to an unfeeling disposition, that in these words he wished to hasten
God&#8217;s vengeance against his own kindred; for it behaved the Prophet not
only to be solicitous for the salvation of the people, but also to feel a
concern for the glory of God, yea, to burn with a holy zeal. As, then, he had in
vain labored for a length of time, I doubt not but that, being as it were far
removed from the presence of all witnesses, he here asks God, how long he
purposed thus to bear with the wickedness of the people. We now apprehend the
design of the Prophet and the import of his words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How long, Jehovah, shall I cry,
and thou hearest not? How long shall I cry to thee for violence, that is, on
account of violence, and thou savest not?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We
hence learn, that the Prophet had often prayed God to correct the people for
their wickedness, or to contrive some means to prevent so much licentiousness in
sinning. It is indeed probable that the Prophet had prayed as long as there was
any hope; but when he saw that things were past recovery, he then prayed more
earnestly that God would undertake the office of a judge, and chastise the
people. For though the Prophet really condoled with those who perished, and was
touched, as I have said, with a serious concern for their public safety, he yet
preferred the glory of God: when, therefore, he saw that boldness in sin
increased through impunity, and that the Jews in a manlier mocked God when they
found that they could sin without being punished, he could not endure such
unbridled wantonness. Besides, the Prophet may have spoken thus, not only as
expressing his own feeling, but what he felt in common with all the godly; as
though he had undertaken here a public duty, and utters a complaint common to
all the faithful: for it is probable that all the godly, in so disordered a
state of things, mourned alike.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How long, then, shall I cry? How
long, he says, shall I cry on account of
violence?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, When all things are in
disorder, when there is now no regard for equity and justice, but men abandon
themselves, as it were with loose reins, unto all kinds of wickedness, how long,
Lord, wilt thou take no notice? But in these words the Prophet not only egresses
his own feelings, but makes this kind of preface, that the Jews might better
understand that the time of vengeance was come; for they were become not only
altogether intolerable to God, but also to his servants. God indeed had
suspended his judgement, though he had been often solicited to execute it by his
Prophet. It hence appears, that their wickedness had made such advances that it
would be no wonder if they were now severely chastised by the Lord; for they had
by their sins not only provoked him against them, but also all the godly and the
faithful.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How long wilt thou show me
iniquity, and make me to see trouble?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here the
Prophet briefly relates the cause of his indignation, &#8212; that he could not,
without great grief, yea, without anguish of mind, behold such evils prevailing
among God&#8217;s chosen people; for they who apply this to the Chaldeans, do so
strainedly, and without any necessity, and they have not observed the reason
which I have stated &#8212; that the Prophet does not here teach the Jews, but
prepares them for a coming judgement, as they could not but see that they were
justly condemned, since they were proved guilty by the cry and complaints made
by all the godly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this passage teaches us, that all who really
serve and love God, ought, according to the Prophet&#8217;s example, to burn
with holy indignation whenever they see wickedness reigning without restraint
among men, and especially in the Church of God. There is indeed nothing which
ought to cause us more grief than to see men raging with profane contempt for
God, and no regard had for his law and for divine truth, and all order trodden
under foot. When therefore such a confusion appears to us, we must feel roused,
if we have in us any spark of religion. If it be objected, that the Prophet
exceeded moderation, the obvious answer is this, &#8212; that though he freely
pours forth his feelings, there was nothing wrong in this before God, at least
nothing wrong is imputed to him: for wherefore do we pray, but that each of us
may unburden his cares, his griefs, and anxieties, by pouring them into the
bosom of God? Since, then, God allows us to deal so familiarly with him, nothing
wrong ought to be ascribed to our prayers when we thus freely pour forth our
feelings, provided the bridle of obedience keeps us always within due limits, as
was the case with the Prophet; for it is certain that he was retained under the
influence of real kindness. Jeremiah did indeed pray with unrestrained fervor
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;241510&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
15:10): but his case was different from that of our Prophet; for he proceeds not
here to an excess, as Jeremiah did when he cursed the day of his birth, and when
he expostulated with God for being made a man of contention. But our Prophet
undertakes here the defense of justice; for he could not endure the law of God
to be made a sport, and men to allow themselves every liberty in
sinning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, see that the Prophet can be justly
excused, though he expostulates here with God, for God does not condemn this
freedom in our prayers; but, on the contrary, the end of praying is, that every
one of us pour forth, as it is said in the Psalms, his heart before God. As,
then, we communicate our cares and sorrows to God, it is no wonder that the
Prophet, according to the manner of men, says, Why dost thou show me iniquity,
and make me to see trouble? Trouble is to be taken here in an active sense, and
the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">mybt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tabith</i>, has a transitive meaning. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh3</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some
render it, Why dost thou look on trouble? as though the Prophet indignantly bore
the connivance of God. But the context necessarily requires that this verb
should be taken in a transitive sense. &#8220;Why dost thou show me
iniquity?&#8221; and then, &#8220;and makest me to look on violence?&#8221; He
says afterwards, in the third place, in my sight is violence. But I have said,
that the word trouble is to be taken actively; for the prophet means not that he
was worn out with weariness, but that wicked men were troublesome to the good
and the innocent, as it is usually the case when a freedom in sinning
prevails.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>why</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>are violence and plunder
in my sight? and there is he who excites, etc.?</i></font><font face="Palatino">
The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">a&ccedil;n</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nusha</i> means not here to undertake, as some render it; but, on the
contrary, to raise. Others render it, &#8220;Who supports,&#8221; but this is
frigid. Therefore the translation which I have stated is the most suitable
&#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And why is there one who
excites strife and contention?</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet here accuses them only of sins
against the second table of the law: he speaks not of the superstitions of
people, and of the corrupted worship of God; but he briefly says, that they had
no regard for what was just and right: for the stronger any one was, the more he
distressed the helpless and the innocent. It was then for this reason that he
mentioned iniquity, trouble, plunder, violence, contention, strife. In short,
the Prophet here deplores, that there was now no equity and no brotherly
kindness among the people, but that robberies, rapines, and tyrannical violence
prevailed everywhere. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet confirms here what I have already
said, and brings an excuse for his zeal; he proves that he was not without
reason led to so great a warmth; for he saw that the law of God was trodden as
it were under foot; he saw men so hardened in every kind of sin, that all
religion and the fear of God had nearly been extinguished. Hence I have already
said, that the Prophet was not here impelled by a carnal passion, as it often
happens to us, when we defend ourselves from wrongs done to us; for when any one
of us is injured, he immediately becomes incensed, while, at the same time, we
suffer God&#8217;s law to be a sport, His whole truth to be despised, and
everything that is just to be violated. We are only tender on what concerns us
individually, and in the meantime we easily forgive when God is wronged, and His
truth despised. But the Prophet shows here that he was not made indignant
through a private feeling, but because he could not bear the profanation of
God&#8217;s worship and the violation of His holy law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore says, that the law was dissolved or
weakened, as though he said that God&#8217;s law had no longer any authority or
regard. Let us hence learn to rouse up ourselves, for we are very frigid, when
the ungodly openly despise and even mock God. As, then, we are too unconcerned
in this respect, let us learn, by the Prophet&#8217;s example, to stimulate
ourselves. For even Paul also shows, in an indirect way, that there is just
reason for indignation &#8212; &#8216;Be ye angry,&#8217; he says, &#8216;and
sin not,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490426&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:26); that is, every one ought to regard his own sins, so as to become an enemy
to himself; and he ought also to feel indignant whenever he sees God
offended.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This rule the Prophet now follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Weakened</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is the
law</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh4</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We know
that when a sinful custom prevails, there is but little authority in what is
taught: nor are human laws only despised when men&#8217;s audacity breaks
through all restraints, but even the very law of God is esteemed as nothing; for
they think that everything erroneously done, by the consent of all, is lawful.
We now then see that the Prophet felt great anguish of mind, like holy Lot
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
19:1-38.), when he saw every regard for God almost extinct in the land, and
especially among the chosen people, whom God had above all others consecrated to
himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgement goes not forth
perpetually</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Absurdly do many regard this as
having been said in the person of foolish men, who think that there is no such
thing as divine providence, when things in the world are in a disordered state:
but the Prophet simply says, that all justice was suppressed. We have nearly the
very same complaint in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235904&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
59:4. He then says, that judgement did not go forth perpetually, because the
ungodly thought that no account was to be given by them. When, therefore, any
one dared to say a word against them, they immediately boiled with rage, and
like wild beasts fiercely attacked him. All then were silent, and nearly made
dumb, when the ungodly thus prevailed and gathered boldness from the daily
practice of licentiousness. Hence, &#8216;Go forth perpetually does not
judgement;&#8217; that is, &#8220;O Lord, things are now past hope, and there
appears to be no end to our evils, except thou comest soon and applies a remedy
beyond what our flesh can conceive.&#8221;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the
wicked</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>surround the
righteous</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, when there was any one who
continued to retain some regard for religion and justice, immediately the wicked
rose up against him on every side and surrounded him before and behind; so it
happened, that no one dared to oppose the torrent, though frauds, rapines,
outrages, cruelty, and even murders everywhere prevailed; if any righteous men
still remained, they dared not come forth into the public, for the wicked beset
them on all sides.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore perverted judgement
goes forth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet now rises higher, that
even the rulers themselves increased the rage for evils, and as it were supplied
fuel to their wickedness, as they confounded all distinction between right and
wrong: for the Prophet speaks not here of private wrongs which any one might
have done, but he speaks of the very rulers, as though he said, &#8220;There
might have been one remedy, the judges might have checked so great an audacity;
but they themselves stretch out their hands to the wicked and help them.&#8221;
Hence the tribunals, which ought to have been sacred, were become as it were
dens of thieves. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fp&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>meshiphith</i> is taken properly in a good sense: Is not judgement then a
desirable thing? Yes, but the Prophet says, that it was perverted. It was then
by way of concession that judgement is mentioned; for he afterwards adds a word
to it, by which he shows that the administration of the laws was evil and
injurious: for when any one oppressed had recourse to the assistance of the
laws, he was plundered. In short, the Prophet means, that all things in private
and in public were corrupt among the people. It now follows

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet turns his discourse to the Jews,
after having related the private colloquy, in which he expostulated with God for
having so patiently borne with the obstinate wickedness of the nation. Being now
as it were furnished with God&#8217;s command, (as the case really was,) he
performs the office of a herald, and proclaims an approaching destruction. He
indeed adopts a preface, which ought to have awakened drowsy and careless minds.
He says &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>look, see, be
astonished, be astonished</i></font><font face="Palatino">; these repetitions do
not a little increase the alarm; he twice bids them to see, and he twice exhorts
them to be astonished, or to wonder. He then briefly proclaims the judgement of
God, which he afterwards more fully describes. We now, then, perceive the object
of the Prophet, and the manner in which he proceeds with his
subject.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he bids those among the nations to behold, as
though he had said, that they were unworthy to be taught in the school of God;
he therefore appointed other masters for them, even the Chaldeans, as we shall
presently see. He might have said &#8212; look to God; but as the Prophet had so
long spent his labor in vail and without profit while teaching them, he sets
over them the Chaldeans as teachers. Behold, he says, ye teachers among the
Gentiles. There is here indeed an implied contrast, as thought he said &#8212;
&#8220;God has hitherto often recalled you to himself, and has offered himself
to you, but ye have refused to look to him; now then, as he is wearied with
exercising patience so long, he appoints for you other teachers; learn now from
the Gentiles what ye leave hitherto refused to learn from the holy mouth of God
himself&#8221;.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Greek translators no doubt read
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yrwgb</font><font face="Palatino">,
for their version is &#8212; &#8220;Behold, ye despisers.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But in
Hebrew there is no ambiguity as to the word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And wonder ye,
wonder</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh6</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By these
words the prophets express how dreadful God&#8217;s judgement would be, which
would astonish the Jews themselves. Had they not been extremely refractory they
might have quietly received instruction, for God would have addressed them by
his prophets, as though they had been his own children. They might thus, with
composed minds, have listened to God speaking to them; but the time was now come
when they were to be filled with astonishment. We hence see that the Prophet
meant this in a few words &#8212; that there would be a new mode of teaching,
which would overwhelm the unwilling with astonishment, because they would not
endure to be ruled in a gentle manner, when the Lord required nothing from them
but to render themselves teachable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">After having said that God&#8217;s judgement would be
dreadful, he adds that it was nigh at hand &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
work</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will he work in your
days</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. They had already been often warned
of that vengeance, but as they had for a long time disregarded it, they did ever
remain sunk in their own self-delusions, like men who are wont to protract time
and hunt on every side for some excuse for indulging themselves. So then when
the people became hardened against all threatening, they thought that God would
ever bear with them; hence the Prophet expressly declares, that the execution of
that which they regarded as a fable was near at hand &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will
work</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this work in your
days</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then subjoins &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye will not believe when it shall
be told you</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, God will execute such a
punishment as will be incredible and exceed all belief. The Prophet no doubt
alludes to the want of faith in the people, and indirectly reproves them, as
though he said &#8212; &#8220;Ye have hitherto denied faith to God&#8217;s word,
but ye shall at length find that he has told the truth; and this ye shall find
to your astonishment; for as his word has been counted by you incredible, so
also incredible shall be his judgement.&#8221; In short, the Prophet intimates
this &#8212; that though the Prophets had been derided by the Jews, and despised
as inventors of fables, yet nothing had been said by them which would not be
fully accomplished. This reward then was to be paid to all the unbelieving; for
God would in the most dreadful manner avenge their impiety, so that they should
themselves be astonished and become an astonishment to others. We now perceive
what the Prophet meant by saying that the Jews would not believe the work of God
when told them, that is, the vengeance which he will presently
describe.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage is quoted by Paul, and is applied to the
punishment then awaiting the Jews; for Paul, after having offered Christ to
them, and seeing that many of them regarded the preaching of Gospel with scorn,
added these words &#8212; &#8220;see,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and be astonished,
for God will work a work in your days which ye shall not believe.&#8221; Paul at
the same time made a suitable application of the Prophet&#8217;s words; for as
God had once threatened his people by his Prophet Habakkuk, so he was still like
himself; and since had so severely vindicated the contempt of his law as to his
ancient people, he could not surely bear with the impiety of that people whom he
found to have acted so malignantly and so ungratefully, yea so wantonly and
perversely, as to reject his grace; for this was the last remedy for the Jews.
No wonder then that Paul set before them this vengeance, when the Jews of his
time persisted through their unbelief to reject Christ. Now follows the
explanation -</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">This verse is added by the Prophet as an
explanation; for it was not enough to speak generally of God&#8217;s work,
without reminding them that their destruction by the Chaldeans was nigh at hand.
He does not indeed in this verse explain what would be the character of that
judgement which he had mentioned in the last verse
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;350105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
1:5; but he will do this in what follows. Now the Prophets differ from Moses in
this respect, for they show, as it were by the finger, what he threatened
generally, and they declare the special judgements of God; as it is indeed
evident from the demonstrative adverb, &#8220;Behold.&#8221; How necessary this
was, we may gather from the perverseness of that people; for how distinctly
soever the Prophets showed to them God&#8217;s judgements, so that they saw them
with their eyes, yet so great was their insensibility, that they despised
denunciations so apparent. What, then, would have been done, if the Prophets had
only said in general, &#8216;God will not spare you!&#8217; This, then, is the
reason why the Prophet, having spoken of God&#8217;s terrible vengeance, now
declares in express terms, that the Chaldeans were already armed by Him to
execute His judgement. The rest we leave for
tomorrow.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>

we have provoked to take vengeance, to be indeed our Father: and may we be so
preserved by thee in this world, that having at length put off all our vices, we
may attain to that perfection of purity, to which thou invites us; and thus lead

Amen.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE HUNDRED
AND SEVENTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">IN the lecture of yesterday the Prophet began to show
from whom the Jews were to expect the vengeance of God, even from the Chaldeans,
who would come, not by their own instinct, but by the hidden impulse of God. God
indeed testifies that he should be the author of this war, and that the
Chaldeans would fight, as it were, under his auspices. <i>I am he</i>, <i>he
says</i>, <i>who excites</i>, etc. Then by calling the Chaldeans
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a bitter and hasty
nation</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he intended seriously to terrify the
Jews, who had heedlessly despised all threatenings. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh7</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It was
not indeed a subject of praise to the Chaldeans, that they were bitter and
impetuous: but the Lord could turn these vices to a good purpose, inasmuch as he
elicits light from darkness. When, therefore, we read that the Chaldeans were
bitter, and also hasty, God thus intimates that he can employ the vices of men
in executing his judgements, and yet contract hence no spot nor blemish; for we
cannot possibly pollute him with our filth, as he scatters it far away by the
brightness of his justice and equity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall march through the
latitudes</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh8</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
of the earth, to possess habitations not their
own</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He means that there would be no obstacles
in the way of the Chaldeans, but that they would spread themselves over the
whole earth, and occupy regions far remote. For they who fear, dare not thus
disperse themselves, but, on the contrary, they advance cautiously with a
collected army; but those, who have already obtained victory, march on to lay
waste the land. This is what the Prophet says the Chaldeans would
do.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning is &#8212; that they would not come to
carry on an uncertain warfare, but that they would enjoy a victory; for they
would by an impetuous course fill the land, so as to occupy tents or habitations
not their own. It was indeed a matter of blame in the Chaldeans, that they thus
made inroads on their own neighbors: but, as I have said, God intended only to
fill the Jews with terror, because he found that all threatenings were despised.
He therefore meant to show how terrible the Chaldeans would be, and he confirms
the same in the next verse.</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">By saying that the Chaldeans would be terrible
and dreadful, he praises not their virtues; but, as I have already reminded you,
he shows that they would be prepared to do his service by executing his
vengeance: and he so regulated his judgement, that he used their cruelty for a
good purpose. Thus we see that the worst of men are in God&#8217;s hand, as
Satan is, who is their head; and yet that God is not implicated in their
wickedness, as some insane men maintain; for they say &#8212; That if God
governs the world by his providence, he becomes thus the author of sin, and
men&#8217;s sins are to be ascribed to him. But Scripture teaches us far
otherwise, &#8212; that the wicked are led here and there by the hidden power of
God, and that yet the fault is in them, when they do anything in a deceitful and
cruel manner, and that God ever remains just, whatever use he may make of
instruments, yea, the very worst.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But when the Prophet adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>its judgement would be from the
nation itself</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he means that the Chaldeans
would act according to their own will. When any one indeed obeys laws, and
willingly submits to them, he will freely allow either judges or umpires in case
of a dispute; but he who will have all things done according to his own purpose
repudiates all judges. The Prophet therefore means, that the Chaldeans would be
their own judges, so that the Jews or others would complain in vain for any
wrongs done to them. &#8220;They shall be,&#8221; he says, &#8220;their own
judges, and shall execute judgement, for they will not accept any
arbitrators.&#8221; The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgement</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
taken in a good sense, is put here for law (<i>jus</i>); as though he said,
&#8220;Whatever the Chaldeans will claim for themselves, theirs shall it be; for
no one will dare to interfere, and they will not submit to the will of others;
but their power shall be for law, and their sword for a tribunal.&#8221; We now
understand the Prophet&#8217;s meaning; and we must ever bear in mind what I
have already said, &#8212; That God had no participation in these vices; but it
was necessary that the stubbornness of an irreclaimable people should be thus
corrected, or at least broken down. The Lord in the meantime could use such
instruments in such a way as to preserve some moderation in his judgements. It

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The design of these figurative expressions is the
same. The Prophet had spoken of the cruelty of those enemies whom the Jews
despised: he now adds, that they would be so active as to surpass in velocity
both leopards and eagles, or to be at least equal to them. He then says first,
that their horses would be swifter then leopards. The Jews might have eluded his
threatenings, or at least have cherished their insensibility by a vain
confidence, as we see how this vice prevails in the world; for they might have
thought thus within themselves, &#8220;The Chaldeans are far away, and the
danger of which the Prophet speaks cannot be so near at hand.&#8221; Hence he
declares that their horses would be swifter than leopards.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they would be fiercer than the
evening wolves</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The wolf is a rapacious animal;
and when he ranges about all the day in vain seeking what he may devour, then in
the evening hunger kindles his rage. There is, therefore, nothing more dreadful
than hungry wolves. But, as I have said, except they find some prey about the
evening, they become the more furious. We shall meet with the same simile in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;360301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zephaniah
3:1. We now see the drift of the Prophet&#8217;s words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their horsemen would be
numerous</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh9</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He now
sets forth their power, lest the Jews should have recourse to vain hopes,
because they might obtain some help either from the Egyptians or other
neighbors. The Prophet shows that all such hopes would be wholly vain; for had
they gathered auxiliaries from all quarters, still the Chaldeans would exceed
them in power and number.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their horsemen would come from a
distance</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Though they should have a long
journey, yet weariness would not hinder and delay them in coming from a remote
part. The toil of travelling would not weaken them, until they reached Judea.
How so? Because it will fly, he says, (he speaks throughout of the nation
itself,) </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as an eagle hastening to
devour</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This metaphor is also most suitable to
the present purpose; for it signifies, that wherever the Chaldeans saw a prey,
they would instantly come, as an eagle to any carcass it may observe. Let the
distance be what it may, as soon as it sees a prey, it takes a precipitate
flight, and is soon present to devour; for the rapidity of eagles, as it is well
known, is astonishing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see that what we learn from the
Prophet&#8217;s words is substantially this, &#8212; that God&#8217;s judgement
ought to have been feared, because he purposed to employ the Chaldeans as his
servants, whose cruel disposition and inhumanity would be dreadful: he also
shows that the Chaldeans would be far superior in power and number; and in third
place he makes it known, that they would possess an astonishing rapidity, and
that though length of journey might be deemed a hindrance, they would yet be
like eagles, which come like an arrow from heaven to earth, whenever a prey is
observed by them. And eagles are not only rapid in their flight, but they
possess also sharpness of sight; for we know that the eyes of eagles are
remarkably keen and strong: and it is said that they cast away their young, if
they find that they cannot look steadily at the sun; for they regard them as
spurious. The Prophet then intimates that the Chaldeans would from a distance
observe their prey: as the eagles, who are endued with incredible quickness of
sight, see from mid air every carcass lying on the ground; so also would the
Chaldeans quickly discover a prey, and come upon it in an instant. Let us
proceed.</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">By saying that they would come to the prey, he
means that they would have no trouble or labor, for they would be victorious
before they had any contest, or had any war with their enemies. The meaning then
is, that the Chaldeans would not come to spend much time in warfare, as when
there is a strong power to resist; but that they would only come for the booty,
for the Jews would be frightened, and instantly submit themselves. And by these
words the Prophet intimates, that there would be neither strength nor courage in
a people so refractory: for God thus debilitates the hearts of those who
fiercely resist his word. Whenever, then, men become strong against God, he so
melts their hearts, that they cannot resist their fellow-mortals; and thus he
mocks their confidence, or rather their madness. Lest then the Jews should still
harbor any hope from the chance of war, the Prophet says that the Chaldeans
would only come for the prey, for all would become subject to
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the meeting of their faces would
be like the oriental wind</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hmg</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gime</i>, means what is opposite; and its derivative signifies meeting or
opposition (<i>occursus</i>.) We indeed know that the east wind was very
injurious to the land of Judea, that it dried up vegetation, yea, that it
consumed as it were the whole produce of the earth. The violence of that wind
was also very great. Hence whenever the Prophets wished to express a violent
impetuosity, they added this comparison of the east wind. It was therefore the
same as though the Prophet had said that the Jews would now in vain flatter
themselves; for as soon as they perceived the blowing of the east wind, they
would flee away, knowing that they would be wholly unable to stand against it.

<div><font face="Palatino">Hence follows what is added by the Prophets,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shall gather the captivity
like the sand</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, the king of Babylon
shall without any trouble subdue all the people, and collect captives
innumerable as the sand; for by the sand of the sea is meant an immense number
of men. In short, the Prophet shows that the Jews were already conquered;
because their striving and their contest had been with God, whom they had so
often and so obstinately provoked; and also, because God had chosen for himself
such servants as excelled in quickness, and power, and cruelty. This is the sum
of the whole. He afterwards adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet concludes the subject which he has
been hitherto pursuing. He says that the Chaldeans would not come to engage in a
doubtful war, but only to triumph over conquered nations. We indeed know that
the Jews, though not excelling either in number or in riches, were yet so proud,
that they looked down, as it were, with contempt on other nations, and we also
know, that they vainly trusted in vain helps; for as they were in confederacy
with the Egyptians, they thought themselves to be beyond the reach of danger.
Hence the Prophet says, that kings and princes would be only a sport to the
Chaldeans, and their fortresses would be only a derision to them. How so? For
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they will gather
dust</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says; that is, will make a mound of
the dust of the earth, and will thus penetrate into all fortified
cities.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short the Prophet intended to cut off every hope
from the Jews, that they might humble themselves before God; or he intended to
take away every excuse if they repented not, as it indeed happened; for we know
that they did not repent notwithstanding these warnings, until vengeance at
length fully overtook them. He then adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now begins to give some comfort to
the faithful, lest they should succumb under so grievous evils. He has hitherto
directed his discourse to that irreclaimable people, but he now turns to the
remnant; for there were always among them some of the faithful, though few, whom
God never neglected; yea, for their sake often he sent his prophets; for though
the multitude derived no benefit, yet the faithful understood that God did not
threaten in vain, and were thus retained in his fear. This was the reason why
the prophets were wont, after having spoken generally, to come down to the
faithful, and as it were to comfort them apart and privately. And this
difference ought to be noticed, as we have said elsewhere; for when the prophets
denounce God&#8217;s wrath, the discourse then is directed indiscriminately to
the whole body of the people; but when they add promises, it is then as though
they called the faithful to a private conference, and spake in their ear what
had been committed to them by the Lord. The truth might have been useful to all,
had they returned to a right mind; but as almost the whole people had hardened
themselves in their vices, and as Satan had rendered stupid the minds and hearts
of nearly all, it behaved the Prophet to have a special regard to the chosen of
God. We now then apprehend his design.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>now he will change his
spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He bids the faithful to entertain hope,
because the Chaldeans, after having poured forth all their fury, will be
punished by the Lord for their arrogance, for it will be intolerable. This may
indeed seem frigid to ungodly men; for what wonder is it that the Chaldeans,
after having obtained so many victories, should grow haughty and exult in their
success, as is commonly the case? But as this is a fixed principle with us, that
men&#8217;s pride becomes intolerable to God when they extremely exult and
preserve no moderation &#8212; this is a very powerful argument &#8212; that is,
that whosoever thus raises his horns shall suddenly be laid prostrate by the
Lord. And Scripture also ever sets this before us, that God beats down
supercilious pride, and does this that we may know that destruction is nigh all
the ungodly, when they thus grow violently mad, and know not that they are
mortals. It was then for this reason that the Prophet mentions what he says
here; it was that the faithful might hope for some end to the violence of their
enemies, for God would check their pride when they should transgress. But he
says &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>then He will change
his spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">; not that there was before any
humility in the Chaldeans, but that success inebriated them, yea, and deprived
them of all reason. And it is a common thing that a person who has fortune as it
were in his hand, forgets himself, and thinks himself no longer a mortal. Great
kings do indeed confess that they are men; but we see how madness lays hold on
them; for, as I have said, being deluded by prosperity, they deem themselves to
be nothing less than gods.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet refers here to the king of Babylon and
all his people. He will change, he says, his spirit; that is, success will take
away from him whatever reason and moderation he had. Now since the proud betray
themselves and their disposition when fortune smiles on them, let us learn to
form our judgement of men according to this experiment. If we would judge
rightly of any man we must see how he bears good and bad fortune; for it may be
that he who has borne adversity with a patient, calm and resigned mind, will
disappoint us in prosperity, and will so elate himself as to be wholly another
man. The Prophet then does not without reason speak of a change of spirit; for
though the Chaldeans were before proud, they were not so extremely haughty as
when their pride passed all bounds, after their many victories. He will change
then his spirit; not that the Chaldeans were another kind of people, but that
the Lord thus discovered their madness which was before hid.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he will pass
over</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet intended to express that when
the Lord suffered the Chaldeans to rule far and wide, a way was thus opened for
his judgements, which is far different from the judgement of the flesh. For the
more power men acquire the more boldness they assume; and it seemed to tend to
the establishing of their power that they knew how to use their success. But the
Lord, as I have said, was secretly preparing a way to destroy them, when they
thus became proud and passed all bounds; hence the Prophet does not simply
condemn the haughtiness and pride of the Chaldeans, but shows that a way is
already open, as it were, for God&#8217;s judgement, that he might destroy them,
inasmuch as they would render themselves intolerable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and shall act
impiously</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ashem</i> I refer to the end of the verse &#8212; where he ascribes his power
to his own god. And the Prophet adds this explanation, in order that the Jews
might know what kind of sin would be the sin of the king of Babylon. He then
charges him with sacrilege, because he would think that he had become the
conqueror of Judea through the kindness of his idol, so that he would make
nothing of the power and glory of the true God. Since then the Babylonian would
transfer God&#8217;s glory to his own idol, his own ruin would be thus made
ripe; for the Lord would undertake his own cause, and execute vengeance on such
a sacrilege; for he speaks here no doubt of the Babylonian, and according to his
view, when he says &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This his strength is that of his
god</i></font><font face="Palatino">; but were any inclined to explain this of
the true God, as some do, he would make a harsh and a forced construction; for
the Babylonians did not worship the true God, but were devoted, as it is well
known, to their own superstitions. The Prophet then no doubt makes known here to
the faithful the pride with which the Babylonians would become elated, and thus
provoke God&#8217;s wrath against themselves; and also the sacrilegious boasting
in which they would indulge, ascribing the victories given them to their own
idols, which could not be done without daring reproach to the true God.

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now exulting, according to what all
the faithful feel, shows the effect of what he has just mentioned; for as
ungodly men wantonly rise up against God, and, while Satan renders them insane,
throw out swelling words of vanity, as though they could by speaking confound
earth and heaven; so also the faithful derive a holy confidence from God&#8217;s
word, and set themselves against them, and overcome their ferocity by the
magnanimity and firmness of their own minds, so that they can intrepidly boast
that they are happy and blessed even in the greatest miseries.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This then is what the prophet means when he adds
&#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Art not thou our
God?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The question is much more emphatical than
if he had simply declared that the true God was worshipped in Judea, and would
therefore be the protector of that nation; for when the Prophet puts a question,
he means, according to what is commonly understood in Hebrew, that the thing
admits of no doubt. &#8220;What! art not thou our God?&#8221; We hence see that
there is a contrast between the wicked and impious boastings in which the
profane indulge, and the holy confidence which the faithful have, who exult in
their God. But that the discourse is addressed to God rather than to the ungodly
is not done without reason, for it would have been useless to contend with the
wicked. This is indeed sometimes necessary, for when the reprobate openly
reproach God we cannot restrain ourselves; nor is it right that we refrain from
testifying that we regard all their slanders as of no account; but we cannot so
courageously oppose their audacity as when we have the matter first settled
between us and God, and be able to say with the Prophets &#8212; &#8220;Thou art
our God.&#8221; Whosoever then would boldly contend with the ungodly must first
have to do with God, and confirm and ratify as it were that compact which God
has proposed to us, even that we are his people, and that he in his turn will be
always our God. As then God thus covenants with us, our faith must be really
made firm, and then let us go forth and contend against all the ungodly. This is
the order which the Prophet observes here, and what is to be observed by us
&#8212; Art not thou our God?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He also adds &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>long
since</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;dqm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mekodam</i>, by which word the Prophet invites the attention of the faithful
to the covenant which God had made, not yesterday nor the day before that, with
his people, but many ages before, even 400 years before he redeemed their
fathers from Egypt. Since then the favor of God to the Jews had been confirmed
for so long a time, it is not without reason that the Prophet says here &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou art our God from the
beginning</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, &#8220;the religion which
we embrace has been delivered to us by thy hands, and we know that thou art its
author; for our faith recumbs not on the opinion of men, but is sustained by thy
word. Since, then, we have found so often and in so many ways, and for so many
years, that thou art our God, there is now no room for doubt.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh12</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then subjoins &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we shall not
die</i></font><font face="Palatino">. What the Jews say of this place, that it
had been corrected by the scribes, seems not to me probable; for the reason they
give is very frivolous. They suppose that it was written lo tamut, Thou diest
not, and that the letter nun had been introduced, &#8220;we shall not
die,&#8221; because the expression offended those scribes, as though the Prophet
compared God to men, and ascribed to him a precarious immortality; but they
would have been very foolish critics. I therefore think that the word was
written by the Prophet as we now read it, Thou art our God, we shall not die.
Some explain this as a prayer &#8212; &#8220;let us not die;&#8221; and the
future is often taken in this sense in Hebrew; but this exposition is not
suitable to the present passage; for the Prophet, as I have already said, rises
up here as a conqueror, and disperses as mists all those foolish boastings of
which he had been speaking, as though he said &#8212; &#8220;we shall not die,
for we are under the protection of God.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have already explained why he turns his discourse
to God: but this is yet the conclusion of the argument, &#8212; that as God had
adopted that people, and received them into favor, and testified that he would
be their defender, the Prophet confidently draws this inference, &#8212; that
this people cannot perish, for they are preserved by God. No power of the world,
nor any of its defences, can indeed afford us this security; for whatever forces
may all mortals bring either to protect or help us, they shall all perish
together with us. Hence, the protection of God alone is that which can deliver
us from the danger of death. We now perceive why the Prophet joins together
these two things, &#8220;Thou art our God,&#8221; and &#8220;We shall not
die;&#8221; nor can indeed the one be separated from the other; for when we are
under the protection of God, we must necessarily continue safe and safe for
ever; not that we shall be free from evils, but that the Lord will deliver us
from thousand deaths, and ever preserve our life in safety. When only he affords
us a taste of eternal salvation, some spark of life will ever continue in our
hearts, until he shows to us, when at length redeemed, as I have already said,
from thousand deaths, the perfection of that blessed life, which is now promised
to us, but as yet is looked for, and therefore hid under the custody of
hope.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>

wicked, not only elated with prosperity, but also pouring forth blasphemies
against the living God. The Prophet then says, that those who are under
God&#8217;s protection shall not perish. Of this he felt assured within himself.
The declaration, as I have said, is much more striking, as the Prophet turns all
his thoughts towards God, than if he had publicly and loudly declared what he
testified, as it were, in a private conference.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it was not without reason that he said,
&#8220;Thou, my God, my holy one;&#8221; as though he had said, &#8220;I trust
in thee, inasmuch as I am one of thy chosen people.&#8221; He does not indeed
speak here in his own private name, but includes with himself the whole Church;
for this privilege belonged to all the children of Abraham, as they had been set
apart by the gratuitous adoption of God, and were a royal priesthood. This is
the reason why the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou, my God, my holy
one</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For the Jews were wont thus to call God,
because they had been chosen from the rest of the world. And their holiness was,
that God had deigned to take them as his people, having rejected others, while
yet there was by nature no difference between them. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh13</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is, moreover, much weight in the words which
follow, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah! for judgement
has thou set him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This temptation ever occurs
to us, whenever we strive to put our trust in God &#8212; What does this mean?
for God now forsakes us, and exposes us to the caprice of the wicked they are
allowed to do what they please, and God interferes not. How, then, can we
cherish hope under these perplexities?&#8221; The Prophet now sets up a shield
against this temptations &#8212; &#8220;Thou,&#8221; he says, &#8220;hast
appointed him for judgement.&#8221; For he ascribes it to God&#8217;s
providence, that the Assyrians had with so much wantonness wasted the land, or
would waste it when they came; for he speaks of things yet future &#8212;
&#8220;Thou,&#8221; he says, &#8220;hast appointed him for
judgement.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is a truth much needed: for Satan darkens, as
with clouds, the favor of God, when any adversity happens to us, and when God
himself thus proves our faith. But adversities are as it were clouds, excluding
us from seeing God&#8217;s fervor, as the light of the sun appears not to us
when the sky is darkened. If, indeed, the mass of evils be so great and so
thick, that our minds are overwhelmed, they are not clouds, but the thick
darkness of night. In that case our faith cannot stand firm, except the
providence of God comes to our view, so that we may know, in the midst of such
confusion, why he permits so much liberty to the wicked, and also how their
attempts may turn out, and what may be the issue. Except then we be fully
persuaded, that God by his secret providence regulates all these confusions,
Satan will a hundred times a day, yea every moment, shake that confidence which
ought to repose in God. We now see how opportunely the Prophet adds this clause.
He had said, &#8220;Art not thou our God? we shall not die.&#8221; He now
subjoins this by way of anticipation, &#8220;The Assyrians indeed do lay waste
thy land as with an unbridled wantonness, they plunder thy people, and with
impunity slay the innocent; but, O Lord, this is not done but by thy permission:
Thou overrules all these confused proceedings, nor is all this done by thee
without a cause. Thou, Jehovah,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hast for judgement appointed
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. &#8212; Judgement is to be taken for
chastisement.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet repeats the same thing,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and, being strong, thou hast for
correction established him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwx</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tsur</i> strong, in the accusative case, and give a twofold explanation. One
party apply the term to the Jews, who were to be subdued by hard means, since
they were so refractory; and hence they think that the Jews are called strong,
because they were like stones. Others give this meaning,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast made him strong to
correct</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, Thou hast given him strength,
by which he will chastise us. But as this is one of God&#8217;s titles, I doubt
not but that the two clauses correspond. He now, then, gives this name to God.
Having given him his name as an eternal God,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou,
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc.; he now calls him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>strong</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
He puts
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwx</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tsur</i> to correspond with Jehovah; and then to <i>correct</i>, to
correspond with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgement</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
We hence see how well the whole context agrees, and how the words answer, the
one to the other. Then it is,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou, strong one, hast
established him to correct</i></font><font face="Palatino">. But why does the
Prophet call him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>strong</i></font><font face="Palatino">?
though this title, as I have said, is commonly ascribed to God, yet the Prophet,
I have no doubt, had regard to the circumstances at the time. It is indeed
difficult to retain this truth, &#8212; that the world is ruled by the secret
counsel of God, when things are turned upside down: for the profane then glamour
against God, and charge him with listlessness; and others cry out, that all
things are thus changed fortuitously and at random; and hence they call fortune
blind. It is then difficult, as I have said, to retain a fast hold on this
truth. The Prophet, therefore, in order to support his own weakness, sets before
himself this title of God, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou,
the strong God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or the <i>rock</i>, etc.; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwx</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tsur</i> means properly a rock, but it is to be taken here for God of
strength. Why? &#8220;Behold, we indeed see revolutions, which not only make our
faith to totter, but also dissipate as it were all our thoughts: but how much
soever the world revolve in confusion, yet God is a rock; His purpose fails not,
nor wavers; but remains ever firm.&#8221; We now then see why the Prophet calls
God strong.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh14</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thou the strong one, he says, hast established him.
He expresses more by the word <i>established</i>, than in the first clause: for
he prepared himself with firmness against continued evils, in case God (as it
might be easily conjectured) would not give immediate relief to his people, but
add calamities to calamities. Should God then join evils to evils, the Prophet
prepares himself for perseverance; &#8220;Thou,&#8221; he says, &#8220;the
strong one hast established him;&#8221; that is, &#8220;Though the Assyrian
should not only like a whirlwind or a violent tempest rush upon us, but also
continue to oppress us, as though he were a pestilence attached to the land, or
some fixed mountain, yet thou, Lord, hast established him.&#8221; For what
purpose? <i>to correct</i>. But the Prophet could not have said this, had he not
known that God justly chastised his people. Not only for his own sake did he say
this; but he intended also, by his own example, to lead the faithful to make the
same holy and pious confession.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The two clauses of this sentence then are these, that
though the Assyrian would rage with unbridled wantonness, like a cruel wild
beast, he would yet be restrained by the hidden power of God, to whom it
peculiarly belongs to overrule by his secret providence the confusions of this
world. This is one thing. The Prophet also ascribes justice to God&#8217;s
power, and thus confesses his own guilt and that of the people; for the Lord
would justly use so severe a scourge, because the people needed such a
correction. Let us now go on &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here expostulates with God, not as at
the beginning of the chapter; for he does not here, with a holy and calm mind,
undertake the defense of God&#8217;s glory, but complains of injuries, as men do
when oppressed, who go to the judge and implore his protection. This complaint,
then, is to be distinguished from the former one; for at the beginning of the
chapter the Prophet did not plead his own cause or that of the people; but zeal
for God&#8217;s glory roused him, so that he in a manner asked God to take
vengeance on so great an obstinacy in wickedness; but he now comes down and
expresses the feelings of men; for he speaks of the thoughts and sorrows of
those who had suffered injuries under the tyranny of their
enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says, O God,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou art pure in eyes, thou
lookest not on evil</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some render the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwhf</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>theur</i> in the imperative mood,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>clear the
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino">; but they are mistaken; for the verse
contains two parts, the one contrary to the other. The Prophet reasons from the
nature of God, and then he states what is of an opposite character. Thou, God,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>art pure in
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino">; hence thou canst not look on evil; it is
not consistent with thy nature to pass by the vices of men, for every iniquity
is hateful to thee. Thus the Prophet sets before himself the nature of God. Then
he adds, that experience is opposed to this; for the wicked, he says, exult; and
while they miserably oppress the innocent, no one affords any help. How is this,
except that God sleeps in heaven, and neglects the affairs of men? We now then
understand the Prophet&#8217;s meaning in this verse. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh15</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying that God is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pure in
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he assumes what ought to be deemed
certain and indubitable by all men of piety. But as God&#8217;s justice does not
always appear, the Prophet has a struggle; and he shows that he in a manner
vacillated, for he did not see in the state of things before him what yet his
piety dictated to him, that is, that God was just and upright. It is indeed
true, that the second part of the verse borders on blasphemy: for though the
Prophet ever thought honourably and reverently of God, yet he murmurs here, and
indirectly charges God with too much tardiness, as he connived at things, while
he saw the just shamefully oppressed by the wicked. But we must notice the order
which the Prophet keeps. For by saying that God is pure in eyes, he no doubt
restrains himself. As there was danger lest this temptation should carry him too
far, he meets it in time, and includes himself, in a manner, within this
boundary &#8212; that we ought to retain a full conviction of God&#8217;s
justice. The same order is observed by Jeremiah when he says, &#8216;I know,
Lord, that thou art just, but how is it that the ungodly do thus pervert all
equity? and thou either takest no notice, or dost not apply any remedy. I would
therefore freely contend with thee.&#8217; The Prophet does not immediately
break out into such an expression as this, &#8220;O Lord, I will contend with
thee in judgement:&#8221; but before he mentions his complaint, knowing that his
feelings were strongly excited, he makes a kind of preface, and in a manner
restrains himself, that he might check that extreme ardor which might have
otherwise carried him beyond due bounds; &#8220;Thou art just, O Lord,&#8221; he
says. In a similar manner does our prophet speak here,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou art pure in eyes, so as not
to behold evil; and thou canst not look on
trouble</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou canst not look on
trouble</i></font><font face="Palatino">, we find that he confirms himself in
that truth &#8212; that the justice of God cannot be separated from his very
nature: and by saying, </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lkwt
al</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>la</i> <i>tucal</i>, &#8220;thou canst
not,&#8221; it is the same as though he had said, &#8220;Thou, O Lord, art just,
because thou art God; and God, because thou art just.&#8221; For these two
things cannot be separated, as both the eternity, and the very being of God,
cannot stand without his justice. We hence see how strenuously the Prophet
struggled against his own impetuosity, so that he might not too much indulge
himself in the complaint, which immediately follows.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For he then asks, according to the common judgement
of the flesh, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why dost thou look
on, when the ungodly devours one more just than
himself?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet here does not divest God
of his power, but speaks in doubt, and contends not so much with God as with
himself. A profane man would have said, &#8220;There is no God, there is no
providence,&#8221; or, &#8220;He cares not for the world, he takes his pleasure
in heaven.&#8221; But the Prophet says, &#8220;Thou seest, Lord.&#8221; Hence he
ascribes to God what peculiarly belongs to him &#8212; that he does not neglect
the world which he has created. At the same time he here inclines two ways, and
alternates; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why does thou look
on, when the ungodly devours one more just than
himself?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He says not that the world revolves by
chance, nor that God takes his delight and ease in heaven, as the Epicureans
hold; but he confesses that the world is seen by God, and that he exercises care
over the affairs of men: notwithstanding, as he could not see his way clear in a
state of things so confused, he argues the point rather with himself than with
God. We now see the import of this sentence. The Prophet, however, proceeds

<div><br><font face="Palatino">He goes on, as it has been said, in his
complaint; and by a comparison he shows that the judgement would be such as
though God turned away from men, so as not to check the violence of the wicked,
nor oppose his hand to their wantonness, in order to restrain them. Since, then,
every one would oppress another as he exceeded him in power, and would with
increased insolence rise up against the miserable and the poor, the Prophet
compares man to the fish of the sea, &#8212; &#8220;What can this mean?&#8221;
he says. &#8220;For men have been created after God&#8217;s image: why then does
not some justice appear among them? When one devours another, and even one man
oppresses almost the whole world, what can be the meaning of this? God seems to
sport with human affairs. For if he regards men as his children, why does he not
defend them by his power? But we see one man (for he speaks of the Assyrian
king) so enraged and so cruel, as though the rest of the world were like fish or
reptiles.&#8221; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou makes
men</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>like reptiles or

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He draws up the whole by his
hook, he collects them into his drag, he gathers then into his net, he
exults</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh16</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see what the Prophet means &#8212; that God
would, as it were, close his eyes, while the Assyrians wantonly laid waste the
whole world: and when this tyranny should reach the holy land, what else could
the faithful think but that they were forsaken by God? And there is nothing, as
I have already said, more monstrous, than that iniquitous tyranny should thus
prevail among men; for they have all, from the least to the greatest, been
created after God&#8217;s image. God then ought to exercise peculiar care in
preserving mankind; his paternal love and solicitude ought in this respect to
appear evident: but when men are thus destroyed with impunity, and one oppresses
almost all the rest, there seems indeed to be no divine providence. For how will
it be that he will care for either birds, or oxen, or asses, or trees, or
plants, when he will thus forsake men, and bring no aid in so confused a state?
We now understand the drift of what the Prophet says.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But yet he does not, as I have already said, take
away from God his power, nor does he here rail against fortune, as many
cavillers do. Thou makest men, he says: he ascribes to God what cannot be taken
from him, &#8212; that he governs the world. But as to God&#8217;s justice, he
hesitates, and appeals to God. Though the Prophet seems here to rush headlong
like insane men; yet if we consider all things, we shall see that he strenuously
contended with his temptations, and even in these words some sparks at least of
faith will shine forth, which are sufficient to show to us the great firmness of
the Prophet. For this especially is worthy of being noticed, &#8212; that the
Prophet turns himself to God. The Epicureans, when they glamour against God, for
the most part, seek the ear of the multitude; and so they speak evil of God and
withdraw themselves at a distance from him; for they do not think that he
exercises any care over the world. But the Prophet continually addresses God. He
knew then that God was the governor of all things. He also desires to be
extricated from thoughts so thorny and perplexing; and from whom does he seek
relief? From God himself. When the profane wantonly deride God, they indulge
themselves, and seek nothing else but to become hardened in their own impious
conjectures: but the Prophet comes to God himself, &#8220;How does this happen,
O Lord?&#8221; As though he had said,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Thou sees how I am distracted, and also held
fast bound &#8212; distracted by many absurd thoughts, so that I am almost
confounded, and held fast bound by great perplexities, from which I cannot
extricate myself. Do thou, O Lord, unfold to me these knots, and concentrate my
scattered thoughts, that I may understand what is true, and what I am to
believe; and especially remove from me this doubt, lest it should shake my
faith; O Lord, grant that I may at length know and fully understand how thou art
just, and overrules, consistently with perfect equity, those things which seem
to be so confused.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It also happens sometimes that the ungodly, as it
were, openly revile God, a satanic rage having taken possession on them. But the
case was far different with the Prophet; for finding himself overwhelmed and his
mind not able to sustain him under so heavy trials, he sought relief, and as we
have said, applied to God himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He therefore rejoices and
exults</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he increases the indignity; for though
the Lord may for a time permit the wicked to oppress the innocent, yet when he
finds them glorying in their vices and triumphing, so great a wantonness ought
the more to kindle his vengeance. That the Lord then should still withhold
himself, seems indeed very strange. But the Prophet proceeds

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet confirms the closing sentence of the
last verse; for he explains what that joy was of which he had spoken, even the
joy by which the wicked, as it were, designedly provoke God against themselves.
It is indeed an abominable thing when the ungodly take delight in their vices;
but it is still more atrocious when they deride God himself. Such, then, is the
account now added by the Prophet, as though he had said, &#8220;Not only do the
ungodly felicitate themselves while thou sparest them, or for a time bearest
with them; but they now rise up against thee and deride all thy majesty, and
openly blaspheme against heaven itself; for they sacrifice to their own net, and
offer incense to their drag.&#8221; By this metaphor the Prophet intimates, that
the wicked do not only become hardened when they succeed in their vices, but
that they also ascribe to themselves the praise of justice; for they consider
that to be rightly done which has been attended with success. They thus dethrone
God, and put themselves in his place. We now then see the Prophet&#8217;s
meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this passage discovers to us the secret impiety
of all those who do not serve God sincerely and with an honest mind. There is
indeed imprinted on the hearts of men a certain conviction respecting the
existence of a God; for none are so barbarous as not to have some sense of
religion: and thus all are rendered inexcusable, as they carry in their hearts a
law which is sufficient to make them a thousand times guilty. But at the same
time the ungodly, and those who are not illuminated by faith, bury this
knowledge, for they are enveloped in themselves: and when some recollection of
God creeps in, they are at first impressed, and ascribe some honor to him; but
this is evanescent, for they soon suppress it as much as they can; yea they even
strive to extinguish (though they cannot) this knowledge and whatever light they
have from heaven. This is what the Prophet now graphically sets forth in the
person of the Assyrian king. He had before said, &#8220;This power is that of
his God.&#8221; He had complained that the Assyrians would give to their idols
what was peculiar to God alone, and thus deprive him of his right: but he says
now, that they would </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sacrifice to
their own drag, and offer incense to their net</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
This is a very different thing: for how could they sacrifice to their idols, if
they ascribed to their drag whatever victories they had gained? Now, by the
words drag and net, the Prophet means their efforts, strength, forces, power,
counsels, and policies as they call them, and whatever else there be which
profane men arrogate to themselves. But what is it to sacrifice to their own
net? The Assyrian did this, because he thought that he surpassed all others in
craftiness, because he thought himself so courageous as not to hesitate to make
war with all nations, regarding himself well prepared with forces and justified
in his proceedings; and because he became successful and omitted nothing
calculated to ensure victory. Thus the Assyrian, as I have said, regarded as
nothing his idols; for he put himself in the place of all the gods. But if it be
asked whence came his success, we must answer, that the Assyrian ought to have
ascribed it all to the one true God: but he thought that he prospered through
his own velour. If we refer to counsel, it is certain that God is he who governs
the counsels and minds of men; but the Assyrian thought that he gained
everything by his own skill. If, again, we speak of strength, whence was it? and
of courage, whence was it, but from God? but the Assyrian appropriated all these
things to himself. What regard, then, had he for God? We see how he now takes
away all honor even from his own idols, and attributes everything to
himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this sin, as I have already said, belongs to all
the ungodly; for where God&#8217;s Spirit does not reign, there is no humility,
and men ever swell with inward pride, until God thoroughly cleanse them. It is
then necessary that God should empty us by his special grace, that we may not be
filled with this satanic pride, which is innate, and which cannot by any means
be shaken off by us, until the Lord regenerates us by his Spirit. And this may
be seen es specially in all the kings of this world. They indeed confess that
kings rule through God&#8217;s grace; and then when they gain any victory,
supplications are made, vows are paid. But were any one to say to those
conquerors, &#8220;God had mercy on you,&#8221; the answer would be,
&#8220;What! was then my preparation nothing? did I not provide many things
beforehand? did I not attain the friendship of many? did I not form
confederacies? did I not foresee such and such disadvantages? did I not
opportunely provide a remedy?&#8221; In a word, they sacrifice apparently to
God, but afterwards they have a regard mainly to their drag and their net, and
make nothing of God. Well would it be were these things not so evident. But
since the Spirit of God sets before us a lively image of the fact, let us learn
what true humility is, and that we then only have this, when we think that we
are nothing, and can do nothing, and that it is God alone who not only supports
and continues us in life, but also governs us by his Spirit, and that it is he
who sustains our hearts, gives courage, and then blesses us, so as to render
prosperous what we may undertake. Let us hence learn that God cannot be really
glorified, except when men wholly empty themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because in
</i></font><font face="Palatino">(</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>or
by</i></font><font face="Palatino">)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>them is his fat portion and his
rich meat</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Though some render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">harb</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>berae</i>,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>choice</i></font><font face="Palatino">
meat, and others,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fat</i></font><font face="Palatino">
meat, I yet prefer the meaning of rich. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh17</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> His
meat then will be rich. The Prophet intimates here that men are so blinded by
prosperity that they sacrifice to themselves, and hence the more deserving of
reproof is their ingratitude; for the more liberally God deals with us the more
reason, no doubt, there is why we ought to glorify him. But when men, well
supplied and fully satisfied, thus swell with pride and sacrifice to themselves,
is not their impiety in this manner more completely discovered? But the Prophet
not only proves that the Assyrians abused God&#8217;s bounty, but he shows in
their person what is the disposition of the whole world. For when men accumulate
great wealth, and pile up a great heap from the property of others, they become
more and more blinded. We hence see that we ought justly to fear the evil of
prosperity, lest our fatness should so increase that we can see nothing; for the
eyes are dimmed by excessive fatness. Let this then be ever remembered by us.
The Prophet then concludes his discourse: but as one verse of the first chapter
only remains, I shall briefly notice it.</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">We have seen in the first chapter
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;350102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
1:2-3 that the Prophet said in the name of all the faithful. It was indeed a
hard struggle, when all things were in a perplexed state and no outlet appeared.
The faithful might have thought that all things happened by chance, that there
was no divine providence; and even the Prophet uttered complaints of this kind.
He now begins to recover himself from his perplexities; and he ever speaks in
the person of the godly, or of the whole Church. For what is done by some
interpreters, who confine what is said to the prophetic office, I do not
approve; and it may be easy from the contempt to learn, that the Prophet does
not speak according to his private feeling, but that he represents the feelings
of all the godly. So then we ought to collect this verse with the complaints,
which we have before noticed; for the Prophet, finding himself sinking, and as
it were overwhelmed in the deepest abyss, raises himself up above the judgement
and reason of men, and comes nearer to God, that he might see from on high the
things which take place on earth, and not judge according to the understanding
of his own flesh, but by the light of the Holy Spirit. For the tower of which he
speaks is patience arising from hope. If indeed we would struggle perseveringly
to the last, and at length obtain the victory over all trials and conflicts, we
must rise above the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some understand by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tower</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>citadel</i></font><font face="Palatino">
the Word of God: and this may in some measure be allowed, though not in every
respect suitable. If we more fully weigh the reason for the metaphor, we shall
be at no loss to know that the tower is the recess of the mind, where we
withdraw ourselves from the world; for we find how disposed we are all to
entertain distrust. When, therefore, we follow our own inclination, various
temptations immediately lay hold on us; nor can we even for a moment exercise
hope in God: and many things are also suggested to us, which take away and
deprive us of all confidence: we become also involved in variety of thoughts,
for when Satan finds men wandering in their imaginations and blending many
things together, he so entangles them that they cannot by any means come nigh to
God. If then we would cherish faith in our hearts, we must rise above all these
difficulties and hindrances. And the Prophet by tower means this, that he
extricated himself from the thoughts of the flesh; for there would have been no
end nor termination to his doubts, had he tried to form a judgement according to
his own understanding; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
stand, he says, on my tower,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh19</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
I and I will set myself on the citadel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In
short, the sentence carries this meaning &#8212; that the Prophet renounced the
judgement of men, and broke through all those snares by which Satan entangles us
and prevents us to rise above the earth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will watch to see what he may
say to me</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, I will be there vigilant;
for by watching he means vigilance and waiting, as though he had said,
&#8220;Though no hope should soon appear, I shall not despond; nor shall I
forsake my station; but I shall remain constantly in that tower, to which I wish
now to ascend: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will watch then
to see what he may say to me</i></font><font face="Palatino">.&#8221; The
reference is evidently to God; for the opinion of those is not probable, who
apply this &#8220;saying&#8221; to the ministers of Satan. For the Prophet says
first, &#8216;I will see what he may say to me,&#8217; and then he adds,
&#8216;and what I shall answer.&#8217; They who explain the words &#8216;what he
may say,&#8217; as referring to the wicked who might oppose him for the purpose
of shaking his faith, overlook the words of the Prophet, for he speaks here in
the singular number; and as there is no name expressed, the Prophet no doubt
meant God. But were the words capable of admitting this explanation, yet the
very drift of the argument shows, that the passage has the meaning which I have
attached to it. For how could the faithful answer the calumnies by which their
faith was assailed, when the profane opprobriously mocked and derided them
&#8212; how could they satisfactorily disprove such blasphemies, did they not
first attend to what God might say to them? For we cannot confute the devil and
his ministers, except we be instructed by the word of God. We hence see that the
Prophet observes the best order in what he states, when he says in the first
place, &#8216;I will see what God may say to me;&#8217; and in the second place,
&#8216;I shall then be taught to answer to my chiding;&#8217;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh20</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
is, &#8220;If the wicked deride my faith, I shall be able boldly to confute
them; for the Lord will suggest to me such things as may enable me to give a
full answer.&#8221; We now perceive the simple and real meaning of this verse.
It remains for us to accommodate the doctrine to our own use.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must be first observed, that there is no remedy,
when such trials as those mentioned by the Prophet in the first chapter
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;350104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
1:4-17 meet us, except we learn to raise up our minds above the world. For if we
contend with Satan, according to our own view of things, he will a hundred times
overwhelm us, and we can never be able to resist him. Let us therefore know,
that here is shown to us the right way of fighting with him, when our minds are
agitated with unbelief, when doubts respecting God&#8217;s providence creep in,
when things are so confused in this world as to involve us in darkness, so that
no light appears: we must bid adieu to our own reason; for all our thoughts are
nothing worth, when we seek, according to our own reason, to form a judgement.
Until then the faithful ascend to their tower and stand in their citadel, of
which the Prophet here speaks, their temptations will drive them here and there,
and sink them as it were in a bottomless gulf. But that we may more fully
understand the meaning, we must know, that there is here an implied contrast
between the tower and the citadel, which the Prophet mentions, and a station on
earth. As long then as we judge according to our own perceptions, we walk on the
earth; and while we do so, many clouds arise, and Satan scatters ashes in our
eyes, and wholly darkens our judgement, and thus it happens, that we lie down
altogether confounded. It is hence wholly necessary, as we have before said,
that we should tread our reason under foot, and come nigh to God
himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have said, that the tower is the recess of the
mind; but how can we ascend to it? even by following the word of the Lord. For
we creep on the earth; nay, we find that our flesh ever draws us downward:
except then the truth from above becomes to us as it were wings, or a ladder, or
a vehicle, we cannot rise up one foot; but, on the contrary, we shall seek
refuges on the earth rather than ascend into heaven. But let the word of God
become our ladder, or our vehicle, or our wings, and, however difficult the
ascent may be, we shall yet be able to fly upward, provided God&#8217;s word be
allowed to have its own authority. We hence see how unsuitable is the view of
those interpreters, who think that the tower and the citadel is the word of God;
for it is by God&#8217;s word, as I have already said, that we are raised up to
this citadel, that is, to the safeguard of hope; where we may remain safe and
secure while looking down from this eminence on those things which disturb us
and darken all our senses as long as we lie on the earth. This is one
thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then the repetition is not without its use; for the
Prophet says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On my tower will I
stand, on the citadel will I set myself</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He
does not repeat in other words the same thing, because it is obscure; but in
order to remind the faithful, that though they are inclined to sloth, they must
yet strive to extricate themselves. And we soon find how slothful we become,
except each of us stirs up himself. For when any perplexity takes hold on our
minds, we soon succumb to despair. This, then, is the reason why the Prophet,
after having spoken of the tower, again mentions the citadel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will watch to
see</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he refers to perseverance; for it is not
enough to open our eyes once, and by one look to observe what happens to us; but
it is necessary to continue our attention. This constant attention is, then,
what the Prophet means by watching; for we are not so clear-sighted as
immediately to comprehend what is useful to be known. And then, though we may
once see what is necessary, yet a new temptation can obliterate that view. It
thus happens, that all our observations become evanescent, except we continue to
watch, that is, except we persevere in our attention, so that we may ever return
to God, whenever the devil raises new storms, and whenever he darkens the
heavens with clouds to prevent us to see God. We hence see how emphatical is
what the Prophet says here, I will watch to see. The Prophet evidently compares
the faithful to watchmen, who, though they hear nothing, yet do not sleep; and
if they hear any noise once or twice, they do not immediately sound an alarm,
but wait and attend. As, then, they who keep watch ought to remain quiet, that
they may not disturb others, and that they may duly perform their office; so it
behaves the faithful to be also tranquil and quiet, and wait patiently for God
during times of perplexity and confusion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now inquire what is the purpose of this
watching: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will watch to
see</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>what he may say to
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There seems to be an impropriety in the
expression; for we do not properly see what is said. But the Prophet connects
together here two metaphors. To speak strictly correct, he ought to have said,
&#8220;I will continue attentive to hear what he may say;&#8221; but he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will watch to see what he may
say</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The metaphor is found correctly used in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
85:8,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I will hear what
God may say; for he will speak peace to his people.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There also it is a metaphor, for the Prophet speaks
not of natural hearing: &#8220;I will hear what God may speak,&#8221; what does
that hearing mean? It means this, &#8220;I will quietly wait until God shows his
favor, which is now hid; for he will speak peace to his people;&#8221; that is,
the Lord will never forget his own Church. But the Prophet, as I have said,
joins together here two metaphors; for to speak, or to say, means no other thing
than that God testifies to our hearts, that though the reason for his purpose
does not immediately appear to us, yet all things are wisely ruled, and that
nothing is better than to submit to his will. But when he says, &#8220;I will
see, and I will watch what he may say,&#8221; the metaphor seems incongruous,
and yet there appears a reason for it; for the Prophet intended to remind us,
that we ought to employ all our senses for this end, &#8212; to be wholly
attentive to God&#8217;s word. For though one may be resolved to hear God, we
yet find that many temptations immediately distract us. It is not then enough to
become teachable, and to apply our ears to hear his voice, except also our eyes
be connected with them, so that we may be altogether attentive.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see the object of the Prophet; for he meant
to express the greatest attention, as though he had said, that the faithful
would ever wander in their thoughts, except they carefully concentrated both
their eyes and their ears, and all their senses, on God, and continually
restrained themselves, lest vagrant speculations or imaginations should lead
them astray. And further, the Prophet teaches us, that we ought to have such
reverence for God&#8217;s word as to deem it sufficient for us to hear his
voice. Let this, then, be our understanding, to obey God speaking to us, and
reverently to embrace his word, so that he may deliver us from all troubles, and
also keep our minds in peace and tranquillity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God&#8217;s speaking, then, is opposed to all the
obstreperous clamours of Satan, which he never ceases to sound in our ears. For
as soon as any temptation takes place, Satan suggests many things to us, and
those of various kinds: &#8212; &#8220;What will you do? what advice will you
take? see whether God is propitious to you from whom you expect help. How can
you dare to trust that God will assist you? How can he extricate you? What will
be the issue?&#8221; As Satan then disturbs us in various ways, the Prophet
shows that the word of God alone is sufficient for us all, then, who indulge
themselves in their own counsels, deserve to be forsaken by God, and to be left
by him to be driven up and down, and here and there, by Satan; for the only
unfailing security for the faithful is to acquiesce in God&#8217;s
word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this appears still more clear from what is
expressed at the close of the verse, when the Prophet adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and what I may answer to the
reproof given me</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for he shows that he would be
furnished with the best weapons to sustain and repel all assaults, provided he
patiently attended to God speaking to him, and fully embraced his word:
&#8220;Then,&#8221; he says, &#8220;I shall have what I may answer to all
reproofs, when the Lord shall speak to me&#8221;. By &#8220;reproofs,&#8221; he
means not only the blasphemies by which the wicked shake his faith, but also all
those turbulent feelings by which Satan secretly labors to subvert his faith.
For not only the ungodly deride us and mock at our simplicity, as though we
presumptuously and foolishly trusted in God, and were thus over-credulous; but
we also reprove ourselves inwardly, and disturb ourselves by various internal
contentions; for whatever comes to our mind that is in opposition to God&#8217;s
word, is properly a chiding or a reproof, as it is the same thing as if one
accused himself, as though he had not found God to be faithful. We now, then see
that the word &#8220;reproof&#8221; extends farther than to those outward
blasphemies by which the unbelieving are wont to assail the children of God;
for, as we have already said, though no one attempted to try our faith, yet
every one is a tempter to himself; for the devil never ceases to agitate our
minds. When, therefore, the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>what I may answer to
reproof</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he means, that he would be
sufficiently fortified against all the assaults of Satan, both secret and
external, when he heard what God might say to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may also gather from the whole verse, that we can
form no judgement of God&#8217;s providence, except by the light of celestial
truth. It is hence no wonder that many fall away under trials, yea, almost the
whole world; for few there are who ascend into the citadel of which the Prophet
speaks, and who are willing to hear God speaking to them. Hence, presumption and
arrogance blind the minds of men, so that they either speak evil of God who
addresses them, or accuse fortune, or maintain that there is nothing certain:
thus they murmur within themselves, and arrogate to themselves more than they
ought, and never submit to God&#8217;s word. Let us proceed, -</font><br></div>

there is no fear but that God will give help in time, provided we bring our
minds to a state of spiritual tranquillity, and constantly look up to him: for
the event which the Prophet relates, proves that there is no danger that God
will frustrate their hope and patience, who lift up their minds to heaven, and
continue steadily in that attitude.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Answer
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>did Jehovah, and
said</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There is no doubt but that the Prophet
accommodates here his own example to the common instruction of the whole Church.
Hence, by testifying that an answer was given him by God, he intimates that we
ought to entertain a cheerful hope, that the Lord, when he finds us stationed in
our watch-tower, will in due season convey to us the consolation which he sees
we need.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he afterwards comes to the discharge of his
prophetic office; for he was bid to write the vision on tables, and to write it
in large letters, that it might be read, and that any one, passing by quickly,
might be able by one glance to see what was written: and by this second part he
shows still more clearly that he treated of a common truth, which belonged to
the whole body of the Church; for it was not for his own sake that he was bid to
write, but for the edification of all.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Write</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
vision</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>make it
plain</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rab</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>bar</i> properly means, to declare plainly. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh21</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Unfold
it then, he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on tables, that
he may run who reads it</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, that the
writing may not cause the readers to stop. Write it in large characters, that
any one, in running by, may see what is written. Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for the vision shall be for an
appointed time</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is a remarkable passage; for we are taught here
that we are not to deal with God in too limited a manner, but room must be given
for hope; for the Lord does not immediately execute what he declares by his
mouth; but his purpose is to prove our patience, and the obedience of our faith.
Hence he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the vision, is for
a time</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and a fixed time: for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d[wm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>muod</i> means a time which has been determined by agreement. But as it is
God who fore appoints the time, the constituted time, of which the Prophet
speaks, depends on his will and power.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
vision</i></font><font face="Palatino">, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be for a
time</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He reproves here that immoderate ardor
which takes hold on us, when we are anxious that God should immediately
accomplish what he promises. The Prophet then shows that God so speaks as to be
at liberty to defer the execution of his promise until it seems good to
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>At the
end</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it will
speak</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh22</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In a
word, the Prophet intimates, that honor is to be given to God&#8217;s word, that
we ought to be fully persuaded that God speaks what is true, and be so satisfied
with his promises as though what is promised were really possessed by us.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>At the
end</i></font><font face="Palatino">, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it will speak and it will not
lie</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh23</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Here
the Prophet means, that fulfillment would take place, so that experience would
at length prove, that God had not spoken in vain, nor for the sake of deceiving;
but yet that there was need of patience; for, as it has been said, God intends
not to indulge our fervid and importunate desires by an immediate fulfillment,
but his design is to hold us in suspense. And this is the true sacrifice of
praise, when we restrain ourselves, and remain firm in the persuasion that God
cannot deceive nor lie, though he may seem for a time to trifle with us.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It will not, then,
lie</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If it will delay, wait for
it</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He again expresses still more clearly the
true character of faith, that it does not break forth immediately into
complaints, when God connives at things, when he suffers us to be oppressed by
the wicked, when he does not immediately succor us; in a word, when he does not
without delay fulfill what he has promised in his word. If, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it delays, wait for
it</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He again repeats the same thing,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>coming it will
come</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, however it may be, God, who is
not only true, but truth itself, will accomplish his own promises. The
fulfillment, then, of the promise will take place in due time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must notice the contrariety,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If it will delay, it will come,
it will not delay</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The two clauses seem to be
contrary the one to the other. But delay, mentioned first, has a reference to
our haste. It is a common proverb, &#8220;Even quickness is delay to
desire.&#8221; We indeed make such haste in all our desires, that the Lord, when
he delays one moment, seems to be too slow. Thus it may come easily to our mind
to expostulate with him on the ground of slowness. God, then, is said on this
account to delay in his promises; and his promises also as to their
accomplishment may be said to be delayed. But if we have regard to the counsel
of God, there is never any delay; for he knows all the points of time, and in
slowness itself he always hastens, however this may be not comprehended by the
flesh. We now, then, apprehend what the Prophet means. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh24</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He is now bidden to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>write the vision, and to explain
it on tables</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Many confine this to the coming
of Christ; but I rather think that the Prophet ascribes the name of vision to
the doctrine or admonition, which he immediately subjoins. It is indeed true,
that the faithful under the law could not have cherished hope in God without
having their eyes and their minds directed to Christ: but it is one thing to
take a passage in a restricted sense as applying to Christ himself, and another
thing to set forth those promises which refer to the preservation of the Church.
As far then as the promises of God in Christ are yea and amen, no vision could
have been given to the Fathers, which could have raised their minds, and
supported them in the hope of salvation, without Christ having been brought
before them. But the Prophet here intimates generally, that a command was given
to him to supply the hearts of the godly with this support, that they were, as
we shall hereafter more clearly see, to wait for God. The vision, then, is
nothing else than an admonition, which will be found in the next and the
following verses.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He uses two words, to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>write</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>explain</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
which some pervert rather than rightly distinguish: for as the Prophets were
wont to write, and also to set forth the summaries or the heads of their
discourses, they think that it was a command to Habakkuk to write, that he might
leave on record to posterity what he had said; and then to publish what he
taught as an edict, that it might be seen by the people passing by, not only for
a day or for a few days. But I do not think that the Prophet speaks with so much
refinement: I therefore consider that to write and to explain on tables mean the
same thing. And what is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he may run who reads
it</i></font><font face="Palatino">, is to be understood as I have already
explained it; for God intended to set forth this declaration as memorable and
worthy of special notice. It was not usual with the Prophets to write in long
and large characters; but the Prophet mentions here something peculiar, because
the declaration was worthy of being especially observed. What is similar to this
is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230801&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
8:1, &#8216;Write on at table with a man&#8217;s pen.&#8217; By a man&#8217;s
pen is to be understood common writing, such as is comprehended by the rudest
and the most ignorant. To the same purpose is what God bids here his servant
Habakkuk to do.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Write</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says how? Not as Prophecies are wont to be written, for the Prophets set
before the people the heads of their discourses; but write, he says, so that he
who runs may read, and that though he may be inattentive, he may yet see what is
written; for the table itself will plainly show what it
contains.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see that the Prophet commends, by a peculiar
eulogy, what he immediately subjoins. Hence this passage ought to awaken all our
powers, as God himself testifies that he announces what is worthy of being
remembered: for he speaks not of a common truth; but his purpose was to reveal
something great and unusually excellent; as he bids it, as I have already said,
to be written in large characters, so that those who run might read
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And by saying that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the vision is yet for a
time</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he shows, as I have briefly explained,
what great reverence is due to heavenly truth. For to wish God to conform to our
rule is extremely preposterous and unreasonable: and there is no place for
faith, if we expect God to fulfill immediately what he promises. It is hence the
trial of faith to acquiesce in God&#8217;s word, when its accomplishment does in
no way appear. As then the Prophet teaches us, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the vision is yet for a
time</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he reminds us that we have no faith,
except we are satisfied with God&#8217;s word alone, and suspend our desires
until the seasonable time comes, that which God himself has appointed.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
vision</i></font><font face="Palatino">, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yet</i></font><font face="Palatino">
shall be. But we are inclined to reduce, as it were, to nothing the power of
God, except he accomplishes what he has said: &#8220;Yet, yet,&#8221; says the
Prophet, &#8220;the vision shall be;&#8221; that is, &#8220;Though God does not
stretch forth his hand, still let what he has spoken be sufficient for you: let
then the vision itself be enough for you; let it be deemed worthy of credit, so
that the word of God may on its own account be believed; and let it not be tried
according to the common rule; for men charge God with falsehood, except he
immediately yields to their desires. Let then the vision itself be counted
sufficiently solid and firm, until the suitable time shall come.&#8221; And the
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d[wm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>muod</i>, ought to be noticed; for the Prophet does not speak simply of time,
but, as I have already said, he points out a certain and a preordained time.
When men make an agreement, they on both sides fix the day: but it would be the
highest presumption in us to require that God should appoint the day according
to our will. It belongs, then, to him to appoint the times, and so to govern all
things, that we may approve of whatever he does.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it will speak at the end, and
it will not lie</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The same is the import of the
expression, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it will speak at the
end</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, men are very perverse, if they
wish God to close his mouth, and if they wish to deny faith to his word, except
he instantly fulfill what he speaks.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It
will</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>speak</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
that is, let this liberty of speaking be allowed to God. And there is always an
implied contrast between the voice of God and its accomplishment; for we are to
acquiesce in God&#8217;s word, though he may conceal his hand: though he may
afford no proof of his power, yet the Prophet commands this honor to be given to
his word. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
vision</i></font><font face="Palatino">, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will speak at the
end</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now expresses more clearly what he had before said
of the preordained time; and thus he meets the objections which Satan is wont to
suggest to us: &#8220;How long will that time be delayed? Thou indeed namest it
as the preordained time; but when will that day come?&#8221; &#8220;The
Lord,&#8221; he says, &#8220;will speak at the end;&#8221; that is,
&#8220;Though the Lord protracts time, and though day after day we seem to live
on vain promises, yet let God speak, that is, let him have this honor from you,
and be ye persuaded that he is true, that he cannot disappoint you; and in the
meantime wait for his power; wait, so that ye may yet remain quiet, resting on
his word, and let all your thoughts be confined within this stronghold &#8212;
that it is enough that God has spoken. The rest we shall defer until
to-morrow.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as thou sees
us laboring under so much weakness, yea, with our minds so blinded that our
faith falters at the smallest perplexities, and almost fails altogether, &#8212;
O grant that by the power of thy Spirit we may be raised up above this world,
and learn more and more to renounce our own counsels, and so to come to thee,
that we may stand fixed in our watch tower, ever hoping, through thy power, for
whatever thou hast promised to us, though thou shouldst not immediately make it
manifest to us that thou hast faithfully spoken; and may we thus give full proof
of our faith and patience, and proceed in the course of our warfare, until at
length we ascend, above all watch towers, into that blessed rest, where we shall
no more watch with an attentive mind, but see, face to face, in thine image,
whatever can be wished, and whatever is needful for our perfect happiness,
through Christ our Lord.
Amen.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE HUNDRED
AND TENTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet taught us yesterday, that we ought to
allow God his right of speaking to us, and of sustaining us by his own word,
until the ripe time shall come, when he shall really fulfill what he has
promised. Then an exhortation follows, added at the close of the verse &#8212;
that we are to exercise patience; and the Apostle also, referring to this
passage in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581038&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
10:38, makes a similar application. He indeed quotes what we shall find in the
next verse, &#8216;The just by his faith shall live;&#8217; but he had in view
the whole context; and at the same time he reminds us of the Prophet&#8217;s
object here in exalting the authority of God&#8217;s word. The exhortation,
then, is briefly this &#8212; that though God may keep us in suspense, we yet
ought not to cast away hope, for he knows when it is expedient for us that he
should stretch forth his hand. And as there are two clauses, as I said
yesterday, which seem at first sight to be inconsistent the one with the other,
the Prophet very fitly joins them together, and considers them to be in perfect
harmony; for though God may appear to delay, yet he is not slower than what is
necessary and expedient. Let us then be fully persuaded that there is in God
prudence and wisdom enough to assist us as soon as it may be needful. The
Prophet now reminds us that it is no wonder if God seems to us to delay, for we
are too hasty in our desires. Let therefore this fervor be restrained, so that
we may subject our feelings to the providence and purpose of God. Let us now
proceed &#8212;</font><br></div>

</table></div>
<div><br><font face="Palatino">This verse stands connected with the last, for
the Prophet means to show that nothing is better than to rely on God&#8217;s
word, how much soever may various temptations assault our souls. We hence see
that nothing new is said here, hut that the former doctrine is confirmed &#8212;
that our salvation is rendered safe and certain through God&#8217;s promise
alone, and that therefore we ought not to seek any other haven, where we might
securely sustain all the onsets of Satan and of the world. But he sets the two
clauses the one opposed to the other: every man who would fortify himself would
ever be subject to various changes, and never attain a quiet mind; then comes
the other clause &#8212; that man cannot otherwise obtain rest than by
faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the former part is variously explained. Some
interpreters think the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlp[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ophle</i>, to be a noun, and render it elevation, which is not unsuitable;
and indeed I hesitate not to regard this as its real meaning, for the Hebrews
call a citadel
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lpw[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ouphel</i>, rightly deriving it from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lp[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ophle</i>, to ascend. What some others maintain, that it signifies to
strengthen, is not well founded. Some again give this explanation &#8212; that
the unbelieving seek a stronghold for themselves, that they may fortify
themselves; and this makes but little difference as to the thing itself. But
interpreters vary, and differ as to the meaning of the sentence; for some
substitute the predicate for the subject, and the subject for the predicate, and
elicit this meaning from the Prophet&#8217;s words &#8212; &#8220;Every one
whose mind is not at ease seeks a fortress, where he may safely rest and
strengthens himself;&#8221; and others give this view &#8212; &#8220;He who is
proud, or who thinks himself well fortified, shall ever be of an unquiet
mind.&#8221; And this latter meaning is what I approve, only that I retain the
import of the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlp[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ophle</i>, as though it was said &#8212; &#8220;where there is an elation of
mind there is no tranquillity.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us see first what their view is who give the
other explanation. They say that the unbelieving, being obstinate and perverted
in their minds, ever seek where they may be in safety, for they are full of
suspicions, and having no regard to God they resort to the world for those
remedies, by which they may escape evils and dangers. This is their view. But
the Prophet, as I have already said, does here, on the contrary, denounce
punishment on the unbelieving, as though he had said &#8212; &#8220;This reward,
which they have deserved, shall be repaid to them &#8212; that they shall always
torment themselves.&#8221; The contrast will thus be more obvious; and when we
say that God punishes the unbelieving, when he suffers them to be driven here
and there, and also harasses their minds with various tormenting thoughts, a
more fruitful doctrine is elicited. When therefore the Prophet says that there
is no calmness of mind possessed by those who deem themselves well fortified, he
intimates that they are their own executioners, for they seek for themselves
many troubles, many sorrows, many anxieties, and contrive and mingle together
many designs and purposes; now they think of one thing, then they turn to
another; for the Hebrews say that the soul is made right when we acquiesce in a
thing and continue in a tranquil state of mind; but when confused thoughts
distract us, then they say that our soul is not right in us. We now perceive the
real meaning of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says: by this demonstrative particle he intimates that what he teaches us may
be clearly seen if we attend to daily events. The meaning then is, that a proof
of this fact exists evidently in the common life of men &#8212; that he who
fortifies himself, and is also elated with self confidence, never finds a
tranquil haven, for some new suspicion or fear ever disturbs his mind. Hence it
comes that the soul entangles itself in various cares and anxieties. This is the
reward, as I have said, which is allotted by God&#8217;s just judgement to the
unbelieving; for God, as he testifies by Isaiah, offers to us rest; and they who
reject this invaluable benefit, freely offered to them by God, deserve that they
should not only be tormented in one way, but be also harassed by endless
agitations, and that they should also vex and torment themselves. It is indeed
true that he who is fortified may also acquiesce in God&#8217;s word; but the
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlp[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ophle</i>, refers to the state of the mind. Whosoever, then, swells with vain
confidence, when he finds that he has many auxiliaries according to the flesh,
shall ever be agitated, and will at length find that there is nowhere rest,
except the mind recumbs on God&#8217;s grace alone. We now understand the import
of this clause.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh25</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>but the just shall live by his
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet, I have no doubt, does here
place faith in opposition to all those defences by which men so blind themselves
as to neglect God, and to seek no aid from him. As men therefore rely on what
the earth affords, depending on their fallacious supports, the Prophet here
ascribes life to faith. But faith, as it is well known, and as we shall
presently show more at large, depends on God alone. That we may then live by
faith, the Prophet intimates that we must willingly give up all those defences
which are wont to disappoint us. He then who finds that he is deprived of all
protections, will live by his faith, provided he seeks in God alone what he
wants, and leaving the world, fixes his mind on heaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tgwma</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>amunat</i>, is in Hebrew truth, so some regard it as meaning integrity; as
though the Prophet had said, that the just man has more safety in his
faithfulness and pure conscience, than there is to the children of this world in
all those munitions in which they glory. But in this case they frigidly
extenuate the Prophet&#8217;s declaration; for they understand not what that
righteousness of faith is from which our salvation proceeds. It is indeed
certain that the Prophet understands by the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tgwma</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>amunat</i>, that faith which strips us of all arrogance, and leads us naked
and needy to God, that we may seek salvation from him alone, which would
otherwise be far removed from us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now many confine the first part to Nebuchadnezzar,
but this is not suitable. The Prophet indeed speaks to the end of the chapter of
Babylon and its ruin; but here he makes a distinction between the children of
God, who cast all their cares on him, and the unbelieving, who cannot go forth
beyond the world, where they seek to be made secure, and gather hence their
defences in which they confide. And this is especially worthy of being observed,
for it helps us much to understand the meaning of the Prophet; if this part
&#8212; &#8220;Behold the proud, his soul is not right in him,&#8221; be applied
to Nebuchadnezzar, the other part will lose much of its import; but if we
consider that the Prophet, as it were, in these two tablets, shows what it is to
glory in our own powers or in earthly aids, then what it is to repose on God
alone will appear much more clear, and this truth will with more force penetrate
into our minds; for we know how much such comparisons illustrate a subject which
would be otherwise obscure or less evident. For if the Prophet had only declared
that our faith is the cause of life and salvation, it might indeed be
understood; but as we are disposed to entertain worldly hopes, the former truth
would not have been sufficient to correct this evil, and to free our minds from
all vain confidence. But when he affirms that all the unbelieving are deceived,
while they fortify or elate themselves, be cause God will ever confound them,
and that though no one disturbs them outwardly, they will yet be their own
tormentors, as they have nothing that is right, nothing that is certain; when
therefore all this is said to us, it is as though God drew us forcibly to
himself, while seeing us deluded by the allurements of Satan, and seeing us too
inclined to be taken with deceptions, which would at length lead us to
destruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, perceive why Habakkuk has put these two
things in opposition the one to the other &#8212; that the defences of this
world are not only evanescent, but also bring always with them many tormenting
fears &#8212; and then, that the just lives by his faith. And hence also is
found a confirmation of what I have already touched upon, that faith is not to
be taken here for man&#8217;s integrity, but for that faith which sets man
before God emptied of all good things, so that he seeks what he needs from his
gratuitous goodness: for all the unbelieving try to fortify themselves; and thus
they strengthen themselves, thinking that anything in which they trust is
sufficient for them. But what does the just do? He brings nothing before God
except faith: then he brings nothing of his own, because faith borrows, as it
were, through favor, what is not in man&#8217;s possession. He, then, who lives
by faith, has no life in himself; but because he wants it, he flies for it to
God alone. The Prophet also puts the verb in the future tense, in order to show
the perpetuity of this life: for the unbelieving glory in a shadowy life; but
the Lord will at last discover their folly, and they themselves shall really
know that they have been deceived. But as God never disappoints the hope of his
people, the Prophet promises here a perpetual life to the
faithful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now come to Paul, who has applied the
Prophet&#8217;s testimony for the purpose of teaching us that salvation is not
by works, but by the mercy of God alone, and therefore by faith. Paul
<i>seems</i> to have misapplied the Prophet&#8217;s words, and to have used them
beyond what they import; for the Prophet speaks here of the state of the present
life, and he has not previously spoken of the celestial life, but exhorted, as
we have seen, the faithful to patience, and at the same time testified that God
would be their deliverer; and now he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the just shall live by
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino">, though he may be destitute of all help,
and though he may be exposed to all the assaults of fortune, and of the wicked,
and of the devil. What has this to do, some one may say, with the eternal
salvation of the soul? It seems, then, that Paul has with too much refinement
introduced this testimony into his discussion respecting gratuitous
justification by faith. But this principle ought ever to be remembered &#8212;
that whatever benefits the Lord confers on the faithful in this life, are
intended to confirm them in the hope of the eternal inheritance; for however
liberally God may deal with us, our condition would yet be indeed miserable,
were our hope confined to this earthly life. As God then would raise up our
minds to the hopes of eternal salvation whenever he aids us in this world, and
declares himself to be our Father; hence, when the Prophet says that the
faithful shall live, he certainly does not confine this life to so narrow
limits, that God will only defend us for a day or two, or for a few years; but
he proceeds much farther, and says, that we shall be made really and truly
happy; for though this whole world may perish or be exposed to various changes,
yet the faithful shall continue in permanent and real safety. Hence, when
Habakkuk promises life in future to the faithful, he no doubt overleaps the
boundaries of this world, and sets before the faithful a better life than that
which they have here, which is accompanied with many sorrows, and proves itself
by its shortness to be unworthy of being much desired.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive that Paul wisely and suitably
accommodates to his subject the Prophet&#8217;s words &#8212; that the just
lives by faith; for there is no salvation for the soul except through
God&#8217;s mercy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Quoting this place in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:17, he says that the righteousness of God is in the gospel revealed from faith
to faith, and then adds,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;As it is written,
The just shall live by faith.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul very rightly connects these things together that
righteousness is made known in the Gospel &#8212; and that it comes to us by
faith only; for he there contends that men cannot obtain righteousness by the
law, or by the works of the law; it follows that it is revealed in the Gospel
alone: how does he prove this? By the testimony of the Prophet Habakkuk
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;If by faith the
just lives, then he is just by faith; if he is just by faith, then he is not so
by the works of the law.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And Paul assumes this principle, to which I have
before referred &#8212; that men are emptied of all works, when they produce
their faith before God: for as long as man possesses anything of his own, he
does not please God by faith alone, but also by his own
worthiness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If then faith alone obtains grace, the law must
necessarily be relinquished, as the apostle also explains more clearly in the
third chapter of the Epistle to the Galatians
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480311&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:11:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;That righteousness,&#8217; he
says, &#8216;is not by the works of the law, is evident; for it is written, The
just shall live by faith, and the law is not of faith.&#8217;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul assumes that these, even faith and law, are
contrary, the one to the other; contrary as to the work of justifying. The law
indeed agrees with the gospel; nay, it contains in itself the gospel. And Paul
has solved this question in the first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:1-32 by saying, that the law cannot assist us to attain righteousness, but
that it is offered to us in the gospel, and that it receives a testimony from
the law and the Prophets. Though then there is a complete concord between the
law and the gospel, as God, who is not inconsistent with himself, is the author
of both; yet as to justification, the law accords not with the gospel, any more
than light with darkness: for the law promises life to those who serve God; and
the promise is conditional, dependent on the merits of works. The gospel also
does indeed promise righteousness under condition; but it has no respect to the
merits of works. What then? It is only this, that they who are condemned and
lost are to embrace the favor offered to them in Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see how, by the testimony of our Prophet,
Paul rightly confirms his own doctrine, that eternal salvation is to be attained
by faith only; for we are destitute of all merits by works, and are constrained
to stand naked and needy before God; and then the Lord justifies us
freely.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But that this may be more evident, let us first
consider why men must come altogether naked before God; for were there any
worthiness in them, the Lord would by no means deprive them of such an honor.
Why then does the Lord justify us freely, except that he may thereby appear
just? He has indeed no need of this glory, as though he could not himself be
glorified except by doing wrong to men. But we obtain righteousness by faith
alone for this reason, because God finds nothing in us which he can approve, or
what may avail to obtain righteousness. Since it is so, we then see that to be
true which the Holy Spirit everywhere declares respecting the character of men.
Men indeed glory in a foolish conceit as to their own righteousness: but all
philosophic virtues, as they call them, which men think they possess through
free-will, are mere fumes; nay, they are the delusions of the devil, by which he
bewitches the minds of men, so that they come not to God, but, on the contrary,
precipitate themselves into the lowest deep, where they seek to exalt themselves
beyond measure. However this may be, let us be fully convinced, that in man
there is not even a particle either of rectitude or of righteousness; and that
whatever men may try to do of themselves, is an abomination before God. This is
one thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now after God has stretched forth his hand to his
elect, it is still necessary that they should confess their own want and
nakedness, as to justification; for though they have been regenerated by the
Spirit of God, yet in many things they are deficient, and thus in innumerable
ways they become exposed to eternal death in the sight of God; so that they have
in themselves no righteousness. The Papists differ from us in the first place,
imagining as they do, that there are certain preparations necessary; for that
false notion about free-will cannot be eradicated from their hearts. As then
they will have man to be endued with free- will, they always connect with it
some power, as though they could obtain grace by their own doings. They indeed
confess that man of himself can do nothing, except by the helping grace of God;
but in the meantime they blend, as I have said, their own fictitious
preparations. Others confess, that until God anticipates us by his grace, there
is no power whatever in free-will; but afterwards they suppose that free-will
concurs with God&#8217;s grace, as it would be by itself inefficient, except
received by our consent. Thus they always reserve for men some worthiness; but a
greater difference exists as to the second subject: for after we have been
regenerated through God&#8217;s grace, the Papists imagine that we are justified
by the merits of works. They confess, that until God anticipates us by his
grace, we are condemned and cannot attain salvation except through the assisting
grace of God; but as soon as God works in us, we are then, they say, able to
attain righteousness by our own works.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we object and say, that the faithful, after
having been regenerated by the Spirit of God, do not fulfill the law: they allow
this to be true, but say that they might if they would, for that God has
commanded nothing which is above what men are capable of doing. And this also is
a most pernicious error. They are at the same time forced to confess, that
experience itself teaches us that no man is wholly free from sin: then some
guilt always remains. But they say, that if we kept half the law, we could
obtain righteousness by that half. Hence, if one by adultery offended God and
thus becomes exposed to eternal death, and yet abstains from theft, he is just,
they say, because he is no thief. He is an adulterer, it is true; but he is yet
just in part, because he keeps a part of the law; and they call this partial
righteousness. But God has not promised salvation to men, except they fully and
really fulfill whatever he has commanded in his law. For it is not said,
&#8220;He that fulfill a part of the law shall live;&#8221; but he who shall do
these things shall live in them. Moses does not point out two or three
commandments, but includes the whole law
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;031805&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
18:5.) There is also a declaration made by James,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;He who has forbidden to commit
adultery, has also forbidden to steal: whosoever then transgresses the law in
one particular, is a transgressor of the whole law&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;590208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">James
2:8,11):</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">he is then excluded from any hope of righteousness.
We hence see that the papists are most grossly mistaken, who imagine, that men,
when they keep the law only in part, are just.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Were there indeed any one found who strictly kept
God&#8217;s law, he could not be counted just, except by virtue of a promise.
And here also the Papists stumble, and are at the same time inconsistent with
themselves; for they confess that merits do not obtain righteousness for men by
their own intrinsic worth, but only by the covenant of the law. But as soon as
they have said this, they immediately forget themselves, and say what is
contrary, like men carried away by passion. Were then the Papists to join
together these two things &#8212; that there is no righteousness except by
covenant, and that there is a partial righteousness they would see that they are
inconsistent: for where is this partial righteousness? If we are not righteous
except according to the covenant of the law, then we are not righteous except
through a full and perfect observance of the law. This is
certain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They go astray still more grievously as to the
remission of sins; for as it is well known, they obtrude their own
satisfactions, and thus seek to expiate the sins of men by their own merits, as
though the sacrifice of Christ was not sufficient for that purpose. Hence it is
that they will not allow that we are gratuitously justified by faith; for they
cannot be brought to acknowledge a free remission of sins; and except the
remission of sins be gratuitous, we must confess that righteousness is not by
faith alone, but also by merits. But the whole Scripture proves that expiation
is nowhere else to be sought, except through the sacrifice of Christ alone. This
error, then, of the Papists is extremely gross and false. They further err in
pleading for the merits of works; for they boast of their own inventions, the
works of supererogation, or as they call them, satisfactions. And these
meritorious works, under the Papacy, are gross errors and worthless
superstitions, and yet they toil in them and lacerate themselves, nay, they
almost wear out themselves. If they mutter many short prayers, if they run to
altars and to various churches, if they buy masses, in a word, if they
accumulate all these fictitious acts of worship, they think that they merit
righteousness before God. Thus they forget their own saying, that righteousness
is by covenant; for if it be by covenant, it is certain that God does not
promise it to fictitious works, which men of themselves invent and contrive. It
then follows, that what men bring to God, devised by themselves, cannot do
anything towards the attainment of righteousness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is also another error which must be noticed,
for in good works they perceive not those blemishes which justly displease God,
so that our works might be deservedly condemned were they strictly examined and
tried. The Papists rightly say, that we are not justified by the intrinsic
worthiness of works, but afterwards they do not consider how imperfect our works
are, for no work proceeds from mortal man which can fully answer to what
God&#8217;s covenant requires. How so? For no work proceeds from the perfect
love of God, and where the perfect love of God does not exist, there is
corruption there. It hence follows, that all our works are polluted before God;
for they flow not except from the impure fountain of the heart. Were any to
object and say, that the hearts of men are cleansed by the regeneration of the
Spirit, we allow this; but at the same time much filth always remains in our
hearts, and it ought to be sufficient for us to know that nothing is pure and
genuine before God except where the perfect love of him exists.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, the Papists are blind to all these things,
it is no wonder that they with so much hostility contend with us about
righteousness, and can by no means allow that the righteousness of faith is
gratuitous, for from the beginning this figment about free- will has been
resorted to &#8212; &#8220;if men of themselves come to God, then they are not
freely justified.&#8221; They, then, as I have said, imagine a partial
righteousness, they suppose the deficiency to be made up by satisfactions, they
have also, as they say, their devotions, that is, their own contrived modes of
worship. Thus it comes, that they ever persuade themselves that the
righteousness of man, at least in part, is made up by himself or by works. They
indeed allow that we are justified by faith, but when it is added, by faith
alone, then they begin to be furious; but they consider not that righteousness,
if obtained by faith, cannot be by works, for Paul, as I have shown above,
reasons from the contrary, when he says, that righteousness, if it be by the
works of the law, is not by faith, for faith, as it has been said, strips man of
everything, that he may seek of God what he needs. But the Papists, though they
think that man has not enough for himself, do not yet acknowledge that he is so
needy and miserable, that righteousness must be sought in God alone. But yet
sufficiently clear is the doctrine of Paul, and if Paul had never spoken, reason
itself is sufficient to convince us that men cannot be justified by faith until
they cast away every confidence in their own works, for if righteousness be of
faith, then it is of grace alone, and if by grace alone, then it cannot be by
works. It is wholly puerile in the Papists to think, that it is partly by grace
and partly by the merits of works; for as salvation cannot be divided, so
righteousness cannot be divided, by which we attain salvation itself. As, then,
faith acquires for us favor before God, and by this favor we are counted just,
so all works must necessarily fall to the ground, when righteousness is ascribed
to faith.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as the
corruption of our flesh ever leads us to pride and vain confidence, we may be
illuminated by thy word, so as to understand how great and how grievous is our
poverty, and be thus taught wholly to deny ourselves, and so to present
ourselves naked before thee, that we may not hope for righteousness or for
salvation from any other source than from thy mercy alone, nor seek any rest but
only in Christ; and may we cleave to thee by the sacred and inviolable bond of
faith, that we may boldly despise all those empty boastings by which the ungodly
exult over us, and that we may also so cast ourselves down in true humility,
that thereby we may be carried upward above all heavens, and become partakers of
that eternal life which thine only begotten Son has purchased for us by his own
blood. Amen.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND ELEVENTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE yesterday compared this passage of Habakkuk with
the interpretation of Paul, who draws this inference, that we are justified by
faith without the works of the law, because the Prophet teaches us that we are
to live by faith, for the way of life and of righteousness is the same, inasmuch
as life is not to be otherwise sought by us than through the paternal favor of
God. This then is our life &#8212; to be united to God; but this union with God
cannot be hoped for by us while he imputes sins to us; for as he is just and
cannot deny himself, iniquity must be ever hated by him. Then as long as he
regards us as sinners, he must necessarily hold us as hateful to him. Where the
hatred of God is, there is death and ruin. It then follows, that we can have no
hope of life until we be reconciled to God, and there is no other way by which
God can restore us to favor, but by regarding and counting us as just. It hence
follows, that Paul reasons correctly, when he leads us from life to
righteousness; for they are two things which are connected and
inseparable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence the error of the Papists comes to light, who
think that to be justified is nothing else but to be renewed in righteousness,
in order that we may lead a pious and a holy life. Hence their righteousness is
a quality. But Paul&#8217;s view is very different, for he connects our
justification and salvation together, inasmuch as God cannot be propitious to us
without being reconciled to us. And how is this done even by not imputing to us
our sins. Hence they speak correctly and truly express what the Holy Spirit
everywhere teaches us, who call it imputative righteousness, for they thus show
that it is not a quality, but, on the contrary, a relative righteousness, and
therefore we said yesterday that he who lives by faith derives life from
another, and that every one who is just by faith, is just through what is not in
himself, even through the gratuitous mercy of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see how suitably Paul joins righteousness
with life, and adduces the Prophet&#8217;s testimony to prove gratuitous
justification, who affirms that we are to live by faith. But it is no wonder
that the Papists go in so many ways astray in this instance, for they even
differ with us in the meaning of the word faith. Hence it is that they so
obstinately deny that we are justified by faith alone. They are forced, as we
have said yesterday, to admit the righteousness of faith; but the exclusive
particle they cannot endure; for they imagine that it is a moulded faith that
justifies, and this moulded or formed faith is piety, or the fear of God. And by
calling faith unformed they seem to think that we can embrace the promises of
God without the fruit of regeneration, which is very absurd, as though faith
were not the peculiar gift of the Spirit, and a pledge of our adoption. But
these are principles of which the Papists are wholly ignorant; for they are
given up to a reprobate mind, so that they stumble at the very first elements of
religion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is sufficient for us, in order to understand
this passage, to know that we live by faith; for our life is a shadow or a
passing cloud; and hence our only remedy is to seek life from God alone. And how
does God communicate this life to us? even by gratuitous promises which we
embrace by faith; hence salvation is by faith. Now, salvation cannot be ascribed
to faith and to works too; for faith refers the praise for life and salvation to
God alone, and works show that something is due to man. Faith, then, as to
justification, entirely excludes all works, so that they come to no account
before God; and hence I have said that salvation is by faith; for we are
accepted of God by gratuitous remission of sins. The union of God with us is
true and real salvation; but no one can be united to God without righteousness,
and there is found in us no righteousness; hence God himself freely imputes it
to us; and as we are justified freely, so our salvation is said to be
gratuitous.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I will not now repeat what may be said of
justification by faith; for it is better to proceed with the Prophet&#8217;s
subject, only it may be necessary to add two things to what has been said. The
Prophet testified to the men of his age that salvation is by faith; it then
follows that they had regard to Christ; for without relying on a mediator they
could not have trusted in God. For as our righteousness is said to be the
remission of sins, so a sacrifice must necessarily intervene, by which God is
pacified, so as not to impute our sins. They had indeed their sacrifices
according to the law; but these were to direct their minds to Christ; for they
were by no means acceptable to God, except through that Mediator on whom our
faith at this day is founded. There is also another thing: the Prophet, by
distinctly expressing that the just live by faith, clearly shows, that through
the whole course of this life we cannot be deemed just in any other way than by
a gratuitous imputation. He does not say that the children of Adam, born in a
state exposed to eternal death, do recover life by faith; but that the just, who
are now endued with the true fear of God, live by faith; and thus refuted is the
romance about initial justification. Let us now then proceed -</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet has taught us that a tranquil state
of mind cannot be otherwise had than by recumbing on the grace of God alone; and
that they who elate themselves, and fly in the air, and feed on the wind,
procure for themselves many sorrows and inquietudes. But he now comes to the
king of Babylon, and also to his kingdom; for in my judgement he speaks not only
of the king, but includes also that tyrannical empire with its people, and
represents them as a great company of robbers. He then says in short, that
though the Babylonians, like drunken men, hurried here and there without any
control, yet God&#8217;s vengeance, by which they were to be brought to nothing,
was nigh at hand. What ever therefore the Prophet subjoins to the end of the
chapter tends to confirm his doctrine, which we have already explained &#8212;
that the just shall live by faith. We cannot indeed be fully convinced of this
except we hold firmly this principle &#8212; that God cares for us, and that the
whole world is governed by his providence; so that it cannot be but that he will
at length check the wicked, and punish their sins, and deliver the innocent who
call upon him. Unless this be our conviction, there can be no benefit derived
from our faith; we might indeed be a hundred times deceived; for experience
teaches us that the hopes of men, as long as they are fixed on the earth, are
vain and delusive, as they are only mere imaginations. Except then God governs
the world there is no salvation to the faithful; for God in that case would
delude them with vain promises, and they would flatter themselves with an empty
prospect, or hope for that which is not. Hence the Prophet shows how it is that
the just shall live by faith; and that is because the Lord will defend all who
call upon him, and that inasmuch as he is the just Judge of all the world, he
will finally execute judgement on all the wicked, though for a time they act
wantonly, and think that they shall escape punishment, because God does not
execute upon them immediate vengeance. We now perceive the design of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>

yea, is it so truly? can it be so? So it is in this place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yea,
truly</i></font><font face="Palatino">, says the Prophet. That it is an
amplification may be gathered from the context. He had said before that they who
elevate themselves, or seem to themselves to be well fortified, are fearful in
their minds, and driven backwards and forwards. He now advances another step
&#8212; that when men are borne along by unrestrained wantonness, and promise
themselves all things, as though there was no God, they surpass even the
drunken, being hurried on by blind cupidity. When therefore men thus abandon
themselves, can they escape the judgement of God? Far less bearable is such a
madness than that simple arrogance of which he had spoken in the last verse.
Thus then are the two verses connected together, &#8212; &#8220;Yea, truly, he

even like to wild beasts or to the grave, devouring whatever meets them &#8212;
he surely will not at length be endured by God.&#8221; Vengeance, then, is nigh
to all the proud, who are cruelly furious, passing all bounds and without any
fear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But interpreters differ as to the import of the words
which follow. Some render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dgwb</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>bugad</i>, to deceive, and it means so in some places; and they render the
clause thus &#8212; &#8220;Wine deceives a proud man, and he will not
dwell.&#8221; This is indeed true, but the meaning is strained; I therefore
prefer to follow the commonly received interpretation &#8212; that the proud man
transgresses as it were through wine. At the same time I do not agree with
others as to the expression &#8220;transgressing as through wine.&#8221; Some
give this version &#8212; &#8220;Man addicted to wine or to drunkenness
transgresses;&#8221; and then they add &#8212; &#8220;a proud man will not
inhabit;&#8221; but they pervert the sentence, and mangle the words of the
Prophet; for his words are &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By wine transgressing the proud
man</i></font><font face="Palatino">: he does not say that a man addicted to
wine transgresses; but he compares the proud to drunken men, who, forgetting all
reason and shame, abandon themselves unto all that is disgraceful; for the
drunken distinguishes nothing, and becomes like a brute animal, so that he shuns
nothing that is base and unbecoming. This is the reason why the Prophet compares
proud men to the drunken, who transgress through wine, that is, who observe no
moderation, but indulge themselves in excesses. We now then understand the real
meaning of the Prophet, which many have not perceived. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh26</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the word <i>inhabiting</i> I take it in a
metaphorical sense, as signifying to rest or to continue in the same place. The
drunken are borne along by a certain excitement; so they do not restrain
themselves, for they have no power over their feet or their hands: but as wine
excites them, so they ramble here and there like insane persons. As then such an
unruly temper lays hold on and bewilders drunken men, so the Prophet very aptly
says that the proud man never rests.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the reason follows, (provided the meaning be
approved,) </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because he enlarges as
the grave his soul he is like to death</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is
then the insatiableness which he had mentioned &#8212; that the proud cannot be
satisfied, and therefore include heaven and earth and sea within the compass of
their desires. Since then they thus run here and there, it is no wonder that the
Prophet says that they do not rest.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He enlarges
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as the grave his
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and then he adds &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he heaps
together</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or congregates, or collects
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to himself all nations, and
accumulates to himself all people</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, the
proud man keeps within no moderate limits; for though he were able to make one
heap of all nations, he would yet think that not enough, like Alexander, who
wept because he had not then enjoyed the empire of the whole world; and had he
enjoyed it his tears would not have been dried; for he had heard that, according
to the opinion of Democritus, there were many worlds. What did he mean? even
this &#8220;Were I to obtain the empire of the world, I should still be poor;
for if there are more worlds I should still wish to devour them all.&#8221;
These proud men surpass every kind of drunkenness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now apprehend the meaning of the words; and though
they contain a general truth, yet the Prophet no doubt applies them to the king
of Babylon and to all the Chaldeans; for as it has been said, he includes the
whole nation. He shows then here, that the Chaldeans were much worse and less
excusable than those who with great fierceness elated themselves, for their rage
carried them farther, as they wished to swallow up the whole world. But in order
to express this more fully, he says that they were like drunken men; and he no
doubt indirectly derides here the counsels of princes, who think themselves to
be very wise, when either by deceit they oppress their neighbors, or by artful
means seize for themselves on the lands of others, or by some contrivance, or
even by force of arms, take possession of them. As princes take wonderful
delight in their iniquities, so the Prophet says that they are like drunken men
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who transgress by
wine</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, who are completely overcome by
excessive drinking; and at the same time he shows the cause of this drunkenness
by mentioning the words </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ryhy
rbg</font><font face="Palatino">, &#8220;proud man.&#8221; As then they are
proud, so all their crafts are like the freaks of drunkenness, that is, furious,
as when a man is deprived of reason by wine. Having thus spoken of the
Babylonians he immediately adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">Now at length the Prophet denounces punishment on
the Babylonian king and the Chaldeans; for the Lord would render them a sport to
all. But some think that a punishment is also expressed in the preceding verse,
such as awaits violent robbers, who devour the whole world. But I, on the
contrary, think that the Prophet spoke before of proud cruelty, and simply
showed what a destructive evil it is, being an insatiable cupidity; and now, as
I have stated, he comes to its punishment; and he says first, that all the
people who had been collected as it were into a heap, would take up a parable or
a taunt, in order to scoff at the king of Babylon. When therefore the Chaldeans
should possess the empire of almost the whole world, and subject to their power
all their neighboring nations, all these would at length take up against them
parables and taunts; and what would be said everywhere would be this &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woe to him who increases and
enriches himself by things not his own. How
long?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, Is this to be perpetual? All
then who thus increase themselves heap on themselves thick clay, by which they
shall at last be overthrown.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the words,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>meshil</i> is a short saying or a pithy sentence, and worthy to be
remembered, as we have noticed elsewhere. Some render it parable. As to the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hxylm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>melitse</i>, it probably signifies a scoff or a taunt, by which any one is
reproved; for it comes from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#8776;wl</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>luts</i>, which means to laugh at one or to deride him. It is indeed true,
that the Hebrews call a rhetorician or an interpreter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#8776;ylm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>melits</i>; and hence some render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hxylm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>melitse</i>, interpretation; but it is not suitable to this passage; for the
Prophet speaks here of taunts that would be cast against the king of Babylon.
For as he had as with an open mouth swallowed up all, so also all would eagerly
prick him with their goads, and disdainfully deride him. The word he afterwards
adds
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twdyj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chidut</i>, is to be read, I have no doubt, in the genitive case. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh27</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I
therefore do not approve of adding a copulative, as many do, and read thus
&#8212; &#8220;a taunt and an enigma.&#8221; This word comes from the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dwj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chud</i>, which is to speak enigmatically; hence
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twdyj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chidut</i>, are enigmas, or metaphors, or obscure sentences; and we know that
when we wish to touch a man to the quick, there is more sharpness when we use an
obscure word, which contains a metaphor or ambiguity, or something of this kind.
It is not therefore without reason that the Prophet calls taunts, enigmas,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twdyj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chidut</i>, that is, obscure words, which bite or prick men sharply, as it
were with goads. Hence in all scoffs a figurative language ought to be used; and
except the expression be ambiguous or alliterative, or, in short, contain such
metaphors as it is not necessary to recite here, there would be in it no beauty,
no aptness. When therefore men wish to form biting taunts, they obscure what
might be plainly said by some indirect metaphor; and this is the reason why the
Prophet speaks here of a taunt that is enigmatical, for it is on that account
more severe.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall
say</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There is a change of number in this verb,
but it does not obscure the sense. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh28</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ywh</font><font face="Palatino">
may be rendered &#8220;woe&#8221;; or it may be an exclamation, as when one is
attracted by some particular sight, <i>caca or sus</i>; and so it is taken often
by the Hebrews, and the context seems to favor this meaning, for
&#8220;woe&#8221; would be frigid. When the Prophets pronounce a curse on the
wicked, it is no doubt a dreadful threat; but what is found here is a taunt, by
which the whole world would deride those haughty tyrants who thought that they
ought to have been worshipped as gods. He! they say, where is he who
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>multiplies himself by what
belongs to another?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How long
</i></font><font face="Palatino">is this to be? even
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>such accumulate on themselves
thick clay</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, they sink themselves in
deep caverns, and heap on themselves mountains, by which they become
overwhelmed. We now understand the meaning of the Prophet&#8217;s
words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What seems here to be the singing of triumph before
the victory is no matter of wonder; for our faith, as it is well known, depends
not on the judgement of the flesh, nor regards what is openly evident; but it is
a vision of hidden things, as it is called in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:1, and the substance of things not seen. As then the firmness of faith is the
same, though what it apprehends is remote, and as faith ceases not to see things
hidden, &#8212; for through the mirror of God&#8217;s word it ascends above
heaven and earth, and penetrates into the spiritual kingdom of God, &#8212; as
faith, then, possesses a view so distant, it is not to be wondered that the
Prophet here boldly triumphs over the Babylonians, and now prescribes a derisive
song for all nations, that the proud, who had previously with so much cruelty
exalted themselves, might be scoffed at and derided.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But were any to ask, whether it be right to assail
even the wicked with scoffs and railleries, the question is unsuitable here; for
the Prophet does not here refer to what is lawful for the faithful to do, but
speaks only of what is commonly done by men: and we know that it is almost
natural to men, that when those whom they had feared and dared not to blame as
long as they were in power, are overthrown, they break forth against them not
only with many complaints and accusations, but also with wanton rudeness. As,
then, it usually happens, that all triumph over fallen tyrants, and throw forth
their taunts, and all seek in this way to bite, the Prophet describes this
regular course of things. It is not, however, to be doubted, but that he
composed this song according to the nature of the case, when he says, that they
were men who multiplied their own by what belonged to others; that is, that they
gathered the wealth of others. It is indeed true, that many things are commonly
spread abroad, for which there is no reason nor justice; but as some principles
of equity and justice remain in the hearts of men, the consent of all nations is
as it were the voice of nature, or the testimony of that equity which is
engraven on the hearts of men, and which they can never obliterate. Such is the
reason for this saying; for Habakkuk, by introducing the people as the speakers,
propounded, as it were, the common law of nature, in which all agree; and that
is, &#8212; that whosoever enriches himself by another&#8217;s wealth, shall at
length fall, and that when one accumulates great riches, these will become like
a heap to cover and overwhelm him. And if any one of us will consult his own
mind, he will find that this is engraven on his very nature.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">How, then, does it happen, that many should yet labor
to get for themselves the wealth of others, and strive for nothing else through
their whole life, but to spoil others that they may enrich themselves? It hence
appears that men&#8217;s minds are deprived of reason by sottishness, whenever
they thus addict themselves to unjust gain, or when they give themselves loose
reins to commit frauds, robberies, and plunders. And thus we perceive that the
Prophet had not without reason represented all the proud and the cruel as
drunken.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then follow the words,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ytmAd[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>od-mati</i>, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>how
long?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This also is the dictate of nature; that
is, that an end will some time be to unjust plunders, though God may not
immediately check plunderers and wicked men, who proceed and effect their
purposes by force and slaughters, and frauds and evil-doings. In the mean time
the Prophet also intimates, that tyrants and their cruelty cannot be endured
without great weariness and sorrow; for indignity on account of evil deeds
kindles within the breasts of all, so that they become wearied when they see
that wicked men are not soon restrained. Hence almost the whole world sound
forth these words, How long, how long? When any one disturbs the whole world by
his ambition and avarice, or everywhere commits plunders, or oppresses miserable
nations, &#8212; when he distresses the innocent, all cry out, How long? And
this cry, proceeding as it does from the feeling of nature and the dictate of
justice, is at length heard by the Lord. For how comes it that all, being
touched with weariness, cry out, How long? except that they know that this
confusion of order and justice is not to be endured? And this feeling, is it not
implanted in us by the Lord? It is then the same as though God heard himself,
when he hears the cries and greenings of those who cannot bear
injustice.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But let us in the meantime see that no one of us
should have to say the same thing to himself, which he brings forward against
others. For when any avaricious man proceeds through right or wrong, as they
say, when an ambitious man, by unfair means, advances himself, we instantly cry,
How long? and when any tyrant violently oppresses helpless men, we always say,
How long? Though every one says this as to others, yet no one as to himself. Let
us therefore take heed that, when we reprove injustice in others, we come
without delay to ourselves, and be impartial judges. Self love so blinds us,
that we seek to absolve ourselves from that fault which we freely condemn in
others. In general things men are always more correct in their judgement, that
is, in matters in which they themselves are not concerned; but as soon as they
come to themselves, they become blind, and all rectitude vanishes, and all
judgement is gone. Let us then know, that this song is set forth here by the
Prophet, drawn, as it were, from the common feeling of nature, in order that
every one of us may put a restraint on himself when he discharges the office of
a judge in condemning others, and that he may also condemn himself, and restrain
his desires, when he finds them advancing beyond just bounds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must also observe what he subjoins, &#8212; that
the avaricious </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>accumulate on
themselves thick clay</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This at first may appear
incredible; but the subject itself plainly shows what the Prophet teaches here,
provided our minds are not so blinded as not to see plain things. Hardly indeed
an avaricious man can be found who is not a burden to himself, and to whom his
wealth is not a source of trouble. Every one who has accumulated much, when he
comes to old age, is afraid to use what he has got, being ever solicitous lest
he should lose any thing; and then, as he thinks nothing is sufficient, the more
he possesses the more grasping he becomes, and frugality is the name given to
that sordid, and, so to speak, that servile restraint within which the rich
confine themselves. In short, when any one forms a judgement of all the
avaricious of this world, and is himself free from all avarice, having a free
and unblessed mind, he will easily apprehend what the Prophet says here, &#8212;
that all the wealth of this world is nothing else but a heap of clay, as when
any one puts himself of his own accord under a great heap which he had collected
together.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some refer this to the walls of Babylon, which were
built of baked bricks, as it is well known; but this is too farfetched. Others
think that the Prophet speaks of the last end of us all; for they who possess
the greatest riches, being at last thrown into the grave, are covered with
earth: but this also is not suitable here, any more than when they apply it to
Nebuchadnezzar, that is, to that sottishness by which he had inebriated himself
almost through his whole life; or when others apply it to Belshazzar, his
grandson, because when he drank from the sacred vessels of the temple, he
uttered slanders and blasphemies against God. These explanations are by no means
suitable; for the Prophet does not here speak of the person of the king alone,
but, as it has been solid, he, on the contrary, summons to judgement the whole
nation, which had given itself up to plunders and frauds and other evil
deeds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then a general truth is to be drawn from this
expression that all the avaricious, the more they heap together, the more they
lade themselves, and, as it were, bury themselves under a great load. Whence is
this? Because riches, acquired by frauds and plunders, are nothing else than a
heavy and cumbrous lump of earth: for God returns on the heads of those who thus
seek to enrich themselves, whatever they have plundered from others. Had they
been contented with some moderate portion, they might have lived cheerfully and
happily, as we see to be the case with all the godly; who though they possess
but little, are yet cheerful, for they live in hope, and know that their
supplies are in God&#8217;s hand, and expect everything from his blessing.
Hence, then, their cheerfulness, because they have no anxious fears. But they
who inebriate themselves with riches, find that they carry a useless burden,
under which they lie down, as it were, sunk and
buried.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as thou
deignest so far to condescend as to sustain the care of this life, and to supply

to rely on thee, and so to trust to thy blessing, as to abstain not only from
all plunder and other evil deeds, but also from every unlawful coveting; and to
continue in thy fear, and so to learn also to bear our poverty on the earth,
that being content with those spiritual riches which thou offerest to us in thy
gospel, and of which thou makes us now partakers, we may ever cheerfully aspire
after that fullness of all blessings which we shall enjoin when at length we
shall reach the celestial kingdom, and be perfectly united to thee, through

<div><br><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet proceeds with the subject which we
have already begun to explain; for he introduces here the common taunts against
the king of Babylon and the whole tyrannical empire, by which many nations had
been cruelly oppressed. He therefore says that enemies, who should

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh29</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> would

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>up</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
Some expound this of worms, but not rightly: for God not only inflicted
punishment on the king when dead, but he intended also that there should be on
earth an evident and a memorable proof of his vengeance on the Babylonians, by
which it might be made known to all that their cruelty could not be suffered to
go unpunished.</font><br></div>

for the Babylonians, relying on their own power, did not think that any evil was
nigh them; and if any one dared to rise up against them, this could not have

when they find themselves fortified on all sides. But the Prophet declares here

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here expresses more clearly why the
Babylonians were to be so severely dealt with by Cod. He shows that it would be
a just reward that they should be plundered in their turn, who had previously
given themselves up to plunder, violence, and cruelty. Since, then, they had
exercised so much inhumanity towards all people, the Prophet intimates here that
God could not be deemed as treating them cruelly, by inflicting on them so
severe a punishment: he also confirms the former truth, and recalls the
attention of the faithful to the judgement of God, as a main principle to be
remembered; for when things in the world are in a state of confusion, we
despond, and all hope vanishes, except this comes to our mind &#8212; that as
God is the judge of the world it cannot be otherwise but that at length all the
wicked must appear before his tribunal, and give there an account of all their
deeds; and Scripture, also, is wont to set God before us as a judge, whenever
the purpose is to allay our troubles. The Prophet now does the same thing: for
he says, that robbers should soon come upon the Babylonians, who would plunder
them; for God, the judge of the world, would not at last suffer so many plunders
to be unpunished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it was everywhere known that the Babylonians had,
beyond all bounds and moderation, given themselves up to plunder, so that they
spared no nations. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because thou hast plundered many
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and on this he enlarges; because the
Babylonians had not only done wrongs to a few men, or to one people, but had
marched through many countries. As, then, they had taken to themselves so much
liberty in doing evil, the Prophet draws this conclusion &#8212; that they could
not escape the hand of God, but that they were at length to find by experience
that there was a God in heaven, who would repay them for their
wrongs.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says also,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Spoil thee shall the remnant of
all people</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This admits of two expositions; it
may mean, that the people, who had been plundered by the Chaldeans, would take
revenge on them: and he calls them a remnant, because they were not entire; but
yet he intimates that they would be sufficient to take vengeance on the
Babylonians. This view may be admitted, and yet we may suppose, that the Prophet
takes in other nations, who had never been plundered; as though he had said
&#8212; &#8220;Thou hast indeed spoiled many nations; but there are other
nations in the world whom thy cruelty could not have reached. All the people
then who remain in the world shall strive to outdo one another in attacking
thee; and canst thou be strong enough to resist so great a power?&#8221; Either
of these views may be admitted; that is, that in the wasted and plundered
countries there would be still a remnant who would take vengeance, &#8212; or
that the world contained other people who would willingly undertake this cause
and execute vengeance on the Babylonians; for God would by his secret influence
fulfill by their means his purpose of punishing them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on account of man&#8217;s
blood</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, because thou hast shed innocent
blood, and because thou hast committed many plunders; for thou hast not only
injured a few men, but thy daringness and cruelty have also extended to many
nations. He indeed mentions the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
and also the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>city</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
Some confine these words to the land of Judea and to Jerusalem, but not rightly;
for the Prophet speaks here generally; and to the land, he joins cities and
their inhabitants.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh30</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this verse contains a truth which applies to all
times. Let us then learn, during the licentious success of tyrants, to raise up
our minds to heaven&#8217;s tribunal, and to nourish our patience with this
confidence, that the Lord, who is the judge of the world, will recompense these
cruel and bloody robbers, and that the more licentious they are, the heavier
judgement is nigh them; for the Lord will awaken and raise up as many to execute
vengeance as there are men in the world, who by shedding blood will inflict
punishment, though they may not intend to fulfill his purpose. God can indeed
(as it has been often observed) execute his judgements in a wonderful and sudden
manner. Let us hence also learn to restrain our evil desires; for none shall go
unpunished who will allow themselves to injure their brethren; though they may
seem to be unpunished for a time, yet God, who is ever the same, will at length
return on their heads whatever they have devised against others, as we shall
presently see again. He now adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk proceeds in exciting the king of Babylon
by taunts; which were not scurrilous jests, but contained serious threatening;
for, as it has been already said, the Prophet here introduces indeed the common
people, but in that multitude we are to recognize the innumerable heralds of
God&#8217;s vengeance: and hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woe to him who
coveteth</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc.; or we may say, He! for it is a
particle of exclamation, as it has been said: He! thou, he says, who covetest an
evil covetousness to thy house, and settest on high thy nest: but what shall
happen? The next verse declares the punishment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woe to him who covets an evil
covetousness to his house</i></font><font face="Palatino">, may be read by
itself, &#8212; that this cupidity shall be injurious to his house; as though he
had said, &#8220;Thou indeed wouldest provide for thy house by accumulating
great riches; but thy house shall find this to be evil and ruinous. So the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h[r</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>roe</i>, evil, might be referred to the house; but the verse is best
connected by reading the whole together; that is, that the Babylonians not only
provided for themselves, while they with avidity plundered and collected much
wealth from all quarters; but that they wished also to make provisions for their
sons and grandsons: and we also see, that avarice has this object in view; for
they who are anxiously bent on the accumulation of riches do not only regard
what is needful for themselves to pass through life, but also wish to leave
their heirs rich. Since then the avaricious are desirous of enriching for ever
their houses, the prophet, deriding this madness, says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woe to him who covets an evil
covetousness to his house</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, who wishes
not only to abound and be satiated himself, but also to supply his posterity
with abundance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds another vice, which is almost ever connected
with the former &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he
may set</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his nest on
high</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for the avaricious have a regard to this
&#8212; to fortify themselves; for as an evil conscience is always fearful, many
dangers come across their minds &#8212; &#8220;This may happen to me,&#8221; and
then, &#8220;My wealth will procure for me the hatred and envy of many. If then
some danger be at hand, I shall be able to redeem my life many times;&#8221; and
he also adds, &#8220;Were I satisfied with a moderate portion, many would become
my rivals; but when my treasures surpass what is common, then I shall be as it
were beyond the reach of men; and when others envy one another, I shall
escape.&#8221; So the avaricious think within themselves when they are ardently
bent on accumulating riches, and form for themselves a great heap like a nest;
for they think that they are raised above the world, and are exempt from the
common lot of men, when surrounded by their riches.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see what the Prophet means:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woe</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to him who wickedly and
intemperately covets</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And why does he so do? To
enrich his posterity. And then he adds, to him who covets that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he may set his nest on
high</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, that he may by wealth fortify
himself, that he may be able to drive away every danger, and be thus exempt from
every evil and trouble. And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he may deliver himself from
the power of evil</i></font><font face="Palatino">; he expresses now more
clearly what I have said &#8212; that the rich are inebriated with false
confidence, when they surpass all others; for they think not themselves to be
mortals, but imagine that they have another life, as though they had a world of
their own, free from all dangers. But while the avaricious thus elevate
themselves by a proud confidence, the Prophet derides their madness. He then
subjoins their punishment &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet again confirms the truth, that those
who count themselves happy, imagining that they are like God, busy themselves in
vain; for God will turn to shame whatever they think to be their glory, derived
from their riches. The avaricious indeed wish, as it appears from the last
verse, to prepare splendor for their posterity, and they think to render
illustrious their race by their wealth; for this is deemed to be nobility, that
the richer any one is the more he excels, as he thinks, in dignity, and the more
is he to be esteemed by all. Since, then, this is the object of almost all the
avaricious, the Prophet here reminds them, that they are greatly deceived; for
the Lord will not only frustrate their hopes, but will also convert their glory
into shame. Hence he says, that they consult shame to their
family.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He includes in the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>consult</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
all the industry, diligence, skill, care, and labor displayed by the avaricious.
We indeed see how very sagacious they are; for if they smell any gain at a
distance, they draw it to themselves, night and day they form new designs, that
they may circumvent this person and plunder that person, and accumulate into
their heap whatever money they can find, and also that they may join fields to
fields, built great palaces, and secure great revenues. This is the reason why
the Prophet says, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>consult
shame</i></font><font face="Palatino">. What is the object of all their designs?
for they are, as we have said, very sharp and keen-sighted, they are also
industrious, and torment themselves day and night with continual labor; for what
purpose are all these things? even for this, that their posterity may be
eminent, that their nobility may be in the mouth of all, and spread far and
wide. But the Prophet shows that they labor in vail; for God will turn to shame
whatever they in their great wisdom contrived for the honor of their families.
The more provident then the avaricious are, the more foolish they are, for they
consult nothing but disgrace to their posterity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>though thou cuttest off many
people</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This seems to have been expressed for
the sake of anticipating an objection; for it might have seemed incredible that
the Babylonians should form designs disgraceful to their posterity, when their
fame was so eminent, and Babylon itself was like an idol, and the king was
everywhere regarded with great reverence and also fear. Since then the
Babylonians had made such advances, who could have thought it possible that what
the Prophet declares here should take place? But, as I have already said, he
meets these objections, and says, &#8220;Though the Babylonians shall conquer
many enemies, and overthrow strong people, yet this will be of no advantage to
them; nay, even that will turn out to their disgrace which they think will be to
their glory.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To the same purpose is what he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou hast sinned against thy
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some give this version, &#8220;Thou hast
sinned licentiously&#8221; or immoderately; others, &#8220;Thy soul has
sinned,&#8221; but these pervert the Prophet&#8217;s meaning; for what he
intended was nothing else but the evils which the avaricious and the cruel bring
on themselves, and which will return on their own heads. When therefore the
Babylonians contrived ruin for the whole world, the Prophet predicts that an
end, very different from what they thought, would be to them:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou hast
sinned</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>against thine own
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino">; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh31</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
is, the evil which thou didst prepare to bring on others, shall be made by God
to fall on thine own head.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this kind of declaration ought to be carefully
noticed; that is, that the ungodly, while they trouble all, and harass all,
while they torment one, plunder another, oppress another, do always sin against
their own souls; that is, they do not cause so such loss and sorrow to others as
to themselves: for the Lord will make the evil they intend for others to return
on themselves. He does not speak here of guilt, but of punishment, when he says,
&#8220;Thou hast sinned against thy soul;&#8221; that is, thou shalt receive the
reward due to all thy sins. We now then see what the Prophet means. It now
follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">There is here introduced by the Prophet a new
personification. He had before prepared a common song, which would be in the
mouth of all. He now ascribes speech to stones and wood, of which buildings are
formed. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The stone, he says, shall
cry from the wall, and the wood from the
chamber</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, there is no part of the
building that will not cry out that it was built by plunder, by cruelty, and, in
a word, by evil deeds. The Prophet not only ascribes speech to wood and stone,
but he makes them also respond one to the other as in a chorus, as in lyrics
there are voices which take up the song in turns.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The stone, he says, shall cry
from the wall, and the wood shall respond to it from the
chamber</i></font><font face="Palatino">; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh32</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as
though he said, &#8220;There will be a striking harmony in every part of the
building; for the wall will begin and will utter its song, &#8216;Behold I have
been built by blood and by iniquity;&#8217; and the wood will utter the same,
and will cry, &#8216;Woe;&#8217; but all in due order; there will be no confused
noise, but as music has distinct sounds, so also the stones will respond to the
wood and the wood to the stones, so that there may be, as they say,
corresponding
voices.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
stone</i></font><font face="Palatino">, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the wall shall cry, and the
wood shall answer &#8212; </i></font><font face="Palatino">what will it answer?
&#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woe to him who builds a
city by blood</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and who adorns
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his city by
iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By blood and by iniquity he
understands the same thing; for though the avaricious do not kill innocent men,
they yet suck their blood, and what else is this but to kill them by degrees, by
a slow tormenting process? For it is easier at once to undergo death than to
pine away in want, as it happens to helpless men when spoiled and deprived of
all their property. Wherever there is wanton plundering, there is murder
committed in the sight of God; for as it has been said, he who spares not the
helpless, but drinks up their blood, doubtless sins no less than if he were to
kill them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But if this personification seems to any one strange,
he must consider how incredible seemed to be what the Prophet here teaches, and
how difficult it was to produce a conviction on the subject. We indeed confess
that God is the judge of the world; nay, there is no one who does not anticipate
his judgement by condemning avarice and cruelty; the very name of avarice is
infamous and hated by all: the same may be said of cruelty. But yet when we see
the avaricious in splendor and in esteem, we are astounded, and no one is able
to foresee by faith what the Prophet here declares. Since, then our dullness is
so great, or rather our sottishness, it is no wonder that the Prophet should
here set before us the stones and the wood, as though he said, &#8220;When all
prophecies and all warnings become frigid, and God himself obtains no credit,
while openly declaring what he will do, and when his servants consume their
labor in vain by warning and crying, let now the stones come forth, and be
teachers to you who will not give ear to the voice of God himself, and let the
wood also cry out in its turn.&#8221; This, then, is the reason why the Prophet
introduces here mute things as the speakers, even to awaken our
insensibility.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall it not be, behold, from
Jehovah of hosts?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some
give a wrong version, &#8220;Is not this,&#8221; as though
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ene</i>, were put here instead of a pronoun demonstrative; but they extenuate
and obscure the beauty of the expression; nay, they pervert the meaning of the
Prophet: for when he says,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ene</i>, behold, he refers not to what he had said, nor specifies any
particular thing, and yet he shows, as it were by the finger, the judgement of
God, which he bids us to expect; as though he said, &#8220;Shall not God at
length have his turn, when the avaricious and the cruel have obtained their
triumphs in the world, and darkened the minds and thoughts of all, as though no
account were to be given by them before the tribunal of God? Shall not God
sometime show that it is his time to interpose?&#8221; When, therefore, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall it not be, behold, from
Jehovah?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> it is an indefinite mode of speaking;
he does not say, This or that shall be from the God of hosts; but,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall it not be, behold, from
Jehovah of hosts?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, God seems now indeed
to rest, and on this account men indulge themselves with greater boldness; but
he will not always remain still, Shall not God then come forth, who seems now to
be unconcerned? Something there will at length be from the God of hosts. And the
demonstrative particle confirms the same thing:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, as though he would show to the faithful as in a picture the tribunal of
God, which cannot be seen by us now but by faith. He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, will not there be
something</i></font><font face="Palatino"> from the God of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hosts?</i></font><font face="Palatino">
that is, Will not God at length stretch forth his hand, to show that he is not
unconcerned, but that he cares for the affairs of men? In a word, by this mode
of speaking is pointed out to us the change, which we are to hole for, inasmuch
as it cannot be soon realised.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he concludes,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
people</i></font><font face="Palatino">, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>labor in the fire, and the people
weary themselves in vain</i></font><font face="Palatino">. To labor in the fire
means the same thing as to take in hand an unprofitable work, the fruit of which
is immediately consumed. Some say that people labor in the fire, because Babylon
had been built by a great number of men, and at length perished by fire; but
this explanation seems far-fetched. I take a simpler view &#8212; that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>people labor in the
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino">, like him who performs a work, and a fire
is put under it and consumes it; or like him, who with great labor polishes his
own work, and a fire is prepared, which destroys it while in the hands of the
artifices. For it is certain that the Prophet repeats the same thing in another
form, when he says,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qyrAydb</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>bedi-rik</i>, with vanity, or for vanity. We now then apprehend his
object.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may here collect a useful doctrine &#8212; that
not only the fruit of labor shall be lost by all who seek by wicked means to
enrich themselves, but also that were the whole world favorable and subservient
to them, the whole would yet be useless; as it happened to the king of Babylon,
though he had many people ready to obey him. But the Prophet derides all those
great preparation; for God had fire at hand to consume whatever they had so
eagerly contrived who wished to spend all their labor to please one man. He at
length adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet briefly teaches us here, that so
remarkable would be God&#8217;s judgement on the Babylonians that his name would
thereby be celebrated through the whole world. But there is in this verse an
implied contrast; for God appeared not in his own glory when the Jews were led
away into exile; the temple being demolished and the whole city destroyed; and
also when the whole easterly regions was exposed to rapine and plunder. When
therefore the Babylonians were, after the Assyrians, swallowing up all their
neighbors, the glory of God did not then shine, nor was it conspicuous in the
world. The Jews themselves had become mute; for their miseries had, as it were,
stupefied them; their mouths were at least closed, so that they could not from
the heart bless God, while he was so severely afflicting them. And then, in that
manifold confusion of all things, the profane thought that all things here take
place fortuitously, and that there is no divine providence. God then was at that
time hid: hence the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Filled shall be the earth with
the knowledge of </i></font><font face="Palatino">God; that is, God will again
become known, when by stretching forth his hand he will execute vengeance on the
Babylonians; then will the Jews, as well as other nations, acknowledge that the
world is governed by God&#8217;s providence, as it had been once created by
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand the Prophet&#8217;s meaning, and
why he says, that the earth would be filled with the knowledge of God&#8217;s
glory; for the glory of God previously disappeared from the world, with regard
to the perceptions of men; but it shone forth again, when God himself had
erected his tribunal by overthrowing Babylon, and thereby proved that there is
no power among men which he cannot control. We have the same sentence in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;231109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
11:9.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh34</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The Prophet there speaks indeed of the kingdom of Christ; for when Christ was
openly made known to the world, the knowledge of God&#8217;s glory at the same
time filled the earth; for God then appeared in his own living image. But yet
our Prophet uses a proper language, when he says that the earth shall then be
filled with the knowledge of God&#8217;s glory, when he should execute vengeance
on the Babylonians. Hence incorrectly have some applied this to the preaching of
the gospel, as though Habakkuk made a transition from the ruin of Babylon to the
general judgement: this is a strained exposition. It is indeed a well-known mode
of speaking, and often occurs in the Psalms, that the power, grace, and truth of
God are made known through the world, when he delivers his people and restrains
the ungodly. The same mode the Prophet now adopts; and he compares this fullness
of knowledge to the waters of the sea, because the sea, as we know, is so deep,
that there is no measuring of its waters. So Habakkuk intimates, that the glory
of God would be so much known that it would not only fill the world, but in a
manner overflow it: as the waters of the sea by their vast quantity cover the
deep, so the glory of God would fill heaven and earth, so as to have no limits.
If, at the same time, there be a wish to extend this sentence to the coming of
Christ, I do not object: for we know that the grace of redemption flowed in a
perpetual stream until Christ appeared in the world. But the Prophet, I have no
doubt, sets forth here the greatness of God&#8217;s power in the destruction of
Babylon.

<div><br><font face="Palatino">THIS passage, in which the Prophet condemns the
king of Babylon for his usual practice of rendering drunk his friends, is
frigidly interpreted by most expounders. It has been already often said how bold
the Jews are in contriving what is fabulous; when nothing certain occurs to
them, they divine this or that without any discrimination or shame. Hence they
say, that Nebuchadnezzar was given to excess, and led all whom he could into a
participation of the same vice. They also think that his associates were captive
kings, as though he bid them for the sake of sport to be brought to his table,
and by drinking to their health, forced them to intoxication, that he might
laugh at them when they made themselves base and ridiculous. But all this is
groundless; for there is no history that relates any such thing. It is, however,
easy to see that another matter is here treated of by the Prophet; for he does
not speak of the king only, but he refers to the whole empire. I therefore doubt
not but that this whole discourse, in which the Babylonian king is condemned for
making drunk his associates or friends, is metaphorical or allegorical. But
before I proceed further on the subject, I shall say something as to the words;
for the meaning of the Prophet will thereby be made more
evident.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woe</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to him who gives his
friend drink</i></font><font face="Palatino">; then he adds,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;tmj
jpsm</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>mesephech</i> <i>chemetak</i>, &#8220;who
joinest and bottle.&#8221;
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hmj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cheme</i>, is taken in Hebrew for a bottle; and we know, and it is
sufficiently evident from Scripture, that the Jews used bottles of skin, as
there are casks and larger vessels with us. Since, then, they put their wine
into bottles, these were often taken for their cups, as it is in our language,
when one says, <i>Des flacons, des bouteilles</i>. Hence some give this
explanation &#8212; that the king of Babylon brought forth his flagons, that he
might force to intoxication, by excessive drinking, those who could not and
dared not to resist his will. But others render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hmj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cheme</i>, wrath, with a preposition understood: and in order that nothing
may be understood, some render the participle,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jpsm</font><font face="Palatino">,
&#8220;displaying,&#8221; that is, &#8220;his fury.&#8221; But as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hmj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cheme</i>, means to be hot, we may, therefore, properly give this version,
&#8220;Uniting thy heat;&#8221; that is, &#8220;It is not enough for thee to
inebriate others, except thou implicates them with thyself.&#8221; We now
perceive the meaning of this phrase. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou also dost
inebriate</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We may hence learn that the Prophet
had no other thing in view, but to show that the king of Babylon sought for
himself many associates in his intemperance or excess: at the same time he
takes, as I have said, excess in a metaphorical sense. I shall presently explain
more fully what all this means; but now we only expound the words.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
thou</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dost also
inebriate</i></font><font face="Palatino">: the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
as it is well known, is laid down for the sake of amplifying. After having said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou unitest thy
heat</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, thou exhales thine intemperance,
so that others also contract the same heat with thyself, he immediately adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou inebriatest
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that their nakedness may be made
open</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, that they may disclose
themselves with shame. The following verse I shall defer until we shall see more
clearly what the Prophet had in view. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh36</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As I have already said the Prophet charges the
Babylonian king with having implicated neighboring kings in his own evil
desires, and with having in a manner inebriated them. He indeed compares the
insatiable avarice of that king to intemperance; for as it is the object of
drunken men not to drink what may suffice them, but to glut themselves with
wine, so also when avarice is dominant in the hearts of men, they are seized
with a certain kind of fury, like a person who has an immoderate love for wine.
This is the reason for the metaphor; for the Babylonian king, when he thirsted
for the blood of men, and also for wealth and kingdoms, led into the same kind
of madness many other kings; for he could not have succeeded except he had
allured the favor of many others, and deceived them with vain expectations. As a
person who gives himself up to drinking wishes to leave associates, so Habakkuk
lays the same thing to the charge of the king of Babylon; for being himself
addicted to insatiable avarice, he procured associates to be as it were his
guests, and quaffed wine to them, that is, elicited their cupidity, that they
might join him in his wars; for each hoped for a part of the spoil after
victory. Since, then, he had thus blinded many kings, they are said to have been
inebriated by him. We indeed know that such allurements infatuate the minds and
hearts of men; for there is no intoxication that stultifies men more than that
eager appetite by which they devour both lands and seas.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then apprehend what the Prophet meant &#8212;
that the Babylonian king not only burnt with his own avarice, but kindled also,
as it were, a flame in others, like drunken men who excite one another. As then
he had thus inflamed all the neighboring kings to rush headlong without any
consideration and without any shame, like a person suffocated and overcome by
excessive drinking; so the Prophet designates this inflaming as quaffing wine to
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this metaphor ought to be carefully observed; for
we see at this day as in a mirror what the Prophet teaches here. For all the
great princes, when they devise any plans of their own, send their ambassadors
here and there, and seek to involve with themselves other cities and princes;
and as no one is willing to endanger himself without reason, they set forth many
fallacious allurements. And when any city fears a neighboring prince, it will
seek to fortify itself by a new protection; so a treaty, when offered, becomes
like a snare to it. And then when any inferior prince wishes to enlarge his
borders, or to revenge himself, he willingly puts on arms, nay, anxiously, that
he may be able, by the help of a greater, to effect his purpose, which he could
not otherwise accomplish. Thus we see that dukes and counts, as they are called,
and free cities, are daily inebriated. They who are chief kings, abounding in
wine, that is, full of many vain promises, give to drink, as it were with full
flagons, bidding wine to be brought forth on a well furnished table &#8212;
&#8220;I will make thine enemy to give way to thee, and thou shalt compel him
according to thy wish, and when I shall obtain the victory a part of the spoil
shall be allotted to thee; I desire nothing but the glory. With regard to you,
the free cities, see, ye tremble continually; now if you lie under my shadow, it
will be the best security for you.&#8221; Such quaffing is to be found at this
day almost throughout the whole of Europe.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then the Prophet does not without reason commemorate
this vice in the king of Babylon &#8212; that he made those associates drunk
whom he had bound to himself by perfidious treaties; for as it has been said,
there is no intoxication so dangerous as this madness; that is, when any one
promises this or that to himself, and imagines what does not exist. Hence he not
only says, that the Babylonian king gave drink to his friends, but also that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>joined his
bottles</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as though he had said that he was very
liberal, nay, prodigal, while seeking associates in his intemperance; for if one
condition did not suffice, another was added &#8212; &#8220;Behold, my king is
prepared; but if he is not enough another will be joined with him.&#8221; They
thus then join together their heat. If we take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hmj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cheme</i>, for a bottle, then to join together their bottles would mean, that
they accumulated promises until they inebriated those whom they sought to
deceive. But if the other interpretation be more approved, which I am disposed
to follow, then the meaning would be &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They join together their own
heat</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, they implicate others with
themselves; as they burn themselves with insatiable cupidity, so they spread
this ardor far and wide, so that the desires of many become
united.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that thou mayest see their
nakedness</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It was not indeed an object to the
king of Babylon to disclose the reproach of all those whom he had induced to
take part in his wars; but we know that great kings are wont to neglect their
friends, to whom at first they promise every thing. When a king wishes to entice
to himself a free city or an inferior prince, he will say &#8212; &#8220;See, I
seek nothing but to be thy friend&#8221;. We indeed see how shamefully they
perjure themselves; nor is it enough for them to utter these perjuries in their
courts; but not many years pass away before our great kings make public their
abominable perjuries; and it appears immediately afterwards that they thus seek,
without any shame, to mock both God and all mankind. After testifying that they
seek nothing except to defend by their protection what is right and just, and to
resist the tyranny and pride of others, they immediately draw back when anything
adverse afterwards happens, and the city, which had hoped everything from so
liberal a king, is afterwards forced to submit and to agree with its enemies,
and to manage matters anyhow; thus its
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nakedness is
disclosed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In the same manner also are inferior
princes deprived of their power. And to whom is this to be imputed but to the
principal author? For when any one, for the sake of ambition or avarice, leads
others to inconvenience or to damage, he may justly and correctly be said to
disclose their nakedness. We now apprehend the Prophet&#8217;s real meaning,
which interpreters have not understood. I come now to the next verse
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino">He says that he is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>satiated with shame instead of
glory</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some give this rendering &#8212;
&#8220;Thou art satiated with shame more than glory;&#8221; but this does not
suit the passage; for the Prophet does not mean that the Babylonian king was
satiated with his own reproach, but rather with that of others. Secondly, the
particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mem</i>, is not put here in a comparative sense, but the clause is on the
contrary to be understood thus &#8212; &#8220;By thy glory, or, on account of
thy glory, thou art satiated with shame&#8221;. It must also in the third place
be observed, that punishment is not what the Prophet describes in these words;
for it immediately follows &#8212;
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hja &#181;g
ht&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>shite gam ate</i>, &#8220;drink thou
also.&#8221; He comes now to punishment. By saying, then, that the king of
Babylon was satiated with shame on account of glory, it is the same as though he
had said, that while he was intent on increasing his own glory he brought all
others to shame. It is indeed the common game of great kings, as it has been
said, to enlarge their own power at the expense and loss of others. They would,
indeed, if they could, render their friends safe; but when any one loses ground
in their favor they neglect him. We see how at this day great kings, raising
great armies, shed innocent blood. When a slaughter is made in war they express
their grief, but it is only on account of their own glory or advantage. They
will in words profess that they sympathise with the miserable men who faithfully
spent their life for them, but they have for them no real concern. As, then,
great kings draw human blood, and care nothing when many perish for their sake,
the Prophet justly says, That the king of Babylon was satiated with shame on
account of glory; that is, that while he was seeking his own glory he was
satiated with the reproaches of many; for many perished on his account, many had
been robbed of their power, or were afterwards to be robbed &#8212; for the
Prophet refers not here to what had taken place, but he speaks of things future;
and the past tense of verbs was intended to express certainty; and we know that
this was a common mode of speaking with the Prophets. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh37</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>drink thou
also</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We hence see that the king of Babylon was
secure as long as he remained untouched, though his alliance and friendship had
proved ruinous to many. As long then as his kingdom flourished, the king of
Babylon cared but little for the losses of others. Hence the Prophet says
&#8212; &#8220;Thou shalt also drink; thou thinkest that others only shall be
punished, as though thou were not exposed to God&#8217;s judgement; but thou
shalt come in thy turn and drink;&#8221; &#8212; in what way? He speaks here
allegorically of the vengeance which was nigh the king of Babylon &#8212;
&#8220;Thou, also,&#8221; he says, &#8220;shalt drink and become a
reproach,&#8221; or, shalt be uncovered.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lr[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>orel</i>, means in Hebrew the foreskin; and the foreskinned, or
uncircumcised, was the name given to the profane and the base, or the
contaminated; and hence many give this rendering &#8212; &#8220;Thou also shalt
become ignominious;&#8221; but others express more clearly the Prophet&#8217;s
meaning by this version &#8212; &#8220;Thou shalt be uncovered.&#8221; Yet their
opinion is not amiss who think that there is here a change of letters, that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lr[h</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>eorel</i>,is put for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l[rh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>erol</i>; and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l[r</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rol</i>, means to be cast asleep; and it well suits a drunken man to say that
he is stupefied. But as the Prophet had spoken of nakedness, I retain the word
as it is; and thus the two clauses will correspond &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then thou shalt drink and be
uncovered</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then follows the explanation &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Poured
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh38</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
into thee shall be the cup of Jehovah&#8217;s right
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, &#8220;the Lord shall in his
time be thy cup-bearer; as thou hast inebriated many nations, and under the
pretense of friendship hast defrauded those who, being bound to thee by
treaties, have been ruined; so the Lord will now recompense thee with the reward
which thou hast deserved: As thou hast been a cup-bearer to others, so the Lord
will now become thy cup-bearer, and will inebriate thee, but after another
manner.&#8221; We indeed know what the Scripture everywhere means by the cup of
God&#8217;s hand &#8212; even vengeance of every kind. God strikes some with
giddiness and precipitates them, when deprived of all humanity, into a state of
madness; others he infatuates by insensibility; some he deprives of all
understanding, so that they perceive nothing aright; against others he rouses up
enemies, who treat them with cruelty. Hence the Lord is said to extend his cup
to the wicked whenever he takes vengeance on them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore he adds &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the reproach of spewing shall be
on thy glory</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wlqyq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kikolun</i>, is a compound. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh39</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We have
already seen that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">kwlq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kolun</i>, is shame; and now he speaks of shameful spewing. And this may be
referred to the king of Babylon &#8212; that he himself would shamefully spew
out what he had before intemperately swallowed down; or it might be fitly
applied to his enemies &#8212; that they would spew in the face of the king of
Babylon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The end of which Habakkuk speaks, awaits all tyrants,
who disturb the world by their cupidity. Ambition does indeed so infatuate them,
that they neither spare human blood, nor hesitate to endanger their nearest and
most friendly associates. Since then an insatiable thirst for glory thus
inflames them, the Prophet justly allots to them this reward &#8212; that they
shall receive filthy and shameful spewing instead of that glory, in seeking
which they observed no limits. Let us now proceed -</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">We may hence easily learn, that the Prophet has
not been speaking of drunkenness, but that his discourse, as we have explained,
was metaphorical; for here follows a reason, why he had denounced such a
punishment on the king of Babylon, and that was, because he had exercised
violence, not only against all nations indiscriminately, but also against the
chosen people of God. He had before only set forth in general the cruelty with
which the king of Babylon had destroyed many nations; but he now speaks
distinctly of the Jews, in order to show that God would in a peculiar manner be
the avenger of that cruelty which the Chaldeans had employed towards the Jews,
because the Lord had taken that people under his own protection. Since then the
king of Babylon had assailed the children of God, who had been adopted by him,
and whose defender he was, he denounces upon him here a special punishment. We
thus see that this discourse is properly addressed to the Jews; for he intended
to bring them some consolation in their extreme evils, so that they might
strengthen their patience; for they were thereby made to see that the wrongs
done to them were come to a reckoning before God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By <i>Libanus</i> then we are to understand either
Judea or the temple; for Libanus, as it is well known, was not far from the
temple; and it is elsewhere found in the same sense. But if any extends this to
the land of Judea, the meaning will be the same; there will be but little or no
difference as to the subject that is handled.

<div><font face="Palatino">Then come the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the pillaging of

and Assyrians are here called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twmhb</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>bemutt</i>, beasts, as they had been savage and cruel, like wild beasts, in
laying waste Judea; but I rather understand by the beasts of Libanus those which
inhabited that forest. The Prophet exaggerates the cruelty of the king of
Babylon by this consideration, that he had been an enemy to brute beasts; and I
consider the pronoun relative
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>asher</i>, which, to be understood before the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;tyjy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ichiten</i>, which may be taken to mean, to tear, or to frighten, Some give
this rendering, &#8220;The plundering of beasts shall tear them;&#8221; as
though he had said, &#8220;The Babylonians are indeed like savage beasts, but
they shall be torn by their own plundering:&#8221; but another sense will be
more suitable that the plundering of beasts, which terrified them, shall
overwhelm thee; for the same verb,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">sby</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>icas</i>, shall cover or overwhelm the king of Babylon, is to be repeated
here. He adds at last the clause, which was explained yesterday. We now perceive
the meaning of the Prophet to be &#8212; that the king of Babylon would be
justly plundered, because he had destroyed the holy land and iniquitously
attacked God&#8217;s chosen people, and had also carried on his depredations
through almost the whole of the Easter world.

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now advances farther, and shows that
whatever he had predicted of the future ruin of Babylon and of its monarchy,
proceeded from the true God, from the God of Israel: for it would not have been
sufficient to hold, that some deity existed in heaven, who ruled human affairs,
so that it could not be, but that tyrants would have to suffer punishment for
their cruelty. We indeed know that such sayings as these were everywhere common
among heathen nations &#8212; that justice sits with Jupiter &#8212; that there
is a Nemesis &#8212; that there is Divine vengeance. Since then such a
conviction had ever been imprinted on the hearts of men, it would have been a
frigid and almost an empty doctrine, had not the Prophet introduced the God of
Israel. This is the reason why he now derides all idols, and claims for God the
government of the whole world, and clearly shows that he speaks of the Jews,
because they worshipped no imaginary gods, as the heathen nations, but plainly
understood him to be the creator of heaven and earth, who revealed himself to
Abraham, who gave his law by the hand of Moses. We now perceive the
Prophet&#8217;s design.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As then the king of Babylon did himself worship his
own gods, the Prophet dissipates that vain confidence, by which he might be
deceived and deceive others. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What avails the graven
image?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He speaks here contemptuously of images
formed by men&#8217;s hands. And he adds a reason,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because the maker has graven
it</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says. Interpreters give a sense that is
very jejune, as though the Prophet had said, &#8220;What avails a graven image,
when it is graven or melted by its artifices?&#8221; But the Prophet shows here
the reason why the worship of idols is useless, and that is, because these gods
are made of dead materials. And then he says, &#8220;What deity can the
artifices produce?&#8221; We hence see that a reason is given in these words,
and therefore we may more clearly render them thus &#8212; &#8220;What avails
the graven image, when the framer has graven it?&#8221; that is, since the
graven image has its origin from the hand and skill of man, what can it avail?
He then adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he has formed a
molten image</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, though the artifices has
given form to the metal, or to the wood, or to the stone, yet he could not have
changed its nature. He has indeed given it a certain external appearance; but
were any one to ask what it is, the answer would surely be, &#8220;It is a
graven image.&#8221; Since then its nature is not changed by the work of man, it
evidently appears, how stupid and mad must all those be who put their trust in
graven images.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh41</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and a teacher of
falsehood</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He added this clause, because men
previously entertain false notions, and dare not to form a judgement on the
matter itself. For, how comes it that a piece of wood or a stone is called a
god? Had any one asked the sages at Rome or at Athens, or in other cities, who
thought all other nations barbarous, What is that? on seeing a Jupiter made of
silver; or of wood, or of stone, the answer would have been, &#8220;It is
Jupiter, it is God.&#8221; But how could this be? It is a stone, a piece of
wood, or of silver. They would yet have asserted that it was God. Whence came
this madness? Even from this, because men were bewitched, so that seeing they
saw not; they wilfully closed their eyes, and resolved to be blind, being
unwilling to understand. This is the reason why the Prophet, by way of
anticipation, says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the artificer
has formed &#8212; </i></font><font face="Palatino">what has he formed?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a graven image and a teacher of
falsehood</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The material remains the same, but a
false notion prevails, for men think idols to be gods. How come they to think
so? It is no doubt the teaching of falsehood, a mere illusion. He then confirms
the same thing; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
fashioner</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or the artificer, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>trusts in his own
work</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or in what he has formed. How is this?
Must they not be void of sense and reason who trust in lifeless things?
&#8220;The workman,&#8221; as Isaiah says, &#8220;will take his instruments,
will form an idol, and then he will bow the knee, and call it his god; yet it is
the work of his own hands.&#8221; What! art not thou thyself a god? thou knowest
thine own frailty, and yet thou createst new gods! Even in this manner does the
Prophet confirm what he had previously said, that men are extremely stupid, nay,
that they are seized with monstrous sottishness, when they ascribe a kind of
deity to wood, or to a stone, or to metal. How so? because they are, he says,
false imaginations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he may make dumb
idols</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He again repeats what he had said,
&#8212; that the nature of the material is not changed by men&#8217;s
workmanship, when they form to themselves gods either from wood or from stone.
How so? because they cannot speak. To the same purpose is what immediately
follows; the next verse must therefore be added. We shall afterwards say
something more on the general subject.</font><br></div>

sufficient teachers to you: ask your idols, that is, ascertain rightly what is

declares by his silence that he is no god. For there is no motion in wood and
stone. Where there is no vigor and no life, is it not right to feel assured,
that there is no deity? There are, indeed, many creatures endued with feeling
and motion; but the God who gives power, and motion, and feeling to the whole

<div><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE HUNDRED AND
FOURTEENTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE said yesterday, that the Prophet speaks now of
idols, that he might deprive the king of Babylon of his vain confidence: for
though heathens claim everything to themselves and to their own powers, yet
their superstition in some measure dementates them. Hence the Prophet shows,
that that tyrant in vain trusted in his idols, since they were things of nought.
But the reasons by which he refutes idolatry ought to be noticed: he says, that
the artifices, who formed gods, were not able to change the nature of the
material, for the wood remained wood, and stone continued to be stone, and that
the workmen and artifices in forming it did nothing more than make a molten
image. The material then remained still the same. As to the image itself, the
Prophet says, that it was mere falsehood and deception; yea, that gods made of
wood or of silver, or of any other material, were instructors and teachers of
falsehood, for they allured simple souls: and Satan spread his snares before
men, when he set before their eyes these visible figures, and persuaded them
that they contained something divine. Then this reasoning of the Prophet ought
to be carefully observed; for he reminds us, that fictitious gods are made of
lifeless and perishable materials, and that images are only the juggleries of
Satan.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That saying of Gregory is common among the Papists,
that images are the books of the ignorant; for such was his answer to Serenus,
bishop of Marseilles, who turned out images from all the churches (Lib. 9,
Epist. 9.) He said that he approved of his object, in wishing to correct the
superstition which prevailed among the people, but that he had done what was not
right in wholly taking away images, the books of the ignorant. But let us
consider whether more faith is due to Gregory, a man imbued with many errors,
(as that age was very corrupt), or to the Prophet Habakkuk, and also to
Jeremiah, who announces nearly the same sentiment. Though, then, there is some
speciousness in idols, yet the Prophet here reminds us that they are nothing but
the impostures of Satan; for they teach falsehood. The reason also that is given
is deserving of notice &#8212; that the workmen put their hope in what they
themselves have formed. And it is indeed a thing most preposterous, that a
mortal man should form his own god, and then imagine that something divine is
enclosed in the very form, for deity is not in the material. The material is
disregarded when unformed; but not so when it attains a beautiful shape. While
the tree grows, while it produces flowers and fruit, it is deemed, as it really
is, a dead thing; but when a piece of it is formed in the figure of a man, it is
believed to be a god! But it is extremely absurd to suppose that the hand of the
artifices gives deity to a dead material; for the wood is dead, and nothing is
perceived but the shape given to it by man. Since, then, the artifices trusts in
what he has formed, it is what seems beyond anything strange. It is hence quite
evident, that men are wholly demented by the devil, when they worship their own
workmanship.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But now, in order to press the matter more fully on
idolaters, the Prophet upbraids them for calling on the wood and on the stone to
awake. It is certain, that when idolaters bow the knee before what they have
themselves formed, they still imagine that there are celestial gods; but when
before a figure of wood or stone they call upon God, it is the same thing as
though they expected help from the wood and stone; for the question is not here
what idolaters imagine, but the thing itself is to be regarded; and this is what
the Prophet most fully and plainly condemns. Since, then, the superstitious are
wont to address their prayers to wood and stone, he says, that they make to
themselves gods, to whom they sacrifice. And the Prophet rightly refers in
express terms to this kind of service; for the chief sacrifice which God bids to
be offered to him, and demands from us, is to call on him; for we thus testify
that life and all things belonging to salvation are found alone in him. Since,
then, the majesty of God appears especially from having this testimony borne to
him, that he is the fountain of life and of all blessings, every one who
prostrates himself before a stone or wood, and implores the aid of a visible
god, transfers, no doubt, the glory of the eternal God to a dead piece of wood
or to a stone. If, then, we wish to be free from every superstition, let us
remember this truth, that then only we have the only true God, when we direct
our prayers and supplications to him alone, or, in a word, when we call on him
alone. When we have recourse to dead idols, God is deprived of his own right. We
may call him God a hundred times, but we give him an empty title, and one of no
value, except we pray to him alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, in the last place, derides the madness
of men, by saying that the very idols teach: for, as it was said yesterday, the
clause is not to be read as a question, as some do; but in order more sharply to
reprove the stupidity of men, the Prophet says, &#8220;Doubtless the very
figures themselves, except ye are wholly senseless, will teach you.&#8221; He
had before said, it is true, that they were the teachers of falsehood and
vanity; but he speaks now of another kind of teaching, that if men wisely
attended to the thing itself, they might soon learn from a mere view of their
gods, that they were most palpably the deceits of Satan; for if any one looked
on the idols with a clear eye, he would see that they were a dead material, and
would see that great wrong is done to God by transforming him into a likeness of
what is dead.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand the Prophet&#8217;s meaning, when
he says, That idols themselves are sufficient, and more than sufficient
teachers, when men are teachable, and lend an attentive ear. He means not, as it
was said yesterday, that idols teach fallaciously to the destruction of men,
while something divine is ascribed to them; but he says that they teach, if any
one of a sane mind, and free from error, comes to view the idol, and forms a
judgement of the thing itself. But superstition occupies the minds of men; and
hence it is that all become the scholars of Satan, and no one applies his mind
to understand the doctrine he mentions here. In short, idols teach naturally,
and they teach through the artifice and delusion of Satan. They teach naturally;
for by their silence they show that they are not gods, inasmuch as there is no
strength in them. They teach, also, by the artifice of the devil; for they are
made to claim a kind of divinity, and thus dazzle the minds of men, who are
already corrupted by their own delusions. To the first teaching, of which the
Prophet now speaks, none apply their minds; for almost all renounce nature
wholly: this only lays hold on them &#8212; that idols are gods; for they make
an image of the heavenly and eternal God, from whom we are at a great distance,
and who does not otherwise descend to us, except through visible
representations!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The same truth the Prophet confirms when he says,
that though these gods are covered over with gold and silver,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there is no breath in
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or in the midst of them. In short, he
means that they are mere masks; for no divinity can be without life. As then
idols are dead things, it follows that they are the most palpable impostures of
Satan, by which he fascinates the minds of men, when they thus devote themselves
to dead things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, whatever is here said against idols, most
certainly applies to the superstitions of popery. They deny that they give
divine honors to their idols; but let us consider what the Prophet says. They
indeed sacrifice to gold and silver, and then bend their knees before their
images, and do not think that God is near them, except in these figures. Let
them show, then, that the Prophet reasons here foolishly, or let them be held
guilty according to the declaration, as it were, of the Holy Spirit, when they
thus present their prayers before idols. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">After having taught us that the Babylonians were
deceived in expecting any help from their idols, and were deluded by Satan,
Habakkuk now recalls the attention of the faithful to the only true God; for it
would not have been enough to take away from the Babylonians the false
confidence which they had in their idols, except the Israelites, on the other
hand, trusting in the grace of the true God, were fully persuaded that God was
on their side, as he had taken them under his protection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And we ought carefully to observe this order; for we
see that many boldly deride all the superstitions which prevail in the world,
and at the same time daringly and with cyclopic fury despise the true God. How
many are at this day either Epicureans or Lucianians, who prate jestingly and
scoffingly against the superstitions of the papacy, but in the meantime they are
not influenced by any fear of God? If, however, we are to choose one of two
evils, superstition is more tolerable than that gross impiety which obliterates
every thought of a God. It is indeed true, that the more the superstitious toil
in their delusions, the more they provoke God&#8217;s wrath against them; for
they transfer his glory to dead things; but yet they retain this principle
&#8212; that honor and worship are due to God: but the profane, in whom there is
no religion whatever, not only change God from what he is, but also strive as
far as they can to reduce him to nothing. Hence I have said, that the order
which the Prophet observes here ought to be maintained. For, after having
overturned the false illusions of the devil, by which he deludes the
superstitious, by setting before them a mere shadow in the place of the true
God, he now sets up the true worship of the only true God. Then the Prophet has
hitherto been endeavoring to subvert superstitions, but he now builds up: for
except God, when idols are pulled down, ascends his own tribunal, and shines
there as supreme according to his right, it would be better, at least it would
be more tolerable, as I have said, that superstitions should be left
entire.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now says that God is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in his own temple
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or palace: this word is often taken for heaven,
but is applied to the sanctuary. Many consider that the reference is made to
heaven; as though the Prophet had said, that the true God, who is the artificer
and creator of heaven and earth, is not to be seen in a visible form, nor
covered over with gold and silver, nor represented by wood or stone; but that he
rules in heaven, and fills heaven with his infinite glory and this view is by no
means unsuitable. But as he here specially addresses the Jews, it seems to me
more probable that he speaks of the temple, where God then designed to be
worshipped, and sacrifices to be offered to him for it would not have been
sufficient to set God, the creator of heaven and earth, in opposition to the
superstitions of all the nations; but it was also necessary to introduce the
contrast between the God of Israel and all those gods who then had obtained a
name and reputation in the world, as they had been formed by the will of men.
The God of Israel was indeed the creator of heaven and earth; but he had made
himself known by his law, he had revealed himself to men, so that his majesty
was not hidden; for when we speak of God, we are lost except he comes to us, and
in a manner exhibits himself to us; for the capacity of our understanding is not
so great that it can penetrate above all heavens. Hence the majesty of God is in
itself incomprehensible to us; but he makes himself known by his works and by
his word. Now as the Israelites worshipped, and surely knew that they worshipped
the only true God, the Prophet here rightly confirms them in the hope they
derived from the teaching of the law &#8212; that God was their Father, inasmuch
as he had adopted them. If any prefer to take the word for heaven, I do not
object; and that meaning, as I have said, is not unsuitable. But as the Prophet
seems to me to have a special vies to his own people, to whom he was appointed a
teacher; it is more probable that the word, temple or palace, is here to be
understood of the sanctuary.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If any raises the objection that there is then no
difference between the God of Israel and the gods of the Gentiles, for he also
dwells in an earthly habitation, the answer is obviously this &#8212; that
though God is said to dwell between the cherubim, he has not been represented by
an image, as though he had anything like to wood or stone, or possessed any
likeness to human bodies. All these delusions were banished from the Temple; for
he commanded his worshipers to look up to heaven. There was an intervening veil,
that the people might understand that they could not otherwise come to God than
through that celestial model, the and types of which they saw in the altar of
incense, in the altar on which they sacrificed, in the table of the shewbread,
in short, in all other services of the Temple. And there is another difference
to be noticed; for though there was there the golden altar, though there was
there the ark of the covenant, and the altar on which the victims were
immolated, yet inscribed on all these typical representations was the word of
God, by which alone true religion was to be distinguished from all false
inventions. For whatever specious appearance of reason may therefore be in
fictitious modes of worship, men have no authority to render them lawful; but so
much reverence is due to the only true word of God, that it ought to overrule
all other reasons. And besides, this word, as I have hinted already, did not
retain the Jews in these delusions, but elevated their minds to heaven. We now
then see that there was a wide difference between the Temple which was at
Jerusalem, and the temples which the superstitious had then built for themselves
throughout the world; for God ruled over the Jews, so that they could not have
been deluded. And at this day, where the word of God shines among us, we can
follow it with safety. And, further, God did spiritually draw to himself his own
servants, though he employed, on account of their ignorance, certain outward
elements. Hence the Prophet justly says, that God was in his palace or his
Temple; for the Israelites knew of a certainty that they did not worship a
fictitious God, since in his law he had revealed himself to them, and had chosen
the sanctuary, where he intended to be worshipped in a typical, and yet in a
spiritual manner.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let all the earth be silent
before him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Habakkuk, no doubt, commends the
power of God, that the Israelites might proceed with alacrity in their religious
course, knowing it to be a sufficient security to be under the protection of the
only true God, and that they might not seek after the superstitions of the
nations, nor be carried here and there, as it often happens, by vain desires.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Keep
silence</i></font><font face="Palatino">, then, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>let all the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He shows that though the Israelites
might be far inferior to the Babylonians and other nations, and be far unequal
to them in strength, military art, forces, and, in short, in all things of this
kind, yet they would be always safe under the guardianship of God; for the Lord
was able to control whatever power there might be in the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see what the Prophet had in view: for he does
not here simply exhort all people to worship God, but shows, that thought men
may grow mad against him, he yet can easily by his hand subjugate them; for
after all the tumults made by kings and their people, the Lord can, by one
breath of his mouth, dissipate all their attempts, however furious they may be.
This, then, is the silence of which the Prophet now speaks. But there is another
kind of silence, and that is, when we willingly submit to God; for silence in
this respect is nothing else but submission: and we submit to God, when we bring
not our own inventions and imaginations, but suffer ourselves to be taught by
his word. We also submit to him, when we murmur not against his power or his
judgements, when we humble ourselves under his powerful hand, and do not
fiercely resist him, as those do who indulge their own lusts. This is indeed, as
I have said, a voluntary submission: but the Prophet here shows that there is
power in God to lay prostrate the whole world, and to tread it under his feet,
whenever it may please him; so that the faithful have nothing to fear, for they
know that their salvation is secured; for though the whole world were leagued
against them, it yet cannot resist God. Now follows a prayer:

<div><br><font face="Palatino">THERE is no doubt but that the Prophet dictated
this form of prayer for his people, before they were led into exile, that they
might always exercise themselves in the study of religion. We indeed know that
God cannot be rightly and from the heart worshipped but in faith. Hence, in
order to confine the dispersed Israelites within due limits, so that they might
not fall away from true religion, the Prophet here sets before them the
materials of faith, and stimulates them to prayer: and we know, that our faith
cannot be supported in a better way than by the exercise of
prayer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then bear in mind, that the way of fostering
true religion, prescribed here to the miserable Israelites while dispersed in
their exile, was to look up to God daily, that they might strengthen their
faith; for they could not have otherwise continued in their obedience to God.
They would, indeed, have wholly fallen away into the superstitions of the
Gentiles, had not the memory of the covenant, which the Lord had made with them,
remained firm in their hearts: and we shall presently see that the Prophet lays
much stress upon this circumstance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls it his own prayer, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh43</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> not
because he used it himself privately, or composed it for himself, but that the
prayer might have some authority among the people; for they knew that a form of
prayer dictated for them by the mouth of a Prophet, was the same as though the
Spirit itself was to show them how they were to pray to God. The name, then, of
Habakkuk is added to it, not because he used it himself, but that the people
might be more encouraged to pray, when they knew that the Holy Spirit, through
the Prophet, had become their guide and teacher.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is some difficulty connected with the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twnyg&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sheginut</i>. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">gg&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shegag</i>, or
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hg&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shege</i>, means, to act inconsiderately; and from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hg&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shege</i>, is derived
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wyg&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shegiun</i>. Many render it, ignorance; some, delight. Some think it to be
the beginning of a song; others suppose it to be a common melody; and others, a
musical instrument. Thus interpreters differ. In the seventh Psalm David, no
doubt, calls either a song or some musical instrument by the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wyg&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shegiun</i>. Yet some think that David bears testimony there to his own
innocency; and that, as he was not conscious of having done wrong, his own
innocency is alone signified by the title: but this is a strained view. The word
is taken in this place, almost by common consent, for ignorances: and we know
that the Hebrews denominate by ignorances all errors or falls which are not
grievous, and such things as happen through inadvertence; and by this word they
do not extenuate their faults, but acknowledge themselves to be inconsiderate
when they offend. Then
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wyg&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shegiun</i>, is no excusable ignorance, which men lay hold on as a pretext;
but an error of folly and presumptions, when men are not sufficiently attentive
to the word of God. But perhaps the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twnyg&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sheginut</i>, being here in the plural number, ought to be taken for musical
instruments. Yet as I would not willingly depart from a received opinion, and as
there is no necessity in this case to constrain us to depart from it, let us
follows what had been already said, &#8212; that the Prophet dictates here for
his people a form of prayer for ignorances, that is, that they could not
otherwise hope for God&#8217;s forgiveness than by seeking his favor. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh44</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And how
can we be reconciled to God, except by his not imputing to us our
sins?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet, by asking for the pardons of
ignorances, does not omit more grievous sins; but intimates that though their
conscience does not reprove men, they are yet not on that account innocent and
without guilt; for they often inconsiderately fall, and their faults are not to
be excused for inadvertence. It is, then, the same thing as though the Prophet
reminded his own people, that there was no remedy for them in adversity but by
fleeing to God, and fleeing as suppliants, in order to solicit his forgiveness;
and that they were not only to acknowledge their more grievous sins, but also to
confess that they were in many respects guilty; for they might have fallen
through error a thousand times, as we are inconsiderate almost through the whole
course of our life. We now, then, perceive what this word means, and why the
Prophet spoke rather of ignorances than of other sins. But I shall not proceed
farther now, as there is some other
business.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet says here, in the name of the whole
people, that he was terrified by the voice of God, for so I understand the word,
though in many places it means report, as some also explain it in this place.
But as the preaching of the Gospel is called in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
53:1,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h[m&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shemoe</i>, report, it seems to me more suitable to the present passage to
render it the voice of God; for the general sentiment, that the faithful were
terrified at the report of God, would be frigid. It ought rather to be applied
to the Prophecies which have been already explained: and doubtless Habakkuk did
not intend here to speak only in general of God&#8217;s power; but, as we have
seen in the last lecture, he humbly confesses the sins of the people, and then
prays for forgiveness. It is then not to be doubted but that he says here, that
he was terrified by the voice of God, that is, when he heard him threatening
punishment so grievous. He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Revive thy work in the middle of
the years, and make it known</i></font><font face="Palatino">. At last, by way
of anticipation, he subjoins, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God would remember his
mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino">, though justly offended by the sins of
the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But by saying, that he feared the voice of God, he
makes a confession, or gives an evidence of repentance; for we cannot from the
heart seek pardon, unless we be first made humble. When a sinner is not
displeased with himself, and confesses not his guilt, he is not deserving of
mercy. We then see why the Prophet speaks here of fear; and that is, that he
might thus obtain for himself and for others the favor of God; for as soon as a
sinner willingly condemns himself, and does not do this formally, but seriously
from the heart, he is already reconciled to God; for God bids us in this way to
anticipate his judgement. This is one thing. But if it be asked, for what
purpose the Prophet heard God&#8217;s voice; the obvious answer is, &#8212; that
as it is not the private prayer of one person, but of the whole Church, he
prescribes here to the faithful the way by which they were to obtain favor from
God, and turn him to mercy; and that is, by dreading his threatening and by
acknowledging that whatever God threatened by his Prophets was near at
hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then follows the second clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah! in the middle of the
years revive thy work</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By the work of God he
means the condition of his people or of the Church. For though God is the
creator of heaven and earth, he would yet have his own Church to be acknowledged
to be, as it were, his peculiar workmanship, and a special monument of his
power, wisdom, justice, and goodness. Hence, by way of eminence, he calls here
the condition of the elect people the work of God; for the seed of Abraham was
not only a part of the human race, but was the holy and peculiar possession of
God. Since, then, the Israelites were set apart by the Lord, they are rightly
called his work; as we read in another place,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The work of thine
hands thou wilt not
despise,&#8221;</font><br><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
138:8.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And God often says, &#8220;This is my
planting,&#8221; &#8220;This is the work of my hands,&#8221; when he speaks of
his Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
middle of the years</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he means the middle
course, as it were, of the people&#8217;s life. For from the time when God chose
the race of Abraham to the coming of Christ, was the whole course, as it were,
of their life, when we compare the people to a man; for the fullness of their
age was at the coming of Christ. If, then, that people had been destroyed, it
would have been the same as though death were to snatch away a person in the
flower of his age. Hence the Prophet prays God not to take away the life of his
people in the middle of their course; for Christ having not come, the people had
not attained maturity, nor arrived at manhood.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the
middle</i></font><font face="Palatino">, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the years thy work
revive</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, &#8220;Though we seem destined
to death, yet restore us.&#8221;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Make it
known</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says, in the middle of the years;
that is, &#8220;Show it to be in reality thy work.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh46</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now apprehend the real meaning of the Prophet.
After having confessed that the Israelites justly trembled at Cod&#8217;s voice,
as they saw themselves deservedly given up to perdition, he then appeals to the
mercy of God, and prays God to revive his own work. He brings forward here
nothing but the favor of adoption: thus he confesses that there was no reason
why God should forgive his people, except that he had been pleased freely to
adopt them, and to choose them as his peculiar people; for on this account it is
that God is wont to show his favor towards us even to the last. as, then, this
people had been once chosen by God, the Prophet records this adoptions, and
prays God to continue and fulfill to the end what he had begun. With regard to
the half course of life, the comparison ought to be observed; for we see that
the race of Abraham was not chosen for a short time, but until Christ the
Redeemer was manifested. Now we have this in common with the ancient people,
that God adopts us, that he may at length bring us into the inheritance of
eternal life. Until, then, the work of our salvation is completed, we are, as it
were, running our course. We may therefore adopt this form of prayer, which is
prescribed for us by the Holy Spirit, &#8212; that God would not forsake his ohm
work; in the middle of our course.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What he now subjoins &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in wrath remember
mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino">, is intended to anticipate an objection;
for this thought might have occurred to the faithful &#8212; &#8220;there is no
ground for us to hope pardon from God, whom we have so grievously provoked, nor
is there any reason for us to rely any more on the covenant which we have so
perfidiously violated.&#8221; The Prophet meets this objection, and he flees to
the gracious favor of God, however much he perceived that the people would have
to suffer the just punishment of their sins, such as they deserved. He then
confesses that God was justly angry with his people, and yet that the hope of
salvation was not on that account closed up, for the Lord had promised to be
propitious. Since God then is not inexorable towards his people &#8212; nay,
while he chastises them he ceases not to be a father; hence the Prophet connects
here the mercy of God with his wrath.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have elsewhere said that the word wrath is not to
be taken according to its strict sense, when the faithful or the elect are
spoken of; for God does not chastise them because he hates them; nay, on the
contrary, he thereby manifests the care he has for their salvations. Hence the
scourges by which God chastises his children are testimonies of his love. But
the Scripture represents the judgement with which God visits his people as
wrath, not towards their persons but towards their sins. Though then God shows
love to his chosen, yet he testifies when he punishes their sins that iniquity
is hated by him. When God then comes forth as it were as a judge, and shows that
sins displease him, he is said to be angry with the faithful; and there is also
in this a reference to the perceptions of men; for we cannot, when God chastises
us, do otherwise than feel the accusations of our own conscience. Hence then is
this hatred; for when our conscience condemns us we must necessarily acknowledge
God to be angry with us, that is with respect to us. When therefore we provoke
God&#8217;s wrath by our sins we feel him to be angry with us; but yet the
Prophet collects together things which seem wholly contrary &#8212; even that
God </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>would remember mercy in
wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, that he would show himself
displeased with them in such a way as to afford to the faithful at the same time
some taste of his favor and mercy by finding him to be propitious to
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive how the Prophet had joined the
last clause to the foregoing. Whenever, then, the judgement of the flesh would
lead us to despair, let us ever set up against it this truth &#8212; that God is
in such a way angry that he never forgets his mercy &#8212; that is, in his
dealings with his elect. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

</table></div>
<div><br><font face="Palatino">This verse interpreters explain in two ways. Some
construe the verb in the future tense in the past time &#8212; &#8220;God went
forth from Teman, and the holy one from mount Paran&#8221;; for a verb in the
past tense follows. But others consider it to be in the optative mood &#8212;
&#8220;May God come, or go forth, from Teman, and the holy one from mount
Paran;&#8221; as though the Prophet prayed God to come as the defender of his
people from mount Sinai, where the law was promulgated and the covenant
ratified, which God had formerly made with Abraham and his posterity. I rather
subscribe to their opinion who think that the manifestation of God, by which he
had testified that he was the guardian of that people, is repeated by the
Prophet. As, then, God had so made known his glory on mount Sinai, that it was
evident that that nation was under his protection, so the Prophet, with the view
of strengthening himself and others, records what was well known among the whole
people &#8212; that is, that the law was given on mount Sinai, which was a
testimony of singular favor; for God then by a new pledge testified, that the
covenant formerly made with Abraham was firm and inviolable. The reason why
Habakkuk does not mention mount Sinai, but Teman and Paran, seems to some to be
this &#8212; because these mountains were nearer the Holy Land, though this
view, I fear, will appear too refined; I therefore take this simple view &#8212;
that instead of mentioning mount Sinai, he paraphrastically designates it by
mount Paran and the desert of Teman. Some suppose these to be two mountains; but
I know not whether Teman ought to be understood only as a mountain; it seems on
the contrary to have been some large tract of country. It was a common thing
among the Jews to add this name when they spoke of the south, as many nations
were wont to give to winds the names of some neighboring places; so when the
Jews wished to designate a wind from Africa, they called it Teman. &#8220;It is
a Teman wind;&#8221; and so when they spoke of the south, they said
Teman.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">However this may be, it is certain that the desert of
Teman was nigh to Sinai, and also that mount Paran was connected with that
desert. As then they were places towards the south, and nigh to mount Sinai,
where the law had been proclaimed, the Prophet records here, in order to
strengthen the faith of the whole people, that God had not in vain gone forth
once from Teman, and there appeared in his celestial power; for God then openly
showed, that he took under his guardianship the children of Abraham, and that
the covenant which he had formerly made with him was not vain or of no effect.
Since, then, God had testified this in so remarkable and wonderful a manner, the
Prophet brings forward here that history which tended especially to confirm the
faith of the godly &#8212; God went forth once from Teman, and the holy one from
mount Paran.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For it was not God&#8217;s will that the memory of
that manifestation should be obliterated; but he had once appeared with glory so
magnificent, that the people might feel assured that they would ever be safe,
for they were protected by God&#8217;s hand, and that full of power, as the
fathers had once known by manifest and visible evidences; and hence the Prophet
represents God&#8217;s going forth from mount Paran as a continued act, as
though he rendered himself visible chiefly from that place. Nor is this
representation new; for we see, in many other places, a living picture, as it
were, set before the eyes of the faithful, in order to strengthen them in their
adversity, and to make them assured that they shall be safe through God&#8217;s
presence. The Lord, indeed, did not daily fulminate from heaven, nor were there
such visible indications of his presence as on mount Sinai; but it behaved the
people to feel assured that he was the same God who had given to their fathers
such clear evidence of his power, and that he is also at this time, and to the

observe, that the minds of the godly were recalled to the spectacle on mount
Sinai, when they were drawn away into exile, or when they were in the power of
their enemies. They might indeed have then supposed, that they were wholly
forsaken. Obliterated then must have been the memory of that history, had not
this remedy been introduced. It is, therefore, the same as though the Prophet
had said &#8212; &#8220;Though God now hides his power, and gives no evidence of
his favor, yet think not that he formerly appeared in vain to your fathers as
one clothed with so great a power, when the law was proclaimed on mount Sinai.

the Prophet ascribes horns to God, carried in both hands; and it more
corresponds with what immediately follows, that &#8220;there was the hiding of
his strength,&#8221; or that &#8220;there was his power hidden.&#8221; They who
render the word, splendours, think that what had been said is repeated, that is,
that the brightness was like light; but they are mistaken, for we may collect
from the verse that two different things are expressed by the Prophet: he first
speaks of the visible form of God; and then he adds his power, designating it
metaphorically by horns, which is common in Scripture. Indeed this mode of
speaking occurs often. He then says, that God came armed with power, when he
gave the law to his people; for he bore horns in his hands, where his strength
was hid.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh48</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hiding</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
some indeed give this refined view, that God then put forth his strength, which
was before hidden. But this is a very strained explanation. To me it seems
evident, that the Prophet in the first place says, that God&#8217;s glory was
conspicuous, capable of irradiating the whole world like the light of the sun;
and he then adds, that this splendor was connected with power, for God carried
horns in both his hands, where his strength was laid: and he says, that it was
hid, because God did not intend to make known his power indiscriminately
throughout the world, but peculiarly to his own people; as it is also said in

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet repeats here, that God came armed to
defend his people, when he went forth from Teman; for he connects with it here
the deliverance of the people. He does not indeed speak only of the promulgation
of the law, but encourages all the godly to confidence; for God, who had once
redeemed their fathers from Egypt, remained ever like himself, and was endued
with the same power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says, that

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh49</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The import of the whole is &#8212; that God had put
to flight all the enemies of his people; for we know that the Egyptians were
smitten with various plagues, and that the army of Pharaoh was drowned in the
Red Sea. Hence, the Prophet says, that God had so appeared from Teman, that the
pestilence went before him, and then the ignited coal; in short, that the
pestilence and ignited coal were God&#8217;s officers, which were ready to
perform his commands: as when a king or a judge, having attendants, commands
them to put this man in prison, and to punish another in a different way; so the
Prophet, giving us a representation of God, says, that all kinds of evils were
ready to obey his orders, and to destroy his and their enemies. He does not then
intend here to terrify the faithful in mentioning the pestilence and the ignited
coal; but, on the contrary, to set before their eyes evidences of God&#8217;s
power, by which he could deliver them from the hand of their enemies, as he had
formerly delivered their fathers from Egypt. By God&#8217;s feet, he then means
his going forth or his presence; for I do not approve of what some have said,
that ignited coals followed, when pestilence had preceded; for both clauses are
given in the same way. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">He says that God possessed every power to subdue
the earth to himself, and that he could at his will destroy it, yea, dissolve
mountains as veil as nations. Some of the Jews understood this of the ark, which
stood at that time in Gilead. They then suppose that the Prophet meant this in
short &#8212; that when God chose a place for the ark of the covenant in Gilgal,
that he determined then what he would do, and that he then in his secret counsel
divided the land, so that each should have his portion by lot. This, it is true,
was accomplished shortly after, for Joshua, as we know, divided it by lot
between the tribes. But what the Jews affirm of the ark seems to me strained and
frigid. Habakkuk, on the contrary, means by the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stand</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
that God was openly conspicuous, like him who assumes an erect posture, so that
he is seen at a distance. In this sense we are to take the expression that God
stood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The measuring, of the earth is not to be confined to
Judea, but is to be extended to the whole world. God, he says, has
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>measured the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. To measure the earth is what properly
belongs to a sovereign king; and it is done that he may assign to each his
portion. Except God, then, had a sovereign right over the earth and the whole
world, Habakkuk would not have ascribed to him this office; and this we learn
from the verse itself, for he immediately subjoins, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nations, as it were, melted away,
that the mountains were destroyed, that the hills were bowed
down</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that by earth we are not to understand
Judea only, but the whole world; as though he had said, that when God appeared
on mount Sinai, he made it fully evident that the earth was under his power and
authority, so that he could determine whatever he pleased, and prescribe limits
to all nations. For he does not speak of God here as having, like a surveyor, a
measuring line; but he says, that he measured the earth as one capable even then
of changing the boundaries of the whole world; nay, he intimates that it was he
himself who had at first created the earth and assigned it to men. It is indeed
true that the nations did not then melt away, nor were the mountains demolished,
nor the hills bowed down; but the Prophet simply means, that God&#8217;s power
then appeared, which was capable of shaking the whole world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he calls these
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the mountains of eternity and the
hills ages</i></font><font face="Palatino">, which had been from the beginning
fixed on their own foundations. For if an earthquake happens on a plain, it
seems less wonderful; and then if any of those mountains cleave, which are not
so firmly fixed, it may be on account of some hollow places; for when the winds
fill the caverns, they are forced to burst, and they cleave the mountains and
the earth. But the Prophet relates an unusual thing, and wholly different from
the ordinary course of nature &#8212; that the mountains of eternity, which had
been from the beginning, and had remained without any change, were thus
demolished and bowed down. In short, the Prophet intended by all means to raise
up to confidence the minds of the godly, so that they should become fully
persuaded that God&#8217;s power to deliver them would be the same as that which
their fathers had formerly experienced; for there is no other support under
adverse, and especially under despairing circumstances, than that the faithful
should know that they are still under the protection of that God who has adopted
them. This is the reason why the Prophet amplifies, in so striking a manner, on
the subject of God&#8217;s power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And hence also he subjoins, that the ways of ages are
those of God. Some render the clause, &#8220;the ways of the world.&#8221; The
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;lw[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>oulam</i>, however, means properly an age, or perpetual time. The Prophet, I
have no doubt, means by ways of ages, the wonderful means which God is wont to
adopt for the defense of his Church; for we are ever wont to reduce God&#8217;s
wonder to our own understanding, while it is his purpose to perfect, in a manner
that is wonderful, the work of our salvation. Hence the Prophet bids the
faithful here to raise upwards their thoughts, and to conceive something greater
of God&#8217;s power than what they can naturally comprehend. If we take the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ways of
eternity</i></font><font face="Palatino">, in this sense, then they are to be
understood as in opposition to those means which are known and usual. They are
his daily ways, when the sun rises and sets, when the spring succeeds the
winter, when the earth produces fruit; though even these are so many miracles,
yet they are his common ways. But God has ways of eternity that is he has means
unknown to us by which he can deliver us from death, whenever it may please
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But yet, if any prefer taking the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ways of eternity
</i></font><font face="Palatino">as signifying the continued power of God, which
has ever appeared from the beginning, the sense would be appropriate and not
less useful: for it especially avails to confirm our faith, when we consider
that God&#8217;s power has ever been the same from the creation of heaven and
earth, that it has never been lessened or undergone any change. Since, then, God
has successively manifested his power through all ages, we ought hence to learn
that we have no reason to despair, though he may for a time conceal his hand;
for he is not on that account deprived of his right. He ever retains the
sovereignty of the world. We ought, then, to be attentive to the ways of ages,
that is, to the demonstration of that power, which was manifested in the
creation of the world, and still continues to be manifested.

might bring comfort to the miserable Jews, as they thought themselves rejected

deliverances, which were clear evidences of God&#8217;s constant favor towards
his chosen people. He had hitherto spoken of their redemption, and he will
presently return to the same subject: but he introduces here other histories; as
though he had said, that it was not only at one time that God had testified how
much he loved the race of Abraham, and how inviolable was the covenant he had
made; but that he had given the same testimonies at various times: for as he had
also defended his people against other enemies, the conclusion was obvious, that
God&#8217;s hand was thus made manifest, that the children of Abraham might know
that they were not deceived, when they were adopted by him.</font><br></div>

tremble under thine awful judgement, may we yet never cease to entertain firm
hope, since thou hast once promised to be to us an eternal Father in thine
eternal and only-begotten Son, but being confirmed by the invincible constancy

<div><font face="Palatino">WE said yesterday that the Prophet spoke of the king

and to set before their eyes the continued aid of God, so that they might
venture to feel assured that he would not act otherwise towards the Church to
the end of the world, then what he had done from the beginning. The meaning,
then, is sufficiently evident. We must now consider the words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some understand by the word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wa</font><font face="Palatino">,

of Cushan had been reduced to nothing: but another sense is more probable;

on account of his iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino">; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh51</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
is, the reward which God had repaid, for the iniquity of the king of Cushan had
been made manifest. The Prophet says that he had seen it, because it was evident
and known to all. We now perceive what is meant that God had been a just judge
against the army of Cushan; for as they had unjustly assailed the Israelites, so
a just reward was rendered to them. The account of this we have in Judges 3.
Chusan, the king of Mesopotamia, had well-nigh destroyed the Israelites, when
the Lord put him to flight with all his forces. Some render the words,
&#8220;The tents of Ethiopia,&#8221; as though it was written thus; but this is
strained, and contrary to the rules of grammar; and besides, the following
clause confirms what I have said; for the Prophet mentions the slaughter with
which God destroyed the Midianites, who had also nearly overwhelmed the
miserable people. He says that their curtains trembled, or their dwellings: for
God, without the hand or sword of men, drove them into such madness, that they
slew one another, as the sacred history testifies. See

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here applies the histories to which
he has already referred, for the purpose of strengthening the hope of the
faithful; so that they might know these to be so many proofs and pledges of
God&#8217;s favor towards them, and that they might thus cheerfully look for his
aid, and not succumb to temptation in their adversities. When he asks, was God
angry with the rivers and the sea, he no doubt intended in this way to awaken
the thoughts of the faithful, that they might consider the design of God in the
works which he had already mentioned; for it would have been unreasonable that
God should show his wrath against rivers and the sea; why should he be angry
with lifeless elements? The Prophet then shows that God had another end in view
when he dried the sea, when he stopped the course of Jordan, and when he gave
other evidences of his power. Doubtless God did not regard the sea and the
rivers; for that would have been unreasonable. It then follows that these
changes were testimonies of God&#8217;s favor towards his Church: and hence the
Prophet subjoins, that God </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rode
on his horses</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and that his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>chariots were for salvation

at least have not explained.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, see why the Prophet puts these
questions: and a question has much more force when it refers to what is in no
way doubtful. What! can God be angry with rivers? Who can imagine God to be so
unreasonable as to disturb the sea and to change the nature of things, when a
certain order has been established by his own command? Why should he dry the
sea, except he had something in view, even the deliverance of his Church? except
he intended to save his people from extreme danger, by stretching forth his hand
to the Israelites, when they thought themselves utterly lost? He therefore
denies, that when God dried the Red Sea, and when he stopped the flowing of
Jordan, he had put forth his power against the sea or against the river, as
though he was angry with them. The design of God, says the Prophet, was quite
another; for God </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rode on his
horses</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, he intended to show that all
the elements were under his command, and that for the salvation of his people.
That God, then, might be the redeemer of his Church, he constrained Jordan to
turn back its course, he constrained the Red Sea to make a passage for his
miserable captives, who would have otherwise been exposed to the slaughter of
their enemies. There was indeed no hope of saving Israel, without a passage
being suddenly opened to them through the Red Sea.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence all these miracles were designed to show that
God had become the redeemer of his Church, and had put forth his power for the
salvation of those whom he had taken under his protection: and it is easy from
this fact to conclude, that the same help ought to be expected from God by
posterity; for God was not induced by some sudden impulse to change the nature
of things, but exhibited a proof of his favor: and his grace is perpetual, and
flows in an even course, though not according to the apprehension of men; for it
suffers some interruptions, because God exercises the faithful under the cross;
yet his goodness never ceases. It hence follows that the faithful are to
entertain hope; for God, when he pleases, and when he sees it expedient, will
really show the same power which was formerly exhibited to the fathers. It now

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet explains the same thing more clearly
in this verse &#8212; that the power of God was formerly manifested for no other
reason but that the children of Abraham might be taught to expect from him a
continued deliverance: for he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the bow
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was made
bare</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By the bow, he means also the sword and
other weapons; as though he had said, that God was then armed, as we have found
declared before. God therefore was then furnished with weapons, and marched to
the battle, having undertaken the cause of his chosen people, that he might
defend them against the wicked. Since it was so, we hence see that these
miracles were not to avail only for one period, but were intended perpetually to
encourage the faithful to look ever for the aid of God, even in the midst of
death; for he can find escapes, though they may not appear to
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see the import of the text; but he
emphatically adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The oaths of
the tribes</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for hereby he more fully confirms
that God had not then assisted the children of Abraham, so as to discard them
afterwards; but that he had really proved how true he was in his promises; for
by the oaths of (or to) the tribes he means the covenant that God had made not
only with Abraham, but also with his posterity for ever. He puts oaths in the
plural number, because God had not only once promised to be a God to Abraham and
to his seed, but had often repeated the same promise, in order that faith might
be rendered more certain, inasmuch as we have need of more than one thing to
confirm us. For we see how our infirmity always vacillates, unless God supplies
us with many props. As, then, God had often confirmed his servant Abraham, the
Prophet speaks here of his oaths: but then as to the substance, the oath of God
is the same; which was, that he had taken the race of Abraham under his
protection, and promised that they should be to him a peculiar people, and,
especially, that he had united the people under one head; for except Christ had
been introduced, that covenant of God would not have been ratified nor valid.
As, then, God had once included every thing when he said to Abraham, &#8220;I am
God Almighty, and I shall be a God to you and to your children;&#8221; it is
certain that nothing was added when God afterwards confirmed the faith of
Abraham: but yet the Prophet does not without reason use the plural number; it
was done, that the faithful might recomb with less fear on God&#8217;s promise,
seeing, that it had been so often and by so many words
confirmed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls them too
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the oaths to the
tribes</i></font><font face="Palatino">: for though God had spoken to Abraham
and afterwards to Moses, yet the promise was deposited in the hands of Abraham,
and of the patriarchs, and afterwards in those of Moses, that the people might
understated that it belonged equally to them; for it would have been no great
matter to promise what we read of to a few men only. But Abraham was as it were
the depository; and it was a certain solemn stipulation made with his whole
race. We hence see why the Prophet here mentions the tribes rather than Abraham,
or the patriarchs or Moses. He had indeed a special regard to those of his own
time, in order to confirm them, that they might not doubt but that God would
extend to them also the same power. How so? Because God had formerly wrought in
a wonderful manner for the deliverance of his people. Why? That he might prove
himself to be true and faithful. In what respect? Because he had said, that he
would be the protector of his people; and he did not adopt a few men only, but
the whole race of Abraham. Since it was so, why should not his posterity hope
for that which they knew was promised to their fathers? for the truth of God can
never fail. Though many ages had passed away, the faith of his people ought to
have remained certain, for God intended to show himself to be the same as he had
been formerly known by their fathers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rma</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>amer</i>, which means a word or speech; but it is to be taken here for a
fixed and an irrevocable word. The word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rma</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>amer</i>, he says; that is, as they say, the word and the deed: for when we
say, that words are given, we often understand that those who liberally promise
are false men, and that we are only trifled with and disappointed when we place
confidence in them. But the term, word, is sometimes taken in a good sense.
&#8220;This is the word,&#8221; we often say, when we intend to remove every
doubt. We now then perceive what the Prophet meant by adding
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rma</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>amer</i>, the word. &#8220;O Lord, thou hast not given mere words to and
people; but what has proceeded from thy mouth has been found to be true and
valid. Such, therefore, is and faithfulness in thy promises, that we ought not
to entertains the least doubt as to the event. As soon as thou givest to us any
hope, we ought to feel assured of its accomplishment, as though it were not a
word but the exhibition of the thing itself.&#8221; In short, by this term the
Prophet commends the faithfulness of God, lest we should harbour doubts as to
his promises.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh53</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by rivers had been cleft the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He refers, I doubt not, to the history
we read in Numbers 14; for the Lord, when the people were nearly dead through
thirst, drew forth water from the rock, and caused a river to flow wherever the
people journeyed. As then he had cleft the earth to make a perpetual course for
the stream, and thus supplied the people in dry places with abundance of water,
the Prophet says here, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>earth had been cleft by rivers
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or streams. It was indeed but one river; but he
amplifies, and justly so, that remarkable work of God. He afterwards adds

<div><br><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk proceeds with the history of the
people&#8217;s redemption. We have said what his object was, even this that the
people, though in an extreme state of calamity, might yet entertain hope of
God&#8217;s favor; for he became not a Redeemer to the race of Abraham for one
time, but that he might continue the same favor to them to the
end.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mountains had seen and
grieved</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some explain this allegorically of
kings, and say, that they grieved when envy preyed on them: but this view is too
strained. The Prophet, I have no doubt, means simply, that the mountains obeyed
God, so as to open a way for his people. At the same time, the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lwj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chul</i>, signifies not only to grieve, but also to bring forth, and then to
fall and to abide in the same place. We might then with no less propriety read
thus &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>see thee did the
mountains, and were still</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or fell down; that
is, they were subservient to thy command, and did not intercept the way of thy
people. I think the real meaning of the Prophet to be, that God had formerly
imprinted on all the elements evident marks of his paternal favor, so that the
posterity of Abraham might ever confide in him as their deliverer in all their
distresses: and even the context requires this meaning; for he subjoins
-</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The stream
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or the inundation
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of
waters</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc.: and this second part cannot be
explained allegorically. We then see, that the import of the words is &#8212;
That God removed all obstacles, so that neither mountains, nor waters, nor sea,
nor rivers, intercepted the passage of the people. He says now, that the
inundation of waters had passed away. This applies both to Jordan and to the Red
Sea; for God separated the Red Sea, so that the waters stood apart, contrary to
the laws of nature, and the same thing happened to Jordan; for the flowing of
the water was stayed, and a way was opened, so that the people passed over
dryshod into the land of Canaan. Thus took place what is said by the Prophet,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the stream of waters passed
away</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We indeed know that such is the abundance
of waters in the sea and in the rivers, that they cannot be dried up: when
therefore waters disappear, it is what is beyond the course of nature. The
Prophet, therefore, records this miracle, that the faithful might know, that
though the whole world were resisting, their salvation would still be certain;
for the Lord can surmount whatever impediments there may be.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then ascribes life to waters; for he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the abyss gave its
voice</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and also, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the deep lifted up its
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino">; or that the abyss with uplifted hands
was ready to obey God. It is a striking personification; for though the abyss is
void of intelligence, and it cannot speak, yet the Prophet says, that the abyss
with its voice and uplifted hands testified its obedience, when God would have
his people to pass through to the promised land. When anxious to testify our
obedience, we do this both with our voice and in our gesture. When any one is
willing to do what is commanded, he says, &#8220;Here I am,&#8221; or &#8220;I
promise to do this.&#8221; As, then, servants respond to others, so the Prophet
says, that a voice was uttered by the abyss. The abyss indeed uttered no voice;
but the event itself surpassed all voices. Now when a whole people meet
together, they raise their hands; for their consent cannot be understood except
by the outstretching of the hands, and hence came the word hand-extending,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ceirotonia</font><font face="Palatino">.
This similitude the Prophet now takes, and says, that the abyss raised up its
hands; that is, shows its consent by this gesture. As when men declare by this
sign that they will do what they are bidden; so also the abyss lifted up its
hands. If we read, The deep raised up its hands, the sense will be the same.

<div><br><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet refers to another history; for
we know that when Joshua fought, and when the day was not long enough to slay
the enemies, the day was prolonged according to his prayer,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;061012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joshua
10:12.) He seems indeed to have authoritatively commanded the sun to stay its
course: but there is no doubt, but that having been answered as to his prayer,
when he expressed this, he commanded the sun, as he did, through the secret
impulse of the Holy Spirit: and we know that the sun would not have stopped in
its course, except the moon also was stayed. There must indeed have been the
same action as to these two luminaries.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence Habakkuk says, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sun and moon stood still in their
habitation</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, that the sun then rested
as it were in its dwelling. When it was hastening in its course, it then stood
still for the benefit of God&#8217;s people.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The sun then and the moon
stood</i></font><font face="Palatino">, &#8212; How?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>At the light of thy arrows shall
they walk</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some refer this to the pillar of
fire, as though the Prophet had said, that the Israelites walked by that light,
by which God guided them: but I doubt not but that this is said of the sun. The
whole sentence is thus connected &#8212; that the sun and moon walked, not as
from the beginning, but at the light of God&#8217;s arrows; that is, when
instead of God&#8217;s command, which the sun had received from the beginning as
its direction, the sun had God&#8217;s arrows, which guided it, retarded its
course, or restrained the velocity which it had before. There is then an implied
contrast between the progress of the sun which it had by nature to that day, and
that new direction, when the sun was retained, that it might give place to the
arrows of God, and to the sword and the spear; for by the arrows and the spear
he means nothing else but the weapons of the elect people; for we know, that
when that people fought under the protection of God, they were armed as it were
from above. As then it is said of Gideon, &#8220;The sword of God and of
Gideon;&#8221; so also in this place the Prophet calls whatever armor the people
of Israel had, the arrows of God and his spear; for that people could not move
&#8212; no, not a finger&#8217;s breadth &#8212; without the command of God. The
sun then was wont before to regard the ordinary command, of which we read in
Genesis; but it was then directed for another purpose: for it had regard to the
arrows of God flying on the earth as lightning; and it had regard to the arrows,
as though it stood astonished and dared not to advance. Why? because it behoved
it to submit to God while he was carrying on war.

delivering them; for it was for this end that he formerly wrought so many

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet relates here the entrance of the
people into the land of Canaan, that the faithful might know that their fathers
would not have obtained so many victories had not God put forth the power and
strength of his hand. Hence he says, that God himself
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had trampled on the land in
anger</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For how could the Israelites have dared
to attack so many nations, who had lately come forth from so miserable a
bondage? They had indeed been in the desert for forty years; but they were
always trembling and fearful, and we also know that they were weak and feeble.
How then was it, that they overcame most powerful kings? that they made war with
nations accustomed to war? Doubtless God himself
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>trod down the land in his
wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and also
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>threshed the

<div><font face="Palatino">Justly then does the Prophet ascribe this to God,
that he himself walked over the land; for otherwise the Israelites would never
have dared to move a foot. Doubtless, they could never have been settled in that
land, had not God gone before them. Hence when God did tread on the land in his
anger, then it became a quiet habitation to the children of Abraham; warlike
nations were then easily and without much trouble conquered by the Israelites,
though they were previously very weak.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see, that the Prophet sets forth here before
the eyes of the people their entrance into the land, that they might know that
God did not in vain put to flight so many nations at one time; but that the land
of Canaan might be the perpetual inheritance of his chosen
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet changes often the tenses of the verbs,
inconsistently with the common usage of the Hebrew language; but it must be
observed, that he so refers to those histories, as though God were continually
carrying on his operations; and as though his presence was to be looked for in
adversities, the same as what he had granted formerly to the fathers. Hence the
change of tenses does not obscure the sense, but, on the contrary, shows to us
the design of the Prophet, and helps us to understand the meaning. It follows at

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet applies again to the present state of
the people what he had before recorded &#8212; that God went forth with his
Christ for the salvation of his people. Some consider that there is understood a
particle of comparison, and repeat the verb twice, &#8220;As thou didst then go
forth for the deliverance of thy people, so now wilt thou go forth for the
deliverance of thy people with thy Christ.&#8221; But this repetition is
strained. I therefore take the words of the Prophet simply as they are &#8212;
that God went forth for the deliverance of his people. But when God&#8217;s
people are spoken of, their gratuitous adoption must ever be remembered. How was
it that the children of Abraham became the peculiar people of God? Did this
proceed from any worthiness? Did it come to them naturally? None of these things
can be alleged. Though then they differed in nothing from other nations, yet God
was pleased to choose them to be a people to himself. By the title, the people
of God, is therefore intimated their adoption. Now this adoption was not
temporary or momentary, but was to continue to the end. Hence it was easy for
the faithful to draw this conclusion &#8212; that they were to hope from God the
same help as what he had formerly granted to the fathers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou wentest
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for the salvation, for the
salvation of thy people</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He repeats the word
salvation, and not without reason; for he wished to call attention to this
point, as when he had said before &#8212; that God had not in vain manifested,
by so many miracles, his power, as though he were angry with the sea and with
rivers, but had respect to the preservation of his people. Since then the
salvation of the Church has ever been the design of God in working miracles, why
should the faithful be now cast down, when for a time they were oppressed by
adversities? for God ever remains the same: and why should they despond,
especially since that ancient deliverance, and also those many deliverances, of
which he had hitherto spoken, are so many evidences of his everlasting covenant.
These indeed ought to be connected with the word of God; that is, with that
promise, according to which he had received the children of Abraham into favor
for the purpose of protecting them to the end. &#8220;For salvation, for
salvation,&#8221; says the Prophet, and that of his elect
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with thy
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This clause still more confirms what
Habakkuk had in view &#8212; that God had been from the beginning the deliverer
of his people in the person of the Mediator. When God, therefore, delivered his
people from the hand of Pharaoh, when he made a way for them to pass through the
Red Sea, when he redeemed them by doing wonders, when he subdued before them the
most powerful nations, when he changed the laws of nature in their behalf
&#8212; all these things he did through the Mediator. For God could never have
been propitious either to Abraham himself or to his posterity, had it not been
for the intervention of a Mediator. Since then it has ever been the office of
the Mediator to preserve in safety the Church of God, the Prophet takes it now
for granted, that Christ was now manifested in much clearer light than formerly;
for David was his lively image, as well as his successors. God then gave a
living representation of his Christ when he erected a kingdom in the person of
David; and he promised that this kingdom should endure as long as the sun and
moon should shine in the heavens. Since, then, there were in the time of
Habakkuk clearer prophecies than in past times respecting the eternity of this
kingdom, ought not the people to have taken courage, and to have known of a
certainty that God would be their Deliverer, when Christ should come? We now
then apprehend the meaning of the Prophet.

face is justly hid from us, may we yet never hesitate to flee to thee, since
thou hast made a covenant through thy Son, which is founded in thine infinite
mercy. Grant then, that we, being humbled in true penitence, may so surrender
ourselves to thy Son, that we may be led to thee, and find thee to be no less a

<div><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE HUNDRED AND
SEVENTEENTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE explained yesterday why the Prophet says that God
went forth for the salvation of the elect people with his Christ. His purpose
was to confirm still more the faithful in the hope of their deliverance; for God
is not only the same, and never changes his purpose, but the same Mediator also
performs his office, through whom the people were formerly preserved. We must
also notice this difference, to which I referred yesterday; for as God had then
more clearly manifested Christ, with more cheerfulness it behaved the faithful
to go on, as they had so remarkable a pledge of God&#8217;s favor, inasmuch as
God had promised that the kingdom of God would be for ever.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wounded was the head from the
house of the wicked</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, that there was no
power which had not been laid prostrate by God for the sake of his people; and
we know that all the great kings were formerly destroyed, in order that favor
might be shown to God&#8217;s people. The other comparison seems different, and
yet its object is the same &#8212; that God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had made bare the foundation to
the neck</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, that he had destroyed from
the roots his enemies; for by foundation he means, in a metaphorical sense,
whatever stability there was in these enemies, and that this was torn up and
overthrown to the very neck, that is, to the very summit; for the body of men,
we know, is covered from the neck to the feet. And he says that their houses,
that is their families, were made bare to the neck, for the Lord had destroyed
them all from the bottom to the top. We now understand what the Prophet
meant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hls</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>selah</i>, I have hitherto said nothing; but I shall now briefly refer to
what the Hebrew interpreters think. Some explain it by
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;lw[l</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>laoulam</i>, &#8220;for ever;&#8221; and by
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d[w
d[</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>od uod</i>, &#8220;yet and yet;&#8221; as
though, when this word is inserted, the Holy Spirit pronounced what is to be for
ever. Others render it by
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;ma</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>amen</i>, as though God testified that what is said is true and indubitable.
But as it never occurs except in this song and in the Psalms, and does not
always comport with what they say, that is, that it denotes certainty or
perpetuity, I prefer embracing the opinion of those who think that it refers to
singing, and not to things. And what they add is also probable, if we regard its
etymology, for the word means to raise or to elevate; and it was therefore put
down to remind the singers to raise their voice. But as it is a thing of no
great importance, it is enough shortly to state what others think. Let us now go
on &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">At the beginning of this verse the Prophet
pursues the same subject &#8212; that God had wounded all the enemies of his
people; and he says that the head of villages or towns had been wounded, though
some think that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yzrp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>perezim</i>, mean rather the inhabitants of towns; for the Hebrews call
fortified towns or villages
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twzrp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>perezut</i>, and the word is commonly found in the feminine gender; but as it
is here a masculine noun, it is thought that it means the inhabitants. At the
same time this does not much affect the subject; for the Prophet simply means,
that not only things had been overthrown by God&#8217;s hand, but also all the
provinces under their authority; as though he had said that God&#8217;s
vengeance, when his purpose was to defend his people, advanced through all the
villages and through every region, so that not a corner was safe. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh57</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But we
must also notice what follows &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with his
rods</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet means that the wicked had
been smitten by their own sword. Though the word rods is put here, it is yet to
be taken for all kinds of instruments or weapons; it is the same as though it
was said that they had been wounded by their own hands. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh58</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive the import of this clause &#8212;
that God not only put forth his strength when he purposed to crush the enemies
of his people, but that he had also smitten them with infatuation and madness,
so that they destroyed themselves by their own hands. And this was done, as in
the case of the Midianites, who, either by turning their swords against one
another, fell by mutual wounds, or by slaying themselves, perished by their own
hands.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;070702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Judges
7:2.) We indeed often read of the wicked that they ensnared themselves, fell
into the pit which they had made, and, in short, perished through their own
artifices; and the Prophet says here that the enemies of the Church had fallen,
through God&#8217;s singular kindness, though no one rose up against them; for
they had transfixed or wounded themselves by their own staff. Some read &#8212;
&#8220;Thou hast cursed his sceptres and the head of his villages;&#8221; but
the interpretation which I have given is much more appropriate.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>came like a
whirlwind</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is indeed a verb in the future
tense; but the sentence must be thus rendered &#8212; &#8220;When they rushed as
a whirlwind to cast me down, when their exultation was to devour the poor in
their hiding-places.&#8221; It is indeed only a single verb, but it comes from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r[s</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sor</i>, which means a whirlwind, and we cannot render it otherwise than by a
paraphrase. They rushed, he says, like a whirlwind. The Prophet here enlarges on
the subject of God&#8217;s power, for he had checked the enemies of his people
when they rushed on with so much impetuosity. Had their advance been slow God
might have frustrated their attempts without a miracle, but as their own madness
rendered them precipitate, and made them to be like a whirlwind, God&#8217;s
power was more clearly known in restraining such violence. We now understand the
import of what is here said; for the Prophet&#8217;s special object is not to
complain of the violent and impetuous rage of enemies, but to exalt the power of
God in checking the violent assaults of those enemies whom he saw raging against
his people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their exultation was to devour
the poor</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He intimates that there was nothing
in the world capable of resisting the wicked, had not God brought miraculous
help from heaven; for when they came to devour the poor, they came not to wage
war, but to devour the prey like wild beasts. Then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to devour the poor in
secret</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He means, that the people of God had no
strength to resist, except help beyond all hope came from heaven. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh59</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The import of the whole is &#8212; that when the
miserable Israelites were without any protection, and exposed to the rage and
cruelty of their enemies, they had been miraculously helped; for the Lord
destroyed their enemies by their own swords; and that when they came, as it were
to enjoy a victory, to take the prey, they were laid prostrate by the hand of
God: hence his power shone forth more brightly. It follows

such strained explanations, since the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;rd</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>darek</i>, means to go or to march? The Prophet&#8217;s meaning is by no
means doubtful &#8212; that God would make a way for himself in the sea, and on
his own horses. How? even when
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>great waters were gathered into a
mass</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet again refers to the history
of the passage through the Red Sea; for it was a work of God, as it has been
said, worthy of being remembered above all other works: it is therefore no
wonder that the Prophet dwells so much in setting forth this great miracle.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou</i></font><font face="Palatino">

adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The heap of
waters</i></font><font face="Palatino">: for the waters had been gathered
together, and a firm and thick mass appeared, which was not according to nature;
for we know that water is a fluid, and that hardly a drop of water can stand
without flowing. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh60</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> How
then was it that he stopped the course of Jordan, and that the Red Sea was
divided? These were evidences of God&#8217;s incomprehensible power, and rightly
ought these to have added courage to the faithful, knowing, as they ought to
have done, that nothing could have opposed their salvation, which God was not
able easily to remove, whenever it pleased him. It follows

<div><br><font face="Palatino">Those interpreters are mistaken in my view, who
connect the verb, &#8220;I have heard,&#8221; with the last verse, as though the
Prophet had said, that he had conceived dread from those evidences of
God&#8217;s power: for the Prophet had no occasion to fear in regarding God as
armed with unexpected power for the salvation of his people; there was no reason
for such a thing. Hence these things do not agree together. But he returns again
to that dread which he had entertained on account of God&#8217;s voice in those
terrific threatening which we before referred to. We must always bear in mind
the Prophet&#8217;s design &#8212; that his object was to humble the faithful,
that they might suppliantly acknowledge to God their sins and solicit his
forgiveness. His purpose also was to animate them with strong hope, that they
might nevertheless look for deliverance. He had already said at the beginning,
&#8220;Lord, I have heard thy voice; I feared.&#8221; He now repeats the same
thing: for if he had spoken only of that terrific voice, the faithful might have
been overwhelmed with despair; he therefore wished opportunely to prevent this
evil, by interposing what might have comforted them. For this reason he recited
these histories, by which God had proved that he was armed with invincible power
to save his Church. Having done this, he applies his general doctrine to present
circumstances, and says, &#8220;I have heard.&#8221; What had he heard? even
those judgements with which God had determined to visit the contumacy of his
people. Since, then, God had threatened his people with a horrible destruction,
the Prophet says now, that he had heard and trembled, so that he had been
confounded. He speaks in the singular number; but this was done, as we have
said, because he represented the whole people, as was the case before (which
escaped my notice) when he said, his enemies came like whirlwind to cast him
down; for certainly he did not then speak of himself but of the ancient people.
As, then, the Prophet here undertakes the cause of the whole Church, he speaks
as though he were the collective body of the people: and so he says that he had
heard; but the faithful speak here as with one mouth, that they had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heard</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
and that their </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>inside
trembled</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some read, &#8220;I was dismayed, or I feared, and my
inside trembled at his voice.&#8221; He takes
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lwq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kul</i>, voice, not for report, but, as it has been said, for threatening.
The faithful, then, declare here, that they dreaded the voice of God, before he
had executed his judgements, or before he inflicted the punishment which he had
threatened. He says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>quiver did
my lips</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">llx</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tsalel</i>, means sometimes to tingle, and so some render it here,
&#8220;Tingle did my lips;&#8221; but this is not suitable, and more tolerable
is the rendering of others, &#8220;Palpitate did my lips.&#8221; The Hebrews say
that what is meant is that motion in the lips which fear or trembling produces.
I therefore render the words, &#8220;quiver did my lips;&#8221; as when one says
in our language, <i>Mes levres ont barbate</i>; that is, when the whole body
shakes with trembling, not only a noise is made by the clashing of the teeth,
but an agitation is also observed in the lips.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Enter</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>did rottenness into my
bones and within myself I made a noise</i></font><font face="Palatino">, (it is
the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">zgr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>regaz</i>, again,) or I trembled. No doubt the Prophet describes here the
dread, which could not have been otherwise than produced by the dreadful
vengeance of God. It hence follows that he does not treat here of those miracles
which were, on the contrary, calculated to afford an occasion of rejoicing both
to the Prophet and to the whole of the chosen people; but that the vengeance of
God, such as had been predicted, is described here.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That I may rest in the day of
affliction</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh61</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There
seems to be here an inconsistency &#8212; that the Prophet was affected with
grief even to rottenness, that he trembled throughout his members with dread,
and now that all this availed to produce rest. But we must inquire how rest is
to be obtained through these trepidations, and dreads, and tremblings. We indeed
know that the more hardened the wicked become against God, the more grievous
ruin they ever procure for themselves. But there is no way of obtaining rest,
except for a time we tremble within ourselves, that is, except God&#8217;s
judgement awakens us, yea, and reduces us almost to nothing. Whosoever therefore
securely slumbers, will be confounded in the day of affliction; but he who in
time anticipates the wrath of God, and is touched with fear, as soon as he hears
that God the judge is at hand, provides for himself the most secure rest in the
day of affliction. We now then see, that the right way of seeking rest is set
forth here by the Prophet, when he says, that he had been confounded, and that
rottenness had entered into his bones that he could have no comfort, except he
pined away as one half-dead: and the design of the Prophet, as I have already
said, was to exhort the faithful to repentance. But we cannot truly and from the
heart repent, until our sins become displeasing to us: and the hatred of sin
proceeds from the fear of God, and that sorrow which Paul regards as the mother
of repentance.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470710&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 7:10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This exhortation is also very necessary for us in the
present day. We see how inclined we are by nature to indifference; and when God
brings before us our sins, and then sets before us his wrath, we are not moved;
and when we entertain any fear, it soon vanishes. Let us, then, know that no
rest can be to us in the day of distress, except we tremble within ourselves,
except dread lays hold on all our faculties, and except all our soul becomes
almost rotten. And hence it is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;190404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
4:4, &#8220;Tremble, and ye shall not sin.&#8221; And Paul also shows that the
true and profitable way of being angry is, when one is angry with his sins
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490426&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:26,) and when we tremble within ourselves. In the same manner does the Prophet
describe the beginnings of repentance, when he says, that the faithful trembled
in their bowels, and were so shaken within, that even their lips quivered, and,
in short, (and this is the sum of the whole,) that all their senses felt
consternation and fear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When he shall
ascend</i></font><font face="Palatino">: he speaks, no doubt, of the Chaldeans;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When</i></font><font face="Palatino">
therefore the enemy </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall ascend
against the people, that he may cut them off</i></font><font face="Palatino">:

or
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dwg</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gade</i> or <i>gud</i>, means to cut off, and it means also to gather, and so
some render it, &#8220;that he may gather them:&#8221; but the other meaning is
better, &#8220;when the enemy shall ascend, that he may cut them off.&#8221; If
one would have the word God to be understood, I do not object: for the Prophet
does not otherwise speak of the Chaldeans than as the ministers and executioners
of God&#8217;s wrath.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, he intimates, that they who had been moved
and really terrified by God&#8217;s vengeance, would be in a quiet state when
God executed his judgements. How so? because they would calmly submit to the
rod, and look for a happy deliverance from their evils; for their minds would be
seasonably prepared for patience, and then the Lord would also console them, as
it is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;195117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
51:17, that he despises not contrite hearts. When, therefore, the faithful are
in a suitable time humbled, and when they thus anticipate the judgement of God,
they then find a rest prepared for them in his bosom. It follows

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh62</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
means that the desolation of the land was nigh at hand, and that the people
would be reduced to extreme poverty. But it was an instance of rare virtue, to
be able to rejoice in the Lord, when occasions of sorrow met him on every
side.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet then teaches us what advantage it is to
the faithful seasonably to submit to God, and to entertain serious fear when he
threatens them, and when he summons them to judgement; and he shows that though
they might perish a hundred times, they would yet not perish, for the Lord would
ever supply them with occasions of joy, and would also cherish this joy within,
so as to enable them to rise above all their adversities. Though, then, the land
was threatened with famine, and though no food would be supplied to them, they
would yet be able always to rejoice in the God of their salvation; for they
would know him to be their Father, though for a time he severely chastised them.
This is a delineation of that rest of which he made mention
before.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The import of the whole is &#8212; &#8220;Though
neither the figs, nor the vines, nor the olives, produce any fruit, and though
the field be barren, though no food be given, yet I
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will rejoice
</i></font><font face="Palatino">in my God;&#8221; that is, our joy shall not
depend on outward prosperity; for though the Lord may afflict us in an extreme
degree, there will yet be always some consolation to sustain our minds, that
they may not succumb under evils so grievous; for we are fully persuaded, that
our salvation is in God&#8217;s hand, and that he is its faithful guardian. We
shall, therefore, rest quietly, though heaven and earth were rolled together,
and all places were full of confusion; yea, though God fulminated from heaven,
we shall yet be in a tranquil state of mind, looking for his gratuitous
salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive more clearly, that the sorrow
produced by the sense of our guilt is recommended to us on account of its
advantage; for nothing is worse than to provoke God&#8217;s wrath to destroy us;
and nothing is better than to anticipate it, so that the Lord himself may
comfort us. We shall not always escape, for he may apparently treat us with
severity; but though we may not be exempt from punishment, yet while he intends
to humble us, he will give us reasons to rejoice: and then in his own time he
will mitigate his severity, and by the effects will show himself propitious to
us. Nevertheless, during the time when want or famine, or any other affliction,
is to be borne, he will render us joyful with this one consolation, for, relying
on his promises, we shall look for him as the God of our salvation. Hence, on
one side Habakkuk sets the desolation of the land; and on the other, the inward
joy which the faithful never fail to possess, for they are upheld by the
perpetual favor of God. And thus he warns, as I have said, the children of God,
that they might be prepared to bear want and famine, and calmly to submit to
God&#8217;s chastisements; for had he not exhorted them as he did, they might
have failed a hundred times.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may hence gather a most useful doctrine, &#8212;
That whenever signs of God&#8217;s wrath meet us in outward things, this remedy
remains to us &#8212; to consider what God is to us inwardly; for the inward
joy, which faith brings to us, can overcome all fears, terrors, sorrows and
anxieties.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must notice what follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the God of my
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino">: for sorrow would soon absorb all our
thoughts, except God were present as our preserver. But how does he appear as
such to the faithful? even when they estimate not his love by external things,
but strengthen themselves by embracing the promise of his mercy, and never doubt
but that he will be propitious to them; for it is impossible but that he will
remember mercy even while he is angry. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">He confirms the same truth, &#8212; that he
sought no strength but in God alone. But there is an implied contrast between
God and those supports on which men usually lean. There is indeed no one, who is
not of a cheerful mind, when he possesses all necessary things, when no danger,
no fear is impending: we are then courageous when all things smile on us. But
the Prophet, by calling God his strength, sets him in opposition to all other
supports; for he wishes to encourage the faithful to persevere in their hope,
however grievously God might afflict them. His meaning then is, &#8212; that
even when evils impetuously rage against us, when we vacillate and are ready to
fall every moment, God ought then to be our strength; for the aid which he has
promised for our support is all-sufficient. We hence see that the Prophet
entertained firm hope, and by his example animated the faithful, provided they
had God propitious, however might all other things fail them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will
make</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>my feet like those of

return to their own country, though some give this explanation, &#8212;
&#8220;God will give the swiftest feet to his servants, so that they may pass
over all obstacles to destroy their enemies;&#8221; but as they might think in
their exile that their return was closed up against them, the Prophet introduces
this most apt similitude, that God would give his people
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>feet like those of
hinds</i></font><font face="Palatino">, so that they could climb the precipices
of mountains, and dread no difficulties:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>give me the feet of hinds, and
make me to tread on my high places</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some think
that this was said with regard to Judea, which is, as it is well known,
mountainous; but I take the expression more simply in this way, &#8212; that God
would make his faithful people to advance boldly and without fear along high
places: for they who fear hide themselves and dare not to raise up the head, nor
proceed openly along public roads; but the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God will make me to tread on any
high places</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at last adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the leader on my

render conqueror. This inscription, To the leader,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jxnml</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lamenatsech</i>, frequently occurs in the Psalms. To the conqueror, is the
version of some; but it means, I have no doubt, the leader of the singers.
Interpreters think that God is signified here by this title, for he presides
over all the songs of the godly: and it may not inaptly be applied to him as the
leader of the singers, as though the Prophet had said, &#8212; &#8220;God will
be a strength to me; though I am weak in myself, I shall yet be strong in him;
and he will enable me to surmount all obstacles, and I shall proceed boldly, who
am now like one half-dead; and he will thus become the occasion of my song, and
be the leader of the singers engaged in celebrating his praises, when he shall
deliver from death his people in so wonderful a manner.&#8221; We hence see that
the connection is not unsuitable, when he says, that there would be strength for
him in God; and particularly as giving of thanks belonged to the leader or the
chief singer, in order that God&#8217;s aid might be celebrated, not only
privately but at the accustomed sacrifices, as was usually the case under the
law. Those who explain it as denoting the beginning of a song, are extremely
frigid and jejune in what they advance; I shall therefore pass it
by.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,

that it signifies a melody, others render it beatings (<i>pulsationes</i>) or
notes (<i>modos</i>;) and others consider that musical instruments are meant. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fh63</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I
affirm nothing in a doubtful matter: and it is enough to bear in mind what we
have said, &#8212; that the Prophet promises here to God a continual
thanksgiving, when the faithful were redeemed, for not only each one would
acknowledge that they had been saved by God&#8217;s hand, but all would assemble
together in the Temple, and there testify their gratitude, and not only with
their voices confess God as their Deliverer, but also with instruments of music,
as we know it to have been the usual custom under the
Law.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>

under a deep feeling of sorrow flee to thy mercy; and may we in the meantime
persevere in the hope of that mercy, which thou hast promised, and which has

<div><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">CALVIN&#8217;S PREFACE TO
ZEPHANIAH.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">ZEPHANIAH is placed the last of the Minor Prophets
who performed their office before the Babylonian Captivity; and the inscription
shows that he exercised his office of teaching at the same time with Jeremiah,
about thirty years before the city was destroyed, the Temple pulled down, and
the people led into exile. Jeremiah, it is true, followed his vocation even
after the death of Josiah, while Zephaniah prophesied only during his
reign.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The substance of his Book is this: He first denounces
utter destruction on a people who were so perverse, that there was no hope of
their repentance; &#8212; he then moderates his threatening, by denouncing
God&#8217;s judgments on their enemies, the Assyrians, as well as others, who
had treated with cruelty the Church of God; for it was no small consolation,
when the Jews heard that they were so regarded by God, that he would undertake
their cause and avenge their wrongs. He afterwards repeats again his reproofs,
and shortly mentions the sins which then prevailed among the elect people of
God; and, at the same time, he turns his discourse to the faithful, and exhorts
them to patience, setting before them the hope of favor, provided they ever
looked to the Lord; and provided they relied on the gratuitous covenant which he
made with Abraham, and doubted not but that he would be a Father to them, and
also looked, with a tranquil mind, for that redemption which had been promised
to them. This is the sum of the whole Book.</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">ZEPHANIAH first mentions the time in which he
prophesied; it was under the king Josiah. The reason why he puts down the name
of his father Amon does not appear to me. The Prophet would not, as a mark of
honor, have made public a descent that was disgraceful and infamous. Amon was
the son of Manasseh, an impious and wicked king; and he was nothing better than
his father. We hence see that his name is recorded, not for the sake of honor,
but rather of reproach; and it may have been that the Prophet meant to intimate,
what was then well known to all, that the people had become so obdurate in their
superstitions, that it was no easy matter to restore them to a sound mind. But
we cannot bring forward anything but conjecture; I therefore leave the matter
without pretending to decide it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the pedigree of the Prophet, I have
mentioned elsewhere what the Jews affirm &#8212; that when the Prophets put down
the names of their fathers, they themselves had descended from Prophets. But
Zephaniah mentions not only his father and grandfather, but also his
great-grandfather and his great-great-grandfather; and it is hardly credible
that they were all Prophets, and there is not a word respecting them in
Scripture. I do not think, as I have said elsewhere, that such a rule is
well-founded; but the Jews in this case, according to their manner, deal in
trifles; for in things unknown they hesitate not to assert what comes to their
minds, though it may not have the least appearance of truth. It is possible that
the father, grandfather, the great-grandfather, and the great-great-grandfather
of the Prophet, were persons who excelled in piety; but this also is uncertain.
What is especially worthy of being noticed is &#8212; that he begins by saying
that he brought nothing of his own, but faithfully, and, as it were, by the
hand, delivered what he had received from God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard, then, to his pedigree, it is a matter of
no great moment; but it is of great importance to know that God was the author
of his doctrine, and that Zephaniah was his faithful minister, who introduced
not his own devices, but was only the announcer of celestial truth. Let us now

<div><br><font face="Palatino">It might seem at the first view that the Prophet
dealt too severely in thus fulminating against his own nation; for he ought to
have begun with doctrine, as this appears to be the just order of things. But
the Prophet denounces ruin, and shows at the same time why God was so grievously
displeased with the people. We must however remember, that the Prophet, living
at the same period with Jeremiah, had regard to the stubbornness of the people,
who had been already with more than sufficient evidence proved to have been
guilty. Hence he darts forth as of a sudden and denounces the wickedness of the
people, which had been already exposed; so there was to be no more contention on
the subject, for their iniquity had become quite ripe. And no doubt it was ever
the object of the Prophets to unite their endeavors so as to assist one another:
and this united effort ought ever to be among all the servants of God, that no
one may do anything apart, but with joined efforts they may promote the same
object, and at the same time strive mutually to confirm the common truth. This
is what our Prophet is now doing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He knew that God would have used various means to
restore them, had not the corruption of the people become now past recovery.
Having observed that all others had spent their labor in vain, he directly
attacks the wicked men who had, as it were designedly, cast aside every fear of
God, and shook off every shame. Since, then, it was openly evident that with
determined rebellion they resisted God, it was no wonder that the Prophet began
with so much severity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here a difficulty meets us. He said in the first
verse, that he thus spoke under Josiah; but we know that the land was then
cleansed from its superstitions. For we learn, that when that pious king
attained manhood, he labored most strenuously to restore the pure worship of
God; and when all places were full of wicked superstitions, he not only
constrained the tribe of Judah to adopt the true worship of God, but he also
stimulated his neighbors who had remained and were dispersed through the land of
Israel. Since, then, the pious king had strenuously and courageously promoted
the interest of true religion, it seems a wonder that God was still so much
displeased. But we must remember, that though Josiah sincerely worshipped God,
yet the people were not really changed; for it has often happened, that God
roused the chief men and leaders, while few, or hardly any, followed them, but
only yielded a feigned obedience. This was no doubt the case in the time of
Josiah; the hearts of the people were alienated from God and true religion, so
that they chose rather to rot in their filth than to return to the true worship
of God. And that this was the case soon appeared by the event; for Josiah did
not reign long after he had cleansed the land from its defilements, and Jehoahaz
succeeded him; and then the people immediately relapsed into their idolatry; and
though for three months only his successor reigned, yet true religion was in
that short time abolished. It is hence an obvious conclusion, that the people
had ever been wedded to impiety, and that its roots were hidden in their hearts;
though they apparently pretended to worship God, and, in order to please the
king, embraced the worship divinely prescribed in their law; yet the event
proved that it was a mere act of dissimulation, yea, of perfidy. Then after
Jehoahaz followed Jehoiakim, and no better was their condition down to the time
of Zedekiah; in short, no remedy could be found for their unhealable
wound.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It hence plainly appears, that though Josiah made use
of all means to revive the true and unadulterated worship of God in Judea, he
did not yet gain his object. And we hence clearly learn how hard were the trials
he sustained, seeing that he effected nothing, though at great hazard he
attempted to restore the worship of God. When he found that he labored in vain,
he no doubt had to contend with great difficulties; and this we know by our own
experience. When hope of success shines on us, we easily overcome all troubles,
however arduous our work may be; but when we see that we strive in vain, we
become dejected: and when we see that our labor succeeds only for a few years,
our spirit grows faint. Josiah surmounted these two difficulties; for the
perverseness of the people was sufficiently evident, and he was also reminded by
two Prophets, Jeremiah and Zephaniah, that the people would still cherish their
impious perverseness. When, therefore, he plainly saw that his labor was almost
in vain, he might have fainted in the middle of his course, or, as they say, at
the starting-place. And since the benefit was so small during his reign, what
could he have hoped after his death?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This example ought at this day to be carefully
observed: for though God now appears to the world in full light, yet very few
there are who submit themselves to his word; and of this small number fewer
still there are who sincerely and without any dissimulation embrace sound
doctrine. We indeed see how great is their inconstancy and indifference. For
they who pretend great zeal for a time very soon vanish and fall away. Since
then the perversity of the world is so great, sufficient to deject the minds of
God&#8217;s servants a hundred times, let us learn to look to Josiah, who in his
own time left undone nothing, which might serve to establish the true worship of
God; and when he saw that he effected but little and next to nothing, he still
persevered, and with firm and invincible greatness of mind proceeded in his
course.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may also derive hence an admonition no less useful
not to regard ours as the golden age, because some portion of men profess the
pure worship of God: for many, by no means wicked men, think, that almost all
mortals are like angels, as soon as they testify in words their approbation of
the gospel: and the sacred name of Reformation is at this day profaned, when any
one who shows as it were by a nod only that he is not wholly an enemy to the
gospel, is immediately lauded as a person of extraordinary piety. Though then
many show some regard for religion, let us yet know that among so large a number
there are many hypocrites, and that there is much chaff mixed with the wheat:
and that our senses may not deceive us, we may see here, as in a mirror, how
difficult it is to restore the world to the obedience of God, and utterly to
root up all corruptions, though idols may be taken away and superstitions be
abolished. No doubt Josiah had regard to everything calculated to cleanse the
Church, and had recourse to the advice of Jeremiah and also of Zephaniah; we yet
see that he did not attain the object he wished, for God now became more
grievously displeased with his people than under Manasseh, or under Amon. These
wicked kings had attempted to extinguish all true religion; they had cruelly
raged against all God&#8217;s servants, so that Jerusalem became almost drenched
with innocent blood: and yet God seems here to have manifested greater
displeasure under Josiah than during the previous cruelty and so many impieties.
But as I have already said, there is no reason why we should despond, though the
world by its ingratitude may close up the way against us; and however much may
Satan also by this artifice strive to discourage us, let us still perseveringly
go on according to the duties of our calling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be now asked, why God denounces his
vengeance on </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the beasts of the
field, the birds of heaven, and the fishes of the
sea</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for how much soever the Jews may have
provoked him by their sins, innocent animals ought to have been spared. If a son
is not to be punished for the fault of his father,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;261804&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
18:4, but that the soul that has sinned is to die, why did God turn his wrath
against fishes and other animals? This seems to have been a hasty and
unreasonable infliction. But let this rule be first borne in mind &#8212; that
it is preposterous in us to estimate God&#8217;s doings according to our
judgment, as froward and proud men do in our day; for they are disposed to judge
of God&#8217;s works with such presumption, that whatever they do not approve,
they think it right wholly to condemn. But it behaves us to judge modestly and
soberly, and to confess that God&#8217;s judgments are a deep abyss: and when a
reason for them does not appear, we ought reverently and with due humility to
hook for the day of their full revelation. This is one thing. Then it is meet at
the same time to remember, that as animals were created for man&#8217;s use,
they must undergo a lot in common with him: for God made subservient to man both
the birds of heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and all other animals. It is
then no matter of wonder, that the condemnation of him, who enjoys a sovereignty
over the whole earth, should reach to animals. And we know that the world was
not made subject to corruption willingly &#8212; that is, naturally; but because
the contagion from Adam&#8217;s fall diffused itself through heaven and earth.
Hence the sun and the moon, and all the stars, and also all the animals, the
earth itself, and the whole world, bear marks of God&#8217;s wrath, not because
they have provoked it through their own fault, but because the whole world is
involved in man&#8217;s curse. The reason then is, because all things were
created for the sake of man. Hence there is no ground to conclude, that God acts
with too much severity when he executes his vengeance on innocent animals, for
he can justly involve in the same ruin with man whatever he has created for his
use.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the reason also is sufficiently plain, why the
Prophet speaks here of the beasts of the earth, the fishes of the sea, and the
birds of heaven: for we find that men grow torpid, or rather stupid in their own
indifference, except they are forcibly roused. It was, therefore, necessary for
the Prophet, when he saw the people so hardened in their wickedness, and that he
had to do with men past recovery, to set clearly before them these judgments of
God, as though he had said &#8212; &#8220;Ye lie down securely, and indulge
yourselves, when God is coming forth prepared for vengeance: but his wrath shall
not only proceed against you, but will also lay hold on the harmless animals;
for ye shall see a horrible judgment executed on your oxen and asses, on the
birds and the fishes. What will become of you when God&#8217;s wrath shall be
thus kindled against the unhappy creatures who have committed no sins? Shall ye
indeed escape unpunished?&#8221; We now understand why the Prophet does not
speak here of men only, but collects with them the beasts of the earth, the
fishes of the sea, and the birds of the air.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By removing I will remove all
things from the face of the land</i></font><font face="Palatino">; he afterwards
enumerates particulars: but immediately after he clearly shows, that God would
not act rashly and inconsiderately while executing his vengeance, for his sole
purpose was to punish the wicked,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall
be</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stumblingblocks to the
ungodly</i></font><font face="Palatino">; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk1</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it is
the same as though he said &#8212; &#8220;When I cite to God&#8217;s tribunal
both the fishes of the sea and the birds of heaven, think not that God&#8217;s
controversy is with these creatures which are void of reason, but they are to
sustain a part of God&#8217;s vengeance, which ye have through your sins
deserved.&#8221; The Prophet then does here briefly show, that what he had
before threatened brute creatures with, would come upon them on men&#8217;s
account; for God&#8217;s design was to execute vengeance on the wicked; and as
he saw that they were extremely torpid, he tried to awaken them by manifest
tokens, so that they might see God the avenger as it were in a striking picture.
And at the same time he also adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will remove man from the face
of the land</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He does not speak now of fishes or
of other animals, but refers to men only. Hence appears more clearly what I have
said &#8212; that the Prophet was under the necessity of speaking as he did,
owing to the insensibility of the people. He now adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet explains still more clearly why he
directed his discourse in the last verse against the beasts of the earth and the
birds of heaven, even for this end &#8212; that the Jews might understand that
God was angry with them. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
stretch forth, he says, my hand on Judah and on
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God, then, by executing his
vengeance on animals, intended to exhibit to the Jews, as in a picture, the
dreadfulness of his wrath, which yet they despised and regarded as nothing. The
stretching forth of God&#8217;s hand I have elsewhere explained; and it means
even this &#8212; that he stretches forth his hand when he acts in an unusual
manner, and employs means beyond what is common. We indeed know that God has no
hands, and we also know that he performs all things by his command alone: but as
everything seen in the world is called the work of his hands, so he is said to
stretch forth his hand when he mentions a work that is remarkable and worthy of
being remembered. In a like manner, when I intend to do some slight work, I only
move my hand; but when I have some difficult work to do, I prepare myself more
carefully, and also stretch forth my arms. This metaphor, then, is intended only
for this purpose, to render men more attentive to God&#8217;s works, when he is
set forth as stretching forth his hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says, on
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and on the inhabitants of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
The kingdom of Israel had now been abolished, and the ten tribes had been led
into exile; and a few only of the lowest and the poorest remained. The Jews
thought themselves safe for ever, because they had escaped that calamity. This
is the reason why the Prophet declares that God&#8217;s judgment was impending
not only over the kingdom of Judah, but also over the holy city, which thought
itself exempt from all such evil, because there were the sacrifices performed,
and there was the royal city, and, in short, because God had testified that his
habitation was to be there for ever. Since, then, by this vain confidence the
inhabitants of Jerusalem deceived themselves and others, Zephaniah specifically
addresses them. And as he had before spoken of the wicked, he intended here, no
doubt, sharply to reprove the Jews, as though he said by way of anticipation,
There is no reason for you to enquire who are the wicked; for ye yourselves are
they, even ye who are the holy people of God and God&#8217;s chosen inheritance,
ye who are the race of Abraham, who flatter yourselves so much on account of
your excellency; ye are the wicked, who have not hitherto ceased to provoke the
vengeance of God. And at the same time he shows, as it were by the finger, some
of their sins, though he mentions others afterwards: but he speaks now of their
superstitions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will cut
off</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the remnants of Baal and the name
of Chamerim</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The severity of the Prophet may
seem here again to be excessive, for being so incensed against superstitions
which had been abolished by the great zeal and singular diligence of the king;
but, as we have already intimated, he regarded not so much the king as the
people. For though they dared not openly to adulterate God&#8217;s worship, they
yet cherished those corruptions at home to which they had before been
accustomed, as we see to be done at this day. For when it is not allowed to
worship idols, many mutter their prayers in secret and invoke their idols: and,
in short, they are restrained only by the fear of men from manifesting their own
impiety; and in the meantime, they retain before God the same abominations. So
it was in the time of Josiah; the people were wedded to their corruptions, and
this we may easily conclude from the words of Zephaniah: for the remnants of
Baal were not seen in the temple, nor in the streets, nor in their chapels, nor
in the high places; but their hidden impiety is here discovered by the Spirit of
God; and no doubt their sin was the more heinous and less excusable, because the
people refused to follow their pious leader. It was indeed the most abominable
ingratitude; for when they saw that the right worship was restored to them, they
preferred to remain fixed in their own filth, rather than to return to God, even
when they had liberty to do so, and also when that pious king extended his hand
to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yrmk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>camerim</i>, it designated either the worshipers of Baal or some such men as
our monks at this day: and they are supposed by some to have been thus called,
because they were clothed in black vestments; while others think that they
derived this name from their fervor, because they were madly devoted to their
superstitions, or because they had marks on their foreheads, or because they
imposed, as is commonly the case, on the simple by the ardor of their zeal. The
name is also found in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;122301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 23:1 in the account given of Josiah: for it is said there, that the
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yrmk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>camerim</i>, were taken away, together with other abominations of
superstition. But as Zephaniah connects priests with them, it is probable that
they were a kind of people like the monks, who did not themselves offer
sacrifices, but were a sort of attendants, who undertook vows and offered
prayers in the name of the whole people. For what some think, that they were
thus called because they burnt incense, appears not to me probable; for then
they must have been priests. They were then inferior to the sacrificers, and
occupying a station between them and the people, like the monks and hermits of
this day, who deceive foolish men by their sanctity. Such, then, were the
Camerim.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk2</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as Josiah could not attain his object, so as
immediately to cleanse the land from these pollutions, we need not wonder that
at this day we are not able immediately to remove superstitions from the world:
but let us in the meantime ever proceed in our course. Let those endued with
authority, who bear the sword, that is, all magistrates, perform their office
with greater diligence, inasmuch as they see how difficult and protracted is the
contest with the ministers of idolatry. Let also the ministers of the gospel
earnestly cry against idolatry, and all ungodly ceremonies, and not desist.
Though they may not effect as much as they wish, yet let them follow the example
of Josiah. If God should in the meantime thunder from heaven, let them not be
discouraged, but, on the contrary, know that their labor is approved by him, and
never doubt of their own safety; for though all were destroyed, their godly
efforts would not be in vain, nor fail of a reward before God. Thus, then, ought
all God&#8217;s servants to animate themselves, each in his particular sphere
and vocation, whenever they have to contend with superstitions, and with such
corruptions as vitiate and adulterate the pure worship of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as we are so
prone to corruptions, and so easily turn from the right course after having
commenced it, and so easily degenerate from the truth once known, &#8212; O
grant, that, being strengthened by thy Spirit, we may persevere to the end in
the right way which thou showest to us in thy word, and that we may also labor
to restore the many who abandon themselves to various errors; and though we may
effect nothing, let us not yet be led away after them, but remain firm in the
obedience of faith, until having at length finished all these contests, we shall
be gathered into that blessed rest which is prepared for us in heaven, through
Christ our Lord. Amen.</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">ZEPHANIAH pursues the subject contained in the
verse I explained yesterday. For as the majority of the people still adhered to
their superstitions, though the pure worship of the law had been restored by
Josiah, the Prophet threatens here, that God would punish such ingratitude. As
then he had spoken in the last verse of the worshipers of Baal and their
sacrifices, so now he proceeds farther &#8212; that the Lord would execute
vengeance on the whole people, who prayed to the host of heaven, or bowed
themselves down before the host of heaven. It is well known that those stars are
thus called in Scripture to which the gentiles ascribed, on account of their
superior lustre, some sort of divinity. Hence it was, that they worshipped the
sun as God, called the moon the queen of heaven, and also paid adoration to the
stars. The people, then, did not only sin in worshipping Baal, but were also
addicted to many superstitions, as we see to be the case whenever men degenerate
from the genuine doctrine of true religion; they then seek out various
inventions on all sides, so that they observe no limits and keep within no
boundaries.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>worshipped</i></font><font face="Palatino">
the stars on their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>roofs</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
It is probable that they chose this higher place, as interpreters remind us,
because they thought that they were more seen by the stars the nearer they were
to them. For as men are gross in their ideas they never think God propitious to
them except he exhibits some proof or sign of a bodily presence; in short, they
always seek God according to their own earthly notions. Since, then, the Jews
thought that there were so many Gods as there are stars in heaven, it is no
wonder that they ascended to the roofs of their houses, that they might be, as
it were, in the sight of their gods, and thus not lose their labor; for the
superstitious never think that their devotion is observed by God, unless they
have before their eyes, as we have just said, some sign of his
presence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see how this verse stands connected with
the last. God declares that he would punish all idolaters; but as the Jews
worshipped Baal, the Prophet first condemned that strange religion; and now he
adds other devices, to which the Jews perversely devoted themselves; for they
worshipped also all the stars, ascribing to them some sort of divinity. Then he
mentions all those who
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>worshipped</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>swore</i></font><font face="Palatino">
by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their own
king</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and swore by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By these last words the Prophet intimates, that the
Jews had not so repudiated the law of God but that they boasted that they still
worshipped the God who had adopted them, and by whom they had been redeemed, who
had commanded the temple to be built for him, and an altar on mount Sion. They
then did not openly reject the worship of the true God, but formed such a
mixture for themselves, that they joined to the true God their own idols, as we
see to be the state of things at this day under the Papacy. It seems a
sufficient excuse to foolish men that they retain the name of God; and they
confidently boast that the true God is worshipped by them; and yet we see that
they mix together with this worship many of the delusions of Satan; for under
the Papacy there is no end to their inventions. When any devise some peculiar
mode of worship, it is then connected with the rest; and thus they form such a
mixture, that from one God, divided into many parts, they bring forth a vast
troop of deities. As then at this day the Papists worship God and idols too, so
Zephaniah had to condemn the same wickedness among the Jews.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We here learn that God&#8217;s name was not then
wholly obliterated, as though the world had openly fallen away from God; for
though they worshipped Jupiter, Mercury, Apollo, and other fictitious gods, they
yet professed to worship the only true and eternal God, the Creator of heaven
and earth. What then was it that the Prophet condemned that they were not
content with what the law simply and plainly prescribed, but that they devised
for themselves various and strange modes of worship; for when men take to
themselves such a liberty as this, they no longer worship the true God, how much
soever they may pretend to do so, inasmuch as God repudiates all spurious modes
of worship, as he testifies especially in Ezekiel 20 &#8212; Go ye, he says,
worship your idols. He shows that all kinds of worship are abominable to him
whenever men depart in any measure from his pure word. For we must hold this as
the main principle &#8212; that obedience is more valued by God than all
sacrifices. Whenever men run after their own inventions they depart from the
true God; for they refuse to render to him what he principally requires, even
obedience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But our Prophet speaks according to the common
notions of men; for they pretended to be the true worshipers of God, while they
still adhered to their own inventions. They did not, indeed, properly speaking,
worship the true God; but as they thought, and openly professed to do this,
Zephaniah, making this concession, says &#8212; God will not suffer his own
worship to be thus profaned: ye seek to blend it with that of your idols; this
he will not endure. Ye worship the true God, and ye worship your idols; but he
would have himself to be worshipped alone; and this he deserves. But the
partition which ye make is nothing else than the mangling of true worship; and
God will not have himself to be thus in part worshipped. We now understand what
the Prophet means here; for the Jews covered their abominations with the pretext
that their purpose was to worship the God of Abraham: the Prophet does not
simply deny this to be done by them, but declares that this worship was useless
and disapproved by God; nay, he proceeds farther, and says that this worship,
made up of various inventions, was an abominable corruption which God would
punish; for he can by no means bear that there should be such an alliance
&#8212; that idols should be substituted in his place, and that a part of his
glory should be transferred to the inventions of men. This is the true
meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence learn how greatly deceived the Papists are,
who think it enough, provided they depart not wholly from the worship of the
only true God; for God allows and approves of no worship except when we attend
to his voice, and turn not aside either to the left hand or to the right, but
acquiesce only in what he has prescribed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is nothing strange that he connects swearing with
worship, for it is a kind of divine worship. Hence the Scripture, stating a part
for the whole, often mentions swearing in this sense, as including the service
due to God. But the Prophet pronounces here generally a curse on all the
superstitious, who worshipped fictitious gods; and then he adds one kind of
worship, and that is swearing. I shall not here speak at large, nor is it
&#8212; necessary, on the subject of swearing. We know that the use of an oath
is lawful when God is appealed to as a witness and a judge, on important
occasions; for God&#8217;s name may be interposed when a matter requires proof,
and when it is important; but God&#8217;s name is not to be introduced
thoughtlessly. Hence two things are especially required in an oath &#8212; that
all who swear by his name should present themselves with reverence before his
tribunal, and acknowledge him to be the avenger if they take his name falsely or
inconsiderately This is one thing. Then the matter itself, on account of which
we swear, must be considered; for if men allow themselves to swear by
God&#8217;s name respecting things which are trifling and frivolous, it is a
shameful profanation, and by no means to be borne. For it is a singular favor on
the part of God, that he allows us to take his name when there is any
controversy among us, and when a confirmation is necessary. As then we thus
receive through kindness the name of God, it is surely a great favor; for how
great is the sanctity of that name, though it serves even earthly concerns? God
then does so far accommodate himself to us, that it is lawful for us to swear by
his name. Hence a greater seriousness ought to be observed by us in oaths, so
that no one should dare to interpose an oath except when necessity requires; and
we should also especially take heed lest God be called a witness to what is
false. For how great a sacrilege it is to cover a falsehood with his name, who
is the eternal and immutable truth! They then who swear falsely by his name
change God, as far as they can, into what he is not. We now sufficiently
understand how swearing is a kind of divine worship, because his honor is
thereby given to God; for his majesty is, as it were, brought before us, and as
it is his peculiar office to know and to discover hidden things, and also to
maintain the truth, this his own work is ascribed to him. Now when any one
swears by a mortal, or by the sun, or by the moon, or by creatures, he deprives
God in part of his own honor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that in superstitious oaths there was a
clear proof of idolatry. This is the reason why the Prophet here condemns those
who did </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>swear by Jehovah and by
Malkom</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, who joined their idols with
the true and eternal God when they swore. For it is a clear precept of
God&#8217;s law, &#8216;By the name of thy God shalt thou swear.&#8217;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;050613&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
6:13. And when the Prophets speak of the renovation of the Church, they use this
form &#8212; &#8216;Ye shall swear by the name of God;&#8217; &#8216;To me shall
bend every knee;&#8217; &#8216;Every tongue shall swear to me.&#8217; What does
all this mean? The whole world shall acknowledge me as the true God; and as
every knee shall bow to me, so every one will submit himself to my judgment. We
may hence doubtlessly conclude, that God is deprived of his right, whenever we
swear by the sun, or by the moon, or by the dead, or by any
creatures.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This evil has been common in all ages; and it
prevails still at this day under the Papacy. They swear by the Virgin, by
angels, and by the dead. They do not think that they thus take away anything
from the sovereignty of the only true God; but we see what he declares
respecting them. The Papists therefore foolishly excuse themselves, when they
swear by their saints: for they cannot elude the charge of sacrilege, which the
Holy Spirit has stamped with perpetual infamy, since he has said, that all those
are abominable in the sight of God who swear by any other name than his own: and
the reason is evident, for the sun, moon, and stars, and also dead or living
men, are honored with the name of God, when they are set up as judges. For they
who swear by the sun, do the same as though they said &#8212; The sun is my
witness and judge; that is, The sun is my God. They who swear by the name of a
king, or as profane men swore formerly, By the genius of their king, ascribe to
a mortal what is peculiar to the true God alone. But when any one swears by
heaven or the temple, and does not think that there is any divinity in the
heavens or in the temple, it is the same as though he swore by God himself, as
it appears from
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402320&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
23:20-22; and Christ, when he forbade us to swear by heaven or by the earth, did
not condemn such modes of swearing as inconsistent with his word, but as only
useless and vain. At the same time he showed that God&#8217;s name is profaned
by such expressions: &#8216;They who swear by heaven, swear also by him who
inhabits heaven; they who swear by the temple, swear also by him who is
worshipped in the temple, and to whom sacrifices are offered.&#8217; When one
swears by his head or by his life, it is a protestation, as though he said
&#8212; As my life is dear to me. But they who swear by the saints, either
living or dead, ascribe to mortals what is due to God. They who swear by the
sun, place a dead created thing on the throne of God himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the term
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;klm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>melkom</i>, it may be properly rendered, their king; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;lm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>melak</i>, as it is well known, means a king; but it is here put in
construction,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;klm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>melkom</i>, their king; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they
swear by their own, king</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk3</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
Prophet, I doubt not, alludes to the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;lwm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Molok</i>, which is derived from the verb, to reign: for though that word was
commonly used by all as a proper name, it is yet certain that that false god was
so called, as though he was a king: and the Prophet increases the indignity by
saying &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They swear by
Malkom</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He might have simply said, They swear
by Moloch; but he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
swear by Malkom</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, They forget that I am
their king, and transfer my sovereignty to a dead and empty image. God then does
here, by an implied contrast, exaggerate the sin of the Jews, as they sought
another king for themselves, when they knew that under his protection they
always enjoyed a sure and real safety. Let us now proceed

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet seems here to include, as it were, in
one bundle, the proud despisers of God, as well as those idolaters of whom he
had spoken. It may yet be, that he describes the same persons in different
words, and that he means that they were addicted to their own superstitions,
because they were unwilling to serve God sincerely and from the heart, and even
shunned everything that might lead their attention to true religion. And this
view I mostly approve; for what some imagine, that their gross contempt of God
is here pointed out, is not sufficiently supported. I therefore rather think
that the idolaters are here reproved, that they might not suppose that they
could by subterfuges wash away their guilt; for they were wont to cover
themselves with the shield of ignorance, when they were overcome, and their
impiety was fully proved: I did not think so; but, on the contrary, my purpose
was to worship God. Since, then, the superstitious are wont to hide themselves
under the covering of ignorance, the Prophet here defines the idolatry of the
people, and briefly shows that it was connected with obstinacy and
wickedness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They did
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not seek
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">; but, on the contrary, they turned
willfully away from him, and sought, as it were designedly, to extinguish true
religion. Nor was it to be wondered at, that so grievous and severe a sentence
was pronounced on them; for they had been taught by the law how God was to be
served. How was it, then, that errors so gross had crept in? Doubtless, God had
kindled the light of celestial truth, which clearly showed the way of true
religion; but as men ever seek to perform some frivolous trifles, the Israelites
and the Jews, when they felt ashamed openly and manifestly to reject the true
God, labored at the same time to add many ceremonies, that their impiety might
be thus concealed. This is the reason why the Prophet says that they turned
back; that is, that they could not be excused on the ground of ignorance, but
that they were perfidious and apostates, who had preferred their own idols to
the true God; though they knew that he could not be rightly worshipped, but
according to the rule prescribed in the law, they yet neglected this, and heaped
together many superstitions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And, doubtless, we shall find that the fountain of
all false worship is this &#8212; that men are unwilling truly and from the
heart to serve God; and, at the same time, they wish to retain some appearance
of religion. For there is nothing omitted in the law that is needful for the
perfect worship of God: but as God requires in the law a spiritual worship,
hence it is that men seek hiding-places, and devise for themselves many
ceremonies, that they may turn back from God, and yet pretend that they come to
him. While they sedulously labor in their own ceremonies, it is indeed true that
the worship of God and religion are continually on their lips: but, as I have
said, it is all hypocrisy and deception; for they accumulate ceremonies, that
there might be something intervening between God and them. It is not, therefore,
without reason that the Prophet here accuses the Jews that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>turned back from Jehovah, and
that they sought him not</i></font><font face="Palatino">. How so? For there was
no need of a long, or of a difficult, or of a perplexed enquiry; for the Lord
had freely offered himself to them. How, then, was it that they were blind in
the midst of light, except that they knowingly and willfully followed their own
inventions?  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk4</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The same is the case at this day with the Papists:
for though they may glamour a hundred times that they seek to worship God, it is
quite evident that they willfully go astray; inasmuch as they so delight
themselves with their own inventions, that they do not purely and from the heart
devote and consecrate themselves to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, see that this verse was added, as an
explanation, by the Prophet, that he might deprive the Jews of their false plea
of ignorance, and show that they sinned willfully; for they would have been
sufficiently taught by the law, had they not adopted their own inventions, which
dazzled their eyes and all their senses. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet confirms here what he has previously
taught, when he bids all </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to be
silent before God</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for this mode of speaking is
the same as though he had said, that he did not terrify the Jews in vain, but
seriously set before them God&#8217;s judgment, which they would find by
experience to be even more than terrible. He also records some of their sins,
that the Jews might know that he did not threaten them for nothing, but that
there were just causes why God declared that he would punish them. This is the
substance of the whole.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us first see what the Prophet means by the word,
silence. Something has been said of this on the second chapter of Habakkuk. We
said then that by silence is meant submission; and to make the thing more clear,
we said that we were to notice the contrast between the silence to which men
calmly submit, and the contumacy, which is ever clamorous: for when men seek to
be wise of themselves, and acquiesce not in God&#8217;s word, it is then said,
that they are not silent, for they refuse to give a hearing to his word; and
when men give loose reins to their own will, they observe no bounds. Until God
then obtains authority in the world, all places are full of clamor, and the
whole life of men is in a state of confusion, for they run to and fro in their
wanderings; and there is no restraint where God is not heard. It is for the same
reason that the Prophet now demands silence: but the expression is accommodated
to the subject which he handles. To be silent at the presence of God, it is
true, is to submit to God&#8217;s authority; but the connection is to be
considered; for Zephaniah saw then that God&#8217;s judgment was despised and
regarded as nothing; and he intimates here that God had so spoken, that the
execution was nigh at hand. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be
silent</i></font><font face="Palatino">, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that is,
Know ye, that I have not spoken merely for the purpose of terrifying you; but as
God is prepared to execute vengeance, of this he now reminds you, that if there
be any hope of repentance, ye may in time seek to return into favor with him; if
not, that ye may be without excuse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand why the Prophet bids them to
be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>silent before the Lord
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">: and the context is a confirmation of
the same view; for the reason is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because the day of Jehovah is
nigh</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For profane men ever promise to
themselves some respite, and think that they gain much by delay: the Prophet, on
the contrary, does now expose to scorn this self-security, and says, that the
day of Jehovah was nigh at hand. It is then the same thing as though he had
said, that his judgment ought to have been quickly anticipated, and even with
fear and trembling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards employs a metaphor to set forth what he
taught, &#8212; that God had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prepared a
sacrifice</i></font><font face="Palatino">, yea, that he had already
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>appointed</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>set apart his
guests</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By the word, sacrifice, the Prophet
reminded them, that the punishment of which he had spoken would be just, and
that the glory of God would thereby shine forth. We indeed know how ready the
world is to make complaints; when it is pressed by God&#8217;s hand, it
expostulates on account of too much rigor; and many in an open manner give
utterance to their blasphemies. As then they own not God&#8217;s justice in his
punishment, the Prophet calls it a sacrifice; and sacrifices, we know, are
evidences of divine worship, and he who offers a sacrifice to God, owns him to
be just. So also by this kind of speaking Zephaniah intimates that God would not
act a cruel part in cutting off the city Jerusalem and its inhabitants; for this
would be a sacrifice, according to the language often employed by the Prophets,
and especially by Isaiah, who says of Bozrah, &#8216;A sacrifice is prepared in
Bozrah,&#8217;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;233406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
34:6;) and who says also of Jerusalem itself, &#8216;Oh! Ariel! Ariel!&#8217;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;232901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
29:1. where Jerusalem itself is represented as the altar; as though he had said,
In all the streets, in the open places, there shall be altars to me; for I will
collect together great masses of men, whom I shall slay as a sacrifice to me.
For all who were not willing to render worship to God, and who did not freely
offer themselves as spiritual victims to him, were to be drawn to the slaughter,
and were at the same time called sacrifices. So the executions on the gallows,
when the wicked suffer, may be said to be sacrifices to God: for the Lord arms
the magistrate with the sword to restrain wickedness, that the wicked may not
have such liberty as to banish all equity from the world. The cities also,
which, being forcibly taken, are subject to a slaughter, and the fields, where
armies are slain, become altars, for God makes the rebellious a sacrifice,
because they refuse willingly to offer themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So also in this place the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah has prepared for himself
a sacrifice</i></font><font face="Palatino">, &#8212; Where? At Jerusalem,
through the whole city, as it has appeared from the quotation from Isaiah; for
as they had not rightly sacrificed to God on Mount Sion, but vitiated his whole
worship, God himself declares, that he would become a priest, that he might
slay, as he thought right, those beasts, who had obstinately refused his yoke:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he has prepared his
guests</i></font><font face="Palatino">. But I cannot finish
today.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as we continue
in so many ways to provoke against us thy wrath, we may patiently bear the
punishment, by which thou wouldest correct our faults, and also anticipate thy
judgment: and since thou art pleased to recall us in due time to thyself, let us
not turn deaf ears to thy counsels, but so obey and submit ourselves to thee,
that we may become partakers of that mercy, which thou offerest to us, provided
we seek to be reconciled to thee, and so proceed in thy service, that under the
government of Christ thy Son, whom thou hast appointed to be our supreme and
only king, we may so strive to be wholly devoted to thee that thou mayest be
glorified through our whole life, until we become at length partakers of that
celestial glory, which has been procured for us by the blood of thy
only-begotten Son. Amen</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE HUNDRED AND
TWENTIETH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE stated yesterday why God compares the slaughter of
the wicked to a sacrifice, &#8212; because in punishing the ungodly, he shows
himself to be the judge of the world: and this slaying is a sacrifice of sweet
odour, because it makes known this glory. And he immediately adds, that he had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prepared his
guests</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The word he uses is
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;dq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kodash</i>, which means to sanctify, but is often to be taken in a different
sense. It may be explained as meaning, that God had prepared his guests: but as
there is an express mention made of sacrifice, Zephaniah, I have no doubt,
continues the same metaphor. The meaning then is, that the Chaldeans, who were
ministers of God&#8217;s vengeance, were already not only chosen for the purpose
of executing it, but were divinely consecrated for that end: and this unwelcome
saying was uttered by the Prophet, that he might more sharply touch the feelings
of his own nation. The Jews ought indeed to have acknowledged God&#8217;s
judgment even when executed by heathens; but this they would not have done, had
they not understood, that these were, in exercising their cruelty, as it were,
the priests of God; for the royal priesthood at Jerusalem had been profaned. We
now then see why the Prophet says, that those were sanctified by the Lord who
had been invited to feed on the flesh of the chosen people, as they were wont to
eat of the remainder of their sacrifices on festal days. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk6</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Let us
now proceed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I yesterday repeated this verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall be, on the day of
the sacrifice of Jehovah, that I will then visit the princes, and the sons of
the king, and those who are clothed with strange
apparel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet shows, that he not only
threatened the common people, but also the chief leaders, so that he spared not
even the king&#8217;s sons. He attacks then here the principal men among the
people; for they were justly led to punishment in the first place, as they had
been to others the cause of their errors. We indeed know, that they who excel in
dignity give a much greater offense when they abuse their power in promoting
what is sinful. Hence it was, that God seemed often to have sent his Prophets to
them only. For though the low and the humble in the community were not exempt
from punishment, yet it was but reasonable that God should more severely punish
their leaders. Hence the Prophet now says, that God would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>visit the princes and the
king&#8217;s sons</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk7</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He did
not indeed intend here to flatter obscure men, as though God meant to overlook
them: but as the king and his counselors had more grievously sinned, the more
angry was God with them. We also know, that kings and others, who exercise
power, are not easily moved, for the splendor of their fortune blinds them; and
they think that they are in a manner exempt from laws, because they occupy a
higher station. We now then see why the Prophet speaks especially of the princes
and the king&#8217;s sons.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He also adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And those who wear foreign
apparel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk8</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some
refer this to the worshipers of Baal, or his priests; but the context does not
allow us to apply it to any but to courtiers, whose great delight was in
apparel: for what Christ says is proved by the experience of all ages to be too
true, &#8212; that they who wear soft clothing are in king&#8217;s courts.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401108&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
11:8. And it is probable, that courtiers, through a foolish affectation, often
changed their clothes; as it is the case with men who seek to appear great, they
devise daily some new way for spending money; and though they may be more
splendidly clothed than needful, yet they think it almost too sordid to wear the
same apparel for a whole month; and that their prodigality may be more evident,
they change also the forms of their dress. This affectation prevails far too
much at this day in the world. But even then in the age of the Prophet, as it
appears, the courtiers and those who had power among the people, often changed
their dress, that they might the more display their pomp and attract the
admiration of the simple and poor people. And it was not simple ambition, but it
brought with it a contempt for others; for the rich in this way upbraided the
poor, that they themselves were alone worthy of this superfluity and opulence.
It was not enough for them, that they were clothed for their own comfort, and
also that ornament and splendor were added; but they would have willingly made
bare all others: and as it was a shame to do this, they yet showed, as far as
they could, by their superfluous abundance, that they were alone worthy of such
display. It was then no wonder that the Lord threatened them with so much
severity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As this vice in course of time had greatly increased,
this passage of the Prophet deserves particular notice. And the more luxurious
men become and the more they indulge in such varieties, and thus manifest their
pride, the more carefully we ought to learn to restrain the desires of our
flesh, that they may not leap over the bounds of moderation; and let those who
abound in wealth be contented with what is modest and becoming; and let them
especially abstain from that absurd affectation, which the Prophet evidently
condemns here. It may however have been, that the Jews then sought new and
unusual fashions as to their clothes from remote countries, like the French at
this day, who delight in the Turkish habit; for they have too much intercourse
with Turkey. So also at that time a foolish desire had possessed the hearts of
the people, so as to wish to ingratiate themselves with the Chaldeans, and to
make friends of them by a likeness in dress. And we may learn this from a
passage in Ezekiel, where he compares them to harlots or to foolish lovers
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;262302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
23:2, etc.:) for as lovers paint harlots on walls, and whoremongers and
adulterers do the same; so Ezekiel accuses the Jews, that they were so inflamed
with a mad desire of making a covenant with the Chaldean nation, that they had
their images painted in their chambers. They also no doubt imitated their dress,
in order to show that they regarded it a great happiness, if they became their
friends and confederates.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows what I repeated also yesterday,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will visit every one who
danceth on the threshold</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some explain this of
the worshipers of Baal, but improperly; for as I have already said, the context
will not allow us to understand this except of the servants of princes, who
cruelly harassed the people and deprived helpless men of their property, who
were not able to resist them. The Prophet then, after having spoken of the chief
governors of the kingdom and of the king&#8217;s sons, now comes to their
servants, who, like hunting dogs, were ready to seize everywhere on the prey.
They who understand this to be said of the sacrifices of Baal, adduce a passage
from sacred history, &#8212; that since the image of Dagon had been found on the
threshold of the temple, they dared not to tread on the threshold, but leaped
over it: but this is too far-fetched. Others also bring expositions of a
different kind; but the Prophet, I have no doubt, refers here to the liberty
they took in plundering, when he says, that they danced on the threshold, as
persons triumphing; for he afterwards adds, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>filled, by rapine and fraud, the
houses </i></font><font face="Palatino">of the princes. To leap or dance then on
the threshold is no other thing than to take possession of the houses of other
people, and insolently to triumph over them, as it is usually done by
conquerors. For he who takes possession of what belongs to another, does not
quietly rest there as in his own habitation, but boasts and exults. So also
here, the Prophet paints to the life that wantonness, which the servants of
princes showed, when they entered into the houses of others. He therefore says,
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they
danced</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and said, This is my house; and who
will dare to say a word to the contrary? Since then the servants of princes took
so much liberty, the Prophet here denounces on them the vengeance of God. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk9</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds, that they filled their masters&#8217;
houses by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rapine and
fraud</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By rapine and fraud he means the prey
gathered, partly by armed force, and partly by deceit and craft; for courtiers
have their nets by which they lay in wait for helpless men. But if they cannot
obtain by fraud what they hope for, they leave recourse to armed force. However
this may be, they enrich themselves, sometimes by plundering, and sometimes by
fraud. Hence the Prophet mentions both here. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">He confirms here the same truth, and amplifies
and illustrates it by a striking description; for we know how much a lively
representation avails to touch the feelings, when the event itself is not only
narrated, but placed as it were before our eyes. So the Prophet is not content
with plain words, but presents a scene, that the future destruction of Jerusalem
might appear in a clearer light. But as I have elsewhere explained this mode of
speaking, I shall not dwell on the subject now.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, that there would be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the voice of crying from the gate
of the fishes</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He names here three places in
Jerusalem, and afterwards he adds a fourth. But as we do not understand the
situation of the city, sufficient for us is this probable conjecture, &#8212;
that he refers to parts opposite to one another; as though he had said, that no
corner of the city would be in a quiet state, when the Lord roused up war. Let
us then suppose it to be triangular, and let the gate of the fishes be one side,
and let the second gate or the school be on the other; and let the part nigh the
hills form the third side. What some say, that the hills mean palaces, I do not
approve of; nor is it consistent with the context: but we ought to bear in mind
what I have already stated, that the Prophet here denounces ruin on every part
of the city, so that the Jews would in vain seek refuges for themselves; for by
running here and there, they would find all places full of crying and howling.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall be then the voice of
crying from the gate of the fishes</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Why the
Prophet calls it the gate of the fishes we cannot for certainty say, except that
it is a probable conjecture, that either some fish-pond was near it, or that the
fish-market was nigh.</font><br></div>

Kings 22:14, where it seems, as there is mention made of priests, the word is
taken in this sense. But as gates are spoken of here, and as the Hebrews often
call whatever is second in order by this word, as the second part in buildings
and also in towns and in other places, is thus called, we may take it here in
this sense, that is, as meaning that gate which was next to the first in general
esteem. But as the subject has little to do with the main point, I dismiss it.

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet addresses the merchants here who
inhabited the middle part of the city, and hence thought themselves farther off
from all danger and trouble. As then they were concealed as it were in their
hiding-places, they thought that no danger was nigh them; and thus security
blinded them the more. After having spoken of the king&#8217;s palace and of the
princes and their servants, Zephaniah now turns his discourse to the
merchants.</font><br></div>

learn also from other parts of scripture that the word means sometimes either a
cavern or some low place. But we know that merchants have for the most part
their streets on level ground, and it is for their advantage, as they have goods
to carry. It may then have been, that at Jerusalem there was a large company of
merchants in that part of the city, which was in its situation low. But they who
regard it as a proper name, bring nothing either of reason or probability to
confirm their opinion: and it is also evident from the context that merchants
are here addressed, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for cut
off</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is the mercantile
people</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;[nk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>canon</i>, means a merchant. Some think that the Jews are here, as often
elsewhere, called Canaan, because they were become degenerate, and more like the
Canaanites than the holy fathers, from whom they descended. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk12</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But the
Prophet speaks here no doubt of merchants, for an explanation immediately
follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all who are laden with
money</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And he says that merchants were laden
with money, because they would not transact business without making payments and
counting money, and also, because merchants for the most part engrossed by their
gainful arts a great portion of the wealth of the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand what the Prophet means: He
threatens howling to the merchants, who were concealed in their hidden places,
for they occupied that part of the city, as I have already said, which was below
the hills; and he then makes use of the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;[nk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>canon</i>, a trafficker; and lastly he speaks of their wealth, as it is
probable that they became rich through frauds and most dishonest means, and
shows that their money would be useless to them, for they would find in it no
defense, when the Lord extended his hand to punish them. It now follows

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet addresses here generally the
despisers of God, who were become hardened in their wickedness. But before he
openly names them, he says that the visitation would be such, that God would
search every corner, so that no place would remain unexplored. For to visit with
candles, or to search with candles, is so to examine all hidden places or
coverts, that nothing may escape. When one intends to plunder a city, he first
enters into the houses, and takes away whatever he finds; but when he thinks
that there are some hidden treasures, he descends into the secret cells; and
then if there be no light there, he lights a candle, and carefully looks here
and there, that he may not overlook anything. By this comparison then God
intimates, that Jerusalem would be so plundered, that nothing whatever would
remain. Hence he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
search it with candles</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We indeed know that
nothing is hid from God; but it is evident, that he is constrained to borrow
comparisons from the common practice of men, because he could not otherwise
express what is necessary for us to know. The world indeed deal with God as men
do with one another; for they think that he can be deceived by their craftiness.
He therefore laughs to scorn this folly, and says, that he would have candles to
search out whatever was concealed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, as impiety had possessed the minds of almost all
the people, he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will visit
the men, who on their lees are congealed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This
may indeed be only understood of the rich, who flattered themselves in their
prosperity, and feared nothing, and were thus congealed on their lees: but
Zephaniah shows in the words which follow, that he had in view something more
atrocious, that is, that they said that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>neither good nor evil proceeded
from God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. At the same time, these two things
may be suitably joined together &#8212; that he reproves here their
self-security, produced by wealth &#8212; and that he also accuses the careless
Jews of that gross contempt of God which is afterwards mentioned. And I am
disposed to take this view, that is, that the Jews, inebriated with prosperity,
became hardened, as men contract hardness often by labor &#8212; and that they
so collected lees through too much quietness and abundance of things, that they
became wholly stupid, and could be touched by no truth made known to them. Hence
in the first place the Prophet says, that God would visit with punishment a
carelessness so extreme, when men not only slumbered in their prosperity, but
also became congealed in their own stupidity, so as to be almost void of sense
and understanding. When one addresses a dead mass, he can effect nothing: and so
the Prophet compares careless men to a dead and congealed mass; for stupidity
had so bound up all their senses, that they could not be either allured by the
goodness of God, or terrified by his threatenings. Congealing then is nothing
else but that hardness or contumacy, which is contracted by self-indulgences,
and particularly when the minds of men become almost stupefied. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk13</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lees</i></font><font face="Palatino">
he means sinful indulgences, which so infatuate all the senses of men, that no
light nor sincerity remains.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then mentions what they said in their hearts. He
expresses here what that carelessness which he condemned brings with it &#8212;
even that wicked men fearlessly mock God. What it is to speak in the heart, is
evident from many parts of Scripture; it means to determine anything within: for
though the ungodly do not openly proclaim what they determine in their minds,
they yet reason within themselves, and settle this point &#8212; that either
there is no God, or that he rests idly in heaven. &#8216;Said has the ungodly in
his heart, No God is.&#8217; Why in the heart? Because shame or fear prevents
men from openly avowing their impiety; yet they cherish such thoughts in the
heart and assent to them. Now here is described by the Prophet the height of
impiety, when he says, that men drunk with pleasures robbed God of his office as
a judge, saying, that he does neither good nor evil. And it is probable that
there were then many at Jerusalem and throughout Judea who thus insolently
despised God as a judge. But Zephaniah especially speaks of the chief men; for
such above all others deride God, as the giants did, and look down as from on
high on his judgments. There is indeed much insensibility among the common
people; but there is more madness in the pride of great men, who, trusting in
their power, think themselves exempt from the authority of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what I have just said must be borne in mind, that
an unhealable impiety is described by the Prophet, when he accuses the Jews,
that they did not think God to be the author either of good or of evil; because
God is thus deprived of his dignity; for except he is owned as the judge of the
world, what becomes of his dignity? The majesty, or the authority, or the glory
of God does not consist in some imaginary brightness, but in those works which
so necessarily belong to him, that they cannot be separated from his very
essence. It is what peculiarly belongs to God, to govern the world, and to
exercise care over mankind, and also to make a difference between good and evil,
to help the miserable, to punish all wickedness, to check injustice and
violence. When any one takes away these things from God, he leaves him an idol
only. Since, then, the glory of God consists in his justice, wisdom, judgment,
power, and other attributes, all who deny God to be the governor of the world
entirely extinguish, as much as they can, his glory. Even so do heathen writers
accuse Epicures; for as he dared not to deny the existence of some god, like
Diagoras and some others, he confessed that there are some gods, but shut them
up in heaven, that they might enjoy there their leisure and delights. But this
is to imagine a god, who is not a god. It is then no wonder that the Prophet
condemns with so much sharpness the stupidity of the Jews, as they thought that
neither good nor evil proceeded from God. But there was also a greater reason
why God should be so indignant at such senselessness: for whence was it that men
entertained such an opinion or such a delirious thought, as to deny that God did
either good or evil, except that they attempted to drive God far away from them,
that they might not be subject to his judgment. They therefore who seek to
extinguish the distinction between right and wrong in their consciences, invent
for themselves the delirious notion, that God concerns not himself with human
affairs, that he is contented with his own celestial felicity, and descends not
to us, and that adversity as well as prosperity happens to men by
chance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see how men seek willfully and designedly to
indulge the notion, that neither good nor evil comes from God: they do this,
that they may stupefy their own consciences, and thus precipitate themselves
with greater liberty into sin, as though they were free to do anything with
impunity, and as though there was no judge to whom an account is to be
rendered.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And hence I have said, that it is the very summit of
impiety when men strengthen themselves in this error, that God rests in heaven,
and that whatever miseries they endure in this world happen through fortunes and
that whatever good things they have are to be ascribed either to their own
industry or to chance. And so the Prophet briefly shows in this passage that the
Jews were past recovery, that no one might feel surprised, that God should
punish with so much severity a people who had been his friends, and whom he had
adopted in preference to the whole world: for he had set apart the race of
Abraham, as it is well known, as his chosen and holy people. God&#8217;s
vengeance on the children of Abraham might have appeared cruel or extremely
rigid, had it not been expressly declared that they had advanced so far in
impiety as to seek to exclude God from the government of the world, and to
deprive him of his own peculiar office, even that of punishing sin, of defending
his own people, of delivering them from all evils, of relieving all their
miseries. Since, then, they thus shut up God in heaven, and gave the governing
power on earth to fortune, it was an intolerable stupidity, nay, wholly
diabolical. It was therefore no wonder that God was so severely indignant, and
stretched forth his hand to punish their sin, as their disease had become now
incurable.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as almost the
whole world breaks out into such excesses, that there is no moderation, no
reason, &#8212; O grant, that we may learn not only to confine ourselves within
those limits which thou dost approve and command, but also to delight and glory
in the smallness of our portion, inasmuch as the wealth, and honors, and
pleasures of the world so fascinate the hearts and minds of all, that they
elevate themselves into heaven, and carry on war, as it were, avowedly with
thee. Grant also to us, that in our limited portion we may be in such a way
humbled under thy powerful hand, as never to doubt but that thou wilt be our
deliverer even in our greatest miseries; and that ascribing to thee the power
over life and death, we may feel fully assured, that whatever afflictions happen
to us, proceed from thy just judgment, so that we may be led to repentance, and
daily exercise ourselves in it, until we shall at length come to that blessed
rest which is laid up for us in heaven, through Christ our Lord.

God, after long forbearance, would punish his rebellious and obstinate people.
Hence he says, that they were now delivered, even by God himself, into the hands
of their enemies. They indeed knew that many were inimical to them; but they did
not consider God&#8217;s judgment, as God himself elsewhere complains &#8212;

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet in this verse expresses more clearly
what I have already stated &#8212; That God would be the author of all the evils
which would happen to the Jews; for as they grew more insensible in their sins,
they more and more provoked God&#8217;s wrath against themselves. It is
therefore no common wisdom to consider God&#8217;s hand when he strikes or
chastens us. This is the reason why the Prophet now calls the attention of the
Jews to God, that they might not fix their minds, as it is commonly done, on men
only. At the same time, he tries to shake off their torpor by declaring that the
day would be terrible, and that it was also now near at hand. We indeed know
that hypocrites trifle with God, except they feel the weight of his wrath, and
that they protract time, and promise themselves so long a respite, that they
never awake to repentance. Hence the Prophet in the first place shows, that
whatever evils then impended over the Jews were not only from men, but
especially from God. This is one thing; and then, in order thoroughly to touch
stupid hearts, he says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
day would be terrible</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and lastly, that they
might not deceive themselves by vain flatteries, he declares that the day was at
hand. These three things must be noticed in order that we understand the
Prophet&#8217;s object.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says at the beginning of the verse, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the great day of Jehovah was
nigh</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In these words he includes the three
things to which I have already referred. By calling it the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>day of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he means, that whatever evils the Jews
suffered, ought to have been ascribed to his judgment; and by calling it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the great
day</i></font><font face="Palatino">, his object was to strike terror; as well
as by saying, in the third place, that it was nigh. We hence see that three
things are included in these words. But the Prophet more fully explains what
might, on account of the brevity of his words, have seemed not quite
clear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Near, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is the day, and quickly
hastens</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Men, we know, are wont to extend time,
that they may cherish their sins; for though they cannot divest themselves of
every feeling as to religion, or shake it off, they yet imagine for themselves a
long distance between them and God; and by such an imagination they find ease
for themselves. Hence the Prophet declares
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"> to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nigh</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
and as it was hardly credible that the destruction of which he spake was near,
he adds, that the day was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>quickly
hastening</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as though he had said, that they
ought not to judge by the present state of things what God would do, for in a
moment his wrath would pass through from east to west like lightning. Men need
long preparation when they determine to execute their vengeance; but God has no
need of much preparation, for his own power is sufficient for him when he
resolves to destroy the wicked. We now, then, see why it was added by the
Prophet, that the day would quickly hasten.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now repeats that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>day of Jehovah
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his voice would cry out
bitterly</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I have stated three renderings as
given by interpreters. Some read thus &#8212; The day of Jehovah shall be
bitter; there the strong shall cry aloud. This meaning is admissible, and a
useful instruction may from it be elicited; as though the Prophet had said, that
no courage could bring help to men, or be an aid to them, against God&#8217;s
vengeance. Others give this rendering, that the day would bitterly cry out, for
there would be the strong, that is, the strength of enemies would break down
whatever courage the Jews might have. But this second meaning seems forced; and
I am disposed to adopt the third &#8212; that the voice of the day of Jehovah
would bitterly cry out. And he means the voice of those who would have really to
know God as a judge, whom they had previously despised; for God would then put
forth his power, which had been an object of contempt, until the Jews had by
experience felt it. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk14</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the Prophet&#8217;s design, there is no
ambiguity: for he seeks here to rouse the Jews from their insensibility, who had
so hardened themselves against all threatening, that the Prophets were not able
to convince them. Since, then, they had thus hardened themselves against every
instruction and all warnings, the Prophet here says, that the voice of
God&#8217;s day would be different: for God&#8217;s voice had sounded through
the mouth of the Prophets, but it availed not with the deaf. An awful change is
here announced; for the Jews shall then cry aloud, as the roaring of the divine
voice shall then terrify them, when God shall really show that he is the avenger
of wickedness &#8212; When therefore he shall ascend his tribunal, then ye shall
cry. His messengers now cry to you in vain, for ye close up your ears; ye shall
cry in your turn, but it will be in vain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But if one prefers to take it as one sentence, The
voice of the day of Jehovah, there strong, shall bitterly cry out, the meaning
will be the same as to the main point. I would not, therefore, contend about
words, provided we bear in mind what I have already said &#8212; that Zephaniah
sets here the cry of the distressed people in opposition to the voices of the
Prophets, which they had despised, yea, and for the most part, as it appears
from other places, treated with ridicule. However this may have been, he
indirectly condemns their false confidence, when he speaks of the strong; as
though he had said, that they were strong only for their own ruin, while they
opposed God and his servants; for this strength falls at length, nay, it breaks
itself by its own weight, when God rises to judgment. It follows

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shows here how foolish they were who
extenuated God&#8217;s vengeance, as hypocrites and all wicked men are wont to
do. Hence he accuses the Jews of madness, that they thought that the way of
reconciliation would be easy to them, when they had by their perverseness
provoked God to come against them as an armed enemy. For though the ungodly do
not promise to themselves anything of God&#8217;s favor, yet they entertain vain
imaginations, as though he might with no trouble be pacified: they do not think
that he will be propitious to them, and yet in the meantime they deride his
vengeance. Against this kind of senselessness the Prophet now inveighs. We have
stated in other places, that these kinds of figurative expressions were intended
solely for this end &#8212; to constrain men to entertain some fear, for they
willfully deluded themselves: for the Prophets had to do, partly with open
despisers of God, and partly with his masked worshipers, whose holiness was
hypocrisy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This, then, was the reason why he said, that that day
would be a day of wrath, and also a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>day of distress and of
affliction,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk15</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
of tumult and desolation,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk16</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
of darkness and of thick darkness, of clouds and of
mist</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In short, he intended to remove from the
Jews that confidence with which they flattered themselves, yea, the confidence
which they derived from their contempt of God: for the flesh is secure, while it
has coverts, where it may withdraw itself from the presence of God. True
confidence cannot exceed moderation, that is, the confidence that is founded on
God&#8217;s word, for thus men come nigh to God: but the flesh wishes for no
other rest but in the forgetfulness of God. And we have already seen in the
Prophet Amos,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;300518&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos
5:18,) why the day of Jehovah is painted as being so dreadful; he had, as I have
said, to contend with hypocrites, who made an improper use of God&#8217;s name,
and at the same time slumbered in gross insensibility. Hence Amos said, It will
be a day, not of light, but of darkness; not of joy, but of sorrow. Why then do
ye anxiously expect the day of the Lord? For the Jews, glorying in being the
chosen people of God, and trusting only in their false title of adoption,
thought that everything was lawful for them, as though God had renounced his own
authority. And thus hypocrites ever flatter themselves, as though they held God
bound to them. Our Prophet does not, as Amos, distinctly express these
sentiments, yet the meaning of the words is the same, and that is, that when God
ascends his tribunal, there is no hope for pardon. He at the same time cuts off
from them all their vain confidences; for though God excludes all escapes, yet
hypocrites look here and there, before and behind, to the right hand and to the
left.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet therefore intimates, that there would be
everywhere darkness and thick darkness, clouds and mists, affliction and
distress, &#8212; Why? because it would be the day of wrath; for God, after
having borne patiently a long time with the Jews, and seen that they perversely
abused his patience, would at length put forth his power. And that they might
not set up their own strongholds against God, he says, that war was proclaimed
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>against the fortified cities and
high citadels</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We hence see that he deprives
the Jews of all help, in order that they might understand that they were to
perish, except they repented, and thus return into favor with God.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It shall then be a day of the
trumpet and of shouting</i></font><font face="Palatino">,

How? </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on all fortified
cities</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For the Jews, as it is usually done,
compared the strength of their enemies with their own. It was not their purpose
to go forth beyond their own borders: and they thought that they would be able
to resist, and be sufficiently fortified, if any foreign enemy invaded them. The
Prophet laughs to scorn this notion, for God had declared war against their
fortified cities. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">He confirms what I have already stated &#8212;
that though other enemies, the Assyrians or Chaldeans, attacked the Jews, yet
God would be the principal leader of the war. God then claims here for himself
what the Jews transferred to their earthly enemies: and the Prophet has already
often called it the day of Jehovah; for God would then make known his power,
which had been a sport to them. He therefore declares in this place, that he
would </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reduce man to
distress</i></font><font face="Palatino">, so that the whole nation would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>walk like the blind &#8212;

and fall, and not be able to proceed in their course: for they are said to go
astray like the blind, who see no end to their evils, who find no means to
escape ruin, but are held as it were fast bound. And we must ever bear in mind
what I have already said &#8212; that the Jews were inflated with such pride,
that they heedlessly despised all the Prophets. Since then they were thus wise
in themselves, God denounces blindness on them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He subjoins the reason,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because they had acted impiously

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk18</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By
these words he confirms what I have already explained &#8212; that the
intermediate causes are not to be considered, though the Chaldeans took
vengeance on the Jews; for there is a higher principle, and another cause of
this evil, even the contempt of God and of his celestial truth; for they had
acted impiously towards God. And by these words the Prophet reminds the Jews,
that no alleviation was to be expected, as they had not only men hostile to
them, but God himself, whom they had extremely provoked.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Poured forth shall be your blood

their preeminence; and God had certainly given them occasion to boast, had they
made a right and legitimate use of his benefits; but as they had despised him,
they deserved in their turn to be exposed to every ignominy and reproach. Hence
the Prophet here lays prostrate all their false boastings by which they were
inflated; for they wished to be honorable, while God was despised by them. At
last he adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">He repeats what he has already said &#8212; that
the helps which the Jews hoped would be in readiness to prevent God&#8217;s
vengeance would be vain. For though men dare not openly to resist God, yet they
hope by some winding courses to find out some way by which they may avert his
judgment. As then the Jews, trusting in their wealth, and in their fortified
cities, became insolent towards God, the Prophet here declares, that neither
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gold nor
silver</i></font><font face="Palatino"> should be a help to them. Let them, he
says, accumulate wealth; though by the mass of their gold and silver they form
high mountains for themselves, yet they shall not be able to turn aside the hand
of God, nor be able to deliver themselves, &#8212; and why? He repeats again the
same thing, that it would be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
day of wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We indeed know, that the most
savage enemies are sometimes pacified by money, for avarice mitigates their
cruelty; but the Prophet declares here, that as God would be the ruler in that
war, there would be no redemption, and therefore money would be useless: for God
could by no means receive them into favor, except they repented and truly
humbled themselves before him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore adds, that the land would be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>devoured by the fire of
God&#8217;s jealousy</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or indignation. He
compares God&#8217;s wrath to fire; for no agreement can be made when fire
rages, but the more materials there are the more will there be to increase the
fire. So then the Prophet excludes the Jews from any hope of deliverance, except
they reconciled themselves to God by true and sincere repentance;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for a
consummation</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,

short, he means, that as the Jews had hardened themselves against every
instruction, they would find God&#8217;s vengeance to be such as would wholly
consume them, as they would not anticipate it, but on the contrary enhance it by
their pride and stupidity, and even deride it. Now follows

<div><br><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet, after having spoken of God&#8217;s
wrath, and shown how terrible it would be, and also how near, now exhorts the
Jews to repentance, and thus mitigates the severity of his former doctrine,
provided their minds were teachable. We hence learn that God fulminates in his
word against men, that he may withhold his hand from them. The more severe,
then, God is, when he chastises us and makes known our sins, and sets before us
his wrath, the more clearly he testifies how precious and dear to him is our
salvation; for when he sees us rushing headlong, as it were, into ruin, he calls
us back by threatening and chastisements. Whenever, then, God condemns us by his
word, let us know that he will be propitious to us, if, touched with true
repentance, we flee to his mercy; for to effect this is the design of all his
reproofs and threatening.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There follows then a seasonable exhortation, after
the Prophet had spoken of the dreadfulness of God&#8217;s vengeance.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Gather
yourselves</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gather, ye nation not worthy of
being loved</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Others read &#8212; Search among
yourselves, search; and interpreters differ as to the root of the verb; some
derive it from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;&ccedil;q</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>koshesh</i>, and others from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;wq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kush</i>; while some deduce the verb from the noun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;q</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>kosh</i>, which signifies chaff or stubble. But however this may be, I
consider the real meaning of the Prophet to be &#8212; Gather yourselves,
gather; for this is what grammatical construction requires. I do not see why
they who read search yourselves, depart from the commonly received meaning,
except they think that the verb gather does not suit the context; but it suits
it exceedingly well. Others with more refinement read thus &#8212; Gather the
chaff, gather the chaff, as though the Prophet ridiculed the empty confidence of
the people. But as I have already said, he no doubt shows here the remedy, by
which they might have anticipated God&#8217;s judgment, with which he had
threatened them. He indeed compares them to stubble, as we find in the next
verse, but he shows that still time is given them to repent, so that they might
gather themselves, and not be dissipated; as though he said &#8212; The day of
your scattering is at hand; ye shall then vanish away like chaff, for ye shall
not be able to stand at the breath of the Lord&#8217;s wrath. But now while God
withholds himself, and does not put forth his hand to destroy you, gather
yourselves, that ye may not be like the chaff. There are then two parts in this
passage; the first is, that if the Jews abused, as usual, the forbearance of
God, they would become like the chaff, for God&#8217;s wrath would in a moment
scatter them; but the Prophet in the meantime reminds them that a seasonable
time for repentance was still given them; for if they willingly gathered
themselves, God would spare them.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before then the day of
Jehovah&#8217;s wrath shall come; gather, he says,
yourselves</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk22</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the way of gathering is, when men do not vanish
away in their foolish confidences, or when they do not indulge their own lusts;
for whenever men give loose reins to wicked licentiousness, and thus go astray
in gratifying their corrupt lusts, or when they seek here and there vain
confidences, they expose themselves to a scattering. Hence the Prophet exhorts
them to examine themselves, to gather themselves, and as it were to draw
themselves together, that they might not be like the chaff. Hence he says,
&#8212; gather yourselves, yea, gather,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye nation not
loved</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some take the participle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;skn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>necasaph</i>, in an active sense, as though the Prophet had said that the
Jews were void of every feeling, and had become wholly hardened in their
stupidity. But I know not whether this can be grammatically allowed. I therefore
follow what has been more approved. The nation is called not worthy of love,
because it did not deserve mercy; and God thus amplifies and renders illustrious
his own grace, because he was still solicitous about the salvation of those who
had willfully destroyed themselves, and rejected his favor. Though then the Jews
had by their depravity so alienated themselves from God, that there was no
reason why he should save them, he yet still continued to call them back to
himself. It is therefore a remarkable proof of the unfailing grace of God, when
he shows love to a nation wholly worthy of being hated, and is concerned for its
safety.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk23</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before the decree brings
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here the Prophet asserts his own
authority, and that of God&#8217;s other servants: for the Jews thought that all
threatening would come to nothing, as it is the case with most men at this day
who deride every true doctrine, as though it were nothing but an empty sound.
Hence the Prophet ascribes birth to his doctrine. It is indeed true, that the
word decree has a wider meaning; but the Prophet does not speak here of the
hidden counsel of God. He therefore calls that a decree, which God had already
declared by his servants: and the meaning is, that it is not beating the air
when God denounces his vengeance on sinners by his Prophets, but that it is a
fixed and unchangeable decree, which shall at length be effected. But the
similitude of birth is most apposite; for as the embryo lies hid in the womb,
and then emerges in due time into light; so God&#8217;s vengeance, though hid
for a time, will yet in due season be accomplished, when God sees that
men&#8217;s wickedness is past a remedy. We now understand why the Prophet says,
that the time was near when the decree should bring forth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pass away shall the chaff in a
day</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some read, Before the day comes, when the
stubble (or chaff) shall pass away. But I take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;wy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ium</i>, in another sense, as meaning that the Jews shall quickly pass away
as the chaff; the like expression we have also met in Hosea. He says then that
the Jews would perish in a day, in a short time, and as it were in a moment;
though they thought that they would not be for a long time conquered.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pass
away</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall they like
chaff</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk24</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before it comes, the fury of
Jehovah&#8217;s wrath; the day of Jehovah&#8217;s
wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino">, gather ye yourselves. He says first,
before it comes upon you, the fury of wrath, and then, the day of wrath. He
repeats the same thing; but some of the words are changed, for instead of the
fury of wrath, he puts in the second clause, the day of wrath; as though he had
said, that they were greatly deceived if they thought that they could escape,
because the Lord deferred his vengeance. How so? For the day, which was nigh,
though not yet arrived, would at length come. As when one trusting in the
darkness of the night, and thinking himself safe from the danger of being taken,
is mistaken, for suddenly the sun rises and discovers his hiding-place; so the
Prophet intimates, that though God was now still, it would yet be no advantage
to the Jews: for he knew the suitable time. Though then he restrained for a time
his wrath, he yet poured it forth suddenly, when the day came and the iniquity
of men had become
ripe.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">HERE the Prophet turns his discourse to a small
number, for he saw that he could produce no effect on the promiscuous multitude.
For had his doctrine been addressed in common to the whole people, there were
very few who would have attended. We would therefore have been discouraged had
he not believed that some seed remained among the people, and that the office of
teaching and exhorting had not been in vain committed to him by God. But he
shows at the same time that the greater part were wholly given up to

word may think that they spend their labor to no purpose, while they sing to the
deaf, as the proverb is, they ought not yet to depart from the course of their
vocation; for there will ever be some who will really show, after a long time,
that they had been divinely and wonderfully saved, so as not to perish with
others. But what the Prophet had especially in view was to show, that the
faithful ought not to regard what the multitude may do, or how they live; but
that when God invites them to repentance, and gives them a hope of pardon, they
ought without delay to come to him, that they might not perish with the rest.
And it deserves to be noticed, that when God raises his voice, some harden
others, and thus men lead one another into ruin. Thus it happens that all
teaching becomes unsuccessful. Hence the Prophet applies a remedy, by showing
how preposterous it is when some follow others; for in this way they increase
the ranks of the rebellious; but that if there be any who are meek, they ought
to be teachable, when God stretches forth his hand and shows that he will be
propitious, provided they return to the right way.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls them meek who had profited under the
scourges of God; for the Hebrews consider
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ywn[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>onuim</i>, to be the afflicted, deriving the word from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hn[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>one</i>, to afflict, or to be humble. But as men for the most part are not
subdued except by scourges, they call, by a metaphor,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ywn[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>onuim</i>, the meek, such as have been subdued: for men grow wanton in their
pleasures, and abundance commonly produces insolence; but by adversity they
learn to become meek. Hence our Prophet calls those the meek of the land who
were submissive to God, after having been chastised by him. For we know, that
though God may smite the wicked, they yet continue to have a stiff and iron neck
and a brazen front: but the faithful are tamed, as Jeremiah confesses as to
himself; for he says that he was like an untamed heifer before he was chastised
by God&#8217;s scourges. So the Prophet directs his discourse to the few who had
felt the afflicting hand of God, and had been thus humbled. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk25</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He bids them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seek
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and yet he says that they had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wrought his
judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino">. These two clauses seem inconsistent
with each other; for if they had been previously alienated from God, justly
might the Prophet bid them to return to the right way; but as they had devoted
themselves to religion, and formed their life according to the rule of
uprightness, the Prophet seems to have exhorted them without reason to seek God.
But the passage is worthy of special notice; for we hence learn that even the
best are roused by God&#8217;s scourges to seek true religion with greater ardor
than they had before done. Though then it be our object to serve God and to
follow his word, yet when calamities arise and God appears as a judge, we ought
to be stimulated to greater care and diligence; for it never is the case that
any one of us fully performs his duty. Let us then remember, that we are roused
by God whenever adversity impends over us, and when God himself shows by
manifest signs that he is displeased. This is the reason why the Prophet bids
the pious doers of righteousness to seek God, however much they were before
devoted to what was just and upright.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There was also another reason: we know how grievously
faith is tried, when the good and wicked are indiscriminately and without any
difference chastised by God&#8217;s hand; for the godly are then tempted to
think that it avails them nothing that they have labored sincerely to serve God;
they think that this has all been in vain and to no purpose, for they are
brought into the same miseries with others. As then this temptation is enough to
shake even the strongest, the Prophet here exhorts the faithful to persevere, as
though he had said, that in the first confusion no difference would be found
between the good and the wicked as to their circumstances, for God would afflict
both alike, but that the end would be different; and that there was therefore no
reason for them to despond or to think it of no advantage to seek God: for he
would at length really show that he approved of their integrity; as though he
had said, God will not remunerate you at the first moment; but your patience
will at length find that he is a just judge, who has regard for his people, and
delivers them in their extremity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To do the judgment of God in this place is to form
the life according to the righteousness of the law. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fp&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>meshepheth</i>, has various meanings in Scripture. Sometimes, and indeed
often, it designates the punishment which God allots to the wicked: but it
frequently means equity or the rule of right living. Hence to do judgment is to
observe what is righteous and just, to abstain from what is wrong and injurious.
But the Prophet calls it the judgment of God, because it is what he prescribes
in his word and what he approves. For we know that men blend various things, by
which they would prove themselves to be just and righteous: but they deceive
themselves, except they form their life especially according to what God
requires. We now perceive what the Prophet means; and he afterwards defines what
it is to seek God; for the latter part of the verse is added as an explanation,
that the faithful might understand how God is to be sought.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For hypocrites, as soon as God invites them,
accumulate many rites, and weary themselves much in things of no value. In
short, they think that they have sufficiently sought God when they have
performed a number of ceremonies. But by over-acting they trifle as it were with
God, and thus deceive themselves. Thus we see repentance profaned. They under
the Papacy prattle enough about repentance, but when they are asked to define
it, they begin with contrition; and yet no displeasure at sin is mentioned by
them, nor any real love of righteousness, but they talk about attrition and
contrition, and then immediately they leap to confession; and this is the
principal part of repentance: they afterwards come to satisfactions. Thus
repentance among the Papists is nothing else but a some kind of mistaken
solicitude, by which they labor to pacify God, as though they came nigh him:
nay, the satisfactions of the Papacy are nothing else but obstructions between
God and men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This evil has been common in all ages. The Prophet,
therefore, does not without reason define what the true and rightful way of
seeking God is, and that is, when
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is sought, when
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>humility</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is sought. By righteousness he understands the same thing as by judgment; as
though he had said, Advance in a righteous and holy course of life, for God will
not forget your obedience, provided your hearts grow not faint, and ye persevere
to the end. We hence see that God complains, not only when we obtrude external
pomps and devices I know not what, as though he might like a child be amused by
us; but also when we do not sincerely devote our life to his service. And he
adds humility to righteousness; for it is difficult even for the very best of
men not to murmur against God when he severely chastises them. We indeed find
how much their own delicacy embitters the minds of men when God appears somewhat
severe with them. Hence the Prophet, in order to check all clamors, exhorts the
faithful here to cultivate humility, so that they might patiently bear the rigor
by which God would try them, and might suffer themselves to be ruled by his
hand. Peter had the same thing in view when he said, Humble yourselves under the
mighty hand of God.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 5:6.) We now then see why the Prophet requires from the faithful not only
righteousness but also humility; it was, that they might with composed minds
wait for the deliverance which God had promised. They were not in the interval
to murmur, nor to give vent to their own perverse feelings, however severely God
might treat them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may hence gather a profitable instruction: The
Prophet does not address here men who were depraved and had wholly neglected
what was just and right, but he directs his discourse to the best, the most
upright, the most holy: and yet he shows that they had no other remedy, but
humbly and patiently to bear the chastisement of God. It then follows that no
perfection can be found among men, such as can meet the judgment of God. For
were any to object and say, that they devoted themselves to righteousness, there
is yet a just reason why they should humble themselves; for we are all guilty
before God, and no one can clear himself, inasmuch as when any one examines his
own conscience, he finds that he is not free from sin. However conscious then we
may be of acting uprightly, and God himself may be a judge to us, and the Holy
Spirit the witness of our true and real integrity; yet when the Lord summons us
before his tribunal, let us all, from the least to the greatest, learn to
confess ourselves guilty and exposed to judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If it may be
</i></font><font face="Palatino">(or,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it may
be</i></font><font face="Palatino">)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye shall be
concealed</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk26</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
in the day of Jehovah&#8217;s anger</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The
Prophet speaks not doubtingly, as though the faithful were uncertain as to
God&#8217;s favor: but he had another thing in view, &#8212; that though no hope
remained as to the perceptions of men, yet the faithful would not lose their
labor, if they sought God; for in their worst circumstances they would find him
propitious to them and their safety secured by his kindness. Hence we see, that
the Prophet in these words points out the disastrous character of the event, but
no deficiency in the love of God. Though the Lord is ready to pardon, nay, of
his own self anticipates his people, and kindly invites them to himself; it is
yet necessary for them to consider how wonderful is his power in preserving his
elect, when all things seem desperate.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It may
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, when the Jews understood that all things were in a state of extreme
despair: and the Prophet said this, partly that the reprobate and the perverse
might know that they were to perish, and partly that the faithful might
appreciate the more the favor of God, when they saw themselves delivered from
death by a miracle, and found that it would be a kind of resurrection, when God
became their deliverer. Hence the Prophet, in order to commend to God&#8217;s
children his salvation, which he offers them, and to render more illustrious
God&#8217;s favor, makes use of the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ylwa</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>auli</i>, it may be. In the meantime he fulminates, as I have already said,
against the reprobate, that they might understand that it was all over with
them. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet begins here to console the elect; for
when God&#8217;s vengeance had passed away, which would only be for a time
against them, the heathens and foreigners would find God in their turn to be
their judge to punish them for the wrongs done to his people; though some think
that God&#8217;s judgment on the Jews is here described, while yet the Prophet
expressly mentions their neighbors: but the former view seems to me more
suitable, &#8212; that the Prophet reminds the faithful of &amp; future change
of things, for God would not perpetually afflict his chosen people, but would
transfer his vengeance to other nations. The meaning then is &#8212; that God,
who has hitherto threatened the Jews, would nevertheless be propitious to them,
not indeed to all the people, for a great part was doomed to destruction, but to
the remnant, whom the Lord had chosen as a seed to himself, that there might be
some church remaining. For we know, that God had always so moderated the
punishment he inflicted on his people, as not to render void his covenant, nor
abolish the memory of Abraham&#8217;s race: for this reason he was to come forth
as their Redeemer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since then the Prophet speaks here against Gaza, and
Ashkelon, and Ashdod, and Akron, and the Philistine, and the Cretians and
others, he intended no doubt to add courage to the faithful, that they might not
despair of God&#8217;s mercy, though they might find themselves very grievously
oppressed; for he could at length put an end to his wrath, after having purged
his Church of its dregs. And this admonition the faithful also need, that they
may not envy the wicked and the despisers of God, as though their condition were
better or more desirable. For when the Lord spares the wicked and chastens us,
we are tempted to think that nothing is better than to shake off every yoke.
Lest then this temptation should have assailed the faithful, the Prophet
reminded them in time, that there was no reason why the heathens should flatter
or congratulate themselves, when God did not immediately punish them; for their
portion was prepared for them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He mentions Gaza first, a name which often occurs in
scripture. The Hebrews called it Aza; but as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>oin</i>, is the first letter, the Greeks have rendered it Gaza, and heathen
authors have thought it to be a Persia word, and it means in that language a
treasure. But this is a vain notion, for it is no doubt a Hebrew word. He then
adds Ashkelon, a city nigh to Gaza. In the third place he mentions Ashdod, which
the Greeks have translated Azotus, and the Latins have followed the Greeks. He
names Ekron in the last place. All these cities were near to the Jews, and were
not far from one another towards the Moabites and the Idumeans. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk27</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ho!</i></font><font face="Palatino">
(or, <i>woe to</i>,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wh</font><font face="Palatino">)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the inhabitants of the line of
the sea</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The region of the sea he calls
Galilee; and he joins the Kerethites and the Philistine. Some think that he
alludes to the troops, who carried on war under David; for he had chosen his
garrison soldiers from that nation, that is, from the people of Galilee, and had
called them Kerethites and Philistine. But I know not whether the Prophet spoke
so refinedly. I rather think, that he refers here to those heathen nations,
which had been hostile to the Jews, though vicinity ought to have been a bond of
kindness. Hence he includes them all in the name of Canaan: for I do not take it
here, as some do, as signifying merchants; for the Prophet evidently means, that
however called, they were all Canaanites, who had been long ago doomed to
destruction. Since then those regions had been enemies to the Jews, the Prophet
intimates that God would become the defender of his chosen
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The word of Jehovah is against
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God, who has hitherto threatened his own
people, summons you to judgment. Think not that you will escape unpunished for
having vexed his Church. For though God designed to prove the patience of his
people, yet neither the Moabites, nor the rest, were excusable when they cruelly
oppressed the Jews; yea, when they purposed through them to fight with God
himself, the creator of heaven and earth. He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall be no
inhabitant</i></font><font face="Palatino">, for God would destroy them all. We
now see that the Prophet had no other design but to alleviate the bitter grief
of the faithful by this consolation, &#8212; that their miseries would be only
for a time, and that God would ere long punish their enemies. It follows

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet confirms what he has before said
respecting the future vengeance of God, which was now nigh at hand to the
Moabites and other neighboring nations, who had been continually harassing the
miserable Jews. Hence, he says, that that whole region would become the
habitation of sheep. It is a well known event, that when any country is without
inhabitants shepherds occupy it; for there is no sowing nor reaping there, but
grass alone grows. Where, therefore, there is no cultivation, where no number of
men are found, there shepherds find a place for their flocks, there they build
sheep cots. It is, therefore, the same as though the Prophet had said, that the
country would be desolate, as we find it expressed in the next verse. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk28</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He immediately adds, but for a different reason, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the coast of the sea would be a
habitation to the house of Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And there is
here a striking divergence from the flocks of shepherds to the tribe of Judah,
which was as it were, the chosen flock of God. The Prophet then, after having
said that the region would be waste and desolate, immediately adds, that it
would be for the benefit of the chosen people; for the Lord would grant there to
the Jews a safe and secure rest. But the Prophet confines this to the remnant;
for the greater part, as we have already seen, were become so irreclaimable,
that the gate of mercy was completely closed against them. The Prophet, at the
same time, by mentioning a remnant, shows that there would always be some seed
from which God would raise up a new Church; and he also encourages the faithful
to entertain hope, so that their own small number might not terrify them; for
when they considered themselves and found themselves surpassed by a vast
multitude, they might have thought that they were of no account. Lest then they
should be disheartened the Prophet says that this remnant would be the object of
God&#8217;s care; for when he would visit the whole coast of the sea and other
regions, he would provide there for the Jews a safe habitation and
refuge.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That line
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be for the residue of the
house of Judah; feed shall they in Ashkelon, and there shall they lie down in
the evening</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, they shall find in their
exile some resting-place; for we know that the Jews were not all removed to
distant lands; and they who may have been hid in neighboring places were
afterwards more easily gathered, when a liberty to return was permitted them.
This is what the Prophet means now, when he says, that there would be a refuge
in the night to the Jews among the Moabites and other neighboring
nations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A reason follows, which confirms what I have stated,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for Jehovah their
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says, will visit them. We hence see
that the Prophet mitigates here the sorrow of exile and of that most grievous
calamity which was nigh the Jews, by promising to them a new visitation of God;
as though he had said, Though the Lord seems now to rage against you, and seems
to forget his own covenant, yet he will again remember his mercy, when the
suitable time shall come. And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he will restore their
captivity</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and he added this, that he might
show that his favor would prove victorious against all hindrances. The Jews
might indeed have raised this objection, Why does not the Lord help us
immediately; but he, on the contrary, allows our enemies to remove us into
exile? The Prophet here calls upon them to exercise patience; and yet be
promises, that after having been driven into exile, they should again return to
their country; for the Lord would not suffer that exile to be perpetual. It now

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet confirms what I have just said of
God&#8217;s vengeance against foreign enemies. Though all the neighboring
nations had been eager in their hostility to the Jews, yet we know that more
hatred, yea and more fury, had been exhibited by these two nations than by any
other, that is, by the Moabites and the Ammonites, notwithstanding their
connection with them by blood, for they derived their origin from Lot, who was
Abraham&#8217;s nephew. Though, then, that connection ought to have turned the
Moabites and the Ammonites to mercy, we yet know they always infested the Jews
with greater fury than others, and as it were with savage cruelty. This is the
reason why the Prophet speaks now especially of them. Some indeed take this
sentence as spoken by the faithful; but the context requires it to be ascribed
to God, and no doubt he reminds them that he looked down from on high on the
proud vauntings of Moab which he scattered in the air, as though he had declared
that it was not hidden or unknown to him how cruelly the Moabites and Ammonites
raged against the Jews, how proud and inhuman they had been. And this was a very
seasonable consolation. For the Jews might have been swallowed up with despair,
had not this promise been made to them. They saw the Moabites and the Ammonites
burning with fury, when yet they had not been injured or provoked. They also saw
that they made gain and derived advantage from the calamities of a miserable
people. What could the faithful think? These wicked men not only harassed them
with impunity, but their cruelty and perfidy towards them was gainful. Where was
God now? If he regarded his own Church, would he not have interposed? Lest then
a temptation of this kind should upset the faithful, the Prophet introduces God
here as the speaker, &#8212;</font><br></div>

the Prophet&#8217;s design. Near]y the same words are used by Isaiah,

48:1, they both pursue the subject much farther, while our Prophet only touches
on it briefly, for we see that what he says is comprised in very few words. But
by saying that the reproach of Moab and the revilings of the children of Amman
had come into remembrance before God, what he had in view was &#8212; that the
Jews might be assured and fully persuaded that they were not rejected and
forsaken, though for a time they were reproachfully treated by the wicked. The
Prophet indeed takes the words reproach and revilings, in an active sense. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk29</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By which they have upbraided any
people</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God intimates here that he does not
depart from his elect when the wicked spit, as it were, in their faces. There is
indeed nothing which so much wounds the feelings of ingenuous minds as reproach;
there is not so much bitterness in hundred deaths as in one reproach, especial]y
when the wicked licentiously triumph, and do this with the applauding consent of
the whole world; for then all difference between good and evil is confounded,
and good conscience is as it were buried. But the Prophet shows here, that the
people of God suffer no loss when they are thus unworthily harassed by the
wicked and exposed to their reproach.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at last subjoins that they had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>enlarged over their
border</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some consider mouth to be understood
&#8212; they have enlarged the mouth against their border; and the word, it is
true, without any addition, is often taken in this sense; but in this place the
construction is fuller, for the words
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;lwbgAl[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ol-gebulam</i>, over their border, follow the verb. The Prophet means that
God&#8217;s wrath had been provoked by the petulance of both nations, for they
wished to break. up, as it were, the borders, which had been fixed by God. The
land of Canaan, we know, had been given to the Jews by an hereditary right;
&#8212; When the Most High, says Moses, divided the nations, he set a line for
Jacob.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:8. It is indeed true that the possessions of the nations were allotted to
them by the hidden counsel of God; but there was a special reason as to his
chosen people; for the Lord had made Abraham the true possessor of that land,
even for ever.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011708&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
17:8. Now the Moabites were confined, as it were, to a certain place; the Lord
had assigned to them their own inheritance. When, therefore, they sought to go
beyond and to invade the land of the Jews, God&#8217;s wrath must have been
kindled against them; for they thus fought, not against mortals, but against God
himself; for by removing the borders fixed by him, they attempted to subvert his
eternal decree. We now then understand why the Prophet says that the children of
Moab and of Ammon had enlarged over the border of those who had been placed in
the land of Canaan by God&#8217;s hand; for they not only sought to eject their
neighbors, but wished and tried to take away from God&#8217;s hand that
inheritance which the Lord had given to Abraham, and given, as I have said, in
perpetuity.

<div><br><font face="Palatino">IN order to cheer the miserable Jews by some
consolation, God said, in what we considered yesterday, that the wantonness of
Moab was known to him; he now adds, that he would visit with punishment the
reproaches which had been mentioned. For it would have availed them but little
that their wrongs had been observed by God, if no punishment had been prepared.
Hence the Prophet reminds them that God is no idle spectator, who only observes
what takes place in the world; but that there is a reward laid up for al the
ungodly. And these verses are to be taken in connection, that the faithful may
know that their wrongs are not unknown to God, and also that he will be their
defender. But that the Jews might have a more sure confidence that God would be
their deliverer, he interposes an oath. God at the same time shows that he is
really touched with when he sees his people so cruelly and immoderately
harassed, when the ungodly seem to think that an unbridled license is permitted
them. God therefore shows here, that not only the salvation of his people is an
object of his care, but that he undertakes their cause as though his anger was
kindled; not that passions belong to him but such a form of speaking is adopted
in order to express what the faithful could never otherwise conceive an idea of,
that is, to express the unspeakable love of God towards them, and his care for
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says that he lives, as though he had sworn by
his own life. As we have elsewhere seen that he swears by his life, so he speaks
now.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> Live do
I</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, As I am God, so will I avenge these
wrongs by which my people are now oppressed. And for the same reason he calls
himself </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah of
hosts</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In the first clause he exalts his own
power, that the Jews might know that he was endued with power; and then he
mentions his goodness, because he had adopted them as his people. The meaning
then is that God swears by his own life; and that the Jews might not think that
this was done in vain, his power is brought before them, and then his favor is
added.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Moab</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be like Sodom, and
the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah, even for the production of the nettle and for a
mire of salt</i></font><font face="Palatino">; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk31</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
is, their lands should be reduced to a waste, or should become wholly barren, so
that nothing was to grow there but nettles, as the case is with desert places.
As to the expression, the mine (<i>fodina</i>) or quarry of salt, it often
occurs in scripture: a salt-pit denotes sterility in Hebrew. And the Prophet
adds, that this would not be for a short time only;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It shall be
</i></font><font face="Palatino">(he says)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a perpetual
desolation</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He also adds, that this would be
for the advantage of the Church;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for the residue of my people
shall plunder them, and the remainder of my nation shall possess
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He ever speaks of the residue; for as it
was said yesterday, it was necessary for that people to be cleansed from their
dregs, so that a small portion only would remain; and we know that not many of
them returned from exile.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The import of the whole is, that though God
determined to diminish his Church, so that a few only survived, yet these few
would be the heirs of the whole land, and possess the kingdom, when God had
taken vengeance on all their enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It hence follows, according to the Prophet, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this</i></font><font face="Palatino">
shall be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to them for their
pride</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We see that the Prophet&#8217;s object
is, to take away whatever bitterness the Jews might feel when insolently
slandered by their enemies. As then there was danger of desponding, since
nothing, as it was said yesterday, is more grievous to be borne than reproach,
God does here expressly declare, that the proud triumph of their neighbors over
the Jews would be their own ruin; for, as Solomon says, &#8216;Pride goes before
destruction.&#8217;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;201618&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
16:18. And he again confirms what he had already referred to &#8212; that the
Jews would not be wronged with impunity, for God had taken them under his
guardianship, and was their protector:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because they have
reproached</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and triumphed over the people of
Jehovah of hosts</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He might have said, over my
people, as in the last verse; but there is something implied in these words, as
though the Prophet had said, that they carried on war not with mortals but with
God himself, whose majesty was insulted, when the Jews were so unjustly
oppressed. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

thus became despised by them: for the ungodly, we know, never submit to God

willingly to submit to his authority; but when forced they are silent.

what the Prophet means in these words; as though he had said, that the wicked
now mock God, as they disregard his power, but that they shall find how terrible
an avenger of his people he is, so that they would have to dread him. And then
he compares the superstitions of the nations with true religion; as though he
had said, that this would be to the Jews as a reward for their piety, inasmuch
as they worshipped the only true God, and that all idols would be of no avail
against the help of God. And this was a necessary admonition; for the ungodly
seemed to triumph for a time, not only over a conquered people, but over God
himself, and thus gloried in their superstitious and vain inventions. The
Prophet, therefore, confirms their desponding minds; for God, he says, will at
length </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>consume all the gods of

inventions of the nations: and he alludes to that famine which idols had
occasioned through the whole world; as though he had said, that God&#8217;s
glory would shortly appear, which would exterminate whatever glory the false
gods had obtained among them, so that it would melt away like
fatness.</font><br></div>

doubtless means, that however far off the countries might be, the distance would
be no hindrance to God&#8217;s name being celebrated, when his power became

short, the Prophet shows, that the redemption of the people would be so
wonderful, that the fame of it would reach the farthest bounds of the earth, and
constrain foreign nations to give glory to the true God, and that it would
dissipate all the mists of superstition, so that idols would be exposed to scorn

vengeance, and says, that God would also render to the Ethiopians the reward
which they deserved; for they had also harassed the chosen people. But if God
punished that nation, how could Ammon and Moab hope to escape? For how could God
spare so great a cruelty, since he would visit with punishment the remotest
nations? For the hatred of the Moabites and of the Ammonites, as we have said,
was less excusable, because they were related to the children of Abraham. They
ought, on this account, to have mitigated their fierceness: besides, vicinity
ought to have rendered them more humane. But as they exceeded other nations in
cruelty, a heavier punishment awaited them. Now this comparison was intended for
this end &#8212; that the Jews might know that God would be inexorable towards
the Moabites, by whom they had been so unjustly harassed, since even the
Ethiopians would be punished, who yet were more excusable on account of their
distance.</font><br></div>

I prefer to understand it of the Moabites, if we read, like them, or with them,

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet proceeds here to the Assyrians, whom
we know to have been special enemies to the Church of God. For the Moabites and
the Ammonites were fans only, as we have elsewhere seen, as they could not do
much harm by their own strength. Hence they stirred up the Assyrians, they
stirred up the Ethiopians and remote nations. The meaning, then, is, that no one
of all the enemies of the Church would be left unpunished by God, as every one
would receive a reward for his cruelty. He speaks now of God in the third
person; but in the last verse God himself said, that the Ethiopians would be
slain by his sword. The Prophet adds here,

before the Assyrians were conquered by the Babylonians. Thus Babylon then
recovered the sovereignty which it had lost; and Nineveh, though not wholly
demolished, was yet deprived of its ruling power, and gradually lost its name
and its wealth, until it was reduced into a waste; for the building of
Ctesiphon, as we have elsewhere seen, proved its ruin. But the Prophet, no
doubt, proceeds here to administer comfort to the Jews, lest they should
despair, while the Lord did not interfere. And the extension of the hand means
as though he said, that his own time is known to the Lord, and that he would put
forth his power when needful. Assyria was north as to Judea: hence he says, to
the north will the Lord extend his hand, and will destroy Assyria; he will make
Nineveh a desolation, that it may be like the desert. It follows

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet describes here the state of the city
and the desolation of the country. He says, that the habitations of flocks would
be in the midst of the city Nineveh. The city, we know, was populous; but while
men were so many, there was no place for flocks, especially in the middle of a
city so celebrated. Hence no common change is here described by the Prophet,
when he says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>flocks would
lie down in the middle of Nineveh</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all wild
beasts</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For beasts, which seek seclusion and
shun the sight of men, are wont to come forth, when they find a country desolate
and deserted; and they range then at large, as it is the case after a slaughter
in war; and when any region is emptied of its inhabitants, the wolves, the
lions, and other wild beasts, roam here and there at full liberty. So the
Prophet says, that wild beasts would come from other parts and remote places,
and find a place where Nineveh once stood.

As to their various kinds, I make no laborious research; for it is enough to
know the Prophet&#8217;s design: besides, the Jews themselves, who boldly affirm
that either the bittern or the stork is meant, yet adduce nothing that is
certain. What, in short, this description means, is &#8212; that the place,
which before a vast multitude of men inhabited, would become so forsaken, that
wild beasts and nocturnal birds would be its only inhabitants.</font><br></div>

these things were set before the Jews, that they might patiently bear their
miseries, understanding that God would become their defender. For this is the
only support that remains for us under very grievous evils, as Paul reminds us
in the first chapter of the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians; for he says,
that the time will come when the Lord shall give to us relief and refreshment,

God does not esteem of less consequence than the salvation of his Church, as it
is said in Isaiah, I will give Egypt as thy ransom. So God threatens the
wealthiest city, that he might show how much he loved his chosen people. And the
Jews could not have attributed this to their own worthiness; but the cause of so
great a love depended on their gratuitous adoption. It afterwards follows

<div><br><font face="Palatino">He seems to have added this by way of
anticipation, lest the magnificent splendor of the city Nineveh should frighten
the Jews, as though it were exempt from all danger. The Prophet therefore
reminds them here, that though Nineveh was thus proud of its wealth, it could
not yet escape the hand of God; nay, he shows that the greatness, on account of
which Nineveh extolled itself, would be the cause of its ruin; for it would cast
itself down by its own pride: as a wall, when it swells, will not long stand; so
also men, when they inwardly swell, and vent their own boastings, burst; and
though no one pushes them down, they fall of themselves. Such a destruction the
Prophet denounces on the Ninevites and the Assyrians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is the exulting city,
which sat in confidence</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Isaiah reprobates in
nearly the same words the pride of Babylon: but what Isaiah said of Babylon our
Prophet justly transfers here to Nineveh. But he no doubt had respect to the
Jews, and exhibits Nineveh in its state of ruin, lest the power of that city
should dazzle their eyes; for we are seized with wonder, when anything grand and
splendid presents itself to us. Here then Zephaniah makes a representation of
Nineveh and sets it before the Jews: Behold, he says, ye see this city full of
exultation; ye also see that it rests as in a state of safety; for it is
conscious of no fear; it regards itself exempt from the common lot of men, as
though it was built in the clouds. This city, he says, is above all others
celebrated; but let not frail and evanescent splendor terrify you; for God will
doubtless in his own time overthrow it and reduce it to
nothing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us also in the meantime observe what I have
lately referred to, &#8212; that the cause of the ruin of Nineveh is described,
which was, that it had promised to itself a perpetuity in the world. But let us
remember, that in this city is presented to us an example, which belongs in
common to all nations, &#8212; that God cannot endure the presumption of men,
when inflated by their own greatness and power, they do not think themselves to
be men, nor humble themselves in a way suitable to the condition of men, but
forget themselves, as though they could exalt themselves above the
heavens.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is necessary to examine the words: Nineveh
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>said in her heart, I, and besides
me no other</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By these words the Prophet means,
that Nineveh was so blinded by its splendor that it now defied every change of
fortune. Had Babylon spoken thus, it would have been no wonder, for it had taken
from Nineveh its sovereignty. But we see that the same pride infatuates people
as well as superior kings; for each thinks himself to be great alone, and when
he compares himself with others, he looks on them as far below him, as though
they were placed beneath his feet. Thus then the Prophet shows in few words what
was the cause of the ruin of Nineveh: it thought that its condition on the earth
was fixed and perpetual. If then we desire to be protected by God&#8217;s hand,
let us bear in mind what our condition is, and daily, yea, hourly prepare
ourselves for a change, except God be pleased to sustain us. Our stability is to
depend only on the aid of God, and from consciousness of our infirmity, to
tremble in ourselves, lest a forgetfulness of our state should creep
in.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How has it become a
desolation?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet accommodates his words
to the capacities of men: for the ruin of Nineveh might have appeared
incredible. Hence the Prophet by a question rouses the minds of the faithful,
that they might not doubt the truth of what God declared, for he would work in
an extraordinary manner. This how then intimates, that the Jews ought not to be
incredulous, while thinking that Nineveh was on all sides fortified, so as to
prevent the occurrence of anything disastrous: for God would, in a wonderful
manner and beyond what is usual, overthrow it.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has it become a desolation,
a resting-place for beasts?</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every one who passes by will hiss
and shake his hand</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet seems to point
out the future reproach of Nineveh, and to confirm also by a different mode of
speaking what he had before said, that its ruin would be wonderful; for the
shaking of the hand and hissing are marks of reproach: Behold Nineveh, which so
much flattered itself! we now see only its sad ruins. The Prophet, I have no
doubt, means here by hissing and the shaking of the hind, that Nineveh would
become an ignominious spectacle to all people: and the same mode of speaking
often occurs in the Prophets. All shall hiss at thee; that is, I will make thee
a reproach and a disgrace. Then the Prophet, as I have already said, still
declares the same truths that the ruin of Nineveh would be like a miracle; for
all those who pass by would be amazed; as though he had said, Behold, they will
hiss &#8212; What is this? and then they will shake the hand &#8212; What can be
firm in this world? We see the principal seat of empire demolished, and
differing nothing from a desert. We now perceive the meaning of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As this doctrine is also necessary for us at this
day, we must notice the circumstances to which we have referred. If, then, our
enemies triumph now, and their haughtiness is intolerable, let us know, that the
sooner the vengeance of God will overtake them; if they are become insensible in
their prosperity, and secure, and despise all dangers, they thus provoke
God&#8217;s wrath, and especially if to their pride and hardness they add
cruelty, so as basely to persecute the Church of God, to spoil, to plunder, and
to slay his people, as we see them doing. Since then our enemies are so wanton,
we may see as in a mirror their near destruction, such as is foretold by the
Prophet: for he spoke not only of his own age, but designed to teach us, by the
prophetic spirit, how dear to God is the safety of his Church; and the future
lot of the ungodly till the end of the world will no doubt be such as Nineveh is
described here to have been that though they swell with pride for a time, and
promise themselves every success against the innocent, God will yet put a stop
to their insolence and check their cruelty, when the proper time shall come. I
shall not today begin the third chapter, for it contains a new
subject.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet speaks here again against Jerusalem;
for first, the Jews ought ever to have been severely reproved, as they were
given to many sins; and secondly, because there was always there some seed which
needed consolation: and this has been the way pursued, as we have hitherto seen,
by all the Prophets. But we must also bear in mind, that the books now extant
were made up of prophetic addresses, that we might understand what was the sum
of the doctrine delivered.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here makes this charge against the Jews,
that they were </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>polluted and
become filthy</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And he addresses Jerusalem,
where the sanctuary was; and it might therefore seem to have been superior to
other cities; for God had not in vain chosen that as the place for his worship.
But the Prophet shows how empty and fallacious was any boasting of this kind;
for the city which God had consecrated for himself had polluted itself with many
sins. The Prophet seems to allude to the ancient rites of the law, which, though
many, had been prescribed, we know, by God, that the people might observe a holy
course of life: for the ceremonies could not of themselves wash away their
filth; but the people were instructed by these external things to worship God in
a holy and pure manner. As then they often washed themselves with water, and as
they carefully observed other rites of outward sanctity, the Prophet derides
their hypocrisy, for they did not regard the real design of the ceremonies.
Hence he says, that they were polluted, though in appearance they might be
deemed the most pure; for they were defiled as to their whole life. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk38</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds that the city was
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnwyh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>eiune</i>; some render it the city of dove, or, a dove; for the word has this
meaning: and they take it metaphorically for a foolish and thoughtless city, as
we find it to be so understood in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;280711&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
7:11; where Ephraim was said to be a dove, because the people were void of
reason and knowledge, and of their own accord exposed themselves to traps and
snares. Some then consider this place to have this meaning, &#8212; that
Jerusalem, which ought to have been wise, was yet wholly fatuitous and foolish.
But it may be easily gathered from the context, that the Prophet means another
thing, even this, &#8212; that Jerusalem was given to plunder and fraud; for the
verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hny</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ine</i>, signifies to defraud and to take by force what belongs to another;
and it means also to circumvent as well as to plunder. He therefore means no
doubt, that Jerusalem was a city full of every kind of iniquity, as he had
before called it a polluted city; and then he adds an
explanation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet in the first verse seems to have in view
the two tables of the law. God, we know, requires in the law that his people
should be holy; and then he teaches the way of living justly and innocently.
Hence when the Prophet called Jerusalem a polluted city, he meant briefly to
show that the whole worship of God was there corrupted, and that no regard for
true religion flourished there; for the Jews thought that they had performed all
their duty to God, when they washed away their filth by water. Such was the
extremely foolish notion which they entertained: but we know and they ought to
have known that the worship of God is spiritual. He afterwards adds, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>city was
rapacious</i></font><font face="Palatino">, under which term he includes every
kind of injustice.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>She heard not the
voice</i></font><font face="Palatino">, she
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>received not
correction</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet now explains and
defines what the pollution was of which he had spoken: for true religion begins
with teachableness; when we submit to God and to his word, it is really to enter
on the work of worshipping him aright. But when heavenly truth is despised,
though men may toil much in outward rites, yet their impiety discovers itself by
their contumacy, inasmuch as they suffer not themselves to be ruled by
God&#8217;s authority. Hence the Prophet shows, that whatever the Jews thought
of their purity at Jerusalem, it was nothing but filth and pollution. He says,
that they were unteachable, because they did not hear the Prophets sent to them
by God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This ought to be carefully noticed; for without this
beginning many torment themselves in the work of serving God, and do nothing,
because obedience is better than sacrifice. If, then, we wish our efforts to be
approved by God, we must begin with faith; for except the word of God obtains
credit with us, whatever we may offer to him are mere human inventions. It is,
in the second place, added, that they did not receive correction; and this was
no superfluous addition. For when God sees that we are not submissive, and that
we do not willingly come to him when he calls us, he strengthens his instruction
by chastisements. He allures us at first to himself, he employs kind and gentle
invitations; but when he sees us delaying, or even going back, he begins to
treat us more roughly and more severely: for teaching without the goads of
reproof would have no effect. But when God teaches and reproves in vain, it then
appears that our disposition is wicked and perverse. So the Prophet intended
here to show the wickedness of his people as extreme, by saying, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heard not the voice nor received
correction</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as though he had said, that the
wickedness of his people was unhealable, for they not only rejected the doctrine
of salvation, when offered, but also obstinately rejected all warnings, and
would not bear any correction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must bear in mind, that the Prophet had to do
with that holy people whom God had chosen as his peculiar treasure. There is
therefore no reason why those who profess the name of Christians at this day
should exempt themselves from this condemnation; for our condition is not better
than the condition of that people. Jerusalem was in an especial manner, as we
have already said, the sanctuary, as it were, of God: and yet we see how
severely the Prophet reproves Jerusalem and all its inhabitants. We have no
cause to flatter ourselves, except we willingly submit to God, and suffer
ourselves to be ruled by his word, and except we also patiently bear correction,
when his teaching takes no suitable effect, and when there is need of sharp
goads to stimulate us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds, that it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>did not trust in the Lord, nor
draw nigh to its God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet discovers
here more clearly the spring of impiety &#8212; that Jerusalem placed not the
hope of salvation in God alone; for from hence flowed all the mass of evils
which prevailed; because if we inquire how it is that men burn with avarice, why
they are insatiable, and why they wantonly defraud and plunder one another, we
shall find the cause to be this &#8212; that they trust not in God. Rightly then
does the Prophet mention this here, among other pollutions at Jerusalem, as the
chief &#8212; that it did not put its trust in God. The same also is the cause
and origin of all superstitions; for if men felt assured that God alone is
enough for them, they would not follow here and there their own inventions. We
hence see that unbelief is not only the mother of all the evil deeds by which
men willfully wrong and injure one another, but that it is also the cause of all
superstitions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, in the last place, that it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>did not draw nigh to
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet no doubt charges the Jews that
they willfully departed from God when he was nigh them; yea, that they wholly
alienated themselves from him, while he was ready to cherish them, as it were,
in his own bosom. This is indeed a sin common to all who seek not God; but
Jerusalem sinned far more grievously, because she would not draw nigh to God, by
whom she saw that she was sought. For why was the law given, why was adoption
vouchsafed, and in short, why had they the various ordinances of religion,
except that they might join themselves to God? &#8216;And now Israel,&#8217;
said Moses, &#8216;what does the Lord thy God require of thee, except to cleave
to him?&#8217; God thus intended his law to be, as it were, a sacred bond of
union between him and the Jews. Now when they wandered here and there, that they
might not be united to him, it was a diabolical madness. Hence the Prophet here
does not only accuse the Jews of not seeking God, but of withdrawing themselves
from him; and thus they were ungovernable. The Lord sought to tame them; but
they were like wild beasts. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now explains what we have stated
respecting plunder and fraud. He confirms that he had not without reason called
Jerusalem
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnwyh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>eiune</i>, a rapacious city, or one given to plunder; for the princes were
like lions and the judges like wolves. And when he speaks of judges, he does not
spare the common people; but he shows that all orders were then corrupt: for
though no justice or equity is regarded by the people, there will yet remain
some shame among the judges, so as to retain the people at least within some
limits, that an extreme licentiousness may not prevail: but when robbery is
practiced in the court of justice, what can be said of such a city? We hence see
that the Prophet in these words describes an extreme confusion: The princes of
Jerusalem, he says, are lions. And we have elsewhere similar declarations; for
the Prophets, when it was their object to condemn all from the least to the
greatest, did yet direct their discourse especially to the
judges.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this is worthy of being noticed, for there was
then no Church of God, except at Jerusalem. Yet the Prophet says, that the
judges, and prophets, and priests, were all apostates. What comfort could the
faithful have had? But we hence see that the fear of God had not wholly failed
in his elect, and that they firmly and with an invincible heart contended
against all offenses and trials of this kind. Let us also learn to fortify
ourselves at this day with the same courage, so that we may not faint, however
much impiety may everywhere prevail, and all religion may seem extinct among
men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we may also hence learn, how foolishly the
Papists pride themselves in their vain titles, as though they thought that God
was bound as it were to them, because they have bishops and pastors. But the
Prophet shows, that even those who performed the ordinary office of executing
the laws could yet be the wicked and perfidious despisers of God. He also shows,
that neither prophets nor priests ought to be spared; for when God sets them
over his Church, he gives them no power to tyrannize, so that they might dare to
do anything with impunity, and not be reproved. For though the priesthood under
the law was sacred, we yet see that it was subject to correction. So let no one
at this day claim for himself a privilege, as though he was exempt from all
instruction and reproof, while occupying a high station among the people of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He distinguishes between princes and judges; and the
reason is, because the kingdom was as yet standing. So the courtiers, who were
in favor and authority with the king, drew a part of the spoil to themselves,
and the judges devoured another part. Though Scripture often makes no difference
between these two names, yet I doubt not but he means by
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yr&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sherim</i>, princes, the chiefs who were courtiers; and he calls them
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yfp&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shepthim</i>, judges, who administered justice. And he says that the judges
were evening wolves, that is, hungry, for wolves become furious in the evening
when they have been roaming about all day and have found nothing. As their want
sharpens the savageness of wolves, so the Prophet says that the judges were
hungry like evening wolves, whose hunger renders them furious. And for the same
purpose he adds, that they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>broke
not the bones in the morning</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, they
waited not till the dawn to break the bones; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk39</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for
when they devoured the flesh they also employed their teeth in breaking the
bones, because their voracity was so great. We now apprehend the Prophet&#8217;s

<div><font face="Palatino">He says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Prophets were
light</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He alone speaks here, and he condemns
the many. We hence see that there is no reason why the ungodly should allege
their great number, when God by his word accuses them, as the Papists do at this
day, who deny it to be right in one or two, or few men, to speak against their
impiety, however bad the state of things may be; there must be the consent of
the whole world, as though the Prophet was not alone, and had not to contend
with a great many. It is indeed true that he taught at the same time with the
Prophet Jeremiah, as we have elsewhere seen; but yet hardly two or three did
then discharge faithfully their office of teaching; and from this and other
places we learn that the false Prophets, relying on their number, were on that
account bolder. But Zephaniah did not for this reason cease to cry against them.
However much then the false Prophets raged against him, and terrified him by the
show of their number, he still exercised his liberty in condemning them. So at
this day, though the whole world should unite in promoting impiety, there is yet
no reason why the few should be disheartened when observing the worship of God
perverted; but they ought on the contrary to encourage themselves by this
example, and strenuously to resist thousands of men if necessary; for no union
formed by men can possibly lessen the authority of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It now follows that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>men of
transgressions</i></font><font face="Palatino">. What we render light, others
render empty; (<i>vacuous</i>;) but the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yzjwp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>puchezim</i>, means strictly men of nought, and also the rash, and those who
are void of judgment as well as of all moderation. In short, it is the same as
though the Prophet had said that they were stupid and blind; and he says
afterwards that they were fraudulent, than which there is nothing more
inconsistent with the Prophetic office. But Zephaniah shows that the whole order
was then so degenerated among the people, that the thickest darkness prevailed
among those very leaders whose office it was to bring forth the light of
celestial truth. And he makes a concession by calling them Prophets. The same we
do at this day when we speak of Popish bishops. It is indeed certain that they
are unworthy of so honorable a title; for they are blinder than moles, so that
they are far from being overseers. We also know, that they are like brute
beasts; for they are immersed in their lusts: in short, they are unworthy to be
called men. But we concede to them this title, in order that their turpitude may
be more apparent. The Prophet did the same, when he said, that the Jews did not
draw nigh to their God; he conceded to them what they boasted; for they ever
wished to be regarded as the holy and peculiar people of God: but their
ingratitude did hence become more evident, because they went back and turned to
another object, when God was ready to embrace them, as though they designedly
meant to show that they had nothing to do with him. It is then the same manner
of speaking, that Zephaniah adopts here, when he says, that the Prophets were
light and men of transgressions. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk40</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds, The priests have polluted the holy
place. The tribe of Levi, we know, had been chosen by God; and those who
descended from him, were to be ministers and teachers to others: and for this
reason the Lord in the law ordered the Levites to be dispersed through the whole
country. He might indeed have given them as to the rest, a fixed habitation; but
his will was, that they should be dispersed among the whole population, that no
part of the land should be without good and faithful ministers. The Prophet now
charges them, that they had polluted the holy place. By the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;dq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kodash</i> the Prophet means whatsoever is holy; at the same time he speaks
of the sanctuary. Moreover, since the sanctuary was as it were the
dwelling-place of God, when the Prophets speak of divine worship and religion,
they include the whole under the word, Temple, as in this place. He says then
that the sanctuary was polluted by the priests, and then that they took away or
subverted the law.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk41</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We here see how boldly the Prophet charges the
priests. There is then no reason why they who are divinely appointed over the
Church should claim for themselves the liberty of doing what they please; for
the priests might have boasted of this privilege, that without dispute
everything was lawful for them. But we see that God not only calls them to order
by his Prophets, but even blames them more than others, because they were less
excusable. Now the Papists boast, that the clergy, even the very dregs collected
from the filthiest filth, cannot err; which is extremely absurd; for they are
not better than the successors of Aaron. But we see what the Prophet objects now
to them, &#8212; that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>subverted the
law</i></font><font face="Palatino">: he not only condemns their life, but says
also, that they were perfidious towards God; for they strangely corrupted the
whole truth of religion. The Papists confess, that they indeed can sin, but that
the sin dwells only in their moral conduct. They yet seek to exempt themselves
from all the danger of going astray. Though the Levitical priests were indeed
chosen by the very voice of God, we yet see that they were apostates. But God
confirms the godly, that they might not abandon themselves to impiety, though
they saw their very leaders going astray, and rushing headlong into ruin. For it
behaved the faithful to fortify themselves with constancy, when the priests not
only by their bad conduct withdrew the people from every fear of God, but also
perverted every sound doctrine; it behaved, I say, the faithful to remain then
invincible. Though then at this day those who hold the highest dignity in the
Church neglect God and even despise every celestial truth, and thus rush
headlong into ruin, and though they attempt to turn God&#8217;s truth into
falsehood, yet let our faith continue firm; for John has not without reason
declared, that it ought to be victorious against the whole world.

<div><br><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet throws back against hypocrites
what they were wont to pretend, when they sought wickedly to reject every
instruction and all warnings; for they said, that God dwelt in the midst of
them, like the Papists at the present day, who raise up this as their shield
against us, &#8212; that the Church is the pillar of the truth. Hence they think
that all their wicked deeds are defended by this covering. So the Jews at that
time had this boast ever on their lips, &#8212; We are notwithstanding the holy
people of God, and he dwells in the midst of us, for he is worshipped in the
Temple, which has been built, not according to men&#8217;s will, but by his
command; for that voice proceeded not from earth, but came from heaven,
&#8216;This is my rest for ever, here will I dwell.&#8217;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
132:14. Since then the Jews were inflated with this presumption, the Prophet
concedes what they claimed, that God dwelt among them; but it was for a far
different purpose, which was, that they might understand, that his hand was nigh
to punish their sins. This is one thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jehovah is in the midst of them; Granted, he says; I
allow that he dwells in this city; for he has commanded a temple to be built for
him on Mount Sion, he has ordered a holy altar for himself; but why does God
dwell among you, and has preferred this habitation to all others? Surely, he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he will not do
iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Consider now what the nature of God
is; for when he purposed to dwell among you, he certainly did not deny himself,
nor did he cease to be what he is. There is therefore no reason for you to
imagine, as though God intended, for the sake of those to whom he bound himself,
to throw aside his own justice, or intended to pollute himself by the
defilements of men. He warns the Jews, that they absurdly blended these things
together.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who dwells in the midst of
you, will not do iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, He will not
approve of your evil deeds; and though he may for a time connive at them, he
will not yet bear with them continually. Do not therefore foolishly flatter
yourselves, as though God were the approver of your wickedness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some apply this to the people, &#8212; that they
ought not to have done iniquity; but this is a strained exposition, and
altogether foreign to the context. Most other interpreters give this meaning,
that God is just and will do no iniquity, for he had sufficient reasons for
executing his vengeance on a people so wicked. They hence think, that the
Prophet anticipates the Jews, lest they murmured, as though the Lord was cruel
or too rigid. He will not do iniquity, that is, Though the Lord may inflict on
you a most grievous punishment, yet he cannot be arraigned by you as unjust; and
ye in vain contend with him, for he will ever be found to be a righteous judge.
But this also is a very frigid explanation. Let us bear in mind what I have
already said, &#8212; that the Prophet here, by way of irony, concedes to the
Jews, that God dwelt among them, but afterwards brings against them what they
thought was a protection to them, &#8212; God dwells in the midst of you; I
allow it, he says; but is not he a just God? Do not then dream that he is one
like yourselves, that he approves of your evil deeds. God will not do iniquity;
ye cannot prevail with him to renounce himself, or to change his own nature. Why
then does God dwell in the midst of you?

<div><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE HUNDRED AND
TWENTY-FIFTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE began yesterday to explain the passage, where the
Prophet says, that God dwelt at Jerusalem, but that he was notwithstanding just,
and could not possibly associate with the ungodly and the wicked, because he
changes not his nature to suit the humor of men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It now follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the morning, in the morning,
his judgment will he bring forth to light</i></font><font face="Palatino">: by
which words he means, either that God would be the avenger of wickedness, which
seems to escape, as it were, his eyes, while he delays his punishment, or that
he is ready to restore his people, whenever they are attentive to instruction.
If the former view be approved, the sense will be this, &#8212; that hypocrites
foolishly flatter themselves, when God spares them; for he will suddenly ascend
his tribunal that he may visit them with punishment. Some however choose to
apply this to the judgments executed on the Gentiles, of which the Jews had not
once nor twice been reminded, but often, that they might in time repent. But
there is no doubt but that the Prophet refers here to a judgment belonging to
the Jews.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now see whether this judgment is pronounced or
inflicted. It would not ill suit the passage to understand it of the vengeance
which God was hastening to execute, for the Jews were worthy of what had been
severely threatened, because they falsely professed his name; and while they
absurdly boasted that he dwelt among them, they withdrew themselves very far
from him. It is however no less suitable to refer this to teaching, so that the
Prophet thus enhanced the sin of the people, because they had hardened
themselves after so many and so constant warnings, which continually sounded in
their ears, as God elsewhere complains, that though he rose early, and indeed
daily, this solicitude had been without its fruit. The verb in the future tense
will thus signify a continued act, for God ceased not to exhort to repentance
those wretched beings who had ears which were deaf. And this view strikingly
corresponds with what immediately follows, that he fails not; for such a
perseverance was a proof of unwearied mercy, when God continued to send Prophets
one after the other.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The wicked knows no
shame</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He means what he has just referred to
&#8212; that the people had become so hardened in their wickedness that they
could not be reformed, either by instruction or by threats, or by the scourges
of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If we refer judgment to teaching, which I approve,
the meaning will be &#8212; that though God, by making known daily his law,
kindled as it were a lamp, which discovered all evils, yet the ungodly were not
ashamed. But if we understand it, as they say, of actual judgment, the meaning
will be in substance the same &#8212; that the ungodly repented not, though the
hand of God openly appeared; and though he rose to judgment, yet he says, they
knew not what it was to feel ashamed. As to the main subject there is no
ambiguity; for the Prophet means only that the people were past recovery; for
though God proved himself a judge by manifest evidences, and even by his own
law, they yet felt no shame, but went on in their wicked courses. The word
judgment, in the singular number, seems to have been put here in the sense of a
rule, by which men live religiously and justly, and a rule which ought to make
men ashamed.

<div><br><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet shows in another way that there
was no hope for a people, who could not have been instructed by the calamities
of others, to seek to return to God&#8217;s favor. For God here complains that
he had in vain punished neighboring nations, and made them examples, in order to
recall the Jews to himself. Had they been of a sane mind they might have been
led, by their quiet state, while God spared them, to consider what they had
deserved &#8212; If this is done in the green tree, what at length will be done
in the dry? They might then have thought within themselves, that a most grievous
calamity was at hand, except they anticipated God&#8217;s wrath, which had grown
ripe against them; and God also testified that he intended by such examples to
stay the judgment which he might have already justly executed on them. As they
then even hastened it, it is evident that their wickedness was past remedy. This
is the sum of the whole.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says first, I
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have cut off
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino">; by which words he shows that he warned
the Jews to repent, not only by one example, but by many examples; for not one
instance only of God&#8217;s wrath had appeared, but God had on all sides
manifested himself to be a judge, in inflicting punishment on one nation after
another. Since then they had been so often warned, we may hence learn that they
were wholly blinded by their wickedness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now enhances the atrocity of the punishment
inflicted, and says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>citadels had been demolished and
streets cut off, that no one passed through</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
and then, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cities had been
reduced to solitude, so that there was no
inhabitant</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For when punishment is of an
ordinary kind, it is wont, for the most part, to be disregarded; but when God
showed, by so remarkable proofs, that he was displeased with the nations, that
is, with the ignorant, who in comparison with the Jews were innocent, how could
such an instance as this be disregarded by the Jews, whom God thus recalled to
himself, except that they were of a disposition wholly desperate and
irreclaimable? We now then see why the Prophet enlarges on the punishments
which, having been inflicted on the nations, ought to have been considered by
the Jews.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk43</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now subjoins the object which God had in view,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I said, Surely thou wilt fear
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here God assumes the character of man, as
he does often elsewhere: for he does not wait for what is future, as though he
was doubtful; but all things, as we know, are before his eyes. Hence God was not
deceived, as though something had happened beyond his expectation; but as I have
already said, he undertakes here the character of man; for he could not
otherwise have sufficiently expressed how inexcusable the Jews were who had
despised all his warnings. For what was God&#8217;s design when he punished the
heathens, one nation after another, except that the Jews might be awakened by
the evils of others, and not provoke his wrath against themselves? Paul makes
use of the same argument.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;On account of
these things,&#8217; he
says,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;the wrath of God comes
upon all the
unbelieving.&#8217;</font><br><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
1:17.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Inasmuch as men for the most part deceive themselves
by self-flatteries and cherish with extreme indulgence their own wickedness,
Paul says, that the wrath of God comes on the unbelieving: and it is a singular
proof of God&#8217;s love, that he does not immediately assail us, but sets
before us the examples of others. As when any one lays hold of his servant in
the presence of his son, and punishes him severely, the son must be moved by the
sight, except he be wholly an abandoned character: however, in such a case the
father&#8217;s love manifests itself; for he withholds his hand from his son and
inflicts punishment on the servant, and this for the benefit of his son, that he
may learn wisdom by what another suffers. God declares in this place that he had
done the same; but he complains that it had been without benefit, for the Jews
had frustrated his purpose.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may be here asked, whether men so frustrate God
that he looks for something different from what happens. I have already said,
that God speaks after the manner of men, and in a language not strictly correct:
and hence we ought not here to enter or penetrate into the secret purpose of
God, but to be satisfied with this reason, &#8212; that if we profit nothing
when God warns us either by his word or by his scourges, we are then equally
guilty, as though he was deceived by us: and hence also the madness of those is
reproved, who are unwilling to ascribe anything to God but what is conveyed in
these common forms of speech: God says, that he wills the salvation of all,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 2:4;) hence there is no election, which makes a distinction between one
man and another; but the Lord leaves the whole human race to their free-will, so
that every one may provide for himself as he pleases; otherwise the will of God
must be twofold. So unlearned men vainly talk; and such not only show their
ignorance in religion, but are also wholly destitute of common sense. For what
is more absurd than to conclude, that there is a twofold will in God, because he
speaks otherwise with us than is consistent with his incomprehensible majesty?
God&#8217;s will then is one and simple, but manifold as to the perceptions of
men; for we cannot comprehend his hidden purpose, which angels adore with
reverence and humility. Hence the Lord accommodates himself to the measure of
our capacities, as this passage teaches us with sufficient clearness. For if we
receive what the fanatics imagine, then God is like man, who hopes well, and
finds afterwards that he has been deceived: but what can be more alien to his
glory? We hence see how these insane men not only obscure the glory of God, but
also labor, as far as they can, to reduce his whole essence to nothing. But this
mode of speaking ought to be sufficiently familiar to us, &#8212; that God
justly complains that he has been deceived by us, when we do not repent,
inasmuch as he invites us to himself, and even stimulates us,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I said, Surely thou wilt fear
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>said</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
ought not then to be referred to the hidden counsel of God, but to the subject
itself, and that is, that it was time to repent. Who would not have hoped but
that you would have returned to the right way? When the next house was on fire,
how was it possible for you to sleep, except ye were extremely stupid? And when
so many examples were presented before your eyes without any advantage, it is
evident that there is no more any hope of repentance. Thou, then, wilt fear me;
that is, God might have hoped for some amendment, though he had not yet touched
you even with his smallest finger; for ye beheld, while in a tranquil state, how
severely he punished the contempt of his justice as to the heathens. He uses a
similar language in

thee to bring forth fruit; but, behold, thou hast brought forth wild
grapes.&#8217;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God in that passage expostulates with the Jews as
though they had by their perfidiousness deceived him. But we know, that whatever
happens was known to him before the creation of the world: but, as I have
already said, the fact itself is to be regarded by us, and not the hidden
judgment of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou wilt receive
correction</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, thou wilt be hereafter
more tractable: for monstrous is our stupidity, when we fear not God&#8217;s
vengeance; when yet it evidently appears that we are warned, as I have already
said, to repent, by all the examples of judgments which are daily presented to
us. But if we proceed in our wickedness, what else is it but to kick against the
goad, as the old proverb is? In short, we here see described an extreme
wickedness and obstinacy, which admitted of no remedy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence the Prophet adds again,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And cut off should not be her
habitation, howsoever I might have visited her</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
that is, though the Jews had already provoked me, so that the punishment they
have deserved was nigh; yet I was ready to withdraw my hand and to forgive them,
if they repented: not that God ever turns aside from his purpose, for there is
no shadow of turning in him; but he sets before them the fact as it was; for the
subject here, as I have said, is not respecting the secret purpose of God, but
we ought to confine ourselves to the means which he employs in promoting our
salvation. God had already threatened the Jews for many years; he had as yet
deferred to execute what he had threatened. In the meantime his wrath had been
manifested through the whole neighborhood; the heathen nations had suffered the
severest judgments. God here declares, that he had been so lenient to his people
as to give time to repent; and he complains that he had delayed in vain, for
they had gone on in their wickedness, and had mocked, as it were, his patience.
When, therefore, he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cut off
should not </i></font><font face="Palatino">be her habitation,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>howsoever I might have visited
her</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or have visited her, he pursues still the
same mode of speaking, that is, that he was prepared to forgive the Jews, though
he had before destined them to destruction; not that he, as to himself, would
retract that sentence; but that he was still reconcilable, if the Jews had been
touched by any feeling of repentance. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk44</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at last adds,

in the sense of hastening; as though he had said, They run headlong to corrupt
their ways. God had said that he had been indulgent to them for this end &#8212;
that he might lead them by degrees to repentance: now he complains, that they on
the contrary had run another way, when they saw that he suspended his judgments,
as though it was their designed object to accelerate his wrath. Thus they
hastened to corrupt their ways. The meaning, then, is that this people were not
only irreclaimable in their obstinacy, but that they were also sottish and
presumptuous, as though they wished to hasten the judgment, which the Lord was
ready for a time to defer. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">God here declares that the last end was near,
since he had found by experience that he effected nothing by long forbearance,
and since he had even found the Jews becoming worse, because he had so
mercifully treated them. Some think that the address is made to the faithful,
that they might prepare themselves to bear the cross; but this view is foreign
to the subject of the Prophet: and though this view has gained the consent of
almost all, I yet doubt not but that the Prophet, as I have now stated, breaks

contumacy of the people, that he would now plunder, spoil and devour, and forget
his kindness, which had been hitherto a sport to them &#8212; I shall come as a
wild beast; as lions rage, lacerate, tear, and devour, so also will I now do
with you; for I have hitherto too kindly and paternally spared you. We hence see
that these things are not to be referred to the hope and patience of the godly;
but that God on the contrary does here denounce final destruction on the wicked,
as though he had said &#8212; I bid you adieu; begone, and mind your own
concerns; for I will no longer contend with you; but I shall shortly come, and
ye shall find me very differentfrom what I have been to you hitherto. We now see
that God, as it were, repudiates the Jews, and threatens that he would come to
them with a drawn sword; and at the same time he compares himself to a savage
and cruel wild beast.</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now mitigates the asperity of his
doctrine, which might have greatly terrified the godly; nay, it might have
wholly disheartened them, had no consolation been applied. God then moderates
here what he had previously threatened; for if the Prophet had only said this
&#8212; My purpose is to gather all the nations, and thus the whole earth shall
be devoured by the fire of indignation, what could the faithful have concluded
but that they were to perish with the rest of the world? It was therefore
necessary to add something to inspire hope, such as we find
here.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must at the same time bear in mind what I have
reminded you of elsewhere &#8212; that the Prophet directs his discourse one
while to the faithful only, who were then few in number, and that at another
time he addresses the multitude indiscriminately; and so when our Prophet
threatens, he regards the whole body of the people; but when he proclaims the
favor of God, it is the same as though he turned his eyes towards the faithful
only, and gathered them into a place by themselves. As for instance, when a few
among a people are really wise, and the whole multitude unite in hastening their
own ruin, he who has an address to make will make a distinction between the vast
multitude and the few; he will severely reprove those who are thus foolish, and
live for their own misery; and he will afterwards shape his discourse so as to
suit those with whom he has not so much fault to find. Thus also the Lord
changes his discourse; for at one time he addresses the ungodly, and at another
he turns to the elect, who were but a remnant. So the Prophet has hitherto
spoken by reproofs and threatening, for he addressed the whole body of the
people; but now he collects, as I have said, the remnant as it were by
themselves, and sets before them the hope of pardon and of
salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But
then</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk46</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

<i>ki</i>, as an adversative)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will I turn to the people a pure
lip</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God intimates that he would propagate his
grace wider, after having cleansed the earth; for he will be worshipped not only
in Judea, but by foreign nations, and even by the remotest. For it might have
been objected, Will God then extinguish his name in the world? For what will be
the state of things when Judea is overthrown and other nations destroyed, except
that God&#8217;s name will be exposed to reproach! It will nowhere be invoked,
and all will outvie one another in blasphemies against him. The Prophet meets
this objection, and says, that God has in his own hand the means by which he
will vindicate his own glory; for he will not only defend his Church in Judea,
but will also gather into it nations far and wide, so that his name shall be
everywhere celebrated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he speaks first of a pure lip,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
turn</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the nations a pure
lip</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By this word he means, that the invocation
of God&#8217;s name is his peculiar work; for men do not pray through the
suggestion of the flesh, but when God draws them. It is indeed true, that God
has ever been invoked by all nations; but it was not the right way of praying,
when they heedlessly cast their petitions into the air: and we also know, that
the true God was not invoked by the nations; for there was no nation then in the
world which had not formed for itself some idol. As then the earth was full of
innumerable idols, God was not invoked except in Judea only. Besides, though the
unbelieving had an intention to pray to God, yet they could not have prayed
rightly, for prayer flows from faith. God then does not without reason promise,
that he would turn pure lips to the nations; that is, that he would cause the
nations to call on his name with pure lips. We hence then learn what I have
stated &#8212; that God cannot be rightly invoked by us, until he draws us to
himself; for we have profane and impure lips. In short, the beginning of prayer
is from that hidden cleansing of the Spirit of which the Prophet now
speaks.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But if it be God&#8217;s singular gift, to turn a
pure lip to the nations, it follows that faith is conferred on us by him, for
both are connected together. As God then purifies the hearts of men by faith, so
also he purifies their lips that his name may be rightly invoked, which would
otherwise be profaned by the unbelieving. Whenever they pretend to call on
God&#8217;s name, it is certain that it is not done without
profanation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
it is to be referred to nations, not to each individual; for it has not been
that every one has called on God; but there have been some of all nations, as
Paul also says in the first chapter of the first Epistle to the Corinthians
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 1:1: for in addressing the faithful, he adds, &#8216;With all who
call on the name of the Lord in every place&#8217; &#8212; that is, not only in
Judea; and elsewhere he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;I would that men

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they may serve him with one
shoulder</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, that they may unitedly
submit to God in order to do him service; for to serve him with the shoulder is
to unite together, so as to help one another. The metaphor seems to have been
derived from those who carry a burden; for except each assists, one will be
overpowered, and then the burden will fall to the ground. We are said then to
serve God with one shoulder when we strive by mutual consent to assist one
another. And this ought to be carefully noticed, that we may know that our
striving cannot be approved by God, except we have thus the same end in view,
and seek also to add courage to others, and mutually to help one another. Unless
then the faithful thus render mutual assistance, the Lord cannot approve of
their service.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk47</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see how foolishly they talk who so much extol
free-will and whatever is connected with it: for the Lord demands faith as well
as other duties of religion; and he requires also from all, love and the keeping
of the whole law. But he testifies here that his name cannot be invoked, as the
lips of all are polluted, until he has consecrated them, cleansing by his Spirit
what was before polluted: and he shows also that men will not undertake the
yoke, unless he joins them together, so as to render them willing. I must not
proceed farther.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>

the mouth, but also prove that we do this sincerely, without any dissimulation,

<div><br><font face="Palatino">INTERPRETERS agree not as to the meaning of this
verse; for some of the Hebrews connect this with the former, as though the
Prophet was still speaking of the calling of the Gentiles. But others, with whom
I agree, apply this to the dispersed Jews, so that the Prophet here gives hope
of that restoration, of which he had before spoken. They who understand this of
the Gentiles, think that Atharai and Phorisai are proper names. But in the first
place, we cannot find that any nations were so called; and then, if we receive
what they say, these were not separate nations, but portions of the Ethiopians;
for the Prophet does not state the fact by itself, that Atharai and Phorisai
would be the worshipers of God; but after having spoken of Ethiopia, he adds
these words: hence we conclude, that the Prophet means this, &#8212; that they
would return into Judea from the farthest region of the Ethiopians to offer
sacrifices to God. And as he mentions the daughter of the dispersion, we must
understand this of the Jews, for it cannot be applied to the Ethiopians. And
this promise fits in well with the former verse: for the Prophet spoke,
according to what we observed yesterday, of the future calling of the Gentiles;
and now he adds, the Jews would come with the Gentiles, that they might unite
together, agreeing in the same faith, in the true and pure worship of the only
true God. He had said, that the kingdom would be enlarged, for the Church was to
be gathered from all nations: he now adds, that the elect people would be
restored, after having been driven away into exile.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Beyond the rivers of Ethiopia

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rt[</font><font face="Palatino">,

to be propitious; and therefore some take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yrt[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>otarim</i>, in a passive sense, they who shall be reconciled to God; as
though he had said, God will at length be propitious to the miserable exiles,
though they have been cast away beyond the rivers of Ethiopia: they shall yet
again be God&#8217;s people, for he will be reconciled to them. As David calls
Him the God of his mercy, because he had found him merciful and gracious,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;195901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
59:18,) so also in this place they think that the Jews are said to be the
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yrt[</font><font face="Palatino">,
the reconciled of Jehovah, because he would be reconciled to them. But this
exposition is too forced: I therefore retain that which I have stated, &#8212;
that some suppliants would come to God from the utmost parts of Ethiopia, not
the Ethiopians themselves, but the Jews who had been driven
there.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To the same purpose is what is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The daughter of my

this prophecy extends to the time of the Gospel, it is yet no wonder, that the
Prophet describes the worship of God such as it had been, accompanied with the
ceremonies of the Law. We now then perceive what Zephaniah means in this verse,
&#8212; that not only the Gentiles would come into the Church of God, but that
the Jews also would return to their country, that they might together make one

<div><br><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet teaches us, that the Church
would be different, when God removed the dross and gathered to himself a pure
and chosen people: and the Prophet stated this, that the faithful might not
think it hard that God so diminished his Church that hardly the tenth part
remained; for it was a sad and a bitter thing, that of a vast multitude a very
few only remained. It could not then be, but that the ruin of their brethren
greatly affected the Jews, though they knew them to be reprobate. We indeed see
how Paul felt a sympathy, when he saw that his own nation were alienated from
God.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:1. So it was necessary that some consolation should be given to the faithful,
that they might patiently bear the diminution of the Church, which had been
previously predicted. Hence the Prophet, that he might moderate their grief,
says, that this would be for their good; for in this manner the reproaches were
to be removed, by which the Jewish name had been polluted, and rendered
abominable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt not be
ashamed</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for the sins by which I have been

it is God&#8217;s purpose to reserve a few, by whom he will be purely
worshipped. Some think that he does not speak here of the remission of sins, but
on the contrary, of a pure and holy life, which follows regeneration; as though
he had said, &#8220;There will be no reason any more for thee to be ashamed of
thy life; for when I shall chasten you, ye will then fear me, and your
correction will be conducive to a newness of life: since then your life will not
be the same as formerly, and since my glory shall shine forth among you, there
will be no cause why ye should be ashamed.&#8221; But this is a strained view,
and cannot be accommodated to the words of the Prophet; for he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt no more be ashamed of
the sins by which thou hast transgressed against
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We hence see that this cannot be otherwise
applied than to the remission of sins. But the last clause has led interpreters
astray, for the Prophet adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For
I will take away from the midst of thee those who
exult</i></font><font face="Palatino">: but the Prophet&#8217;s design, as I
have stated, was different from what they have supposed; for he shows that there
was no reason for the Jews to lament and deplore the diminution of the Church
because the best compensation was offered to them, which was, that by this small
number God would be purely served. For when the body of the people was complete,
it was, we know, a mass of iniquity. How then could Israel glory in its vast
number, since they were all like the giants carrying on war against God? When
now God collects a few only, these few would at length acknowledge that they had
been preserved in a wonderful manner, in order that religion and the true
worship of God should not be extinguished in the earth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive the Prophet&#8217;s design; but I
will endeavor to render this clearer by a comparison: Suppose that in a city
licentiousness of life so prevails that the people may seem to be irreclaimable;
when it happens that the city itself falls away from its power and pristine
state, or is in some other way reformed, not without loss, and is thus led to
improve its morals, this would be a compensation to the good, and would give
courage to the godly and ease their grief, so that they would patiently submit,
though the city had not the same abundance, nor the same wealth and enjoyments.
How so? because they who remained would form a body of people free from reproach
and disgrace. When disease is removed from the human body, the body itself is
necessarily weakened; and it is sometimes necessary to amputate a member, that
the whole body may be preserved. In this case there is a grievous diminution,
but as there is no other way of preserving the body, the remedy ought to be
patiently sustained. In a similar manner does the Prophet now speak of the city
Jerusalem: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt not be
ashamed of the sins by which thou hast transgressed against
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. How so? Because they were to be separated
from the profane and gross despisers of God; for as long as the good and the
evil were mixed together, it was a reproach common to all. Jerusalem was then a
den of robbers; it was, as it were, a hell on earth; and all were alike exposed
to the same infamy, for the pure part could not be distinguished, as a mass of
evil prevailed everywhere. The Prophet now says, Thou shalt not be ashamed of
thy former infamy. Why? &#8220;Because God will separate the chaff from the
wheat, and will gather the wheat; ye shall be, as it were, in the storehouse of
God; the chosen seed shall alone remain; there will be such purity, that the
glory of the Lord shall shine forth among you: ye shall not therefore be ashamed
of the disgraceful deeds by which ye are now
contaminated.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now apprehend the meaning of the words. But it may
seem strange that the Prophet should say, that sins should be covered by
oblivion, which the Jews ought indeed to have thought of often and almost at all
times, according to what Ezekiel says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Thou wilt then
remember thy ways, and be
ashamed,&#8217;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;263606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
36:61)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">that is, when God shall be pacified. Ezekiel says,
that the fruit of repentance would be, that the faithful, covered with shame,
would condemn themselves. Why so? Because the reprobate proceed in their wicked
courses, as it were, with closed eyes, and as it has been previously said, they
know no shame: though God charges them with their sins, they yet despise and
reject every warning with a shameless front; yea, they kick against the goads.
Since it is so, justly does Ezekiel say, that shame would be the fruit of true
repentance, according to what Paul also says in the sixth chapter to the Romans
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:1, &#8220;Of which ye are now ashamed.&#8221; He intimates, that when they
were sunk in their unbelief, they were so given to shameful deeds, that they
perceived not their abomination. They began therefore to be ashamed, when they
became illuminated. The Prophet seems now to cut off this fruit from repentance:
but what he says ought to be otherwise understood, that is, that the Church
would be then free from reproach; for the reprobate would be separated, all the
filth would be taken away, when God gathered only the remnant for himself; for
in this manner, as it has been said, the wheat would be separated from the
chaff. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt not then be
ashamed in that day of evil deeds; for I will take away from the midst of thee
those who exult</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He shows how necessary the
diminution would be; for all must have perished, had not God cut off the putrid
members. How severe soever then and full of pain the remedy would be, it ought
yet to be deemed tolerable; for the Church, that is the body, could not
otherwise be preserved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be again objected &#8212; That the Church
is cleansed from all spots, inasmuch as the reprobate are taken away; for he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt not be ashamed
of the evil deeds by which thou hast sinned</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
literally, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>against
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, by which thou hast transgressed
against me. God here addresses, it may be said, the faithful themselves: He then
does not speak of the evil deeds of those whom the Lord had rejected. But the
answer is easy: When he says, that the Church had sinned, he refers to that
mixture, by which no distinction is made between the wheat and the chaff. We may
say that a city is impious and wicked, when the majority so much exceeds in
number the good, that they do not appear. When therefore among ten thousand men
there are only thirty or even a smaller number who are anxious for a better
state of things, the whole number will be generally counted wicked on account of
the larger portion, for the others are hid, and, as it were, covered over and
buried. Justly then and correctly does Zephaniah declare, that the Jews had
transgressed against God; for in that mixed multitude the elect could not have
been distinguished from the reprobate. But he now promises that there would be a
distinction, when God took away the proud, who exulted in vain boasting. For he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will take away from the
midst of thee those who exult in thy
pride</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some render the word in the abstract, the exultations
of thy pride: but the term
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yzyl[</font><font face="Palatino">,
found here, is never in construction rendered exultations. It is therefore no
doubt to be understood of men. He then names the pride of the people; and yet he
addresses the elect, who were afterwards to be gathered. What does this mean?
even what we have already stated, that before the Church was cleansed from her
pollution and filth, there was a common exultation and insolence against God;
for these words were everywhere heard &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;We are God&#8217;s
holy people, we are a chosen race, we are a royal priesthood, we are a holy
inheritance.&#8221; Ezra 19:6.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since, then, these boastings were in the mouth of
them all, the Prophet says, that it was the pride of the whole people.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>take
away</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the midst of thee those who
exult in thy pride</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk49</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt no more add to take
pride in my holy mountain</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here the Prophet
points out the main spring of the evil, because the Jews had hardened themselves
in a perverse self-confidence, as they thought that all things were lawful for
them, inasmuch as they were God&#8217;s chosen people. Jeremiah also in a
similar manner represents their boasting as false, when they pretended to be the
temple of God.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240704&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
7:4. So our Prophet condemns this pride, because they concealed their sins under
the shadow of the temple, and thought it a sufficient defense, that God dwelt on
Mount Sion. To show, then, that the people were unhealable, without being
cleansed from this pride, the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will take away those who exult
&#8212; </i></font><font face="Palatino">How did they exult?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in thy
pride</i></font><font face="Palatino">: and what was this pride? that they
inhabited the holy mount of God, besides which there was no other sanctuary of
God on earth. As then they imagined that God was thus bound to them, they
insolently despised all admonitions, as though they were exempt from every law
and restraint. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt not
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>add to take pride in my holy
mountain</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see how careful we ought to be, lest the
favors of God, which ought by their brightness to guide us to heaven, should
darken our minds. But as we are extremely prone to arrogance and pride, we ought
carefully to seek to conduct ourselves in a meek and humble manner, when favored
with God&#8217;s singular benefits; for when we begin falsely to glory in
God&#8217;s name, and to put on an empty mask to cover our sins, it is all over
with us; inasmuch as to our wickedness, to our contempt of God, and to other
evil lusts and passions, there is added perverseness, for we persevere in our
course, as it were, with an iron and inflexible neck. Thus, indeed, it happens
to all hypocrites, who elate themselves through false pretenses as to their
connection with God. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet pursues the same subject &#8212;
that God would provide for the safety of his Church, by cutting off the majority
of the people, and by reserving a few; for his purpose was to gather for himself
a pure and holy Church, as the city had previously been full of all uncleanness.
It ought, then, to have been a compensation to ease their grief, when the godly
saw that God would be propitious to them, though he had treated them with great
severity. And we must bear in mind what I have before stated &#8212; that the
Church could not have been preserved without correcting and subduing that
arrogance, which arose from a false profession as to God. Zephaniah takes it now
as granted, that pride could not be torn away from their hearts, except they
were wholly cast down, and thus made contrite. He then teaches us, that as long
as they remained whole, they were ever proud, and that hence it was necessary to
apply a violent remedy, that they might learn meekness and humility; which he
intimates when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the
residue of the people would be humble and
afflicted</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for if they had become willingly
teachable, there would have been no need of so severe a correction. In short,
though the faithful lament that God should thus almost annihilate his Church,
yet in order that they might not murmur, he shows that this was a necessary
remedy. How so? because they would have always conducted themselves arrogantly
against God, had they not been afflicted. It was, therefore, needful for them to
be in a manner broken, because they could not be bent.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will</i></font><font face="Palatino">, then, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>make the residue an afflicted and
a poor people</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yn[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>oni</i>, means humble; but as he adds the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ld</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>dal</i>, he no doubt shows that the Jews could not be corrected without being
stripped of all the materials of their glorying. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk50</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> They
were, indeed, extremely wedded to their boastings; yea, they were become
hardened in their contempt of God. He therefore says, that this fruit would at
last follow, that they would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>trust in the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, when he had laid them
prostrate.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This verse contains a most useful instruction: for
first we are taught that the Church is subdued by the cross, that she may know
her pride, which is so innate and so fixed in the hearts of men, that it cannot
be removed, except the Lord, so to speak, roots it out by force. There is then
no wonder that the faithful are so much humbled be the Lord, and that the lot of
the Church is so contemptible; for if they had more vigor, they would soon, as
is often the case, break out into an insolent spirit. That the Lord, then, may
keep his elect under restraint, he subdues and tames them by poverty. In short,
he exercises them under the cross. This is one thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must also notice the latter clause, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall trust in the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, those who have been reduced to
poverty and want. We hence see for what purpose God deprives us of all earthly
trust, and takes away from us every ground of glorying; it is, that we may rely
only on his favor. This dependence ought not, indeed, to be extorted from us,
for what can be more desirable than to trust in God? But while men arrogate to
themselves more than what is right, and thus put themselves in the place of God,
they cannot really and sincerely trust in him. They indeed imagine that they
trust in God, when they ascribe to him a part of their salvation; but except
this be done wholly, no trust can be placed in God. It is hence necessary that
they who ascribe to themselves even the smallest thing, should be reduced to
nothing: and this is what the Prophet means. Let us further know, that men do
not profit under God&#8217;s scourges, except they wholly deny themselves, and
forget their own power, which they falsely imagine, and recomb on him
alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet speaks of the elect alone; for we see
that many are severely afflicted, and are not softened, nor do they put off
their former hardihood. But the Lord so chastises his people, that by the spirit
of meekness he corrects in them all pride and haughtiness. But by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall trust in the name of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he sets this trust in contrast with
the pride which he had previously condemned. They indeed wished to appear to
trust in the name of God, when they boasted of Mount Sion, and haughtily brought
forward the adoption by which they had been separated from heathen nations; but
it was a false boasting, which had no trust in it. To trust, then, in the name
of Jehovah is nothing else than sincerely to embrace the favor which he offers
in his word, and not to make vain pretenses, but to call on him with a pure
heart and with a deep feeling of penitence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For the same purpose he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The residue of Israel shall no
more work iniquity nor speak falsehood; nor shall there be found a deceitful
tongue in their mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet continues
the same subject &#8212; that the Church is not to be less esteemed when it
consists only of a few men; for in the vast number there was great filth, which
not only polluted the earth by its ill savor, but infected heaven itself. Since
then Jerusalem was full of iniquities, as long as the people remained entire,
the Prophet adduces this comfort, that there was no reason for sorrow, if from a
vast number as the sand of the sea, and from a great multitude like the stars,
God would only collect a small band; for by this means the Church would be
cleansed. And it was of great importance that the filth should be cleansed from
God&#8217;s sanctuary; for what could have been more disgraceful than that the
holy place should be made the lodging of swine, and that the place which God
designed to be consecrated to himself, should be profaned? As then Jerusalem was
the sanctuary of God, ought not true religion to have flourished there? But when
it became polluted with every kind of filth, the Prophet shows that it ought not
to have seemed grievous that the Lord should take away that vast multitude which
falsely boasted that they professed his name.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall not
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>work
iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Under one kind of expression he includes the whole of
a righteous life, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall not speak falsely, nor
will there be found a deceitful tongue</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is
indeed sufficient for the practice of piety or integrity of life to keep the
tongue free from frauds and falsehood; but as it cannot be that any one will
abstain from all frauds and falsehood, except he purely and from the heart fears
God, the Prophet, by including the whole under one thing, expresses under the
word tongue what embraces complete holiness of life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may be now asked, whether this has ever been
fulfilled. It is indeed certain, that though few returned to their own country,
there were yet many hypocrites among that small number; for as soon as the
people reached their own land, every one, as we find, was so bent on his own
advantages, that they polluted themselves with heathen connections, that they
neglected the building of the temple, and deprived the priests of their tenths,
that they became cold in the worship of God. With these things they were charged
by Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. Since these things were so, what means this
promise, that there would be no iniquity when God had cleansed his Church? The
Prophet speaks comparatively; for the Lord would so cleanse away the spots from
his people that their holiness would then appear more pure. Though then many
hypocrites were still mixed with the good and real children of God, it was yet
true that iniquity was not so prevalent, that frauds and falsehood were not so
rampant among the people as they were before.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For they shall feed and lie down,
and there will be none to terrify them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He
mentions another benefit from God &#8212; that he will protect his people from
all wrongs when they had repented. We must ever bear in mind what I have stated
&#8212; that the Prophet intended here to heal the sorrow of the godly, which
night have otherwise wholly dejected their minds. That he might then in some
measure alleviate the grief of God&#8217;s children, he brings forward this
argument &#8212; &#8220;Though few shall remain, it is yet well that the Lord
will cleanse away the filth of the holy city, that it may be justly deemed to be
God&#8217;s habitation, which was before the den of thieves. It is not then a
loss to you, that few will dwell in the holy land, for God will be a faithful
guardian of your safety. What need then is there of a large multitude, except to
render you safe from enemies and from wild beasts? What does it signify, if God
receives you under his protection, under the condition that ye shall be secure,
though not able to resist your enemies? Though one cannot defend another, yet if
God be your protector, and ye be made to live in peace under the defense which
he promises, there is no reason why ye should say, that you have suffered a
great loss, when your great number was made small. It is then enough for you to
live under God&#8217;s guardianship; for though the whole world were united
against you, and ye had no strength nor defense yourselves, yet the Lord can
preserve you; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there will be no
one to terrify you</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this argument is taken from the law; for it is
mentioned among other blessings, that God would render safe the life of his
people; which is an invaluable blessing, and without which the life of men, we
know, must be miserable; for nothing is more distressing than constant fear, and
nothing is more conducive to happiness than a quiet life: and hence to live in
quietness and free from all fear, is what the Lord promises as a chief blessing
to his people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet confirms what he has been teaching,
and encourages the faithful to rejoice, as though he saw with his eyes what he
had previously promised. For thus the Prophets, while encouraging the faithful
to entertain hope, stimulate them to testify their gratitude, as though
God&#8217;s favor was already enjoyed. It is certain, that this instruction was
set before the Jews for this purpose, &#8212; that in their exile and extreme
distress they might yet prepare themselves to give thanks to God, as though they
were already, as they say, in possession of what they had prayed for. But we
must remember the design of our Prophet, and the common mode of proceeding which
all the Prophets followed; for the faithful are exhorted to praise God the same
as if they had already enjoyed his blessings, which yet were remote, and seemed
concealed from their view.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive what the Prophet meant in
encouraging the Jews to praise God: he indeed congratulates them as though they
were already enjoying that happiness, which was yet far distant: but as it is a
congratulation only, we must also bear in mind, that God deals so bountifully
with his Church as to stimulate the faithful to gratitude; for we pollute all
his benefits, except we return for them, as it has been stated elsewhere, the
sacrifice of praise: and as a confirmation of this is the repetition found here,
which would have otherwise appeared superfluous. &#8220;Exult, daughter of Sion,
shout, be glad; rejoice with all thine heart, daughter of Jerusalem.&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet was not thus earnest without reason;
for he saw how difficult it was to console the afflicted, especially when God
manifested no evidence of hope according to the perception of the flesh; but his
purpose was by this heap of words to fortify them, that they might with more
alacrity struggle with so many hard and severe trials.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds, that God had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>taken away the judgments
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of Zion. By judgments, he means those
punishments which would have been inflicted if it had been the Lord&#8217;s
purpose to deal according to strict justice with the Jews, as when any one says
in our language, <i>J&#8217;ai brule tous tes proces</i>. He intimates then that
God would no more make an enquiry as to the sins of his people. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fp&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>meshiphath</i>, we know, has various meanings in Hebrew; but in this place,
as I have said, it means what we call in French, <i>Toutes procedures</i>. In
short, God declares that the sins of his people are buried, so that he in a
manner cuts off his character as a judge, and remits his own right, so that he
will no more contend with the Jews, or summon them, as they say, to trial.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will take away thy
judgments</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk52</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then follows an explanation,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By clearing he has turned aside
all enemies</i></font><font face="Palatino">; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk53</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for we
know that war is one of God&#8217;s judgments. As then God had punished the Jews
by the Assyrians, by the Egyptians, by the Chaldeans, and by other heathen
nations, he says now, that all enemies would be turned away. It hence follows,
that neither the Assyrians nor the Chaldeans had assailed them merely through
their own inclination, but that they were, according to what has been elsewhere
stated, the swords, as it were, of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It afterwards follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The king of Israel is Jehovah in
the midst of thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here the Prophet briefly
shows, that the sum of real and true happiness is then possessed, when God
declares, that he undertakes the care of his people. God is said to be in the
midst of us, when he testifies that we live under his guardianship and
protection. Properly speaking, he never forsakes his own; but these forms of
speech, we know, are to be referred to the perception of the flesh. When the
Lord is said to be afar off, or to dwell in the midst of us, it is to be
understood with reference to our ideas: for we think God to be then absent when
he gives liberty to our enemies, and we seem to be exposed as a prey to them;
but God is said to dwell in the midst of us when he protects us by his power,
and turns aside all assaults. Thus, then, our Prophet now says, that God will be
in the midst of his Church; for he would really and effectually prove that he is
the guardian of his elect people. He had been indeed for a time absent, when his
people were deprived of all help, according to what Moses expresses when he
says, that the people had denuded themselves, because they had renounced God, by
whose hand they had been safely protected, and were also to be protected to the
end.

<div><font face="Palatino">He lastly adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt not see
evil</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some read, &#8220;Thou shalt not fear
evil,&#8221; by inserting
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">y</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>iod</i>; but the meaning is the same: for the verb, to see, in Hebrew is, we
know, often to be taken in the sense of finding or experiencing.

quietness, free from every disturbance. If the other reading, Thou shalt not
fear evil, be preferred, then the reference is to the blessing promised in the
law; for nothing is more desirable than peace and tranquillity. Since then this
is the chief of temporal blessings, the Prophet does not without reason say,
that the Church would be exempt from all fear and anxiety, when God should dwell
in the midst of it, according to what he says in

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet proceeds still to confirm the same
truth, but employs a different mode of speaking. It shall, he says, be then said
everywhere to Zion, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fear not, let
not thine hands be let down</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. For these
words may no less suitably be applied to the common report or applause of all
men, then to the prophetic declaration; so that the expression, It shall be
said, may be the common congratulation, which all would vie to offer. The import
of the whole is, that Jerusalem would be so tranquil that either the Prophets,
or all with common consent would say, &#8220;Thou enjoyest thy rest: for God
really shows that he cares for thee; there is therefore no cause for thee
hereafter to fear.&#8221; For there is expressed here a real change: since the
Jews had been before in daily fear, the Prophet intimates, that they would be so
safe from every danger, as to be partakers of the long-wished-for rest, with the
approbation even of the whole world. Hence, it shall be said &#8212; by whom?
either by the Prophets, or by common report: it makes no great difference,
whether there would be teachers to announce their state joyful and prosperous,
or whether all men would, by common consent, applaud God&#8217;s favor, when he
had removed from his people all wars, troubles, and fears, so as to make them
live in quietness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It shall
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be said to Jerusalem, fear not;
Sion! let not thine hands be relaxed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By saying
Fear not, and let not thine hands be relaxed, he intimates, that all vigor is so
relaxed by fear, that no member can perform its function. But by taking a part
for the whole, he understands by the word hands, every other part of the body;
for by the hands men perform their works. Hence in Scripture the hands often
signify the works of men. The meaning then is &#8212; that God&#8217;s Church
would then be in such a state of quietness as to be able to discharge all its
duties and transact its concerns peaceably and orderly. And it is what we also
know by experience, that when fear prevails in our hearts we are as it were
lifeless, so that we cannot raise even a finger to do anything: but when hope
animates us, there is a vigor in the whole body, so that alacrity appears
everywhere. The Prophet, no doubt, means here, that God thus succors his elect,
not that they may indulge in pleasures, as is too often the case, but that they
may, on the contrary, strenuously devote themselves to the performance of their
duties. We ought therefore to notice the connection between a tranquil state and
diligent hands; for, as I have said, God does not free us from all trouble and
fear, that we may grow torpid in our pleasures, but that we may, on the
contrary, be more attentive to our duty.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sion</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
then! </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>let thine hands be no more
torpid &#8212; </i></font><font face="Palatino">Why?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the midst of thee
strong, will save</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He repeats what he had said,
but more fully expresses what might have appeared obscure on account of its
brevity. He therefore shows here more at large the benefit of God&#8217;s
presence &#8212; that God will not dwell idly in his Church, but will be
accompanied with his power. For what end? To save. We hence see that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwbg</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gebur</i>, ascribed to God, is very emphatical; as though he had said, that
God would not be idle while residing in the midst of his Church, but would
become its evident strength. And it is worthy of notice, that God exhibits not
himself as strong that he may terrify his elect, but only that he may become
their preserver.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will rejoice over thee with
gladness</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This must be referred to the
gratuitous love of God, by which he embraces and cherishes his Church, as a
husband his wife whom he most tenderly loves. Such feelings, we know, belong not
to God; but this mode of speaking, which often occurs in Scripture, is thus to
be understood by us; for as God cannot otherwise show his favor towards us and
the greatness of his love, he compares himself to a husband, and us to a wife.
He means in short &#8212; that God is most highly pleased when he can show
himself kind to his Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms and shows again the same thing more
clearly, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will be at rest
</i></font><font face="Palatino">(or silent)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in his
love</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The proper meaning of
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;rj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>charesh</i>, is to be silent, but it means here to be at rest. The import is,
that God will be satisfied, as we say in French, <i>Il prendra tout son
contentement</i>; as though he had said that God wished nothing more than
sweetly and quietly to cherish his Church. As I have already said, this feeling
is indeed ascribed to God with no strict correctness; for we know that he can
instantly accomplish whatever it pleases him: but he assumes the character of
men; for except he thus speaks familiarly with us, he cannot fully show how much
he loves us. God then shall be at rest in his love; that is, &#8220;It will be
his great delight, it will be the chief pleasure of thy God when he cherishes
thee: as when one cherishes a wife most dear to him, so God will then rest in
his love.&#8221; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He then says, He
will exult over thee with joy</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk54</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These hyperbolic terms seem indeed to set forth
something inconsistent, for what can be more alien to God&#8217;s glory than to
exult like man when influenced by joy arising from love? It seems then that the
very nature of God repudiates these modes of speaking, and the Prophet appears
as though he had removed God from his celestial throne to the earth. A heathen
poet says, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Not well do agree,
nor dwell on the same
throne,</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Majesty and
love. (Ovid. Met. Lib. 2: 816-7.)</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God indeed represents himself here as a husband, who
burns with the greatest love towards his wife; and this does not seem, as we
have said, to be suitable to his glory; but whatever tends to this end &#8212;
to convince us of God&#8217;s ineffable love towards us, so that we may rest in
it, and being weaned as it were from the world, may seek this one thing only,
that he may confer on us his favor &#8212; whatever tends to this, doubtless
illustrates the glory of God, and derogates nothing from his nature. We at the
same time see that God, as it were, humbles himself; for if it be asked whether
these things are suitable to the nature of God, we must say, that nothing is
more alien to it. It may then appear by no means congruous, that God should be
described by us as a husband who burns with love to his wife: but we hence more
fully learn, as I have already said, how great is God&#8217;s favor towards us,
who thus humbles himself for our sake, and in a manner transforms himself, while
he puts on the character of another. Let every one of us come home also to
himself, and acknowledge how deep is the root of unbelief; for God cannot
provide for our good and correct this evil, to which we are all subject, without
departing as it were from himself, that he might come nigher to
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And whenever we meet with this mode of speaking, we
ought especially to remember, that it is not without reason that God labors so
much to persuade us of his love, because we are not only prone by nature to
unbelief, but exposed to the deceits of Satan, and are also inconstant and
easily drawn away from his word: hence it is that he assumes the character of
man. We must, at the same time, observe what I have before stated &#8212; that
whatever is calculated to set forth the love of God, does not derogate from his
glory; for his chief glory is that vast and ineffable goodness by which he has
once embraced us, and which he will show us to the end.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What the Prophet says of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that day
</i></font><font face="Palatino">is to be extended to the whole kingdom of
Christ. He indeed speaks of the deliverance of the people; but we must ever bear
in mind what I have already stated &#8212; that it is not one year, or a few
years, which are intended, when the Prophets speak of future redemption; for the
time which is now mentioned began when the people were restored from the
Babylonian captivity, and continues its course to the final advent of Christ.
And hence also we learn that these hyperbolic expressions are not extravagant,
when the Prophets say, Thou shalt not afterwards fear, nor see evil: for if we
regard the dispersion of that people, doubtless no trial, however heavy, can
happen to us, which is not moderate, when we compare our lot with the state of
the ancient people; for the land of Canaan was then the only pledge of
God&#8217;s favor and love. When, therefore, the Jews were ejected from their
inheritance, it was, as we have said elsewhere, a sort of repudiation; it was
the same as if a father were to eject from his house a son, and to repudiate
him. Christ was not as yet manifested to the world. The miserable Jews had an
evidence, in figures and shadows, of that future favor which was afterwards
manifested by the gospel. Since, then, God gave them so small an evidence of his
love, how could it be otherwise but that they must have fainted, when driven far
away from their land? Though the Church is now scattered and torn, and seems
little short of being ruined, yet God is ever present with us in his
only-begotten Son: we have also the gate of the celestial kingdom fully opened.
There is, therefore, administered to us at all times more abundant reasons for
joy than formerly to the ancient people, especially when they seemed to have
been rejected by God. This is the reason why the Prophet says, that the Church
would be lessened by calamities, when God again gathered it. But that redemption
of the people of Israel ought at this day to be borne in mind by us; for it was
a memorable work of God, by which he intended to afford a perpetual testimony
that he is the deliverer of all those who hope in him. It follows

<div><br><font face="Palatino">He proceeds here with the same subject, but in
different words; for except some consolation had been introduced, what the
Prophet has hitherto said would have been frigid; for he had promised them joy,
he had exhorted the chosen of God to offer praise and thanksgiving; but they
were at the same time in a most miserable state. It was hence necessary to add
this declaration respecting the exiles being gathered.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>at the

from the time; though
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mem</i>, may sometimes be rendered as a particle of comparison. Interpreters
do not seem to me rightly to understand the Prophet&#8217;s meaning: for I do
not doubt but that he points out here the fixed time of deliverance, as though
he had said, I will again gather thine afflicted, and those who have endured thy
reproach. When? at the time,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d[wmm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>memuod</i>; that is, at the determined or fixed time: for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d[wm</font><font face="Palatino">,

time, as we say in French, <i>Un terme prefix</i>.

</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gather thine
afflicted</i></font><font face="Palatino">, but not soon. Our Prophet then holds
the faithful here somewhat in suspense, that they might continue in their watch
tower, and patiently wait for God&#8217;s help; for we know how great is our
haste, and how we run headlong when we hope for anything; but this celerity,
according to the old proverb, is often delay to us. Since, then, men are always
carried away by a certain heat, or by too much impetuosity, to lay hold on what
may happen, the Prophet here lays a restraint, and intimates that God has his
own seasons to fulfill what he has promised, that he will not do so soon, nor
according to the will of men, but when the suitable time shall come. And this
time is that which he has appointed, not what we desire.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who have sustained reproach for
her</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In this second clause the Prophet no doubt
repeats the same thing; but at the same time he points out, not without reason,
their condition &#8212; that the Jews suffered reproach and contumely at the
time of their exile, and that on account of being the Church; that is, because
they professed to worship their own God; for on account of his name the Jews
were hated by all nations, inasmuch as their religion was different from the
superstitions of all heathens. It could not hence be, but that the unbelieving
should vex them with many reproaches, when they were carried away into exile,
and scattered in all directions. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk55</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He had said before, I will gather the afflicted; but
he now adds, I will gather those who have sustained reproach. I have stated that
some read, A burden upon her is reproach; but no sense can be elicited from such
words. The Prophet does here no doubt obviate a temptation which awaited
God&#8217;s children, who would have to experience in exile what was most
grievous to be borne; for they were to be exposed to the taunts and ridicule of
all nations. Hence he seasonably heals their grief by saying, that though for a
time they would be laughed at by the ungodly, they would yet return to their own
country; for the Lord had resolved to gather them. But we must ever remember
what I have said &#8212; that God would do this in his own time, when he thought
it seasonable. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">He confirms here what I have referred to in the
last verse that God would overcome all obstacles, when his purpose was to
restore his people. On this the Prophet, as we have said, dwells, that the Jews
might in their exile sustain themselves with the hope of deliverance. As, then,
they could not instantly conceive what was so incredible according to the
perceptions of the flesh, he testifies that there is sufficient power in God to
subdue all enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>At that
time</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says, he repeats what had been stated
before &#8212; that his people must wait as long as God pleases to exercise them
under the cross; for if their option had been given to the Jews, they would have
willingly continued at their ease; and we know how men are wont to exempt
themselves from every trouble, fear, and sorrow. As therefore men naturally
desire rest and immunity from all evil, the Prophet here exhorts the faithful to
patience, and shows, that it cannot be that God will become their deliverer,
except they submit to his chastisement; at that time then. It is ever to be
observed, that the Prophet condemns that extreme haste which usually takes hold
of men when God chastises them. However slowly then and gradually God proceeds
in the work of delivering his own, the Prophet shows here, that there was no
reason for them to despair, or to be broken down in their spirits. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fk56</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then subjoins, that he would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>save the halting, and restore the
driven away</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By these words he means, that
though the Church would be maimed and torn, there would yet be nothing that
could hinder God to restore her: for by the halting and the driven away he
understands none other than one so stripped of power as wholly to fail in
himself. He therefore compares the Church of God to a person, who, with relaxed
limbs, is nearly dead. Hence, when we are useless as to any work, what else is
our life but a languor like to death? But the Prophet declares here, that the
seasonable time would come when God would relieve his own people: though they
were to become prostrate and fallen, though they were to be scattered here and
there, like a torn body of man, an arm here and a leg there, every limb
separated; yet he declares that nothing could possibly prevent God to gather his
Church and restore it to its full vigor and strength. In short, he means that
the restoration of the Church would be a kind of resurrection; for the Lord
would humble his people until they became almost lifeless, so as not to be able
to breathe: but he would at length gather them, and so gather them that they
would not only breathe but be replenished with such new vigor as though they had
received no loss. I cannot finish the whole
today.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>

heaven so as to be heard through the name of thy Son, until being at length

us in heaven, and which thine only begotten Son has procured for us.

<div><font face="Palatino">WE stopped yesterday at the latter clause of the last
verse but one of the Prophet Zephaniah, where God promises that the Jews, who
had been before not only obscure, but also exposed to all kinds of reproaches,
would again become illustrious; for to give them for a name and for a praise, is
no other thing than to render them celebrated, that they might be, as they say,
in the mouth of every one.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the land of their
shame</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or reproach; for they had been a mockery
everywhere; as the unbelieving thought that they deluded themselves with a vain
hope, because they boasted that God, under whose protection they lived, would be
their perpetual guardian, though they were driven away into exile. Hence an
occasion for taunt and ridicule was given. But a change for the better is here
promised; for all in Assyria and Chaldea would have to see that this was a
people chosen by God; so that there would be a remarkable testimony among all
nations, that all who trust in God are by no means disappointed, for they find
that he is faithful in his promises. The last verse follows

interpreters, who have rendered the word in the singular number; for the Prophet
mentions captivities designedly, as the Jews had not only been driven into
exile, but had also been scattered through various countries, so that they were
not one captive people, but many troops of captives. Hence his purpose was to
obviate a doubt; for it would not have been enough that one captivity should be
restored, except all who had been dispersed were collected into one body by the
wonderful power of God. And hence he adds before your eyes, that the Jews might
be convinced that they should be eye-witnesses of this miracle, which yet they
could hardly conceive, without raising up their thoughts above the
world.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">CALVIN&#8217;S
PREFACE TO HAGGAI</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">AFTER the return of the people, they were favored, we
know, especially with three Prophets, who roused their fainting hearts, and
finished all predictions, until at length the Redeemer came in his appointed
time. During the time of THE BABYLONIAN EXILE the office of teaching was
discharged among the captives by EZEKIEL, and also by Daniel; and there were
others less celebrated; for we find that some of the Psalms were then composed,
either by the Levites, or by some other teachers. But these two, Ezekiel and
Daniel, were above all others eminent. Then Ezra and Nehemiah followed them, the
authority of whom was great among the people; but we do not read that they were
endued with the Prophetic gift.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then appears certain that three only were divinely
inspired to proclaim the future condition of the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">DANIEL had before them foretold whatever was to
happen till the coming of Christ, and his Book is a remarkable mirror of
God&#8217;s Providence; for he paints, as on a tablet, three things which were
to be fulfilled after his death, and of which no man could have formed any
conjecture. He has given even the number of years from the return of the people
to the building of the Temple, and also to the death of Christ. But we must come
to the other witnesses, who confirmed the predictions of Daniel. The Lord raised
up three witnesses &#8212; HAGGAI, ZECHARIAH, and MALACHI.

they all neglected the building of the Temple; and he shows that they were
deservedly suffering punishment for their ingratitude; for they despised God
their Deliverer, or at least honored him less than they ought to have done, and
deprived him of the worship due to him. He then encouraged them to hope for a
complete restoration, and showed that there was no reason for them to be
disheartened by difficulties, and that though they were surrounded by enemies,
and had to bear many evils, and were terrified by threatening edicts, they ought
yet to have entertained hope; for the Lord would perform the work which he had
begun &#8212; to restore their ancient dignity to his people, and Christ also
would at length come to secure the perfect happiness and glory of the
Church.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet mentions here the year, the month, and
the day in which he began to rouse up the people from their sloth and idleness,
by the command of God; for every one studied his own domestic interest, and had
no concern for building the Temple.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This happened, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the second year of Darius the
king</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Interpreters differ as to this time; for
they do not agree as to the day or year in which the Babylonian captivity began.
Some date the beginning of the seventy years at the ruin which happened under
Jeconiah, before the erasing of the city, and the destruction of the Temple. It
is, however, probable, that a considerable time had passed before Haggai began
his office as a Prophet; for Babylon was taken twenty years, or little more,
before the death of king Cyrus; his son Cambyses, who reigned eight years,
succeeded him. The third king was Darius, the son of Hystaspes, whom the Jews
will have to be the son of Ahasuerus by Esther; but no credit is due to their
fancies; for they hazard any bold notion in matters unknown, and assert anything
that may come to their brains or to their mouths; and thus they deal in fables,
and for the most part without any semblance of truth. It may be sufficient for
us to understand, that this Darius was the son of Hystaspes, who succeeded
Cambyses, (for I omit the seven months of the Magi; for as they crept in by
deceit, so shortly after they were destroyed;) and it is probable that Cambyses,
who was the first-born son of Cyrus, had no male heir. Hence it was that his
brother being slain by the consent of the nobles, the kingdom came to Darius.
He, then, as we may learn from histories, was the third king of the Persians.
Daniel says, in the fifth chapter
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;270501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
5:1, that the city of Babylon had been taken by Cyrus, but that Darius the Mede
reigned there.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But between writers there is some disagreement on
this point; though all say that Cyrus was king, yet Xenophon says, that Cyaxares
was ever the first, so that Cyrus sustained only the character, as it were, of a
regent. But Xenophon, as all who have any judgement, and are versed in history,
well know, did not write a history, but fabled most boldly according to his own
fancy; for he invents the tale that Cyrus was brought up by his maternal
grandfather, Astyages. But it is evident enough that Astyages had been conquered
in war by Cyrus. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl3</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He says
also that Cyrus married a wife a considerable time after the taking of Babylon,
and that she was presented to him by his uncle Cyaxares, but that he dared not
to marry her until he returned to Persia, and his father Cambyses approved of
the marriage. Here Xenophon fables, and gives range to his own invention, for it
was not his purpose to write a history. He is a very fine writer, it is true;
but the unlearned are much mistaken who think that he has collected all the
histories of the world. Xenophon is a highly approved philosopher, but not an
approved historian; for it was his designed object fictitiously to relate as
real facts what seemed to him most suitable. He fables that Cyrus died in his
bed, and dictated a long will, and spoke as a philosopher in his retirement; but
Cyrus, we know, died in the Scythian war, and was slain by the queen, Tomyris,
who revenged the death of her son; and this is well known even by children.
Xenophon, however, as he wished to paint the image of a perfect prince, says
that Cyrus died in his bed. We cannot then collect from the <i>Cyropaeda</i>,
which Xenophon has written, anything that is true. But if we compare the
historians together, we shall find the following things asserted almost
unanimously: &#8212; That Cambyses was the son of Cyrus; that when he suspected
his younger brother he gave orders to put him to death; that both died without
any male issue; and that on discovering the fraud of the Magi, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl4</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the son
of Hystaspes became the third king of the Persian. Daniel calls Darius, who
reigned in Babylon, the Mede; but he is Cyaxares. This I readily admit; for he
reigned by sufferance, as Cyrus willingly declined the honor. And Cyrus, though
a grandson of Astyages, by his daughter Mandane, was yet born of a father not
ennobled; for Astyages, having dreamt that all Asia would be covered by what
proceeded from his daughter, was easily induced to marry her to a stranger.
When, therefore, he gave her to Cambyses, his design was to drive her to a far
country, so that no one born of her should come to so great an empire: this was
the advice of the Magi. Cyrus then acquired a name and reputation, no doubt,
only by his own efforts; nor did he venture at first to take the name of a king,
but suffered his uncle, and at the same time his father-in-law, to reign with
him; and yet he was his colleague only for two years; for Cyasares lived no
longer than the taking of Babylon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I come then now to our Prophet: he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the second year of Darius
</i></font><font face="Palatino">it was commanded to me by the Lord to reprove
the sloth of the people. We may readily conclude that more than twenty years had
elapsed since the people began to return to their own country. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some say
thirty or forty years, and others go beyond that number; but this is not
probable. Some say that the Jews returned to their country in the fifty-eighth
year of their captivity; but this is not true, and may be easily disproved by
the words of Daniel as well as by the history of Ezra. Daniel says in the ninth
chapter
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;270901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
9:1 that he was reminded by God of the return of the people when the time
prescribed by Jeremiah was drawing nigh. And as this happened not in the first
year of Darius, the son of Hystaspes, but about the end of the reign of
Belshasar before Babylon was taken, it follows that the time of the exile was
then fulfilled. We have also this at the beginning of the history, &#8216;When
seventy years were accomplished, God roused the spirit of Cyrus the king.&#8217;
We hence see that Cyrus had not allowed the free return of the people but at the
time predicted by Jeremiah, and according to what Isaiah had previously taught,
that Cyrus, before he was born, had been chosen for this work: and then God
began openly to show how truly he had spoken before the people were driven into
exile. But if we grant that the people returned in the fifty-eighth year, the
truth of prophecy will not appear. They therefore speak very thoughtlessly who
say that the Jews returned to their country before the seventieth year; for thus
they subvert, as I hare said, every notion of God&#8217;s
favor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since then seventy years had elapsed when Babylon was
taken, and Cyrus by a public edict permitted the Jews to return to their
country, God at that time stretched forth his hand in behalf of the miserable
exiles; but troubles did afterwards arise to them from their neighbors. Some
under the guise of friendship wished to join them, in order to obliterate the
name of Israel; and that they might make a sort of amalgamation of many nations.
Then others openly carried on war with them; and when Cyrus was with his army in
Scythia, his prefects became hostile to the Jews, and thus a delay was effected.
Then followed Cambyses, a most cruel enemy to the Church of God. Hence the
building of the Temple could not be proceeded with until the time of this
Darius, the son of Hystaspes. But as Darius, the son of Hystaspes, favored the
Jews, or at least was pacified towards them, he restrained the neighboring
nations from causing any more delay as to the building of the Temple. He ordered
his prefects to protect the people of Israel, so that they might live quietly in
their country and finish the Temple, which had only been begun. And we may hence
conclude that the Temple was built in forty-six years, according to what is said
in the second chapter of John 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl6</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
2:1); for the foundations were laid immediately on the return of the people, but
the work was either neglected or hindered by enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as liberty to build the Temple was given to the
Jews, we may gather from what our Prophet says, that they were guilty of
ingratitude towards God; for private benefit was by every one almost exclusively
regarded, and there was hardly any concern for the worship of God. Hence the
Prophet now reproves this indifference, allied as it was with ungodliness: for
what could be more base than to enjoy the country and the inheritance which God
had formerly promised to Abraham, and yet to make no account of God, nor of that
special favor which he wished to confer &#8212; that of dwelling among them? An
habitation on mount Sion had been chosen, we know, by God, that thence might
come forth the Redeemer of the world. As then this business was neglected, and
each one built his own house, justly does the Prophet here reprove them with
vehemence in the name and by the command of God. Thus much as to the time. And
he says in the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>second</i></font><font face="Palatino">
year of Darius, for a year had now elapsed since liberty to build the Temple had
been allowed them; but the Jews were negligent, because they were too much
devoted to their own private advantages.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the word was given by his hand to
Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and to Joshua, the son of
Josedech</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We shall hereafter see that this
communication had a regard without distinction to the whole community; and, if a
probable conjecture be entertained, neither Zerubbabel nor Joshua were at fault,
because the Temple ass neglected; nay, we may with certainty conclude from what
Zechariah says, that Zerubbabel was a wise prince, and that Joshua faithfully
discharged his office as a priest. Since then both spent their labor for God,
how was it that the Prophet addressed them? and since the whole blame belonged
to the people, why did he not speak to them? why did he not assemble the whole
multitude? The Lord, no doubt, intended to connect Zerubbabel and Joshua with
his servant as associates, that they three might go forth to the people, and
deliver with one mouth what God had committed to his servant Haggai. This then
is the reason why the Prophet says, that he was sent to Zerubbabel and
Joshua.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us at the same time learn, that princes and those
to whom God has committed the care of governing his Church, never so faithfully
perform their office, nor discharge their duties so courageously and
strenuously, but that they stand in need of being roused, and, as it were,
stimulated by many goads. I have already said, that in other places Zerubbabel
and Joshua are commended; yet the Lord reproved them and severely expostulated
with them, because they neglected the building of the Temple. This was done,
that they might confirm by their authority what the Prophet was about to say:
but he also intimates, that they were not wholly free from blame, while the
people were thus negligent in pursuing the work of building the
Temple.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Zerubbabel is called the son of Shealtiel: some think
that son is put here for grandson, and that his father&#8217;s name was passed
over. But this seems not probable. They quote from the Chronicles a passage in
which his father&#8217;s name is said to be Pedaiah: but we know that it was
often the case among that people, that a person had two names. I therefore
regard Zerubbabel to have been the son of Shealtiel. He is said to have been the
governor 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl7</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of
Judah; for it was necessary that some governing power should continue in that
tribe, though the royal authority was taken away, and all sovereignty and
supreme power extinguished. It was yet God&#8217;s purpose that some vestiges of
power should remain, according to what had been predicted by the patriarch
Jacob,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Taken away shall
not be the scepter from Judah, nor a leader from his thigh, until he shall
come;&#8217; etc.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;014910&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
49:10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The royal scepter was indeed taken away, and the
crown was removed, according to what Ezekiel had said, &#8216;Take away the
crown, subvert, subvert, subvert it,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;262126&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
21:26, 27;) for the interruption of the government had been sufficiently long.
Yet the Lord in the meantime preserved some remnants, that the Jews might know
that that promise was not wholly forgotten. This then is the reason why the son
of Shealtiel is said to be the governor of Judah. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">They who think that seventy years had not passed
until the reign of Darius, may from this passage be easily disproved: for if the
seventy years were not accomplished, an excuse would have been ready at hand,
&#8212; that they had deferred the work of building the Temple; but it was
certain, that the time had then elapsed, and that it was owing to their
indifference that the Temple was not erected, for all the materials were
appropriated to private uses. While then they were thus taking care of
themselves and consulting their own interest, the building of the Temple was
neglected. That the Temple was not built till the reign of Darius, this
happened, as we have said, from another cause, because the prefects of king
Cyrus gave much annoyance to the Jews, and Cambyses was most hostile to them.
But when liberty was restored to them, and Darius had so kindly permitted them
to build the Temple, they had no excuse for delay.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is however probable that they had then many
disputes as to the time; for it may have been, that they seizing on any pretext
to cover their sloth, made this objection, &#8212; that many difficulties had
occurred, because they had been too precipitate, and that they had thus been
punished for their haste, because they had rashly undertaken the building of the
Temple: and we may also suppose that they took another view of the time as
having not yet come, for easily might this objection occur to them, &#8212;
&#8220;It is indeed true that the worship of God is deservedly to be preferred
to all other things; but the Lord grants us this indulgence, so that we are
allowed to build our own houses; and in the meantime we attend to the
sacrifices. Have not our fathers lived many ages without a Temple? God was then
satisfied with a sanctuary: there is now an altar erected, and there sacrifices
are offered. The Lord then will forgive us if we defer the building of the
Temple to a suitable time. But in the meantime every one may build his own
house, so that afterwards the Temple may at leisure be built more
sumptuously.&#8221; However this may have been, we find that true which I have
often stated, &#8212; that the Jews were so taken up with their own domestic
concerns, with their own ease, and with their own pleasures, that they made very
little account of God&#8217;s worship. This is the reason why the Prophet was so
greatly displeased with them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He declares what they said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This people say, The time is not
yet come to build the house of Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl8</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
repeats here what the Jews were wont to allege in order to disguise their sloth,
after having delayed a long time, and when they could not, except through
consummate effrontery, adduce anything in their own defense. We however see,
that they hesitated not to promise pardon to themselves. Thus also do men
indulge themselves in their sins, as though they could make an agreement with
God and pacify him with some frivolous things. We see that this was the case
then. But we may also see here, as in a mirror, how great is the ingratitude of
men. The kindness of God had been especially worthy of being remembered, the
glory of which ought to have been borne in mind to the end of time: they had
been restored from exile in a manner beyond what they had ever expected. What
ought they to have done, but to have devoted themselves entirely to the service
of their deliverer? But they built, no, not even a tent for God, and sacrificed
in the open air; and thus they wilfully trifled with God. But at the same time
they dwelt at ease in houses elegantly fitted up.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And how is the case at this day? We see that through
a remarkable miracle of God the gospel has shone forth in our time, and we have
emerged, as it were, from the abodes below. Who does now rear up, of his own
free-will, an altar to God? On the contrary, all regard what is advantageous
only to themselves; and while they are occupied with their own concerns, the
worship of God is cast aside; there is no care, no zeal, no concern for it; nay,
what is worse, many make gain of the gospel, as though it were a lucrative
business. No wonder then, if the people have so basely disregarded their
deliverance, and have almost obliterated the memory of it. No less shameful is
the example witnessed at this day among us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we may hence also see how kindly God has provided
for his Church; for his purpose was that this reproof should continue extant,
that he might at this day stimulate us, and excite our fear as well as our
shame. For we also thus grow frigid in promoting the worship of God, whenever we
are led to seek only our own advantages. We may also add, that as God&#8217;s
temple is spiritual, our fault is the more atrocious when we become thus
slothful; since God does not bid us to collect either wood, or stones, or
cement, but to build a celestial temple, in which he may be truly worshipped.
When therefore we become thus indifferent, as that people were thus severely
reproved, doubtless our sloth is much more detestable. We now see that the
Prophet not only spoke to men of his age, but was also destined, through
God&#8217;s wonderful purpose, to be a preacher to us, so that his doctrine
sounds at this day in our ears, and reproves our torpor and ungrateful
indifference: for the building of the spiritual temple is deferred, whenever we
become devoted to ourselves, and regard only what is advantageous to us
individually. We shall go on with what follows
tomorrow.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as we must
carry on a warfare in this world, and as it is thy will to try us with many
contests, &#8212; O grant, that we may never faint, however extreme may be the
trials which we shall have to endure: and as thou hast favored us with so great
an honor as to make us the framers and builders of thy spiritual temple, may
every one of us present and consecrate himself wholly to thee: and, inasmuch as
each of us has received some peculiar gift, may we strive to employ it in
building this temple, so that thou mayest be worshipped among us perpetually;
and especially, may each of us offer himself wholly as a spiritual sacrifice to
thee, until we shall at length be renewed in thine image, and be received into a
full participation of that glory, which has been attained for us by the blood of
thy only-begotten Son. Amen.</font><br></div>

TWENTY-NINTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WHEN the Prophet asks, whether the time had come for
the Jews to dwell in splendid and well furnished houses, and whether the time
had not come to build the Temple, he intimates, that they were trifling in a
very gross manner with God; for there was exactly the same reason for building
the Temple as for building the city. How came they to be restored to their
country, but that God performed what he had testified by the mouth of Jeremiah?
Hence their return depended on the redemption promised to them: it was therefore
easy for them to conclude, that the time for building the Temple had already
come; for the one could not, and ought not to have been separated from the
other, as it has been stated. He therefore upbraids them with ingratitude, for
they sought to enjoy the kindness of God, and at the same time disregarded the
memorial of it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And very emphatical are the words, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is it time for you to dwell in
houses?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl9</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For
there is implied a comparison between God, whose Temple they set no value on,
and themselves, who sought not only commodious, but sumptuous dwellings. Hence
the Prophet inquires, whether it was consistent that mortal men, who differ not
from worms, should possess magnificent houses, and that God should be without
his Temple. And to the same purpose is what he adds, when he says, that their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>houses</i></font><font face="Palatino">
were

then they were not satisfied with what was commodious, without splendor and
luxury being added, it was extremely shameful for them to rob God at the same
time of his Temple, where he was to be worshipped. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet deals with the refractory people
according to what their character required; for as to those who are teachable
and obedient, a word is enough for them; but they who are perversely addicted to
their sins must be more sharply urged, as the Prophet does here; for he brings
before the Jews the punishments by which they had been already visited. It is
commonly said, that experience is the teacher of fools; and the Prophet has this
in view in these words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>apply
your hearts to your ways</i></font><font face="Palatino">; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl11</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
is, &#8220;If the authority of God or a regard for him is of no importance among
you, at least consider how God deals with you. How comes it that ye are
famished, that both heaven and earth deny food to you? Besides, though ye
consume much food, it yet does not satisfy you. In a word, how is it that all
things fade away and vanish in your hands? How is this? Ye cannot otherwise
account for it, but that God is displeased with you. If then ye will not of your
own accord obey God&#8217;s word, let these judgements at least induce you to
repent.&#8221; It was to apply the heart to their ways, when they acknowledged
that they were thus famished, not by chance, but that the curse of God urged
them, or was suspended over their heads. He therefore bids them to receive
instruction from the events themselves, or from what they were experiencing; and
by these words the Prophet more sharply teaches them; as though he had said,
that they profited nothing by instruction and warning, and that it remained as
the last thing, that they were to be drawn by force while the Lord was
chastising them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He says that they had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sown
much</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>small was the
produce</i></font><font face="Palatino">. They who render the clause in the
future tense, wrest the meaning of the Prophet: for why did he say, apply your
heart to your ways, if he only denounced a future punishment? But, as I have
already stated, he intimates, that they very thoughtlessly champed the bridle,
for they perceived not that all their evils were inflicted by God&#8217;s hand,
nor did they regard his judgement as righteous. Hence he says, that they had
sowed much, and that the harvest had been small; and then, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ate</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>were not
satisfied</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>drank</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and had not their </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thirst
quenched</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>clothed themselves
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not
warmed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. How much soever they applied those
things which seemed necessary for the support of life, they yet availed them
nothing. And God, we know, does punish men in these two ways either by
withdrawing his blessings, by rendering the earth and and the heavens dry; or by
making the abundant produce unsatisfying and even useless. It often happens that
men gather what is sufficient for support, and yet they are always hungry. It is
a kind of curse, which appears very evident when God takes away their nourishing
power from bread and wine, so that they supply no support to man. When therefore
fruit, and whatever the earth produces for the necessities of man, give no
support, God proves, as it were by an outstretched arm, that he is an avenger.
But the other curse is more frequent; that is, when God smites the earth with
drought, so that it produces nothing. But our Prophet refers to both these kinds
of evils. Behold, he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye
have sown much and ye gather little</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and then
he says, Though ye are supplied with the produce of wine and corn, yet with
eating and drinking ye cannot satisfy yourselves; nay, your very clothes do not
make you warm. They might have had a sure hope of the greatest abundance, had
they not broken off the stream of God&#8217;s favor by their sins. Were they not
then extremely blind this experience must have awakened them, according to what
is said in the first chapter of
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;290101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joel
1:1.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says at the end of the verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He who gains wages, gains then
for a perforated bag</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By these words he reminds
them, that the vengeance of God could not only be seen in the sterility of the
earth, and in the very hunger of men, who by eating were not satisfied; but also
in their work, for they wearied themselves much without any profit, as even the
money cast into the bag disappeared. Hence he says, even your work is in vain.
It was indeed a most manifest proof of God&#8217;s wrath, when their money,
though laid up, yet vanished away.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl12</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see what the Prophet means: As his doctrine
appeared frigid to the Jews and his warnings were despised, he treats them
according to the perverseness of their disposition. Hence he shows, that though
they disregarded God and his Prophets, they were yet sufficiently taught by his
judgements, and that still they remained indifferent. He therefore goads them,
as though they were asses, that they might at length acknowledge that God was
justly displeased with them, and that his wrath was conspicuous in the sterility
of the land, as well as in everything connected with their life; for whether
they did eat or abstained from food, they were hungry; and when they diligently
labored and gathered wages, their wages vanished, as though they had cast them
into a perforated bag. It follows &#8212;</font><br><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now adds, that since the Jews were thus
taught by their evils, nothing else remained for them but to prepare themselves
without delay for the work of building the Temple; for they were not to defer
the time, inasmuch as they were made to know, that God had come forth with an
armed hand to vindicate his own right: for the sterility of which he had spoken,
and also the famine and other signs of a curse, were like a drawn sword in the
hand of God; by which it was evident, that he intended to punish the negligence
of the people. As God then had been robbed of his right, he not only exhorted
the people by his Prophets, but also executed his vengeance on this
contempt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the reason why the Prophet now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Apply your
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go up to the mountain, bring
wood</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. And this passage strikingly sets
forth why God punished their sins, in order that they might not only perceive
that they had sinned, but that they might also seek to amend that which
displeased God. We may also, in the second place, learn from what is said, how
we are to proceed rightly in the course of true repentance. The beginning is,
that our sins should become displeasing to us; but if any of us proceed no
farther, it will be only an evanescent feeling: it is therefore necessary to
advance to the second step; an amendment for the better ought to follow. The
Prophet expresses both here: He says first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lay your heart on your
ways</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, &#8220;Consider whence comes
this famine to you, and then how it is that by laboring much ye gain nothing,
except that God is angry with you.&#8221; Now this was what wisdom required. But
he again repeats the same thing, Lay your heart on your ways, that is,
&#8220;Not only that sin may be hated by you, but also that this sloth, which
has hitherto offended God and provoked his wrath, may be changed into strenuous
activity.&#8221; Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go up to the mountain, and bring
wood, and let the house be
built</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If any one is at a loss to know why the Prophet
insists so much on building the Temple, the ready answer is this that it was
God&#8217;s design to exercise in this way his ancient people in the duties of
religion. Though then the Temple itself was of no great importance before God,
yet the end was to be regarded; for the people were preserved by the visible
Temple in the hope of the future Christ; and then it behaved them always to bear
in mind the heavenly pattern, that they might worship God spiritually under the
external symbols. It was not then without reason that God was offended with
their neglect of the temple; for it hence clearly appeared, that there was no
care nor zeal for religion among the Jews. It often was the case that they were
more sedulous than necessary in external worship, and God scorned their
assiduity, when not connected with a right inward feeling; but the gross
contempt of God in disregarding even the external building, is what is
reprehended here by the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will be propitious in
it</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or, I will take pleasure in it. Some read,
It will please me; and they depart not from the real meaning of the verb: for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hxr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>retse</i> &#8212; is to be acceptable. But more correct, in my view, is the
opinion of those who think that the Prophet alludes to the promise of God; for
he had said, that he would on this condition dwell among the Jews, that he might
hear their prayers, and be propitious to them. As, then, the Jews came to the
Temple to expiate their sins, that they might return to God&#8217;s favor, it is
not without reason that God here declares that he would be propitious in that
house.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;If any one sin,&#8217; said
Solomon, &#8216;and entering this house, shall humbly pray, do thou also hear
from thy heavenly
habitation.&#8217;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;110830&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Kings 8:30.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We further know that the covering of the ark was
called the propitiatory, because God there received the suppliant into favor.
This meaning, then, seems the most suitable &#8212; that the Prophet says, that
if the Temple was built, God would be there propitious. But it was a proof of
extreme impiety to think that they could prosper while God was adverse to them:
for whence could they hope for happiness, except from the only fountain of all
blessings, that is, when God favored them and was propitious to them? And how
could his favor be sought, except they came to his sanctuary, and thence raise
up their minds by faith to heaven? When, therefore, there was no care for the
Temple, it was easy to conclude that God himself was neglected, and regarded
almost with scorn. We then see how emphatically this was added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will be propitious
there</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, in the Temple; as though he had
said, &#8220;Your infirmity ought to have reminded you that you have need of
this help, even of worshipping me in the sanctuary. But as I gave you, as it
were, a visible mirror of my presence among you, when I ordered a Temple to be
built for me on mount Sion, when ye despise the Temple, is it not the same as
though I was rejected by you?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I shall be glorified, saith
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He seems to express the reason why he
should be propitious; for he would then see that his glory was regarded by the
Jews. At the same time, this reason may be taken by itself, and this is what I
prefer. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl13</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
Prophet then employs two goads to awaken the Jews: When the Temple was built,
God would bless them; for they would have him pacified, and whenever they found
him displeased, they might come as suppliants to seek pardon; this was one
reason why it behaved them strenuously to undertake the building of the Temple.
The second reason was, that God would be glorified. Now, what could have been
more inconsistent than to disregard God their deliverer, and so late a deliverer
too? But how God was glorified by the Temple I have already briefly explained;
not that it added anything to God; but such ordinances of religion were then
necessary, as the Jews were as yet like children. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet relates again, that the Jews were
deprived of support, and that they in a manner pined away in their distress,
because they robbed God of the worship due to him. He first repeats the fact,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have looked for much, but
behold little</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl15</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It may
happen that one is contented with a very slender portion, because much is not
expected. They who are satisfied with their own penury are not anxious though
their portion of food is but scanty, though they are constrained to feed on
acorns. Those who are become hardened in enduring evils, do not seek much; but
they who desire much, are more touched and vexed by their penury. This is the
reason why the Prophet says, Ye have looked for much, and, behold, there was but
little; that is, &#8220;Ye are not like the peasants, who satisfy themselves
with any sort of food, and are not troubled on account of their straitened
circumstances; but your desire has led you to seek abundance. Hence ye seek and
greedily lay hold on things on every side; but, behold, it comes to
little.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the second place he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have brought it
home</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He farther mentions another kind of evil
&#8212; that when they gathered wine, and corn, and money, all these things
immediately vanished. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have
brought it home, and I have blown upon it</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By
saying that they brought it home, he intimates that what they had acquired was
laid up, that it might be preserved safely; for they who had filled their
storehouses, and wine-cellars, and bags, thought that they had no more to do
with God. Hence it was that profane men securely indulged themselves; they
thought that they were beyond the reach of danger, when their houses were well
filled. God, on the contrary, shows that their houses became empty, when filled
with treasures and provisions. But he speaks still more distinctly &#8212; that
he had blown upon them, that is, that he had dissipated them by his breath: for
the Prophet did not deem it enough historically to narrate what the Jews had
experienced; but his purpose also was to point out the cause, as it were, by the
finger. He therefore teaches us, that what they laid in store in their houses
did not without a cause vanish away; but that this happened through the blowing
of God, even because he cursed their blessing, according to what we shall
hereafter see in the Prophet Malachi.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why is this? saith Jehovah of
hosts</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God here asks, not because he had any
doubts on the subject, but that he might by this sort of goading rouse the Jews
from their lethargy, &#8212; &#8220;Think of the cause, and know that my hand is
not guided by a blind impulse when it strikes you. You ought, then, to consider
the reason why all things thus decay and perish.&#8221; Here again is sharply
reproved the stupidity of the people, because they attended not to the cause of
their evils; for they ought to have known this of themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But God gives the answer, because he saw that they
remained stupefied &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On
account of my house</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because it is
waste</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl14</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> God
here assigns the cause; he shows that though no one of them considered why they
were so famished, the judgement of his curse was yet sufficiently manifest, on
account of the Temple remaining a waste. And you, he says, run, every one to his
own house. Some read, You take delight, every one in his own house; for it is
the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hxr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>retse</i>, which we have lately noticed; and it means either to take pleasure
in a thing, or to run. Every one, then, runs to his house, or, Every one
delights in his house. But it is more suitable to the context to give this
rendering, Every one runs to his house. For the Prophet here reminds the Jews
that they were slow and slothful in the work of building the Temple, because
they hastened to their private houses. He then reproves here their ardor in
being intent on building their own houses, so that they had no leisure to build
the Temple. This is the hastening which the Prophet blames and condemns in the

<div><font face="Palatino">We may hence learn again, that they had long delayed
to build the sanctuary after the time had arrived: for, as we have mentioned
yesterday, they who think the Jews returned in the fifty-eighth year, and that
they had not then undergone the punishment denounced by Jeremiah, are very
deluded; for they thus obscure the favor of God; nay, they wholly subvert the
truth of the promises, as though they had returned contrary to God&#8217;s will,
through the permission of Cyrus, when yet Isaiah says, that Cyrus would be the
instrument of their promised redemption.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
45:5.) Surely, then, Cyrus must have been dead before the time was fulfilled!
and in that case God could not have been the redeemer of his people. Therefore
Eusebius, and those who agree with him, did thus most absurdly confound the
order of time. It now follows &#8212;</font><br><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms what the last verse contains &#8212; that
God had made it evident that he was displeased with the people because their
zeal for religion had become cold, and, especially, because they were all
strangely devoted to their own interest and manifested no concern for building
the Temple. Hence, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>therefore the heavens
</i></font><font face="Palatino">are shut up and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>withhold the
dew</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, they distil no dew on the earth;
and he adds, that the earth was closed that it produced no fruit; it yielded no
increase, and disappointed its cultivators. As to the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;kAl[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ol-can</i>, we must bear in mind what I have stated, that God did not regard
the external and visible Temple, but rather the end for which it was designed;
for it was his will then that he should be worshipped under the ceremonies of
the law. When, therefore, the Jews offered mutilated, lame, or diseased
sacrifices, they manifested impiety and contempt of God. It is yet true, that it
was the same thing as to God; but he had not commanded sacrifices to be offered
to him for his own sake, but that by such services they might foster true
religion. When, therefore, he says now, that he punished their neglect of the
Temple, we ought ever to regard that as a pattern of heavenly things, so that we
may understand that the coldness and indifference of the Jews were reproved;
because it hence evidently appeared that they had no care for the worship of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With respect to the withholding of dew and of
produce, we know that the Prophets took from the law what served to teach the
people, and accommodated it to their own purposes. The curses of the law are
general.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
11:17.) It is therefore the same thing as though the Prophet had said, that what
God had threatened by Moses was really fulfilled. It ought not to have been to
them a new thing, that whenever heaven denied its dew and rain it was a sign of
God&#8217;s wrath. But as, at this day, during, wars, or famine, or pestilence,
men do not regard this general truth, it is necessary to make the application:
and godly teachers ought wisely to attend to this point, that is, to remind men,
according to what the state of things and circumstances may require, that God
proves by facts what he has testified in his word. This is what is done by our
Prophet now, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>withheld have the
heavens the dew and the earth its produce</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl16</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In a word, God intimates, that the heavens leave no
care to provide for us, and to distil dew so that the earth may bring forth
fruit, and that the earth also, though called the mother of men, does not of
itself open its bowels, but that the heavens as well as the earth bear a sure
testimony to his paternal love, and also to the care which he exercises over us.
God then shows, both by the heavens and the earth, that he provides for us; for
when the heavens and the earth administer and supply us with the blessings of
God, they thus declare his love towards us. So also, when the heaven is, as it
were, iron, and when the earth with closed bowels refuses us food, we ought to
know that they are commissioned to execute on us the vengeance of God. For they
are not only the instruments of his bounty, but, when it is necessary, God
employs them for the purpose of punishing us. This is briefly the
meaning.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>

when our torpor so possesses us as to render punishment necessary, permit us not
to harden ourselves; but being at length effectually warned, and we return to
the right way, and strive so to render all we do approved by thee, that we may
find a door opened to thy grace and favor: and being made partakers of those
blessed, by which thou affordest a taste of that goodness which we shall enjoy
in heaven, may we ever aspire thither, and be satisfied with the abundant
blessings which we daily and even continually receive from thine hand, in such a
manner as not to be detained by this world; but may we, with minds raised up to

<div><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet here declares that his message had not
been without fruit, for shortly after the whole people prepared themselves for
the work. And he names both Zerubbabel and Joshua; for it behaved them to lead
the way, and, as it were, to extend a hand to others. For, had there been no
leaders, no one of the common people would have pointed out the way to the rest.
We know what usually happens when a word is addressed indiscriminately to all
the people: they wait for one another. But when Joshua and Zerubbabel attended
to the commands of the Prophet, the others followed them: for they were
dominant, not only in power, but also in authority, so that they induced the
people willingly to do their duty. One was the governor of the people, the other
was the high priest; but the honesty and faithfulness of both were well known,
so that the people spontaneously followed their example.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this passage teaches us that though God invites
all to his service, yet as any one excels in honor or in other respects, so the
more promptly he ought to undertake what is proposed by the authority of God.
Our Prophet, no doubt, meant to point out this due order of things, by saying,
that he was heard first by Zerubbabel and Joshua, and then by the whole
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as all had not returned from exile, but a small
portion, compared with that great number, which, we know, had not availed
themselves of the kindness allowed them &#8212; this is the reason why the
Prophet does not simply name the people, but
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the remnant of the
people</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;[h
tyra&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>sharit eom</i>. As also the gift
of prophecy had been for a long time more rare, and few appeared among the
people who had any decided evidence of their call, such as Samuel, Isaiah,
David, and others possessed, the Prophet, for this reason, does here more
carefully commend and honor his own office: he says that the people attended to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the voice of Jehovah
</i></font><font face="Palatino">&#8212; How? By attending, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the words of Haggai the
Prophet, inasmuch as Jehovah their God had sent
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He might have said more shortly that his
labor had not been without fruit; but he used this circuitous mode of speaking,
that he might confirm his own call; and he did this designedly, because the
people had for a long time been without the opportunity of hearing God&#8217;s
Prophets, for there were none among them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Haggai says nothing here but what belongs in
common to all teachers in the Church: for we know that men are not sent by
divine authority to speak that God himself may be silent. As then the ministers
of the word derogate nothing from the authority of God, it follows that none
except the only true God ought to be heard. It is not then a peculiar
expression, which is to be restricted to one man, when God is said to have
spoken by the mouth of Haggai; for he thus declared that he was God&#8217;s true
and authorised Prophet. We may therefore gather from these words, that the
Church is not to be ruled by the outward preaching of the word, as though God
had substituted men in his own place, and thus divested himself of his own
office, but that he only speaks by their mouth. And this is the import of these
words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The people attended to the
voice of Jehovah their God, and to the words of Haggai the
Prophet</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For the word of God is not
distinguished from the words of the Prophet, as though the Prophet had added
anything of his own. Haggai then ascribed these words to himself, not that he
devised anything himself, so as to corrupt the pure doctrine which had been
delivered to him by God, but that he only distinguished between God, the author
of the doctrine, and his minister, as when it is said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The sword of God
and of Gideon,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;070720&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Judges
7:20,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and also,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The people
believed God and Moses his
servant.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;021431&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Exodus
14:31.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">nothing is ascribed to Moses or to Gideon apart from
God; but God himself is placed in the highest honor, and then Moses and Gideon
are joined to him. In the same sense do the Apostles write, when they say, that
&#8220;it had pleased the Holy spirit&#8221; and themselves.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441522&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
15:22.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And hence it is evident how foolish and ridiculous
are the Papists, who hence conclude that it is lawful for men to add their own
inventions to the word of God. For the Apostles, they say, not only alleged the
authority of the Holy Spirit, but also say, that it seemed good to themselves.
God then does not so claim, they say, all things for himself, as not to leave
some things to the decision of his Church, as though indeed the Apostles meant
something different from what our Prophet means here; that is, that they truly
and faithfully delivered what their had received from the spirit of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is therefore a mode of speaking which ought to be
carefully marked, when we hear, that the voice of God and the words of Haggai
were reverently attended to by the people. &#8212; Why?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Inasmuch</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as God had sent
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as though he had said, that God was heard
when he spoke by the mouth of man. And this is also worthy of being noticed,
because many fanatics boast, that they allow regard to the word of the Lord, but
are unwilling to give credit to men, as that would be even preposterous; and
they pretend, that in this way what belongs to the only true God is transferred
to creatures. But the Holy spirit most easily reconciles these two things
&#8212; that the voice of God is heard when the people embrace what they hear
from the mouth of a Prophet. Why so? because it pleases God thus to try the
obedience of our faith, while he commits to man this office. For if the Lord was
pleased to speak himself, then justly might men be neglected: but as he has
chosen this mode, whosoever reject God&#8217;s Prophets, clearly show that they
despise God himself. There is no need of inquiring here, why it is that we ought
to obey the word preached or the external voice of men, rather than revelations;
it is enough for us to know that this is the will of God. When therefore he
sends Prophets to us, we ought unquestionably to receive what they
bring.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And Haggai says also expressly, that he was sent by
the God of Israel; as though he had said, that the people had testified their
true piety when they acknowledged God&#8217;s Prophet in his legitimate
vocation. For he who clamorously objects, and says that he knows not whether it
pleases God or not to send forth men to announce his word, shows himself to be
wholly alienated from God: for it ought to be sufficiently evident to us that
this is one of our first principles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the people feared before
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl17</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Haggai
confirms here the same truth &#8212; that the people received not what they
heard from the mouth of mortal man, otherwise than if the majesty of God had
openly appeared. For there was no ocular view of God given; but the message of
the Prophet obtained as much power as though God had descended from heaven, and
had given manifest tokens of his presence. We may then conclude from these
words, that the glory of God so shines in his word, that we ought to be so much
affected by it, whenever he speaks by his servants, as though he were nigh to
us, face to face, as the Scripture says in another place. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet tells us here, that he had again roused
the leaders as well as the common people; for except God frequently repeats his
exhortations, our alacrity relaxes. Though then they had all attended to
God&#8217;s command, it was yet necessary that they should be strengthened by a
new promise: for men can be encouraged, and their indifference can be corrected,
by no other means, to such a degree, as when God offers and promises his help.
This, then, was the way in which they were now encouraged,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am with
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And experience sufficiently shows, that we
never really and from the heart obey, except when we rely on his promises and
hope for a happy success. For were God only to call us to our work, and were our
hope doubtful, all our zeal would doubtless die away. We cannot then devote our
services to God, except he supports and encourages us by promises. We also see,
that it is not enough that God should speak once, and that we should once
receive his word, but there is need that he should rouse us again and again; for
the greatest ardor grows cold when no goads are applied.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the Prophet makes known again his vocation, for
he says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he spake in the
message of Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">, for he was his messenger.
The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;alm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>malak</i>, means a messenger; and as angels are called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ykalm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>melakim</i>, some foolish men have thought that Haggai was one of the
celestial angels, clothed with the form of man: but this is a most frivolous
conjecture; for priests, we know, are honored with this title in the second
chapter of Malachi, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;390201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
2:1, and God in many other places calls his Prophets messengers or ambassadors.
There is, therefore, no doubt but that Haggai meant simply to testify, that he
brought forward nothing presumptuously, but was a faithful dispenser of the
word; for he knew that he was sent by God; and that he might attain attention,
he was able justly to testify that his message came from
heaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he says, that he spake as a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>messenger of Jehovah in the
message of Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, he spoke according
to his calling, and not as a private individual, but as one who derived his
authority from heaven, and could call to order the whole people; for he was to
give way neither to the chief priest nor to Zerubbabel the ruler of the people,
inasmuch as he was superior to them on this account, because he had a message
which had been committed to him by God. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl18</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We now
then understand the design of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And we hence learn that there is no dignity which
exempts us from obedience common to all, when God&#8217;s word is addressed to
us. Doubtless Joshua the high priest was superior to all the rest in matters of
religion, and he was the chief angel or messenger of the God of hosts; and yet
he refused not to submit himself to God&#8217;s Prophet, for he understood that
he was in a special manner appointed by God to this office. Zerubbabel, the
governor of the people, followed also his example. Let us, then, know that
God&#8217;s word is proclaimed under this condition, that no eminence, either in
honor or in dignity, exempts us, as it were, by a sort of privilege, from the
obligation of receiving it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet at length adds, that the people hastened
quickly to the work, because God had given encouragement to them all. He had
lately spoken of the fruit of his doctrine; but he now declares that his voice
had not so penetrated into the hearts of all, as though it had been of itself
efficacious, but that it had been connected with the hidden influence of the
Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this passage is remarkable; for the Prophet
includes both these things &#8212; that God allows not his word to be useless or
unfruitful &#8212; and yet that this proceeds not from the diligence of men, but
from the hidden power of the Spirit. The Prophet, then, did not fail in his
efforts; for his labor was not in vain, but brought forth fruit. At the same
time, that that saying might remain true,</font><br></div>

Zerubbabel, the spirit of Joshua, and of the whole

influence of the Spirit to one thing only, as some do, who imagine that the
Israelites were confirmed in their good resolution, as they say, having before
spontaneously obeyed the word of God. These separate, without reason, what ought
to be read in the Prophet as connected together. For God roused the spirit of
Zerubbabel and of the whole people; and hence it was that they received the
message of the Prophet, and were attentive to his words. Foolishly, then, do
they imagine that the Israelites were led by their own free-will to obey the
word of God, and then that some aid of the Holy Spirit followed, to make them
firmly to persevere in their course. But the Prophet declared, in the first
place, that his message was respectfully received by the people; and now he
explains how it was, even because God had touched the hearts of the whole
people.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl19</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And we ought to notice the expression, when it is
said that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">
of Zerubbabel and of all the people was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stirred
up</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For much sloth, we know, prevailed,
especially among the multitude. But as to Zerubbabel and Joshua, they were, as
we have said, already willing, but delayed until the coldness under which they
labored was reproved. But the Prophet here simply means, that they became thus
obedient through the hidden impulse of God, and also that they were made firm in
their purpose. God does not form new souls in us, when he draws us to his
service; but changes what is wrong in us: for we should never be attentive to
his word, were he not to open our ears; and there would be no inclination to
obey, were he not to turn our hearts; in a word, both will and effort would
immediately fail in us, were he not to add his gift of perseverance. Let us,
then, know that Haggai&#8217;s labors produced fruits, because the Lord
effectually touched the hearts of the people; for we indeed know that it is his
special gift, that the elect are made disciples, according to that

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet mentions even the time when they
commenced the building of the temple. Three-and-twenty days interposed between
the first message and the beginning of the work. It hence appears how ignorant
he was who divided the chapters, having begun the second chapter at this verse,
where the Prophet shows, as it were by his finger, how much was the distance
between the day in which he began to exhort the people, and the success of which
he speaks. He then simply tells us here when the Temple began to be built
&#8212; that is, in the second year of Darius the king, and in the twenty-fourth
day of the sixth month. He had previously said that a message was given to him
in the second year of Darius the king, and in the sixth month, and on the first
day. Then from that day to the twenty-fourth the people delayed; not that they
disregarded the command of the Prophet, but because it was not so easy a thing
to persuade them all, that they might unanimously undertake the work. Though
then the promptitude of the people is commended, we must yet observe that there
was some mixture of weakness; for the effect of the doctrine did not appear till
the twenty-fourth day.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now states another reason why he had been
sent by God, in order that he might obviate a temptation which might have
hindered the work that was begun. We have seen that they were all stirred up by
the celestial spirit to undertake the building of the Temple. But as Satan, by
his many arts, attempts to turn back the godly from their course, so he had
devised a reason by which the desire of the people might have been checked.
Inasmuch as the old people, who had seen the splendor of the former temple,
considered this temple no better than a cottage, all their zeal evaporated; for,
as we have said, without a promise there will continue in men no ardor, no
perseverance. Now we know what had been predicted by Ezekiel, and what all the
other Prophets had testified, especially Isaiah, who had spoken highly of the
excellency of the Church, and shown that it was to be superior to its ancient
state.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;233321&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
33:21.) Besides, Ezekiel describes the form of the Temple, and states its
dimensions.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;264101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
41:1.) As then the faithful had learnt from these prophecies that the new Temple
would be more splendid than the ancient, they were in danger, not only of
becoming cold in the business, but also of being wholly discouraged, when they
perceived that the new Temple in no respect reached the excellency and grandeur
of the ancient Temple. And these things are described at large by
Josephus.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we may easily conclude, from the words of the
Prophet, that there was then a danger lest they should lay aside the work they
had begun, except they were encouraged by a new exhortation. And he says that
this happened in the seventh month, and on the first day of the
month.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here arises a question, How was it that they so soon
compared the new with the old building. Seven or eight days had passed since the
work was begun: nothing, doubtless, could have been then constructed, which
might have afforded a ground of comparison. It seems then strange, that the
Prophet had been so soon sent to them. An answer to this will be easily found,
if we bear in mind. that what I have stated at the beginning of the first
chapter, that the foundations of the Temple had been previously laid, but that
there had been a long interruption: for the people had turned to their own
private concerns, and all had become so devoted to their own advantages, that
they neglected the building of the Temple. For it is wholly a false notion, that
the people had returned from exile before the appointed time, and it has been
sufficiently refuted by clear proofs; for scripture expressly declares, that
both Cyrus and Darius had been led by a divine impulse to allow the return of
the people. Hence, when the Jews returned to their country, they immediately
began to build the Temple; but afterwards, as I have said, either avarice, or
too anxious a desire for their own private benefit, laid hold on their minds. As
then the building of the Temple had been for some time neglected, they were
again encouraged, as our Prophet has shown to us. They had now hardly applied
their hands to the work, when, through the artifice of Satan, such suggestions
as these crept in &#8212; &#8220;What are ye doing, ye miserable men! Ye wish to
build a Temple to your God; but what sort of Temple will it be? Certainly it
will not be that which all the Prophets have celebrated. For what do we read in
Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel? Have not all these testified that the Temple
which would be rebuilt after our return from Babylonian exile would be more
splendid than the other? But we now build a shed. Surely this is done without
authority. We do not then fight under the guidance of God; and it would be
better for us to leave off the work; for our service cannot be approved of God,
except it be founded on his Word. And we see how far this Temple comes short of
what God has promised.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now hence learn, that it was not without reason
that Haggai was sent on the eighth day to recover the people from their
indifference. And hence also we may learn how necessary it is for us to be
constantly stimulated; for Satan can easily find out a thousand impediments, by
which he may turn us aside from the right course, except God often repeats his
exhortations to keep us awake. Eight days only have elapsed, and the people
would have ceased from their work, had not Haggai been sent to encourage them
again.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the cause of this cessation, which the Prophet
designed to obviate and to remove, ought to be especially noticed. The people
had before ceased to work, because they were immoderately devoted to their own
interest, which was a proof of base ingratitude and of profane impiety: for
those who had no care for building the Temple were most ungrateful to God; and
then their impiety was intolerable, inasmuch as they sought boarded houses to
dwell in, being not content with decent houses without having them adorned,
while the Temple was left, as it were, a wilderness. But the cause was
different, when Haggai was sent the second time; for their indifference then
arose from a good principle and a genuine feeling of religion. But we hence see
what a subtle contriver Satan is, who not only draws us away openly from
God&#8217;s service, but insinuates himself in a clandestine manner, so as to
turn us aside, under the cover of zeal, from the course of our vocation. How was
it that the people became negligent after they had begun the work? even because
it grieved the old men to see the glory of the second, so far inferior to the
first Temple. For though the people animated themselves by the sound of
trumpets, yet the old among them drowned the sound by their lamentations. Whence
was this? even because they saw, as I have said, that this Temple was in no way
equal to the ancient one; and hence they thought that God was not as yet
reconciled to them. Had they said, that so great an expense was not necessary,
that God did not require much money to be laid out, their impiety should have
been openly manifested; but when they especially wished that the splendor of the
Temple would be such, as might surely prove that the restoration of the Church
was come, such as had been promised by all the Prophets, we doubtless perceive
their pious feeling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we are thus reminded, that we ought always to
beware of the intrigues of Satan, when they appear under the cover of truth.
When, therefore, our minds are disposed to piety, Satan is ever to be feared,
lest he should stealthily suggest to us what may turn us aside from our duty;
for we see that some leave the Church because they require in it the highest
perfection. They are indignant at vices which they deem intolerable, when they
cannot be corrected: and thus, under the pretext of zeal, they separate
themselves and seek to form for themselves a new world, in which there is to be
a perfect Church; and they lay hold on those passages in which the Holy Spirit
recommends purity to the Church, as when Paul says, that it was purchased by
Christ, that it might be without spot or wrinkle. As then these are inflamed
with a zeal so rigid that they depart from God himself and violate the unity of
the Church; so also there are many proud men who despise the Church of God,
because it shines not forth among them in great pomp; and they think that God
does not dwell in the midst of us, because we are obscure and of no great
importance, and also because they regard our few number with
contempt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In all these there is some appearance of piety. How
so? Because they would have God to be reverenced, so that they would have the
whole world to be filled with the fear of his majesty; or they would have much
wealth to be gathered, so that sumptuous offerings might be made. But, as I have
already said, Satan thus cunningly insinuates himself; and hence we ought to
fear his intrigues, lest, under plausible pretences, he should dazzle our eyes.
But the best way of caution is to regard what God commands, and so to rely on
his promises as to proceed steadily in our course, though the accomplishment of
the promises does not immediately correspond with our desires; for God
designedly keeps us in suspense in order to try our faith. Though then he may
not as yet fulfill what he has promised, let it yet be our course to attempt
nothing rashly, while we are obeying his command. It will then be our chief
wisdom, by which we may escape all the crafts of Satan, simply to obey
God&#8217;s word, and to exercise our hope so as patiently to wait the
seasonable time, when he will fulfill what he now
promises.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as we are not
only alienated in mind from thee, but also often relapse after having been once
stirred up by thee, either into perverseness, or into our own vanity, or are led
astray by various things, so that nothing is more difficult than to pursue our
course until we reach the end of our race, &#8212; O grant that we may not
confide in our own strength, nor claim for ourselves more than what is right,
but, with our hearts raised above, depend on thee alone, and constantly call on
thee to supply us with new strength, and so to confirm us that we may persevere
to the end in the discharge of our duty, until we shall at length attain the
true and perfect form of that temple which thou commandest us to build, in which
thy perfect glory shines forth, and into which we are to be transformed by
Christ our Lord. Amen.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE HUNDRED AND
THIRTY-FIRST</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet, after having declared why it was
necessary to add new stimulants, now exhorts Zerubbabel and Joshua, and also the
people, to be courageous, and thus to proceed with the work. And he again
repeats what he had said, that the Lord was with them;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am with
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says. Now this one thing is enough for
us, that is, when God declares that he is with us; for his aid, we know, is
stronger than the whole world, however Satan may on every side attempt to resist
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He also adds, that his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Spirit would be in the midst
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of them; and then he says, that there was no
reason for them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fear</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
By his Spirit God means the power by which he strengthened their minds, that
they might not give way to their trials, or, that fear might not hinder them.
And what is particular is joined to what is general; for God is present with his
own in various ways: but he especially shows, that he is present when, by his
Spirit, he confirms weak minds. He then bids them all to be of a courageous
mind. This is one thing. But he also shows whence this courage proceeded; for he
sustained them by his Spirit when they were growing faint, or when they were not
able to resist fears. The Prophet reminds them by these words, that courage was
to be sought from God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence learn that what belongs to our calling and
duty is not required from us as though we were able to perform everything; but
when the Lord, according to his own right, commands, he offers the help of his
Spirit; and thus we ought to connect the promise of grace with the precept, of
which foolish men take no notice, who deduce free will from what is commanded:
for they thus reason &#8212; that it is in vain to require from us what is above
our ability, and that as God requires us to form our life according to the rule
of the highest perfection, it is therefore in our power to perform the highest
justice. But the Prophet here, in the first place, exhorts Joshua and
Zerubbabel, and the whole people, to be courageous, and then, he immediately
adds, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">
of God </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>would be in the midst of
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as though he had said, that there was no
reason for them to despond, though they had not sufficient strength in
themselves; for courage was to be sought from the Spirit of God, who would dwell
among them. In short, the Prophet teaches us that the faithful are so to strive
as not to arrogate anything to themselves, but to offer themselves to be ruled
by the Lord, that he may supply them with weapons as well as with strength, and
thus conquer in them; for though the victory is ascribed to us it is yet certain
that God conquers in us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the
word</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for so I render the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ta</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>at</i>.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl21</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> They
who think that the Jews are here reminded that it was their duty to obey God,
and purely to serve him, and truly to keep his law, according to what he had
commanded them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt, far depart from
the design of the Prophet; for the Prophet pursues the same subject; and in the
latter clause he confirms what I have just mentioned &#8212; that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">
of God </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>would be in the midst of
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He therefore shows that he promises
nothing new, but what God had formerly engaged to give to their fathers. If any
one prefers taking the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ta</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>at</i> in an explicative sense, I do not object; for the meaning would be the
same &#8212; that this is the word which he had promised. The object of the
Prophet is by no means doubtful; for he means to teach us that God is faithful
and constant in his promises, and that the Jews would find this to be the case,
for he would perform what he had formerly promised to their fathers.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
word</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which I had covenanted with you
when I brought you out of Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For the
Prophets were wont to remind the faithful of the ancient covenant, that they
might gain more credit to their special prophecies. We indeed know that whatever
God had promised to the Jews, was founded on their first adoption. When,
therefore, the Prophets brought forward the ancient covenant, it was the same as
though they led the Jews back to the fountain itself; for the promises, which
now and then occurred, were like streams which flowed from the first spring,
even their gratuitous covenant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see why an express mention is made of the
ancient compact which God had made with the chosen people at their departure out
of Egypt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must also be observed, that God became then the
Redeemer of his people, in order to be their eternal Father, and thus to be the
perpetual guardian of their safety. Hence the design of what the Prophet says is
to show that their fathers were not formerly redeemed, that their children might
reject God, but that he might continue his favor to his people to the end. But
the ultimate issue is to be found in Christ, that is, the full accomplishment;
for God does not cease to show kindness in him to his chosen people, but
performs much more fully and abundantly what he had previously exhibited under
types and shadows. For whatever he conferred on his ancient Church, was, as it
were, a prelude of his vast bounty, which was at length made known by the coming
of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now clearly apprehend what the Prophet meant: For
he upbraided the Jews for their stupidity, because they did not consider that
their fathers were formerly delivered from Egypt, that God might defend them to
the end. Hence he bids them maturely to examine the design and character of the
covenant which God made at their departure from Egypt; for he entered into
covenant with them, that he might be their Redeemer, and confer on them the
fullness of all blessings. Since it is so, he says, the time is now come when
God will perform what he then promised to your fathers; and whatever
faithfulness ye have hitherto found in God, ought to be applied for this end
&#8212; that ye may feel assured that ye have been now restored to your country,
in order that he might re-establish his Church, and that ye might not continue
in that low condition, which now depresses your minds. As then ye ought to look
for that fullness of happiness which God formerly promised, either his covenant
is void and he unfaithful, or ye ought with cheerfulness and alacrity to proceed
with the work. It follows &#8212;</font><br><br></div>

have hitherto supported your faith and your hope, yet after a short time God
will really prove that he has spoken nothing falsely to
you.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are yet some, as I have said, who think that
the matter itself is denoted by the Prophet, even that the Temple did not yet
appear in splendor before the eyes of men,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a small one it
is</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, Ye see not indeed a building such
as that was, before the Assyrians and the Chaldeans took possession of the city;
but let not your eyes remain fixed on the appearance of this Temple. Let then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this small one as yet
</i></font><font face="Palatino">pass by; but in a short time
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this house will be filled with
glory</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the main object, it was the
Prophet&#8217;s design to strengthen the minds of the godly, that they might not
think that the power of God was inefficient, though he had not as yet performed
what they had hoped. In short, they were not to judge by present appearances of
what had been previously said of their redemption. We said yesterday that the
minds of the godly were heavily depressed, because the Prophets had spoken in
high terms of the Temple as well as of the kingdom: the kingdom was as yet
nothing; and the temple was more like a shed than what might have been compared
in glory with the former Temple. It was hence necessary for the Prophet to meet
this objection; and this is the reason why he bids them to overlook the present
appearance, and to think of the glory which was yet hidden. As yet, he says, it
is a small one; that is, &#8220;There is no reason for you to despair, though
the grandeur of the Temple does not as yet appear to be so great as you have
conceived; but, on the contrary, let your minds pass over to that restoration
which is still far distant. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As
yet then a small one it is; and I will move the heavens and the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl22</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In a word, God here bids them to exercise patience,
until he should put forth the ineffable power of his hand to restore fully his
Church; and this is what is meant by the shaking of the heaven and the
earth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this is a remarkable passage. The Jews indeed,
who are very absurd in everything connected with the kingdom of Christ, pervert
what is here said by the Prophet, and even reduce it to nothing. But the Apostle
in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
12:1 reminds us of what God means here. For this passage contains an implied
contrast between the law and the gospel, between redemption, just mentioned
here, and that which was to be expected, and was at length made known by the
coming of Christ. God, then, when he redeemed his people from Egypt, as well as
from Babylon, moved the earth: but the Prophet announces here something greater
&#8212; that God would shake the heaven and the earth. But that the meaning of
the Prophet may appear more evident, each sentence must be examined in
order.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this once,
shortly</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I am inclined to apply this to time,
that I may not depart from what is commonly received. But there is no reason for
us to contend on the subject, because it makes little or no difference as to the
main point. For we have said that what the Prophet had in view was to show that
the Jews were not to fix their eyes and their minds on the appearance of the
Temple at the time: &#8220;Allow,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and give place to hope,
because your present state shall not long remain; for the Lord will shake the
heaven and the earth; think then of God&#8217;s power, how great it is; does he
not by his providence rule both the earth and the heaven? And he will shake all
things above and below, rather than not to restore his Church; he will rather
change the appearance of the whole world, than that redemption should not be
fully accomplished. Be not then unwilling to be satisfied with these preludes,
but know what God&#8217;s power can do: for though it may be necessary to throw
the heaven and the earth into confusions, yet this shall be done, rather than
that your enemies should prevent that full restoration, of which the Prophets
have so often spoken.&#8221; But the Apostle very justly says, that the gospel
is here set in contrast with the law; for God exhibited his wonderful power,
when the law was promulgated on mount Sinai; but a fuller power shone forth at
the coming of Christ, for then the heaven, as well as the earth, was shaken. It
is not, then, without reason that the Apostle concludes that God speaks now to
us from heaven, for his majesty appears more splendid in the gospel than
formerly in the law: and hence we are less excusable, if we despise him now
speaking in the person of his only begotten Son, and thus speaking to show to us
that the whole world is subject to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will move all the nations, and
they shall come</i></font><font face="Palatino">. After having mentioned the
heaven and the earth, he now shows that he would arrest the attention of all
mortals, so as to turn them according to his will, in any way it may please him:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall</i></font><font face="Palatino">
all nations &#8212; How? because I shall shake them. Here again the Prophet
teaches us that men come not to Christ except through the wonderful agency of
God. He might have spoken more simply, I will lead all nations, as it is said
elsewhere; but his purpose was to express something more, even that the impulse
by which God moves his elect to betake themselves to the fold of Christ is
supernatural. Shaking seems a forcible act. Lest men, then, should obscure the
power of God, by which they are roused that they may obey Christ, and submit to
his authority, it is here by the Prophet expressed by this term, in order that
they might understand that the Lord does not work in an usual or common manner,
when they are thus changed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it must be also observed, that men are thus
powerfully, and in an extraordinary or supernatural manner influenced, so that
they follow spontaneously at the same time. The operation of God is then
twofold; for it is first necessary to shake men, that they may unlearn their
whole character, that is, that forgetting their former nature, they may
willingly receive the yoke of Christ. We indeed know how great is our
perverseness, and how unnameable we are, until God subdues us by his Spirit.
There is need in such a case of a violent shaking. But we are not forced to obey
Christ, as lions and wild beasts are, who indeed yield, but still retain their
inward ferocity, and roar, though led in chains and subdued by scourges and
beatings. We are not, then, so shaken, that our inward rebellion remains in us;
but we are shaken, so that our disposition is changed, and we receive willingly
the yoke of Christ. This is the reason why the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will shake all nations, and
they shall come</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, there will be indeed
a wonderful conversion, when the nations who previously despised God, and
regarded true religion and piety with the utmost hatred, shall habituate
themselves to the ruling power of God: and they shall come, because they shall
be so drawn by his hidden influence, that the obedience they shall render will
be voluntary. We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The desire of all
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This admits of two explanations. The
first is, that nations shall come and bring with them everything that is
precious, in order to consecrate it to the service of God; for the Hebrews call
whatever is valuable a desire; so that under this term they include all riches,
honors, pleasures, and everything of this kind. Hence some render the passage
thus, I will shake all nations, and come shall the desire of all nations. As
there is a change of number; others will have
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>beth</i>, or
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mem</i>, to be understood, They shall come with what they desire; that is,
the nations shall not come empty, but shall gather all their treasures to be a
holy oblation to God. But we may understand what he says of Christ,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come shall the desire of all
nations, and I will fill this house with glory</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
We indeed know that Christ was the expectation of the whole world, according to
what is said by Isaiah. And it may be properly said, that when the desire of all
nations shall come, that is, when Christ shall be manifested, in whom the wishes
of all ought to center, the glory of the second Temple shall then be
illustrious; but as it immediately follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Mine is the silver, and mine is
the gold</i></font><font face="Palatino">, the more simple meaning is that which
I first stated &#8212; that the nations would come, bringing with them all their
riches, that they might offer themselves and all their possessions as a
sacrifice to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is, then, better to read what follows as an
explanation, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Mine is the silver,
mine is the gold, saith Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is,
&#8220;I have not through want of money deferred hitherto the complete building
of the Temple; for what can hinder me from amassing gold and silver from all
quarters? Should it so please me, I could in a short time build a Temple by all
the wealth of the world. Is it not indeed in my power to create mountains of
gold and silver, by which I might erect for myself a Temple? Ye hence see that
wealth is not wanting to me to build the Temple which I have promised; but the
time is not arrived. Therefore they who believe the preceding predictions, ought
to wait and to look forward, until the suitable time shall come.&#8221; This is
the import of the passage. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl23</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at length declares that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the glory
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of the second
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Temple</i></font><font face="Palatino">
would be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>greater</i></font><font face="Palatino">
than that of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
first</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and that there would be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peace in that
place</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As to the words there is nothing
obscure; but we ought especially to attend to what is said.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must, indeed, be first observed, that what is said
here of the future glory of the Temple is to be applied to the excellency of
those spiritual blessings which appeared when Christ was revealed, and are still
conspicuous to us through faith; for ungodly men are so blind that they see them
not. And this we must bear in mind, lest we dream like some gross interpreters,
who think that what is here said was in part fulfilled when Herod reconstructed
the Temple. For though that was a sumptuous building, yet there is no doubt but
that it was an attempt of the Devil to delude the Jews, that they might cease to
hope for Christ. Such was also, probably, the craft of Herod. We indeed know
that he was only a half-Jew. He professed himself to be one of Abraham&#8217;s
children; but he accommodated his habits, we know, to those of the Jews, oddly
for his own advantage. That they might not look for Christ, this delusive and
empty spectacle was presented to them, so as almost to astound them. Though
this, however, may not have entered into the mind of Herod, it is yet certain
that the Devil&#8217;s design was to present to the Jews this deceptive shade,
that they might not raise up their thoughts to look for the coming of Christ, as
the time was then near at hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God might, indeed, immediately at the beginning have
caused a magnificent temple to be built: as he had allowed a return to the
people, so he might have given them courage, and supplied them with materials,
to render the latter Temple equal or even superior to the Temple of Solomon. But
Cyrus prohibited by an edict the Temple to be built so high, and he also made
its length somewhat smaller: Why was this done? and why also did Darius do the
same, who yet liberally helped the Jews, and spared no expense in building the
Temple? How was it that both these kings, though guided by the Spirit of God,
did not allow the Temple to be built with the same splendor with which it had
been previously erected? This did not happen without the wonderful counsel of
God; for we know how gross in their notions the Jews had been, and we see that
even the Apostles were entangled in the same error; for they expected that the
kingdom of Christ would be no other than an earthly one. Had then this Temple
been equally magnificent with the former, and had the kingdom become such as it
had been, the Jews would have acquiesced in these outward pomps; so that Christ
would have been despised, and God&#8217;s spiritual favor would have been
esteemed as nothing. Since, then, they were so bent on earthly happiness, it was
necessary for them to be awakened; and the Lord had regard to their weakness, by
not allowing a splendid Temple to be built. But in suffering a counterfeit
Temple to be built by Herod, when the manifestation of Christ was nigh, he
manifested his vengeance by punishing their ingratitude, rather than his favor;
and I call it counterfeit, because its splendor was never approved by God.
Though Herod spent great treasures on that building, he yet profaned rather than
adorned the Temple. Foolishly, then, do some commemorate what Helena, queen of
Adiabenians, had laid out, and think that thus a credit is in some measure
secured to this prophecy. But it was on the contrary Satan who attempted to
deceive by such impostures and crafts, that he might draw away the minds of the
godly from the beauty of the spiritual Temple.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But why does the prophet mention gold and silver? He
did this in conformity with what was usual and common; for whenever the Prophets
speak of the kingdom of Christ, they delineate or describe its splendor in
figurative terms, suitable to their own age. When Isaiah foretells the
restoration of the Church, he declares that the Church would be all gold and
silver, and whatever glittered with precious stones; and in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;236001&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
60:1 he especially sets forth the magnificence of the Temple, as though nations
from all parts were to bring for sacrifice all their precious things. But Isaiah
speaks figuratively, as all the other Prophets do. So then what we read of gold
and of silver ought to be so explained as to be applied mystically to the
kingdom of Christ; as we have already observed respecting
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;390111&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
1:11 &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;They shall offer
to me, saith the Lord,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">pure
sacrifices from the rising to the setting of the sun.&#8217;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What are these sacrifices? Are heifers yet to be
offered, or lambs, or other animals? By no means; but we must regard the
spiritual character of the priesthood; for as the gold of which the Prophet now
speaks, and the silver, ought to be taken in a spiritual sense; for since Christ
has appeared in the world, it is not God&#8217;s will to be served with gold and
silver vessels; so also there is no altar on which victims are to be sacrificed,
and no candlestick; in a word, all the symbols of the law have ceased. It hence
follows that the Prophet speaks of the spiritual ornaments of the Temple. And
thus we perceive how the glory of the second Temple is to be greater than that
of the first.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then follows, that God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>would give peace in this
place</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as though he had said that it would be
well with the Jews if they only waited patiently for the complete fulfillment of
redemption. But it must be observed, that this peace was not so evident to them
that they could enjoy it according to the perception of the flesh; but it was
that kind of peace of which Paul speaks, and which, he says, exceeds all
understanding
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;500407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
4:7.) In short, the people could not have comprehended what the Prophet teaches
here respecting the future splendor of the Temple, except they leaped over all
the obstacles which seemed to obstruct the progress of complete redemption; and
so it was ever necessary for them to have recourse to this truth &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yet a little
while</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as though he said that they were
patiently to endure while God was exercising their faith: but that the time
would come, and that shortly, when the Lord would fill that house with glory
that is, when Christ would bring witch him all fullness of glory; for though
they were to gather the treasures of a thousand worlds into one mass, such a
glory would yet be corruptible; but when God the Father appeared in the person
of his own Son, he then glorified indeed his Temple; and his majesty shone forth
so much that there was nothing wanting to a complete
perfection.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>

by nature extremely prone to superstition, we may carefully consider what is the

and relying on no other priest, hope to be acceptable and devoted to thee, that
he may imbue us with the Spirit which has been fully poured on him, so that we
may from the heart devote ourselves to thee, and thus proceed patiently in our
course, that with minds raised upwards we may ever go on towards that glory

<div><font face="Palatino">THOUGH interpreters seem to perceive the meaning of
the Prophet, yet no one really and clearly expresses what he means and intends
to teach us: nay, they adduce nothing but what is jejune and frigid; for they
refer all these things to this point, &#8212; that sacrifices were not
acceptable to God before the people had begun to build the Temple, but that from
that time they were pleasing to God, because the people, in offering sacrifices
in a waste place, proved by such negligence that they disregarded the command of
God: but when their hands were applied to the work, God was appeased, and thus
he began to accept their sacrifices which before he had rejected. This is,
indeed, a part of what is meant, but not the whole; and the Prophet&#8217;s main
object seems to me to be wholly different. He has been hitherto exhorting the
people to build the Temple; he now exhorts them to build from a pure motive, and
not to think that they had done everything when the Temple assumed a fine
appearance before the eyes of men, for God required something else. Hence, I
have no doubt but that the Prophet intended here to raise up the minds of the
people to the spiritual worship of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was, indeed, necessary diligently to build the
Temple, but the end was also to be regarded; for God never cared for external
ceremonies; nor was he delighted with that building as men are with their
splendid houses. As the Jews absurdly ascribed these gross feelings to God, the
Prophet here shows why so strict a command had been given as to the building of
the Temple; and the reason was, &#8212; that God might be worshipped in a pure
and holy manner.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I will repeat again what I have said, that the
explanation may be more familiar to you. When the people neglected the building
of the Temple, they manifested their in-piety and their contempt of Divine
worship: for what was the cause of their delay and tardiness, except that each
of them regarded nothing but just his own private interest? Now, when all of
them strenuously undertook the work of building the Temple, their industry was
indeed laudable, for it was a proof of their piety: but when the people thought
that God required nothing more than a splendid Temple, it was manifest
superstition: for the worship of God, we know, is corrupted when it is confined
to external things; for, in this manner God is transformed into a nature not his
own: as he is a Spirit, so he must be spiritually worshipped by us. Whosoever
then obtrudes on him only external pomps in order to pacify him, most childishly
trifles with him. This second part, in my view, is what the Prophet now
undertakes to handle. From the seventh to the ninth month they had been
diligently engaged in the work which the Lord had commanded them to do: but men,
as we know, busy themselves with external things and neglect spiritual worship;
hence it was necessary to join what is said here, that the people might
understand, that it was not enough to satisfy God, though they spared neither
expense nor labor in building the Temple; but that something greater was
required, even to worship God in it in a pure and holy manner. This is the
design of the whole passage. But we must first examine the Prophet&#8217;s
words, and then it will be easier to gather the whole import of his
doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says then that he was ordered by God,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on the twenty fourth day of the
month, in the same year, in the second year of Darius, to ask the priests
concerning the law</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl24</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Haggai
is not bid to inquire respecting the whole law, but only that the priests should
answer a question according to the Word of God, or the doctrine of the law
according to what is commonly said &#8212; What is law, is the question: for it
was not allowed to the priests to allege anything they pleased indiscriminately;
but they were only interpreters of the law. This is the reason why God bids his
Prophet to inquire what the law of Moses defines as to the ceremony mentioned
here. And the design was, that the people, being convinced as to the legal
ceremonies, might not contend nor glamour, but acknowledge that all socks are
condemned as sinful which flow not from a pure and sincere
heart.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Haggai asks first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If a man takes holy flesh
</i></font><font face="Palatino">&#8212; that is, some part of the sacrifice,
&#8212; if any one takes and carries it in a sleeve or skirt, that is, in any
part of his vestment, and then touches bread, or oil, or any eatable thing, will
anything connected with that holy flesh be sanctified by mere touch?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The priests answer,
No</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here also interpreters grossly mistake: for
they take sanctified as meaning polluted, altogether falsely; for there is here
a twofold question proposed. Whether holy flesh sanctifies anything it may
touch? and then, whether an impure and a polluted man contaminates whatever he
may touch? As to the first question, the priests wisely and truly answer, that
there is no such efficacy in sacrifices, as that they can sanctify what they may
touch: and this is true. The second definition is also most proper, that
whatever is touched by an unclean man is polluted, as the law everywhere
declares.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet then accommodates this to his present
case,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is this people, and this
nation, and the work of their hands</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For as
long as they are polluted, however they may spend money in sacrifices, and
greatly weary themselves in worshipping God, not only is their labor vain, but
whatever they offer is polluted, and is an abomination only. We now understand
the words of the Prophet, and so we may now consider the
subject.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But before I speak generally of the present subject,
I shall first notice what the Prophet says here, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>inquired respecting the
law</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for it was not allowed to the priests to
allege anything they pleased. We indeed know, that they had advanced into such
licentiousness, as arbitrarily to demand what God had never commanded, and also
to forbid the people what was lawful, the use of which had been permitted by
God&#8217;s law. But Haggai does not here allow such a liberty to the priests;
he does not ask what they thought, but what was required by the law of the Lord.
And this is worthy of being noticed; for it is a pernicious evil to exercise an
arbitrary control over the conscience. And yet the devil has ever corrupted the
worship of God, and the whole system of religion, under the pretense of
extolling the authority of the Church. It is indeed true, that the sacerdotal
office was very honorable and worthy of respect; but we must ever take heed lest
men assume too much, and lest what is thoughtlessly conceded to them should
deprive God of what belongs to him; as the case is, we know, under the Papacy.
When the Pope seeks to show that all his commands ought without any dispute to
be obeyed, he quotes what is found in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051708&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
17:8 &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;If a question
arises about the law,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">the high
priest shall judge between what is sacred and profane.&#8217;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is indeed true; but was it permitted to the high
priest to disregard God&#8217;s law, and foolishly to allege this or that
according to his own judgement? Nay, the priest was only an interpreter of the
law. Whenever then God bids those pastors to be heard whom he sets over his
Church, his will is, as it has been before stated, that he himself should be
heard through their mouth. In short, whatever authority is exercised in the
Church ought to be subjected to this rule &#8212; that God&#8217;s law is to
retain its own pre-eminence, and that men blend nothing of their own, but only
define what is right according to the Word of the Lord. Now this is by the way;
I come now to the main point.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The priests
answered</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that neither flesh, nor oil, nor
wine, was sanctified by touching a piece or part of a sacrifice. Why? because a
sacrifice sanctifies not things unclean, except by way of expiation; for this,
we know, was the design of sacrifices &#8212; that men who were polluted might
reconcile themselves to God. A right answer was then given by the priests, that
unclean flesh or unclean oil is not sanctified by the touch of holy flesh. Why?
because the flesh itself was not dedicated to God for this end &#8212; to purify
what was unclean by a mere touch. Yet, on the other hand, it is most true, that
when a man was unclean he polluted whatever he touched. It is commonly thought,
that he is said to be unclean in his soul who had defiled himself by touching a
corpse; but I differ from this. The word soul is often taken in the law for man
himself. &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;The soul that eats
of what died of itself is
polluted;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">the soul that touches a
corpse is
polluted.&#8217;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;031715&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Leviticus
17:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he is here said to be polluted in his soul, who
had an outward uncleanness, as we say in French, <i>Pollu en sa personne</i>.
Whosoever then is unclean pollutes by touch only whatever might have been
otherwise clean; and the conclusion sufficiently proves that this is the purport
of this passage. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl25</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I have
said enough of what the design of the Prophet is, but the subject must be more
fully explained.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We know how heedlessly men are wont to deal with God;
for they trifle with him like children with their puppets. And this presumption
has been condemned, as it is well known, even by heathens. Hardly a Prophet
could have inveighed more severely against this gross superstition than Persius,
who compares sacrifices, so much thought of by all, to puppets, and shows that
other things are required by God, even</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>A well ordered
condition and piety of soul, and an inward
purity</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>of mind, and a
heart imbued with generous virtue.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino"><b><i> 
</i></b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl26</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He means then that men ought to be imbued with true
holiness, and that inwardly, so that there should be nothing fictitious or
feigned. He says that they who are such, that is, who have imbibed the true fear
of God, do rightly serve him, thought they may bring only a crumb of incense,
and that others only profane the worship of God, though they may bring many
oxen; for whatever they think avails to cover their filth is polluted by new and
repeated filth. And this is what has been expressed by heathen authors: another
poet says, -</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>An impious right
hand does not rightly worship the
celestials.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino"><b><i> 
</i></b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl27</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So they spoke according to the common judgement of
natural knowledge. As to the Philosophers, they ever hold this principle &#8212;
that no sacrifice is rightly offered to God except the mind be right and pure.
But yet the Philosophers, as well as the Poets, adopted this false notion, by
which Satan beguiled all men, from the least to the greatest &#8212; that God is
pacified by ceremonies: hence have proceeded so many expiations, in which
foolish men trusted, and by which they thought that God would be propitious to
them, thought they obstinately continued daily to procure for themselves new
punishments, and, as it were, avowedly to carry on war with God
himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They admit at this day, under the Papacy, this
principle that the true fear of God is necessary, as hypocrisy contaminates all
the works of men; nor will they indeed dare to commend those who seek feignedly
and triflingly to satisfy God, when they are filled with pride, contempt, and
impiety. And yet they will never receive what the Prophet says here &#8212; that
men not only lose all their labor, but also contract new pollution, when they
seek to pacify God by their sacrifices, unaccompanied by inward purity. For
whence is that partial righteousness which the Papists imagine? For they say,
that if one does not keep the whole law, yet obedience in part is approved by
God; and nothing is more common among them than this expression, partial
righteousness. If then an adulterer refrains from theft, and lays out in alms
some of his wealth, they will have this to be charity, and declare it to be
acceptable. Though it proceeds from an unclean man, it is yet made a covering,
which is deemed sufficient in some way or another to pacify God. Thus the
Papists seek, without exercising any discrimination, to render God bound to them
by their works, though they may be full of all uncleanness. We hence see that
this error has not sprung up today or yesterday for the first time; but it is
inherent in the bones and marrows of men; for they have ever thought that their
services please God, though they may be unclean themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence this definition must be borne in mind &#8212;
that works, however splendid they may appear before our eyes, are of no value or
importance before God, except they flow from a pure heart. Augustine has very
wisely explained this in his fourth book against Julia. He says, that it would
be an absurd thing for the faithful to judge of works by the outward appearance;
but that they ought to be estimated according to the fountain from which they
proceed, and also according to their design. Now the fountain of works I
consider to be integrity of heart, and the design or end is, when the object of
men is to obey God and to consecrate their life to him. Hence then we learn the
difference between good and evil works, between vices and virtues, that is, from
the inward state of the mind, and from the object in view. This is the subject
of the Prophet in the first clause; and he drew an answer from the priests,
which was wholly consistent with the law; and it amounted to this, that no work,
however praised and applauded by the world, is valued before God&#8217;s
tribunal, except it proceeds from a pure heart.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now as to the second part, it is no less difficult to
convince men of its truth &#8212; that whatever they touch is contaminated, when
they are themselves unclean; and yet this is what God had plainly made known to
the Jews: and the priests hesitated not nor doubted, but immediately returned an
answer, as though the matter was well known &#8212; that an unclean man
contaminates whatever thing he touches. But when we come to apply the subject,
men then reject what they had been clearly taught; nay, what they are forced to
confess, until they see the matter brought home to them, and then they begin to
accuse God of too much rigour: &#8220;Why is this, that whatever we touch is
polluted, though we might leave some defilement? Are not our works still
deserving of some praise, as they are good works?&#8221; And hence also is the
common saying, That works, which are in their kind good, are always in a measure
meritorious, and though they are without faith, they yet avail to merit the gift
of faith, inasmuch as they are in themselves praiseworthy, as chastity,
liberality, sobriety, temperance, beneficence, and all alms giving. But God
declares that these virtues are polluted, though men may admire them, and that
they are only abominable filth, except the heart be really cleansed and
purified. Why so? because nothing can flow from an impure and polluted fountain
but what is impure and polluted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is now easy to understand how suitably the Prophet
had led the priests and the whole people to see this difference. For if he had
abruptly said this to them &#8212; that no work pleased Cod, except the doer
himself had been cleansed from every defilement, there would have arisen
immediate]y many disputations: &#8220;Why will God reject what is in itself
worthy of praise? When one observes chastity, when another liberally lays out a
part of his property, when a third devotes himself wholly to promote the good of
the public, when magnanimity and firmness shine forth in one, when another
cultivates the liberal arts &#8212; are not these such virtues as deserve some
measure of praise!&#8221; Thus a great glamour would have been raised among the
people, had not Haggai made this kind of preface &#8212; that according to the
law what is unclean is not sanctified by the touch of holy flesh, and also that
whatever is touched by an unclean person is polluted. What the law then
prescribed in its rituals silenced all those clamours, which might have
immediately arisen among the people. Moreover, though ceremonies have now ceased
and are no longer in use, yet what God has once declared still retains its force
&#8212; that whatever we touch is polluted by us, except there be a real purity
of heart to sanctify our works.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now inquire how our works please God: for no
one is ever found to be pure and perfect, as the most perfect are defiled with
some vices; so that their works are always sprinkled with some spots and
blemishes, and contract some uncleanness from the hidden filth of their hearts.
In answer to this, I say first, that all our works are corrupt before God and
abominable in his sight, for the heart is naturally corrupt: but when God
purifies our hearts by faith, then our works begin to be approved, and obtain
praise before him; for the heart is cleansed by faith, and purity is diffused
over our works, so that they begin to be pleasing to God. For this reason Moses
says, that Abel pleased God with his sacrifices,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The Lord had
respect to Abel and to his
gifts.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
4:4.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Had Moses said only, that the sacrifices of Abel were
approved by God, he would have spoken unadvisedly, or at least obscurely; for he
would have been silent on the main thing. But he begins with the person, as
though he had said, that Abel pleased God, because he worshipped him with an
upright and sincere heart. He afterwards adds, that his sacrifices were
approved, for they proceeded from the true fear of God and sincere piety. So
Paul, when speaking of the real keeping of the law, says, that the end of the
law is love from a pure heart and faith unfeigned.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 1:5.) He shows then that no work is deemed right before God, except it
proceeds from that fountain, even faith unfeigned, which is always connected
with an upright and sincere heart. This is one thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Secondly, we must bear in mind how God purifies our
hearts by faith. There is indeed a twofold purification: He first forms us in
his image, and engraves on us true and real fear, and an obedient disposition.
This purity of the heart diffuses itself over our works; for when we are imbued
with true piety, we have no other object but to offer ourselves and all we have
to God. Far indeed are they who are hypocrites and profane men from having this
feeling; nay, they are wholly alienated from it: they offer liberally their own
things to God, but they wish to be their own masters; for a hypocrite will never
give up himself as a spiritual sacrifice to God. We hence see how faith purifies
our hearts, and also purifies our works: for having been regenerated by the
Spirit of God, we offer to him first ourselves and then all that we have. But as
this purgation is never found complete in man, it is therefore necessary that
there should come an aid from gratuitous acceptance. Our hearts then are
purified by faith, because God imputes not to us that uncleanness which remains,
and which defiles our works. As then God regards with gracious acceptance that
purity which is not as yet perfect, so he causes that its contagion should not
reach to our works. When Abel offered sacrifices to God, he was indeed perfect,
inasmuch as there was nothing feigned or hypocritical in him: but he was a man,
we know, encompassed with infirmity. It was therefore necessary for his
remaining pollution to have been purified by the grace of Christ. Hence it was
that his sacrifices were accepted: for as he was accepted, so God graciously
received whatever proceeded from him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see how men, while in a state of nature,
displease God by their works, and can bring nothing but what is corrupt, filthy,
and abominable. We farther see how the children of God, after having been
renewed by his Spirit, come pure to him and offer him pure sacrifices: they come
pure, because it is their object to devote themselves to God without any
dissimulation; but as this devotedness is never perfect, God supplies the defect
by a gratuitous imputation, for he embraces them as his servants in the same
manner as though they were entirely formed in all righteousness. And in the same
way he approves of their works, for all their spots are wiped away, yea, those
very spots, which might justly prevent all favor; were not all uncleanness
washed away by the blood of Christ, and that through faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence learn, that there is no ground for any one
to deceive himself with vain delusions, by attempting to please God with great
pomp: for the first thing of which the Prophet treats here is always required,
that is, that a person must be pure in his heart, that inward purity must
precede every work. And though this truth meets us everywhere in all the
Prophets, yet as hypocrisy dazzles our eyes and blinds all our senses, it ought
to be seriously considered by us; and we ought to notice in an especial manner
not only this passage but other similar passages where the Prophets ridicule the
solicitude of the people, when they busied themselves with sacrifices and
outward observances, and neglected the principal thing &#8212; real purity of
heart.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must also take notice of what the Prophet says in
the last verse, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>so was every
work of their hand and whatever they offered</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl28</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It
seems apparently a hard matter, that the very sacrifices were condemned as
polluted. But it is no wonder that fictitious modes of worship, by which profane
men dishonor God, should be repudiated by him; for they seek to transform him
according to their own fancy, as though he might be soothed by playthings or
such trifles. It is therefore a most disgraceful mockery when men deal thus with
God, offering him only external ceremonies, and disregarding his nature: for
they make no account of spiritual worship, and yet think that they please him.
We must then, in a word, make this remark &#8212; that the Prophet teaches us
here, that it is not enough for men to show obedience to God, to offer
sacrifices, to spend labor in building the Temple, except these things were
rightly done &#8212; and how rightly? by a sincere heart, so there should be no
dissimulation, no
duplicity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that inasmuch as we
come from our mother&#8217;s womb wholly impure and polluted, and afterwards
continually contract so many new defilements, &#8212; O grant that we may flee
to the fountain, which alone can cleanse us. And as there is no other way by
which we can be cleansed from all the defilements of the flesh, except we be
sprinkled by the blood of thy only begotten Son, and that by the hidden power of
thy Spirit, and thus renounce all our vices, &#8212; O grant that we may so
strive truly and sincerely to devote ourselves to thee, as daily to renounce
more and more all our evil affections, and to have nothing else as our object,
but to submit our minds and all our affections to thee, by really denying
ourselves, and to exercise ourselves in this strenuous effort as long as we are
in this world, until we attain to that true and perfect purity, which is laid up
for us in thine only-begotten Son, when we shall be fully united to him, having
been transformed into that glory into which he has been received.
Amen.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">I AM under the necessity of joining all these verses
together, for the Prophet treats of the same thing: and the import of the whole
is this &#8212; that the Lord had then openly punished the tardiness of the
people, so that every one might have easily known that they acted very
inconsistently in attending only to their private concerns, so as to neglect the
Temple. The Prophet indeed speaks here in a homely manner to earthly men,
addicted to their own appetites: had they really become wiser, or made greater
progress in true religion, he might have addressed them differently, and would
have no doubt followed the rule mentioned by Paul,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;We speak wisdom
among those who are
perfect.&#8217;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 2:6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as they had their thoughts fixed on meat and
drink, and were intent on their private advantages, the Prophet tells them what
they could comprehend that God was angry with them, and that the proofs of his
curse were evident, as the earth did not produce fruit, and they themselves were
reduced to want. We hence perceive the object of the Prophet: but I shall run
over the words, that the subject may become more evident.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lay
it</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on your
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here the Prophet indirectly condemns
their insensibility, as they were blind in things quite manifest; for he does
not here direct their thoughts to heaven, nor announce deep mysteries, but only
speaks of food and daily support. Since God, then, impressed clear marks of his
wrath on their common sustenance, it was an intolerable stupidity in them to
disregard these. And the Prophet often repeats the same thing, in order to shame
the Jews; for their tardiness being so often reproved, ought to have made them
ashamed. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lay it on the
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says; that is, Consider what I am
going to say; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from this day and
heretofore</i></font><font face="Palatino">, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fl29</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before a stone was laid on
a stone</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, from that day when I began to
exhort you to build the Temple, consider what has happened to this very
day.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds, Before ye began, he says, to build the
Temple, was it not that every one who came to a heap of twenty measures found
only ten? that is, was it not, that when the husband men expected that there
would be twenty measures in the storehouse or on the floor, they were
disappointed? because God had dried up the ears, so they yielded not what they
used to do; for husband men, by long experience, can easily conjecture what they
may expect when they see the gathered harvest; but this prospect had
disappointed the husband men. God, then, had in this case given proofs of his
curse. Farther; when any one came to the vat, and expected a large vintage, had
he not also been disappointed? for instead of fifty casks he found only
twenty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have smitten you with the east
wind</i></font><font face="Palatino">: for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wpd&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shidafun</i>, is to be taken for a scorching wind; and the east wind proved
injurious to Judea by its dryness. So also
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wqry</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>irkun</i>, is mildew, or a moist wind, from which mildew proceeds; for we
know that corn, when it has much wet, contracts mildew when the sun emits its
heat. As to the meaning of the Prophet there is no ambiguity, for he intended to
teach them that they were in various ways visited, that they might clearly
perceive that God was displeased with them. He then mentions the hail: for when
famine happens only from the cold or from the heat, it may be ascribed to chance
or to the stars: but when God employs various scourges, we are then constrained
to acknowledge his wrath, as though he were determined to awaken us. This is the
reason why the Prophet records here various kinds of judgements. And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In every work of your
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some read, And every work, etc., which
is improper; for they were not smitten in their own bodies, but in the produce
of the earth. Then he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
you </i></font><font face="Palatino">returned
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not to
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, &#8220;During the whole of that
time I effected nothing, while I was so often and in such various ways
chastising you. And yet what good has the obduracy of your hearts done you? ye
have not returned to me.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lay
it</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on your heart from this day, and
heretofore</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. He repeats what he had said,
even from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month. We have seen before, that
the Prophet was sent on that day to reprove the people for their sins.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lay it
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on your
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from this
day</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. We see how emphatical is this
repetition, because in things evident the Jews were so insensible that their
want and famine could not touch them: and we know that there is no sharper goad
to stimulate men than famine. Since then the Lord snatched away their food from
their mouth, and they remained inattentive to such a judgement, it was a sure
evidence of extreme stupidity. It is on this account that the Prophet often
declares, that the Jews were extremely insensible; for they did not consider the
judgements of God, which were so manifest. He now subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is there yet seed in the barn?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Jerome reads, in the bud; and the probable
reason why he thus rendered the word was, that he thought that the clauses would
not correspond without giving the meaning of bud to
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrwgm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>megure</i>; but, as I think, he was mistaken. The Hebrews propose what I
cannot approve, for some of them read the sentence as an affirmation, For there
is seed in the barn; because they dared not to commit the seed to the ground in
their state of want. And others read it as a question, as though he had said,
that the time of harvest was far off, and that what they had remaining was so
small that it was not enough to support them. But, in my judgement, the seed
refers not to what had been gathered, but to what had been sown. I therefore
doubt not but that he speaks of God&#8217;s blessing on the harvest which was to
come after five months, to which I shall presently refer. Some, indeed, render
the words in the past tense, as though the Prophet had said, that the Jews had
already experienced how great the curse of God was; but this is a forced view.
The real meaning of the Prophet is this,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is there yet seed in the
barn?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, Is the seed, as yet hid in the
ground, gathered?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds affirmatively,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>neither the vine, nor the fig
tree, nor the pomegranate, nor the olive had yet produced any
thing</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for it was the ninth month of the year;
and the beginning of the year, we know, was in the month of March. Though then
they were nearly in the midst of winter, they remained uncertain as to what the
produce would be. In the month of November no opinion could be formed, even by
the most skillful, what produce they were to expect. As then they were still in
suspense, the Prophet says, that God&#8217;s blessing was in readiness for them.
What he had in view was, to show that he brought a sure message from God; for he
speaks not of a vintage the prospect of which had already appeared, nor of a
harvest when the ears had already made their appearance. As then there was still
danger from the hail, from scorching winds, and also from rains and other things
injurious to fruit and produce of the land, he says, that the harvest would be
most abundant, the vintage large, that, in a word, the produce of the olive and
the fig tree would be most exuberant. The truth of the prophecy might now be
surely known, when God fulfilled what he had spoken by the mouth of his servant.
I now return to the subject itself</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As I have before observed, the Prophet deals with the
Jews here according to their gross disposition: for he might in a more refined
manner have taught the godly, who were not so entangled with, or devoted to,
earthly concerns. It was then necessary for him to speak in a manner suitable to
the comprehension of the people, as a skillful teacher who instructs children
and those of riper age in a different manner. And he shows by evidences that the
Jews were unthankful to God, for they neglected the building of the Temple, and
every one was diligently and earnestly engaged in building his own house. He
shows by proofs their conduct, &#8212; How? Whence has it happened, he says,
that at one time your fruit has been destroyed by mildew, at another by heat,
and then by the hail, except that the Lord intended thus to correct your
neglect? It then follows, that you are convicted of ingratitude by these
judgements; for you have neglected God&#8217;s worship, and only pursued your
own private advantages. This is one thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The latter clause contains a promise; and by it the
instruction given was more confirmed, when the people saw that things suddenly
and unexpectedly took a better turn. They had been for many years distressed
with want of sustenance; but, when fruitfulness of a sudden followed, did not
this change manifest something worthy of their consideration? especially when it
was foretold before it happened, and before any such thing could have been
foreseen by human conjectures? We see then, that the Prophet dwells on two
things, &#8212; he condemns the Jews for their neglect, and proves that they
were impious and ungrateful towards God, for they disregarded the building of
the Temple; and them, in order to animate them and render them more active in
the work they had begun, he sets before them, as I have said, what had taken
place. God had, indeed, abundantly testified, by various kinds of punishment
that he was displeased with them: but when he now promises that he would deal
differently with them, there hence arises a new and a stronger
evidence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But some one may here raise an objection and say,
that these evidences are not sure or unvaried; since it often happens, that when
people devote themselves faithfully to the service of God they are pressed down
by adverse events; yea, that God very often designedly tries their faith by
withholding from them for a time his blessing. But the answer to this may be
readily given: I indeed allow that it often happens that those who sincerely and
from the heart serve God, are deprived of earthly blessings, because God intends
to elevate their minds to the hope of eternal reward. God then designedly
withdraws his blessing often from the faithful, that they may hunger and thirst
in this world; as though they lost all their labor in serving him. But it was
not the Prophet&#8217;s design to propound here an evidence of an unvarying
character, as he counted it sufficient to convince the Jews by experience, that
nothing prevented them from acknowledging that their avarice displeased God,
except their extreme stupidity. The Prophet then does here reprove their
insensibility; for, while they greatly labored in enriching themselves, they did
not observe that their labor was in vain, because God from heaven poured his
curse on them. This then might have been easily known by them had they not
hardened themselves in their vices. And what the Prophet testifies here
respecting the fruitful produce of wine, and corn, and oil, and of other things,
was still, as I have said, a stronger confirmation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, if any one objects again and says &#8212; that
this was of no value, because a servile and mercenary service does not please
God: to this I answer &#8212; that God does often by such means stimulate men,
when he sees them to be extremely tardy and slothful, and that he afterwards
leads them by other means to serve him truly and from the heart. When therefore
any one obeys God, only that he may satisfy his appetite, it is as though one
labored from day to day for the sake of wages, and then disregards him by whom
he has been hired. It is certain that such a service is counted as nothing
before God; but he would have himself to be generously worshipped by us; and he
loves, as Paul says, a cheerful giver.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470607&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 6:7.) But as men, for the most part, on account of their ignorance,
cannot be led at first to this generous state of mind, so as to devote
themselves willingly to God, it is necessary to begin by using other means, as
the Prophet does here, who promises earthly and daily sustenance to the Jews,
for he saw that they could not immediately, at the first step, ascend upwards to
heaven; but it was not his purpose to stop short, until he elevated their minds
higher. Let us then know, that this was only the beginning, that they might
learn to fear God and to expect whatever they wanted from his blessing, and also
that they might shake off their stupor, under which they had previously labored.
In short, God deals in one way with the rude and ignorant, who are not yet
imbued with true religion; and he deals in another way with his own disciples,
who are instructed in sound doctrine. When I say that the Prophet acted thus
towards the Jews, I speak not of the whole nation; but I regard what we have
observed at the beginning of this book &#8212; that the Jews cared for nothing
then but to build their own houses, and that there was no zeal for religion
among them. As then the recollection of God was nigh buried among them, the
Temple being neglected, and every one&#8217;s anxiety being concentrated in
building his own house, we hence learn how grossly earthly their affections
were. It is therefore no wonder that the Prophet treated them in the manner
stated here. Let us proceed -</font><br><br></div>

</table></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now proceeds still farther; for there is
here a really gratuitous and spiritual promise, by which God affirms that he
will have a care for his people to the end. He does not now speak of wine and
corn, in order to feed the hungry; but he shows that he would be an eternal
Father to that people; for he could not and would not forget the covenant he
made with their fathers. There is no doubt but he points out Christ in the
person of Zerubbabel, as we shall presently see. So that it is right to
distinguish this prophecy from the last; for God has before shown, that the
worship which the Jews had for a time disregarded was pleasing to him, as a
reward was in readiness, and also that he was offended with the negligence
previously reproved, as he had inflicted manifest punishment, not once, nor for
a short time, but for many years, and in various ways. What then does follow? In
this second prophecy he addresses Zerubbabel, and promises to be a Savior to the
people under his authority.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to these words, some think that a
continued act is signified when he says, I shake the heavens and the earth; and
they give this explanation &#8212; That though it belongs to me to shake the
heaven and the earth, and I am wont to subvert kingdoms, yet I will render firm
the sacred kingdom which I have raised among my people. But this view is very
frigid: and we see even from this chapter what is meant by the shaking of the
heaven and of the earth, of which mention is made. The Apostle also rightly
interprets this passage, when he teaches us, that this prophecy properly belongs
to the kingdom of Christ.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581226&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
12:26.) There is therefore no doubt, but that the Prophet means here something
special, when he introduces God as saying, Behold, I shake the heavens and the
earth. God then does not speak of his ordinary providence, nor simply claim to
himself the government of the heaven and of the earth, nor teach us that he
raises on high the humble and the low, and also brings down the high and the
elevated; but he intimates, that he has some memorable work in contemplation,
which, when done, would shake men with fear, and make heaven and earth to
tremble. Hence, the Prophet no doubt intended here to lead the Jews to the hope
of that redemption, some prelude of which God had then given them; but its
fullness could not as yet be seen &#8212; nay, it was hid from the view of men:
for who could have expected such a renovation of the world as was effected by
the coming of Christ? When the Jews found themselves exposed to the wrongs of
all men, when so small a number returned, and there was no kingdom and no power,
they thought themselves to have been as it were deceived. Hence the Prophet
affirms here, that there would be a wonderful work of God, which would shake the
heaven and the earth. It is therefore necessary that this should be applied to
Christ; for it was, as it were, a new creation of the world, when Christ
gathered together the things scattered, as the Apostle says, in the heaven and
in the earth.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510120&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
1:20.) When he reconciled men to God and to angels, when he conquered the devil
and restored life to the dead, when he shone forth with his own righteousness,
then indeed God shook the heaven and the earth; and he still shakes them at this
day, when the gospel is preached; for he forms anew the children of Adam after
his own image. This spiritual regeneration then is such an evidence of
God&#8217;s power and grace, that he may justly be said to shake the heaven and
the earth. The import of the passage is, that it behaved the Jews to form a
conception in their minds of something greater than could be seen by their eyes;
for their redemption was not yet completed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he subjoins &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will overthrow the throne of
kingdoms; I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will
overthrow the chariot and him who sits in it; come down shall the horses and
their riders; every one shall fall by the sword of his
brother</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He confirms here the former sentence
&#8212; that nothing would be an hindrance that God should not renew his Church.
And rightly he adds this by way of anticipation; for the Jews were surrounded on
all sides by inveterate enemies; they had as many enemies as they had neighbors;
and they were hated even by the whole world. How then could they emerge into
that dignity which was then promised to them, except God overturned the rest of
the world? But the Prophet here meets this objection, and briefly shows that God
would rather that all the nations should perish, than that his Church should
remain in that dishonorable state. We then see that the Prophet here means no
other thing then that God would overcome all those impediments, which Satan and
the whole world may throw in the way, when it is his purpose to restore his
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive the Prophet&#8217;s designs, and we
also perceive the application of his doctrine. For whenever impediments and
difficulties come in our way, calculated to drive us to despair, when we think
of the restoration of the Church, this prophecy ought to come to our minds,
which shows that it is in God&#8217;s power, and that it is his purpose to
overturn all the kingdoms of the earth, to break chariots in pieces, to cast
down and lay prostrate all riders, rather then to allow them to prevent the
restoration of his Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But in the last verse the Prophet shows why God would
do this &#8212; even that Zerubbabel might prosper together with the whole
people. Hence he says &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In
that day saith Jehovah, I will take thee, Zerubbabel, and will set thee as a
signet, for I have chosen thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As we have
before said, God addresses Zerubbabel here, that in his person he might testify
that he would bless the people whom he intended to gather under that sacred
leader; for though Zerubbabel never had a kingdom, nor ever wore a crown, he was
yet of the tribe of Judah; and God designed that some spark of that kingdom
should exist, which he had raised in the family of David. Since, then,
Zerubbabel was at that time a type of Christ, God declares here that he would be
to him as a signet &#8212; that is, that his dignity would be esteemed by him.
This comparison of a signet is found also in other places. It is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242224&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
22:24 &#8212; &#8220;Though this Coniah were a signet on my right hand I would
pluck him thence.&#8221; But here God says that Zerubbabel would be to him a
signet &#8212; that is, Thou shalt be with me in high esteem. For a sealing
signet is wont to be carefully preserved, as kings seek in this way to secure to
themselves the highest authority, so that more trust may be placed in their seal
than in the greatest princes. The meaning, then, of the similitude is, that
Zerubbabel, though despised by the world, was yet highly esteemed by God. But it
is evident that this was never fulfilled in the person of Zerubbabel. It hence
follows that it is to be applied to Christ. God, in short, shows, that that
people gathered under one head would be accepted by him; for Christ was at
length to rise, as it is evident, from the seed of Zerubbabel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this reason is to be especially noticed &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because I have chosen
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For God does not here ascribe
excellencies or merits to Zerubbabel, when he says that he would hold him in
great esteem; but he attributes this to his own election. If, then, the reason
be asked why God had so much exalted Zerubbabel, and bestowed on him favors so
illustrious, it can be found in nothing else but in the goodness of God alone.
God had made a covenant with David, and promised that his kingdom would be
eternal; hence it was that he chose Zerubbabel after the people had returned
from exile; and this election was the reason why God exalted Zerubbabel, though
his power at that time was but small. We indeed know that he was exposed to the
contempt of all nations; but God invites here the attention of the faithful to
their election, so that they might hope for more than what the perception of the
flesh could conceive or apprehend; for what he has decreed cannot be made void;
and in the person of Zerubbabel he had determined to save a chosen people; for
from him, as it has been said, Christ was to
come.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as we are
still restrained by our earthly cares, and cannot ascend upward to heaven with
so much readiness and alacrity as we ought &#8212; O grant, that since thou
extendest to us daily so liberal a supply for the present life, we may at least
learn that thou art our Father, and that we may not at the same time fix our
thoughts on these perishable things, but learn to elevate our minds higher, and
so make continual advances in thy spiritual service, until at length we come to
the full and complete fruition of that blessed and celestial life which thou
hast promised to us, and procured for us by the blood of thy only begotten Son.

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth1</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Who
Habakkuk was is uncertain. Some have concluded, from chapter 3:19, that he was
of the tribe of Levi; but the premises do not warrant the conclusion. &#8220;He
was probably,&#8221; says <i>Adam Clarke</i>, &#8220;of the tribe of
<i>Simeon</i>, and a native of Beth-zacar.&#8221; The grounds for this
probability are not stated. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth2</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>Newcome&#8217;s </i>opinion is the following: &#8212; &#8220;It seems
probable that Habakkuk lived after the taking of Nineveh, as he prophesies of
the Chaldeans, and is silent on the subject of the Assyrians. We have also
reason to conclude that he prophesied not long before the Jewish captivity. See
chapter 1:5; 2:3; 3:2,6-19. He may therefore be placed in the reign of
Jehoiakim, between the years 606 and 598 before Christ.&#8221;</font><br></div>

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth3</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Rather, a
causative meaning; for so does <i>Calvin</i> take it; and <i>Junius </i>and
<i>Tremelius, Piscator, Grotius, </i>and <i>Newcome, </i>agree with him: but
<i>Drusius, Marckius, Henderson, </i>and others, consider it simply in the sense
of seeing or beholding, and say with truth, that there is no other instance in
which it has, though it be often found, as here, in Hiphil, a causative sense.
The context, as <i>Calvin </i>says, seems certainly to favor this meaning; and
we might suppose that Habakkuk used it in a sense different from others, were it
not that he uses it at least twice in this very chapter, verses 5 and 13, simply
in the sense of seeing or beholding.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In these two verses there is no need of continuing
the interrogatory form throughout, nor is this justified by the original. A
strictly literal rendering, such as the following, would be the most
appropriate:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">How long, Jehovah, have I cried, and
thou hearest not? I cry aloud to thee, &#8220;oppression,&#8221; and thou savest
not:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">
Why showest thou to me iniquity? Yea, wickedness is what thou seest; Even
wasting and oppression are before me; Then there is strife, and contention
arises.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some think that there is to be understood a
preposition before
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;mj</font><font face="Palatino">],
which I render &#8220;oppression,&#8221; in the second line; but there is no
need of it. The word means outrage, wrong forcibly done, violent injustice.
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lm[</font><font face="Palatino">],
wickedness, in the second line of the third verse, in its primary sense, is
labor, toil; it means also what produces toil, mischief, wickedness.
<i>Henderson </i>renders it misery; but it is not so suitable; for it must be
something that corresponds with iniquity in the previous line. Wickedness is the
word adopted by <i>Newcome</i>.
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">byr</font><font face="Palatino">],
strife, is a verbal contention or quarrel; and
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">zwdm</font><font face="Palatino">]
contention, is a judicial contest, or a trial by law. Then in the next verse we
see how unjustly this trial was conducted. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth4</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> <i>Calvin
</i>omits to notice &#8220;therefore,&#8221;
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">zkAl[</font><font face="Palatino">],
at the beginning of the verse. <i>Henderson</i> says, that the connection is
with the second verse: but this can hardly be the case; and certainly what this
verse contains is no reason for what is stated in the previous verse.
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">zkl</font><font face="Palatino">],
a similar proposition with this, when followed by
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">],
as the case is here, refers sometimes to what follows and not to what precedes.
See
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;191610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
16:10,11; 78:21,22. The meaning of the verse will be elicited, as I can
conceive, by the following version: &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>On this account the
law fails, And judgment goeth not forth to victory, &#8212; Because wickedness
surrounds the
righteous;</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Yea,</i></b>
<b><i>on this account perverted judgment goeth forth.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The expression,
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jxnl al
</font><font face="Palatino">], is rendered &#8220;never&#8221; in our version,
and by <i>Newcome;</i> but it never means this: &#8220;not for ever, or not
always,&#8221; it is rendered in other places. See
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;190919&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
9:19; 74:19. But
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jxn</font><font face="Palatino">]
means as a noun, superiority, excellency, strength, victory; and this, according
to <i>Parkhurst</i>, is what it means here. It seems better to render
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[&ccedil;r</font><font face="Palatino">],
wickedness, than wicked. It means injustice, the perversion of right, and by
this the just man was surrounded or completely beset, so that he had no chance
of having justice done to him. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This may
perhaps be considered one of the <i>very few </i>instances in which the
<i>Septuagint</i> seems to have retained the true reading without the
countenance of a single MS.; for the word &#8220;despisers&#8221; is more
suitable to the context. The very same word is found in the 13th verse of this
chapter. The omission is very trifling, only of the letter
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d</font><font face="Palatino">],
and Paul in quoting this passage, in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441341&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
13:41, retains this word, while in the other clauses he departs from the
<i>Septuagint</i>, and comes nearer to the Hebrew text. <i>Pocock</i> thought
that
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ywgb</font><font face="Palatino">]
is a noun from the Arabic
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">agb</font><font face="Palatino">],
which means to be unjust or injurious; and thus the Hebrew is made the same with
the <i>Septuagint</i>, and St. Paul,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">katafronhtai</font><font face="Palatino">,
despisers &#8212; the insolent; but the former supposition seems the more
probable &#8212; that the letter
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d</font><font face="Palatino">]
has been omitted. <i>Dathius</i> renders the word &#8220;<i>perfidi</i> &#8212;
perfidious,&#8221; and <i>Newcome </i>&#8220;transgressors.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth6</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This is
the proper rendering, and not as in our version. It is not the usual mode in
Hebrew to enhance the meaning by connecting two verbs together; but the two
other verbs here are in the imperative mood, only the first is in Niphal and the
other in Kal. <i>Parkhurst </i>very properly renders them, <i>and be ye
astonished, wonder</i>, etc. The repetition, says <i>Drusius, </i>is for the
sake of emphasis. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth7</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8220;Bitter&#8221; rendered &#8220;cruel&#8221; by <i>Drusius.</i> To be
&#8220;bitter&#8221; in mind means passively, to be grieved, or distressed, or
discontented,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;092202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 22:2; and actively, to be revengeful, cruel, or inhuman, Jude 18:25
&#8212; &#8220;Hasty&#8221; signifies to be rash, inconsiderate, or soon excited
and made angry. It is obvious that the order is reversed; what follows is
mentioned first, and then what precedes it; for to be hasty in entertaining
anger is first, and then follows cruelty in executing it. A similar order is
found in the next verse; the worst feature is mentioned first, that the nation
would be &#8220;terrible;&#8221; and then what is less, that it would be
&#8220;fearful.&#8221; This is what is often doen by the writers of both of the
Old and New Testament. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth8</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The word,

<i>Multiples</i>, various: but this is not the meaning of the verb
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h&ccedil;p</font><font face="Palatino">];
it signifies to range at large, or to spread far and wide. The whole verse may
be thus rendered, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The horsemen are represented as sweeping the whole

sanctioned by examples in Scripture. The rendering of the Septuagint is

shall ride forth, and of <i>Jerome</i>, <i>diffundentur</i>, shall spread
themselves. There is no occasion to borrow a meaning from Arabic, as
<i>Henderson </i>does, and to render it &#8220;spread proudly along.&#8221;
<i>Newcome</i> follows our common version. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth10</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
clause has been variously interpreted. The <i>Targum</i>, <i>Vulgate</i>, and
<i>Symmachus</i>, countenance the view given here. There is no help from the
Septuagint, as no sense is given. The word
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jmgm</font><font face="Palatino">],
only found here, is rendered by <i>Symmachus</i>,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">prosoyiv</font><font face="Palatino">,
sight, aspect. Targum explains it by a word which signifies &#8220;front.&#8221;
<i>Henderson</i> and <i>Lee </i>regard this as its meaning. Others, as
<i>Newcome</i> and <i>Drusius </i>render it, supping up, or absorption, and
derive it from
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">amg</font><font face="Palatino">],
to drink up, to absorb; and they regard the idea to be, that the very presence
of the Chaldeans would absorb every thing like a scorching wind. But &#8220;the
supping up of their faces <i>shall</i> <i>be as </i>the east wind,&#8221; which
is <i>Newcome&#8217;s </i>version, is an odd phrase. The last word has
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h</font><font face="Palatino">]
affixed to it, which is never the case when it means the east wind. It is by all
admitted, that &#8220;towards the east&#8221; is its proper construction. Hence
the most probable rendering of this passage is, &#8220;The aspect of their faces
shall be towards the east;&#8221; and with this corresponds what follows, that
they should &#8220;gather captives as the sand;&#8221; that is, that they might
carry them away to the place where they turned their faces.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The version of <i>Henderson</i>, which is essentially
that of <i>Symmachus</i>, is the following, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>The aspect of their
faces is like the east wind.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He owns the difficulty as to the last word, and views
it here as in an irregular form. <i>Dathius </i>gives this paraphrase,
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>It will have its
face direct towards the east.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that the word
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;wdq</font><font face="Palatino">],
by itself never means the pestilential wind from the east; but that when it
means this, it has another word attached to it. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth11</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
foregoing verse is one on which no satisfactory explanation has been given. The
one adopted here has been materially followed by <i>Vatablus, Druius, </i>and
<i>Dathius</i>, except as to the last clause. As to the first part of the verse
<i>Henderson </i>gives the best sense, for it corresponds with
&#8220;changing&#8221; to
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;lj</font><font face="Palatino">]
and &#8220;courage&#8221; to
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jwr</font><font face="Palatino">],
(see Joshua 2:11; 5:1;) and of &#8220;passing onward&#8221; to
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rb[</font><font face="Palatino">],
and not of &#8220;passing over,&#8221; <i>i.e.</i> bounds or moderation, which
it seems not to have, when used, as here, intransitively. The passing here is
evidently what is referred to in verse 6, as the renewing of courage would
arise, from the success mentioned in verse 10.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The best exposition of the last clause is what
<i>Grotius</i> has suggested, and has been followed by <i>Marckius</i> and
<i>Dathius</i> &#8212; that the Chaldeans made their own strength their God;
(see verse 16;) the rendering then would be this, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Then will it renew
courage, And pass
through,</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>and become
guilty; &#8212; This is strength being its
god,</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">or literally,
<b><i>This is strength for its god.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is an inconsistency in our version, and also in
<i>Calvin</i>, as to this passage, from verse 6 to the end of this verse. The
number is changed. The &#8220;bitter nation,&#8221; mentioned in verse 6, is
meant throughout; and we ought to adopt the plural number throughout, as
<i>Newcome </i>does, or, according to <i>Henderson</i>, the singular. There is
no change of person, as some suppose, at the beginning of verse 10; for
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">awh</font><font face="Palatino">],
there, and
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">awh</font><font face="Palatino">]
in verse 6 is the same &#8212; the &#8220;bitter nation.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth12</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Most
commentators agree with our version in connecting &#8220;from the
beginning,&#8221; or &#8220;from eternity,&#8221; with Jehovah, and not as
<i>Calvin </i>seems to do, with &#8220;God.&#8221; His view is evidently the
most consonant with the design of the passage, and countenanced by the
Septuagint, for Jehovah is rendered
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kurie</font><font face="Palatino">,
in the vocative case. To assert the eternity of God seems not to be necessary
here; but to say that he had been from old times the God of Israel is what is
suitable to the context. The Prophet in saying &#8220;my God,&#8221; identifies
himself with the people; for he says afterwards, &#8220;we shall not die.&#8221;
Viewed in this light the former part of the verse may be thus rendered,
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Art not thou from
of old, O Jehovah,</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>my
God! My holy one, we shall not die.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The reason for which he calls him &#8220;holy&#8221;
will appear from what the next verse contains. The Prophet seems to sustain
himself by two considerations &#8212; that Jehovah was the God of Israel, and
that he was a holy God. When he says &#8220;we shall not die,&#8221; he means,
no doubt, as <i>Marckius </i>observes, that the people as a nation would not be
destroyed, for he had prophesied of their subjugation and captivity by the
Chaldeans. What he had in view was the Church of God, respecting which promises
had been made. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth13</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It seems
that <i>Calvin</i> regarded &#8220;my holy one,&#8221; as equivalent to
&#8220;my sanctifier;&#8221; he who had separated the people from others to be
his own. The primary meaning of
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;dq</font><font face="Palatino">]
is no doubt to separate a thing from a common use to a sacred one; but whether
in this connection it has this meaning is not quite certain. &#8220;The holy one
of Israel&#8221; is a phrase several times used by Isaiah, see chapter 30:11;
43:3, etc. The sentence here may be rendered, &#8220;God of my holiness,&#8221;
or &#8220;My God, my holiness.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth14</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Many
agree in this view, <i>Drusius, Piscator, Marckius, Henderson, </i>etc. The
Septuagint affords no help. The rendering of <i>Symmachus </i>is
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">krataion</font><font face="Palatino">,
strong, and of <i>Aquila</i>,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">stereon</font><font face="Palatino">,
firm; then it would be, &#8220;and strong (or firm) for correction hast thou
established him.&#8221; <i>Grotius</i>, and also <i>Newcome</i>, adopt this
meaning.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>And thou hast
founded them on a rock to chasten </i></b>us<b><i>.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is, no doubt, the easiest and most natural
construction. See
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;260309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
3:9. God rendered the Chaldean nation firm, and strong, and resolute, to punish
the Jews. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth15</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Adjectives and participles in Hebrew commonly take a plural form, but not
always, as evidently in the present case; for the word for &#8220;pure,&#8221;
though singular, will admit of a better construction with &#8220;eyes&#8221;
than in any other way; and so <i>Grotius </i>renders the clause, &#8220;Purer
are thine eyes,&#8221; etc.; which is better than our version, followed by
<i>Newcome </i>and <i>Henderson</i>. The whole passage will thus read better:
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Purer </i></b>are
thine <b><i>eyes than to behold
evil,</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>And to look on
wickedness thou art not
able:</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Why
</i></b>then<b><i> lookest thou on the

makest man to be like the fish of the
sea,</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Like the reptile
which has no ruler?</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Evil&#8221; means here wrong, injustice; the
corresponding clause is &#8220;the wicked&#8221; swallowing up or oppressing his
better. The Jews were bad, but better than the Chaldeans.
&#8220;Wickedness,&#8221;
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lm[</font><font face="Palatino">],
is such a mischief as is done through treachery: hence in the next line, which,
according to the style of the Prophets, corresponds with this, &#8220;the
perfidious&#8221; are mentioned, improperly rendered &#8220;plunderers&#8221; by
<i>Henderson</i>, and &#8220;transgressors&#8221; by <i>Newcome</i>. The
Chaldeans had been the allies of the Jews.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With respect to the reptile or the crawling fish,
such as keep to the bottom of the waters, why is it said to be without a ruler?
Is it more insulated and less gregarious, so to speak, than other fish? If so,
&#8220;without a ruler&#8221; has an obvious meaning. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth16</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
construction of this verse can only be understood by a reference to the
preceeding verse; where two things are mentioned, the fish of the sea and the
reptile: as it is customary with the Prophets, the first clause was rasied up by
a hook, and the fish were enclosed in a net, or collected by a drag. The
reptile,
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;mr</font><font face="Palatino">],
is in the singular number, and used in a collective sense, and
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlk</font><font face="Palatino">],
every one, at the beginning of this verse, is in the same number. This entirely
removes the difficulty which critics have felt, and made them to propose
emendations. The verse then would read thus: &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Every one (i.e.
every reptile) by a hook he raises
up</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>He draws them out
(i.e. the fish) by his
net,</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>And collects
them by his drag;</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>He
therefore rejoices, and exults.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To &#8220;gather then <i>into</i> the net&#8221; can
hardly be sense; nor is &#8220;<i>in</i> the net&#8221; much better. The drawing
out and the collecting were evidently <i>by</i> the net and the drag; the
preposition,
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">],
has very commonly this meaning, as
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn</font><font face="Palatino">
in Greek.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The representation here is, that every means would be
employed: men being compared to fishes, some are set forth as creeping along the
bottom, and others as swimming at large at all depths; and then the fisherman,
the Chaldean comes, and draws out the first by a fishing-hook, and the rest by a
net and a ddrag; so that he takes them all. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth17</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

portion, And his meat well-fed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The comparison of the drag and net is continued; by

<i>Newcome</i>, and <i>Henderson</i>. But the verb means also to draw out,
<i>i.e.,</i> a sword,

14:14, and this is the meaning given to it by <i>Grotius, Junius,</i> and the
Septuagint. To draw forth, to extend, or to expand, seems most in accordance
with the drift of the passage. To empty his net, and that for the sake of
filling it again, which must be what is implied, is rather a farfetched notion.

evidently the place; the verb &#8220;stand&#8221; and the corresponding word

fortress, or citadel, in the next line, prove clearly that this is its meaning
here. The metaphor is taken from the practice of ascending a high tower, when
any messenger was expected with news. That any locality is meant here is
supported by nothing in the passage. The Prophet puts himself in an attitude of
waiting for an answer from God to the complaints which he had made: and the
metaphor of &#8220;tower and citadel&#8221; is most beautifully applied by
<i>Calvin</i>, and in a very instructive and striking manner. I give this
version &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>On my watch-tower

seems incongruous, though <i>Grotius </i>agrees with them. The version of the
former is as follows: &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>And what I should

<i>Calvin</i> thinks, or by God, as some others suppose. The view of <i>Piscator

to the people in chapter 1:2-12. He was waiting to know what he might have to
give as a reply in defense of that reproof. &#8220;And what I may reply as to my
reproof,&#8221; <i>i.e., </i>the reproof given by him. In this case, the
preceding clause, &#8220;What he may or will say to me,&#8221; refers to his
complaint respecting the Chaldeans. This is altogether consistent with the mode
in which the Prophets usually write: reversing the order, they take up first the
last subject, and then refer to the first. He then waited to know two things,
how to solve his difficulties respecting the conduct of the Chaldeans, and how
to reply to his own people for the severe rebuke he gave them. There is much in
this view to recommend it. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth25</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Most
authors agree in the main with <i>Calvin</i> in his exposition of this clause.
The whole verse is quoted by Paul in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581039&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
10:39, nearly <i>verbatim</i> from the Scriptures; only he inverts the clauses,
and leaves out the pronoun, &#8220;my,&#8221; connected with
&#8220;faith.&#8221; But this clause, as quoted by him, is materially different
from the Hebrew text, as it now exists, though the chief difference relates to
the word
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlp[</font><font face="Palatino">],
rendered elation, or pride, by <i>Calvin </i>and many others. Two MSS. give
another reading; one has
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hplw[</font><font face="Palatino">],
and the other,
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hpl[</font><font face="Palatino">],
which means to swoon, or to faint, or to fail.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This reading would essentially harmonize the passage,
and the context evidently favors it, as well as the antithesis in the verse
itself. As to the rest of the clause the <i>meaning </i>is same with the
Septuagint version, as cited by Paul, though the words are different; and there
are other examples in which the apostle did not alter that version, though
varying in words, when the sense was preserved. To say that man&#8217;s soul is
not right in him amounts to the same thing as to say that God is not pleased
with him. There is indeed one MS. which has
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">y&ccedil;pn</font><font face="Palatino">],
&#8220;my soul,&#8221; and not &#8220;his soul;&#8221; and then
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hr&ccedil;y</font><font face="Palatino">]
is often rendered
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajreskein</font><font face="Palatino">,
to please, by the Septuagint. See
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;042327&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
23:27;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;143004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 30:4. There would in this case be a complete identity of words as
well as of meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What especially countenances these readings is, that
the alteration would agree better with the preceding verse. There is an
exhortation to wait for the vision, <i>i.e., </i>its fulfillment. To refer to
pride in this connection seems not suitable; but to mention fainting or failing
through unbelief is quite appropriate; and then as a contrast to this state of
mind, the latter clause is added. Adopting the main alteration,
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hpl[</font><font face="Palatino">]
instead of
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlp[</font><font face="Palatino">],
(only a transposition of two letters,) I would render the verse thus
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Behold the
fainting! not right is his soul within
him;</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>But the
righteous, by his faith shall he live.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word for &#8220;fainting&#8221; is in the
feminine gender, either on account of the word &#8220;soul&#8221; in what
follows, or
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;ya</font><font face="Palatino">]
is understood, the &#8220;man of fainting,&#8221; instances of which are adduced
by <i>Henderson </i>on this verse, though he retains the word of the present
text; as [</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlpt
yna</font><font face="Palatino">], &#8220;I am prayer,&#8221; instead of
&#8220;I am a man of prayer.&#8221; &#8212; Psalms 109:4; see
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
1:31,32;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;270923&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
9:23.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now not only the antithesis is here complete, but the
<i>order</i> also in which it occurs coresponds with what is often the style of
the Prophets; the first part of the first clause corresponds with the last part
of the second, and the last of the former with the first of the latter; and not
according to Dr. <i>Henderson</i>, who represents the clauses as regularly
antithetic. See a similar instance in chapter 1:13, and also in the first verse
of this chapter. The man who faints, and he who lives by faith, form the
contrast; and the addition &#8220;by faith&#8221; in the latter clause implies
the fainting to be through want of faith, or through unbelief. Then the soul
that is not right stands in contrast with the righteous, or the just in the
second line. Thus every thing in the verse itself, and in its connection with
what precedes it, is in favor of what has been proposed. And <i>Grotius </i>and
<i>Newcome </i>seemed disposed to adopt this reading. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth26</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Though
the general meaning of the beginning of this verse is what most critics agree
in, yet the construction is difficult. The only difference as to the meaning is,
whether the proud man is said to be given to wine, or is compared to such an
one, or to wine itself. <i>Newcome</i> takes the first, and gives this version
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Moreover, as a
mighty man transgresseth through
wine,</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>He is proud,
and remaineth not at rest.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Henderson</i>, agreeing with <i>Grotius </i>and
<i>Mede</i>, takes the latter sense, and renders the line as follows:
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Moreoever wine is
treacherous;</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>The
haughty man stayeth not at home.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is rather a paraphrase than a version; but this
is the meaning of which the words are most capable. The two first participles
need not be connected according to what <i>Calvin </i>proposes. Then the distich
may be thus rendered &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>And truly, as wine
is treacherous,</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">So<b><i> is
the proud man, and he will not rest.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then follows a delineation of his character
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Because he enlarges

<div><font face="Palatino">As to wine being treacherous, see
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;203001&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
30:1. Wine is pleasant to the taste and inviting in its color, but degrading,
when taken immoderately, in its effects; so a proud and arrogant man is at first
glittering and plausible, and splendid in his appearance, but afterwards cruel
and oppressive. This seems to be the most obvious similitude, as contained in
the passage.</font><br></div>

It is a word evidently in appostion, designing the character of the proverb and

common explanation, and also the <i>Vulgate</i>, and most commentators. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth28</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is
rendered impersonally by <i>Jerome </i>&#8220;et dicetur &#8212; and it shall be
said.&#8221; <i>Junius </i>introduces a question, and supposed the just, who
lives by faith to be referred to &#8212; &#8220;And shall not he, <i>i.e.,
</i>the just, say?&#8221; But <i>Marckius </i>considers that God is the speaker
&#8212; &#8220;And he, <i>i.e., </i>God, shall say.&#8221; But the most obvious
construction is, that each one of the nations previously mentioned is introduced
as speaking &#8212; &#8220;Unusquisque illorum &#8212; every one of them,&#8221;
is understood, says <i>Piscator</i>. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth29</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This is
rendered by <i>Henderson</i>, &#8220;that have lent thee on usury;&#8221; but
incorrectly, as the corresponding clause is found in the following, and not, as
he ays, in the preceding line. The literal version is as follows,
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Shall not suddenly

<div><font face="Palatino">Now, the two corresponding words are
&#8220;biters&#8221; and &#8220;tormentors;&#8221; and the idea of lending on
usury cannot be admitted; and the common meaning of the word
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;&ccedil;n</font><font face="Palatino">],
is to bite, and means lending on usury only in Hiphil. What the Septuagint gives
is
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">daknontev</font><font face="Palatino">
&#8212; biters.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here is an instance of the peculiar manner of the
Prophets, and also of the writers of the New Testament; the most obvious act is
mentioned first &#8220;arise,&#8221; and then what is previous to it,
&#8220;awake.&#8221; There is also a similar difference in &#8220;biters&#8221;
and &#8220;tormentors,&#8221; or those who vex and harass: to torment or vex is
not so great an evil as to bite, as it were, like a serpent; for such is the
biting meant here. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth30</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> So
<i>Grotius</i>, <i>Drusius</i>, and <i>Henderson</i> regard the passage: the
land, and the city, are supposed to have been used poetically for lands and
cities. The word rendered &#8220;violence,&#8221;
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">smj</font><font face="Palatino">],
means an unjust or wrong act done by force, an outrage, a violent injustice:
hence <i>Grotius</i> rightly renders it here, &#8220;direptionem &#8212;
robbing, pillaging, or plundering.&#8221; While <i>Newcome </i>and others apply
the passage to Judea and Jerusalem, the Septuagint version would lead us to
suppose that Babylon was intended. The view taken here would be the most
probable, were it not that the words are repeated at the end of verse 17; and
there clearly they refer to the land of Judea and Jerusalem. &#8212;

wood-building. <i>Parkhurst </i>says, that it is a verb in Syriac, and means to
connect, to fasten together, and he renders it a beam or a rafter, which would
exactly suit this place. The word,
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#8776;[m</font><font face="Palatino">],
&#8220;from the wood,&#8221; evidently means the wood-building or wood-work. So

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The

puts the less evil first, and the greatest last; but Habakkuk&#8217;s usual
manner is the reverse, which has been before noticed, and we find an instance in

over, in Isaiah; and so spreading must be the idea included in the verb. The
comparison in Isaiah is between knowledge and waters, and the earth and the sea.
Hence the common version does not properly present the comparison. The verb

Jehovah.&#8221; By &#8220;the knowledge of Jehovah&#8221; is to be understood

<i>Grotius</i>, <i>Marckius</i>, and <i>Henderson</i>, take nearly the same view
of its meaning as <i>Calvin</i>, regarding it as metaphorical. But <i>Marckius
</i>thinks that the drunkenness which the king of Babylon produced, means the
evils which he inflicted on other nations. To make a nation drunk was to subdue
and oppress it. See

25:15,16, 27,28; 51:7,39,57. This view is confirmed by the following verse,
where the king of Babylon is threatened with a similar judgment; he was also to
drink of the cup of Jehovah&#8217;s right hand. As he made other nations drunk,
so the Lord threatens him with a like visitation.</font><br></div>

wrath, or heat, or gall, or poison, as some have done, is to introduce an idea

mentioning bottle, abundance of wine was probably intended, and to this
abundance was added the strong drink,

noun for

But as drunkenness is the metaphor used, &#8220;shameful spewing,&#8221; or the

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth40</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is
commonly agreed, that Libanus here means either the temple or the land of Judah;

means the violence <i>done </i>to it, as <i>Newcome </i>and others render the
clause. The next line is more difficult: if the verb be retained as it is, we
must either adopt what <i>Calvin</i> has proposed, and after him <i>Drusius</i>,
or take the

at the beginning as a particle of comparison, according to what is done by
<i>Henderson</i>, &#8220;As the destruction of beasts terrifieth them.&#8221;
But to preserve the parallelism of the two lines, it would be better to adopt
the correction of all the early versions, <i>Sept. Arab. Syr. </i>and also of
the <i>Chald.</i> <i>par.;</i> which substitute

<div><font face="Palatino">The reason men are called &#8220;beasts&#8221; is
because Libanus is mentioned which was inhabited by beasts; and in the two

men;&#8221; and &#8220;the violence to Libanus&#8221; is &#8220;violence to the

&#8220;It teach!&#8221; <i>Grotius</i> agrees with <i>Calvin</i>, &#8220;It will

in this way, than by &#8220;of;&#8221; for the meaning is, not that it was his

composed in metre, is evident from the word, &#8220;Selah,&#8221; and from the
conclusion of the chapter. The most probable meaning of the word is what
<i>Drusius</i> has suggested, and adopted by <i>Grotius</i>, <i>Marckius</i>,
and <i>Henderson,</i> and that is, that it refers to a peculiar metre, a kind of
composition, which from its irregularity is called <i>erratica cantio</i>, an
erratic verse. &#8220;The prayer of Habakkuk,&#8221; says <i>Drusius</i>,
&#8220;was to be sung according to the odes which they called
<i>Sigionoth</i>.&#8221; To the same purpose is what <i>Grotius</i> says, that
is, it is &#8220;a song according to the notes of an ancient ode which began
with this word.&#8221; It is derived from
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hg&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">],
to go astray, to wander, that is, in this instance, from the regular metre of an
ode. It is an erratic ode, that is, one containing varieties. It may be thus

wide of the original, that none can account for the differences. There are no
various readings of any moment; and the literal rendering of this verse, and of
the former part of the following, I consider to be this,

&#8220;The report from thee,&#8221; would convey the sense. The third line is a
prayer; and so are the following lines, though all the verbs are in the future
tense, while that for &#8220;revive&#8221; is in the imperative mood. The third
verse ought to end with the word &#8220;Selah.&#8221; What follows in the other
part and in the subsequent verses, is a relation of what took place when God had
formerly interfered in behalf of Israel; while here, and in the latter part of
the preceding verse, the Prophet expresses a prayer to God in reference to his
people, and borrows his language from the past interpositions of God. &#8212;

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth52</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The two
first lines present a difficulty in their construction. The most literal is this
rendering of <i>Junius</i> &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Did against rivers
kindle, O Jehovah &#8212;
</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Against rivers, thy

<div><font face="Palatino">Our language will admit of a similar construction in
another form, by inverting the order &#8212;</font><br></div>

Jehovah,</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Did it
kindle against rivers?</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some connect the two last lines of the verse with the
previous one, thus &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Was thine

<b><i>thy chariots of salvation?</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But <i>Calvin</i> considers them rather as an answer
to the previous questions, or as explanatory; and they may be thus rendered
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>When thou didst
ride on thy
horses,</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Thy chariots
were </i></b>those<b><i> of salvation.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is observed by <i>Henderson</i>, that &#8220;there
is no necessity for our understanding either the angels or thunder and lightning
by &#8216;horses&#8217; and &#8216;chariots.&#8217; They are,&#8221; he adds,
&#8220;merely figurative expressions, designed to carry out the metaphor adopted
from military operations.&#8221; Or it may be, that the horses and chariots of
the Israelites are here meant, as in the 11th verse, the arrows and spears of
the people are spoken of as those of God. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth53</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
clause has been variously explained: the interpretation here given has been
mostly adopted. In the Barberinean manuscript the whole of this prayer is given
in many respects different from the present received text of the Septuagint, and
this clause is thus found in it &#8212;
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejcortasav bolidav thv faretrav
ajutou</font><font face="Palatino">. It is evident that this idea falls in more
with the preceding clause than any other; and the Hebrew will admit of a sense
bordering on this with less alteration than any other that has been offered. No
version has been given without supposing somethin to be understood.
<i>Newcome</i> says, that sixteen MSS. read
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">t[wb&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">];
by leaving out the
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">],
it may be a verb in Kal in the past tense, as rendered above, and writers might
have easily put down
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rma</font><font face="Palatino">]

[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwza</font><font face="Palatino">].
Then the line in Hebrew would be,</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>&#8220;Thou hast

<div><font face="Palatino">It is a description of one equipped for battle; his
bow was made ready, and he had filled his girdle, that is, his military guide,
with arrows; for this girdle the preceding Greek version introduced the quiver,
in which arrows were commonly carried. the word
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twfm</font><font face="Palatino">],
means rods or staves, that is, of arrows, as we may take it here. This is the
most satisfactory solution of the difficulties connected with this line, of
which there have been, as <i>Henderson</i> says, more than a hundred
interpretation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The last clause of the verse is thus rendered by<i>
Newcome</i>, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Thou didst cleave

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Thou didst cleave
the earth into rivers.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The words will not admit the first version; the
genitive case in Hebrew is always by juxtaposition; here &#8220;streams&#8221;
and &#8220;earth&#8221; are separated by the verb. The other version contains
hardly a meaning. The most literal rendering is that given by <i>Calvin</i>, and
it afford the best sense. The words will admit of the following, which is
materially the same, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>By streams didst
thou cleavest the earth.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The allusion evidently to the streams of that water
which miraculously issued from the smitten rock, and followed the Israelites in
the wilderness. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth54</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Most
critics have overlooked the peculiar construction of this verse; but it presents
a striking instant of the order in which the Prophets often arrange their ideas.
There are two things referred to &#8212; the mountains and the waters &#8212;
and the first verb regards both; the nominative case being anticipated, and the
first of the two last lines refers to the waters, and the last to the mountains.
This is the literal version, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>They saw thee,
&#8212; in pain were the

of the Hebrew language; and it evidently here refers to the
&#8220;mountains,&#8221; as the &#8220;deep&#8221; refers to the water. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth55</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There is
much beauty and force in this explanation: and accordant with it is the version
of <i>Henderson</i>. But that of <i>Newcome</i> is somewhat different

<div><font face="Palatino">To avoid the insertion of so many words in italics

&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>The sun! the moon!

being singular; and it is followed, as I conceive, by another verb in the
singular number, and in the feminine gender, while &#8220;stood&#8221; is in the
masculine, and refers to the moon, and the last refers to the sun; which is
sometimes feminine, while moon is ever the masculine. The verb
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lbz</font><font face="Palatino">]
is not properly to dwell, but to continue fixed, or to remain stationary. The
order in our language would be this &#8212;</font><br></div>

it is often done by the Prophets, in the collective sense. The particle
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ta</font><font face="Palatino">]
before it is not often used as a preposition; and the word
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[&ccedil;y</font><font face="Palatino">]
may better be taken here as a verb, according to the <i>Septuagint</i>, than as
a noun, though as a verb it most commonly occurs in <i>Hiphil</i>: but see

<div><font face="Palatino">The reference in the two lines is evidently to the
rooting out of the Canaanites, and not, as <i>Newcome</i> thinks, to the
destruction of the firstborn in Egypt. The singular is poetically used for the
plural: &#8220;head,&#8221; instead of heads, or chiefs, etc. The last line
seems to be a proverbial saying, signifying an entire demolition, the very
foundation being dug up, though so deep as to reach up to man&#8217;s neck.

singular is used throughout instead of the plural, until we come to the two
following lines; and this proves that the singular is to be taken in a
collective sense. <i>Henderson</i> renders it &#8220;captains,&#8221; contrary
to the meaning of the word in other parts. It means an open unfortified village,
as it were scattered, and without any boundaries. <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fth58</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

practice of wild beasts, who take there prey to their dens to devour it there.
The poor her, as in many other places, mean the helpless, such as are destitute
of aid or power to resist their enemies. The line may be thus rendered
&#8212;</font><br></div>

which agrees with &#8220;horses.&#8221; It is singular in Hebrew, and, if a

<div><font face="Palatino">Both <i>Marckius </i>and <i>Henderson</i> think that
the passage through the Red Sea is not what is meant; but the subjugation of the

&#8220;Who shall rest,&#8221; etc.; <i>Henderson</i>, &#8220;yet,&#8221;
&#8220;Yet I shall have rest,&#8221; etc. But it is never found as an
adversative. The construction of this line and the following is very difficult;
and many have been the forms in which they have been rendered. The verb
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jwn</font><font face="Palatino">]
means not only to <i>rest</i> from action or labor, but also to <i>rest </i>in
the sense of remaining or continuing. See

Kings 2:15, and
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
2:2. And were it taken in this latter sense here, there would be a consistency
in the whole passage. The Prophet describes first the dread which seized him on
hearing the report of God&#8217;s vengeance; and then in the two last lines he
accounts for his consternation, because he should remain to witness this
vengeance; and he proceeds in verse 17 to set forth the effects of it, and in
verse 18 he states that he would still rejoice in the God of his salvation. The
three verses may be thus rendered, &#8212;</font><br></div>

and <i>Henderson</i>, &#8220;consecrated,&#8221; as <i>Calvin</i> does.
&#8220;Segregavit &#8212; set apart,&#8221; is the version of <i>Drusius</i>,

<i>Marckius</i>, following the <i>Septuagint</i>, and some of the fathers,

intruders into the temple are here meant, and such as brought there as
sacrifices and gifts the fruits of plunder and fraud. But the passage cannot
possibly bear this meaning according to the Hebrew text: nor is such a meaning
consistent with the context. The view given here is that of <i>Kimki</i>,

Chronicles 34:22; where it ought to be &#8220;in the second city.&#8221; But the
passage in Nehemiah is not decisive on the subject; and our version is
countenanced by the former part of the verse, where &#8220;Joel&#8221; is said
to be the &#8220;overseer,&#8221; and &#8220;Judah&#8221; is mentioned as being
next to him, the second in office: and it is so rendered in the <i>Septuagint.
</i>As to the other text, the word is by itself as here. What <i>Calvin</i>,

solution.</font><br></div>

As &#8220;crying&#8221; and &#8220;howling&#8221; are said to proceed from the
other parts, so something similar must have proceeded from &#8220;the

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;193418&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftk11</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
original meaning of the word is much more probable than what lexicographers

surrounded by hills. The &#8220;hills&#8221; were those on which a part of the

of fixedness here; as wines on the lees, to which allusion is made, do not
become congealed, the comparison seems to be, that as wine kept still on the
lees increases in strength and flavor so the Jews, settling on their dregs
&#8212; their sins &#8212; became strengthened and confirmed in their wickedness
and atheistic notions. But <i>Newcome</i> and <i>Henderson </i>take another view

In no instance is it found in a passive sense as to the feeling through which
the paleness is occasioned, and therefore &#8220;worthy of love,&#8221; or

meaning in Niphal &#8212; &#8220;desiderio affici &#8212; to be touched with or
to feel a desire.&#8221; Hence the person spoken of is the subject, not the
object, of the desire. According, then, to the use of the verb, the rendering
here is to be &#8212; &#8220;Ye nation that feels no desire,&#8221; that is, for
God and his law, or, &#8220;that feels no shame,&#8221; that is, for its sins.

stated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Marckius</i> considers that the nation is here

that they might devour it there in the morning. This is the view taken by

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftk45</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
verse is considered by <i>Newcome</i> and <i>Henderson</i> to be addressed to
the godly, to encourage them at the approaching calamities, while
<i>Piscator</i>, <i>Grotius</i>, <i>Marckius</i>, and <i>Dathius</i>, agree with
<i>Calvin</i> that it is an awful warning to the wicked Jews, spoken of in the
preceding verse. Differing somewhat from <i>Calvin</i>, they regard the
&#8220;nations&#8221; and &#8220;kingdoms&#8221; to be the Babylonians, who were
composed of various nations and kingdoms, and &#8220;upon them&#8221; to be the
Jews, and &#8220;the whole land&#8221; to be that of Judea. This view, no doubt,
is the most consistent with the context. The objection made by <i>Henderson</i>,
that the words <i>expect</i>, or <i>wait for me</i>, are ever used in a good
sense, seems to have no force, for these words by themselves can mean neither
what is good nor what is bad, the whole depends on the context. The verb
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hkj</font><font face="Palatino">]
simply means to tarry, to wait &#8212;
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">menein</font><font face="Palatino">.
The word &#8220;therefore&#8221; seems to connect this with the preceding verse,
and there is nothing in the foregoing part of the chapter that alludes to the
godly. Besides, the words which follow &#8220;wait for me&#8221; explain them,

verse contains four lines: there is an evident correspondence of meaning in the
second and the last line; and so there is between the first and the third
according to the preceding version, but not otherwise. The word rendered
&#8220;acclamation&#8221; is a noun from the verb

you,&#8221; or, &#8220;you yourselves?&#8221; The Welsh often use two pronouns
in this way, for the sake of emphasis. The rendering is very flat, as in our
version, and adopted by <i>Henderson</i>, &#8220;Is it time for you, O
ye?&#8221; etc. <i>Houbigant, </i>who always amends, proposes
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hta</font><font face="Palatino">],
to come, &#8220;Is the time come for you?&#8221; etc. This is suitable, but
without authority. <i>Dathius</i> suggests the place, but it is no more than a
conjecture. There is no doubt an emphasis is intended by the repetition. &#8212;

teaching, drinking, clothing, etc. &#8212;

a verb in the perfect tense, it must be rendered &#8220;for,&#8221; or,
&#8220;as;&#8221; and the clause seems to be a parenthesis. The
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">],
<i>vau</i>, is not conversive when preceded by a verb in the imperative mood, as
it appears from the end of the verse. The mount was not Libanus, as many have
supposed, but Sion, where wood had been previously brought, but was not used.

The first word in this verse,
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnp</font><font face="Palatino">],
is evidently a participle noun; similar instances we find in verse 6. The verse,
literally rendered, is as follows
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino">Looking for much, and behold
little!</font><br><font face="Palatino">And you brought <i>it </i>home, and I

an absolute form, as is sometimes the case in Hebrew; &#8220;There has
been,&#8221; or some such words being understood. Both the Targum and the
Septuagint read
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hyh</font><font face="Palatino">]
instead of
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnh</font><font face="Palatino">],

before it. The line would then be
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino"><i>There has been </i>looking for much,
but it came to little.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The &#8220;blowing&#8221;
seems to be a metaphor taken from scorching wind, blowing on vegetation, and
causing it to wither. The last line may be thus rendered
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino">And ye <i>are </i>delighted, each with
his own house. &#8212;

&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino">Therefore, on your account, withheld

withheld its produce.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The verb

to restrain, to keep back, to withhold, is used here twice, and in the first
line in an intransitive sense, and in the second in a transitive sense, as it is
often the case in other languages, when the same verb is both neuter and
active.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The 11th verse is passed by without any
particular remarks. The word
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">brj</font><font face="Palatino">]
is rendered &#8220;Siccitas &#8212; drought,&#8221; as <i>Jerome</i> does, and
also our version, as well as <i>Newcome</i> and <i>Henderson</i>; but
<i>Grotius</i> and also <i>Marckius</i> very justly observe, that it means here
&#8220;waste,&#8221; or &#8220;desolation,&#8221; it being the same word as is
applied to God&#8217;s house in verse 9. They left his house a waste; by a just
retribution he had brought or called for a waste on the land, etc. The contrast
is so evident that it cannot be denied. The ideal meanings of the word is to be
waste or desolate: it is then applied to various things which produce
desolation, the sword, drought, pestilence, etc.; but it is used here in its
primary sense, and the contrast is very striking: &#8220;My house has been left
waste; I have caused a waste to come upon every thing else.&#8221; The verse may
be thus rendered &#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino">And I have called for a
waste</font><br><font face="Palatino">On the land and on the
mountains,</font><br><font face="Palatino">And on the corn and on the wine and

This clause may be thus rendered, &#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino">And
fear him did the people on account of
Jehovah.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This comports better with the previous
clause, that Jehovah had sent him. The
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">]
affixed to &#8220;fear&#8221; is a pronoun, otherwise the verb is plural; and
&#8220;people&#8221; seldom, if ever, has a verb in the plural number. To fear
sometimes means to respect, to reverence: the people honored him as God&#8217;s
servant, by obeying his message. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br><sup><font color="Maroon">ftl18</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The verse literally is &#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino">Then said Haggai,
the messenger of Jehovah in the message
of</font><br><font face="Palatino">Jehovah to the people,
saying,</font><br><font face="Palatino">I am with you, saith
Jehovah.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The word for &#8220;messages&#8221; is
in the plural number, preceded by the preposition
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">].
Why commentators have generally rendered it in the singular number, does not
appear. Haggai is expressly said to be God&#8217;s messenger in, or with regard
to, the messages or communications he made to the people. To connect the word,
as some do, with &#8220;said,&#8221; hardly gives a meaning, except the clause
be rendered, as it is done by <i>Newcome</i>, &#8220;by the message of
Jehovah,&#8221; that is, by his command; but then a plural word is made
singular. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br><sup><font color="Maroon">ftl19</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It is sometimes the case, that a doctrine is illegitimately drawn from a
passage, and then that it is unfairly opposed. The building of the Temple had
nothing to do with the first movement of the spiritual life: and therefore to
draw an argument from the willingness of the people to undertake that work in
favor of free-will in the great business of salvation, is by no means
legitimate. It would have been, then, better to deny the application, than to
turn the passage from its regular course. But we shall not do violence to the
passage, if we render the
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">]
at the beginning of this verse, &#8220;Thus,&#8221; and refer &#8220;the stiring
up&#8221; to the threatening and the promise previously announced. The object
seems not to have been to set forth the direct influence of the Spirit on the
minds of the people, but to show the effect produced on them by the message
conveyed to them from the Lord by the Prophet. God stirs up the minds of men
both by his word and by his Spirit, both outwardly and inwardly. The former may
more properly be meant here. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftl20</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The reasons assigned here for a different division is by no means satisfactory.
The fact is that this verse necessarily belongs to the last of the previous
chapter, as it specifies the time when the people began the work as there
mentioned; and what follows this verse is another message, and at another time.
The usual division is no doubt the
best.</font><br><sup><font color="Maroon">ftl21</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This is the most approved manner. There is no instance in which it means
&#8220;according.&#8221; It may be rendered &#8212; &#8220;This <i>is </i>the
word,&#8221; etc. There were two things which were intended to dispel their fear
&#8212; the covenant made with the fathers, and the Spirit of God &#8212; the
spirit of prophecy, &#8220;standing,&#8221; or existing among them. The Chaldee
Paraphrase is &#8212; &#8220;My Prophets are teaching among you.&#8221; The
verse may be thus translated &#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino">This <i>is
</i>the word which I covenanted with you</font><br><font face="Palatino">At your
comming forth from Egypt,</font><br><font face="Palatino">And my Spirit <i>is

&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino">With the word (<i>i.e.</i>, having the
word) which I covenanted with you</font><br><font face="Palatino">When ye came
forth from Egypt,</font><br><font face="Palatino">And with my Spirit standing

&#8220;the word,&#8221; and &#8220;my Spirit,&#8221; to be nominatives to the
particle &#8220;standing,&#8221; or rather to the auxiliary verb which is to be
understood before it, an dthat &#8220;standing&#8221; is in the singular number,
on account of the nearer nominative &#8220;my Spirit.&#8221; <i>Newcome</i>
follows our version, and views

<i>Ed.</i></font><br><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftl22</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Our common version is no doubt the best, and is materially followed by
<i>Newcome</i>, <i>Henderson</i>, and many others. Retaining the tense of the
passage, I would render the clause thus,</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet
once, shortly <i>will </i>it <i>be,</i></font><br><font face="Palatino">And I
will shake, etc.</font><br><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Shortly <i>will </i>it
<i>be</i>,&#8221; [</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ayh

parenthesis.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet once <i>more</i>, <i>in </i>a
short time &#8212; <i>Newcome.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet once,
within a little, &#8212; <i>Henderson.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino">The
shaking of the heavens, earth, sea, and dry land is explained, according to the
common manner of the Prophets, in the next verse, by shaking of all nations: the
material world is named in the first instance, while its inhabitants are
intended. So<i> Henderson</i> very properly renders the
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">m</font><font face="Palatino">]
at the beginning of the seventh verse, &#8220;Yea.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftl23</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Many have been the criticisms on this clause, both as to its grammatical
construction and as to the import of the word rendered &#8220;desire.&#8221; The
verb &#8220;come&#8221; is plural, and the word for &#8220;desire&#8221; is
singular. The easiest solution, and countenanced by the Septuagint, where the
word is rendered </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ta&lt;
ejklekta&lt;</font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; &#8220;choice things,&#8221;
is to consider
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tdmj</font><font face="Palatino">]
as a plural, the
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">]
being omitted. This would remove th egrammatical anomaly, and the sentiment, as
<i>Calvin</i> says, woud be more consonant with the
context.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And come shall the choice things of all
nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There is no ground for the objection
which <i>Bishop Chandler </i>states, that to &#8220;come&#8221; is in this case

In favor of &#8220;your&#8221; instead of &#8220;their&#8221; in verse 16, there
are three MSS.; and it is more consistent with the context. The expression
literally is, &#8220;From your being to come,&#8221; <i>i.e</i> from the time in
which you came, and found out the deficiency. &#8220;Fifty measures;&#8221;

the vat; what quantity it contained is not known. It is here in the singular
number, while the numeral, &#8220;fifty,&#8221; is in the plural;

forty.&#8221; In verse 17, &#8220;even all the work of your hands,&#8221; is in
apposition with &#8220;you,&#8221; and explanatory of it, according to what we
often find in the Prophets; for by &#8220;you&#8221; was meant their

What is said in a Note in p. 347 does not apply to what <i>Calvin</i> says. He
refers not, as I inadvertently apprehended, to the present division of the
chapter, but to that adopted in the Septuagint; for this verse in that version
forms the beginning of the next chapter. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</font><br></div>
