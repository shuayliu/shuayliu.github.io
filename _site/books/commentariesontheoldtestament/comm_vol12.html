PREFACE.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In bringing to a close his labors on Calvin's
Commentary On The Psalms, the Editor begs leave to state, that in addition to
the General Index, and the Indices Of Texts Of Scripture, and of Hebrew Words,
originally contemplated, it has been deemed highly desirable to give at the end
of the Commentary a Translation; or Calvin's Version Of The, Psalms arranged in
parallelisms, together with a Table Of Those Passages In The Psalms Which Are
Quoted In The New Testament, and a Table Of The Particular Subjects Of Each
Psalm, according to Calvin's interpretation. These additions, it is hoped, will
be considered as improvements. From the extent to which they have increased the
size of this Volume, it has been found necessary to omit the Appendix of
Additional Criticisms to which reference is made in some of the footnotes
throughout the work.</font><br><font face="Palatino">To exhibit the Psalms
arranged in the metrical order, was an idea which appears never to have
suggested itself to the mind of Calvin. In his time, indeed, and long after it,
the peculiar character of Hebrew Poetry was not understood. It was not till a
recent period that any steady light was; thrown on the laws of its composition.
A vast amount of learning had indeed been expended on the subject, and a variety
of hypotheses had been suggested by successive writers to unravel a question so
intricate and mysterious; but no satisfactory result was attained until it was
investigated by the learned Bishop Lowth, to whose genius and erudition we are
indebted for the discovery of this long lost secret. He has proved, with a
clearness and force of evidence which has now commanded universal assent, that
Hebrew Poetry bears no resemblance in its structure to the Poetry of Greece and
Rome, that it has no rhyming termination of lines as in the Poetry of our own
language, and that its peculiar, and perhaps its sole characteristic, lies in a
felicitous arrangement of words into what he denominates Parallelism. In other
words, its leading peculiarity is that. each sentence consists generally of two
parts, closely corresponding to each other, not indeed in the number of
syllables, but in the ideas which they express, or in their grammatical
constructive form, the second being synonymous (or, as Bishop Jebb would
denominate it, cognate) with the first, &#8212; or antipathetic to it in its
terms and sentiments, &#8212; or similar to it in the form of grammatical
construction, such as noun answering to noun, verb to verb, member to member,
negative to negative, interrogative to
interrogative.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe1</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The division of these sacred poems into
hemistichs or lines is, therefore, the form in which they ought naturally to be
arranged; and such an arrangement is attended with great advantages. It exhibits
to the eve the peculiar structure of Hebrew poetical composition, and is,
besides, an important aid in Scriptural Interpretation, as it often contributes
to the elucidation of obscure and difficult passages, and enables even the mere
English reader to discover a thousand beauties, which, without such a help,
would escape his notice.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In translating this
parallel version, two of Calvin's translations of the Hebrew text were at the
service of the Editor, &#8212; the Latin and the French. The former is strictly
literal, rarely changing the Hebrew idiom, or even inserting a supplementary
term, and uniformly giving the arrangement of the words as they stand in the
inspired original. The latter is also upon the whole literal, though in some
instances it changes the Hebrew idiom into the French, as well as frequently
inserts such supplementary terms as the sense seems to require; and disregarding
the arrangement of the words in the original, it gives them in the order most
suitable to the genius of the French tongue. The Editor has followed Calvin's
Latin; Version, and has rendered it literally, retaining the Hebrew modes of
expression, and the arrangement of the words in the sequence of the Hebrew text,
except in a very few instances where a deviation seemed necessary to render the
reading intelligible. Occasionally he has found it necessary to insert some
supplementary words. These, when taken from Calvin's French Version, as is
generally the case, are printed simply in <i>italics, </i>and when supplied by
the Editor are printed in <i>italics </i>and enclosed within brackets. By
adhering to the Hebrew order of the words, the arrangements may sometimes appear
harsh and uncouth; but very often they give much beauty and force to the
expression. And in retaining the Hebrew idioms, the Editor has felt little
scruple, considering that as our English Bible is a literal verbal translation
of the Original Hebrew, many of these are quite familiar to us, and from their
peculiar grace have even become naturalized in our
language.</font><br><font face="Palatino">"The<i> </i>Hebrew idioms," says
Addison, "run into the English with a peculiar grace and beauty. Our language
has received innumerable elegance's and improvements from that infusion of
Hebraisms which are derived to it out of the poetical passages in Holy Writ.
They give a force and energy to our expressions, warm and animate our language,
and convey our thoughts in more ardent and intense phrases than any that are to
be met with in our own tongue. There is something so pathetic in this kind of
diction, that it often sets the mind in a flame, and makes our heart burn within
Us."</font><br><font face="Palatino">The utility of the two Tables adverted to
is too obvious to require to be dwelt upon. From the former the reader will
perceive how completely the inspiration of the Psalms is established by New
Testament authority, and how highly they were appreciated by Christ And His
Apostles, there being no portion of Old Testament Scripture from which they so
frequently quoted. The other Table will readily serve as a guide to the
selection of such Psalms as may be adapted to the doctrines of the Christian
system, the duties of the Christian life, or the varied circumstances, whether
prosperous or adverse, in which the Christian or the Church of God may be
placed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b><i>J.A.</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b><i>EDINBURGH,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have done judgment and
righteousness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Prophet implores the
help of God against the wicked who troubled him, and he does so in such a manner
as at the same time to testify that the harassing treatment he received from
them was on his part altogether undeserved. If we would have God to come down to
succor us, it becomes us to see to it that we meet him with the testimony of a
good conscience. As He everywhere promises his aid to the afflicted who are
unrighteously oppressed, it is no superfluous protestation which the Prophet
makes, that he had not provoked his enemies, but had restrained himself from all
injury and wrong-doing, and had not even attempted to requite evil for evil. In
asserting that he had at all times
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>done
judgment,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he means that whatever rite
wicked practiced, he steadfastly persevered in following after integrity, and
never turned aside from what was just and right in any of his public or private
transactions.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>122.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Become surety for thy servant for
good.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This prayer is almost similar to
that of the preceding verse; for I prefer translating the Hebrew verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bwr[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>arob, </i>by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Become surety

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Delight thy servant in

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Make thy servant to delight in
good</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>According to this second version,
the words are a prayer that God would rejoice his servant with his benefits.
There is a third translation, by which they become a prayer that God would
inspire his heart with the love and desire of rectitude; for true perfection
consists in our taking pleasure in justice and uprightness. But as from the last
clause of the verse it is obvious that David here desires succor against his
enemies, the verb </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Become
surety</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is the more appropriate
rendering</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Lord, as if he had said, since the proud
cruelly rush upon me to destroy me, interpose. thyself between us, as if thou
weft my surety. The letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lamed, </i>which signifies <i>for, </i>is not indeed prefixed to the noun,
but this is no valid objection to our translation, as that letter is often
understood. It is a form of expression full of comfort, to represent God as
performing the office of a surety in order to effect our deliverance. He is said
metaphorically to become surety for us, just as if, on finding us indebted in a
large sum of money, he discharged us of the obligation, by paying down the money
to our creditor. The prayer is to this effect, That God would not suffer the
wicked to exercise, their cruelty against us at their pleasure, but that he
would interpose as a defender to save us. By these words the Prophet intimates,
that he was in extreme danger, and that he had nothing else left him in which to
hope but the help of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>123.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My eyes have failed for thy
salvation.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe6</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In the first; place he testifies,
that he had been afflicted with severe troubles, and that not for a short time
only, but for a period so protracted as might have exhausted his patience and
occasioned despondency. But so far was this from being the effect they produced,
that he declares that in all these long and wearisome conflicts his heart had
never sunk into despair. We have before explained
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>failing for
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as denoting that although
there was no prospect of an end to his calamities, and although despair
presented itself on every side, yet he strove against temptation even to the
fainting of his soul. Should we understand the past tense of the verb as put for
the present, in which sense it seems to be employed, the Prophet in that case
intimates, that his eyes fail him not because they become fatigued, but Because
through earnest looking they contract as it were a dimness, and that yet he does
not cease to wait continually for the salvation of God. In short, the failing of
his eyes indicates perseverance combined with severe and arduous effort, and it
is opposed to the momentary ardor of those who immediately faint, if God does
not grant their requests. This expression also denotes a painful earnestness,
which almost consumes all the senses. As to the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he does not limit it to one kind of help, but comprehends under it the
continual course of God's grace, until he put his believing people in the
possession of <i>complete </i>salvation. He expresses the manner in which he
waited for salvation, which was by depending upon God's word in which two things
are to be attended to, first, that we can only be said to wait for salvation
from God, when, confiding in his promises, we actually betake ourselves to him
for protection; and secondly, that we then only yield to God the praise of
salvation, when we continue to keep our hope firmly fixed on his word. This is
the way in which He is to be sought; and although he may conceal from our view
the working of his hand, we ought to repose in his bare promises. This is the
reason why David calls God's word <i>righteous. </i>He would hereby confirm his
faith in the truth of the divine promises for God in promising liberally does
not cherish in his people delusive
expectations.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>124.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Deal with thy servant according
to thy goodness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The two clauses of this
verse must be read correctly; for he does not first separately desire God to
deal well with him, and next desire him to be his master and teacher. He rather
beseeches him in the exercise of that goodness and mercy, which he is wont to
display towards all his people, to instruct him in his law. The object of the
Prophet's request then is, that God would teach him in his statutes. But he
begins with the divine mercy, employing it as an argument to prevail with God to
grant him what he desires. This prayer then must be resolved thus: Lord, deal
gently with me, and manifest thy goodness towards me by instructing me in thy
commandments. Our whole happiness undoubtedly consists in our having that true
wisdom which is to be derived from the word of God; and our only hope of
obtaining this wisdom lies in God's being pleased to display his mercy and
goodness towards us. The Prophet, therefore, magnifies the greatness and
excellence of the benefit of being instructed in the divine law, when he
requests that it may be bestowed upon him as a free
gift.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>125.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
I am thy servant, give me understanding.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Here the prayer of the preceding verse is repeated. The repetition shows how
ardently he wished the blessing prayed for, and how earnest and importunate he
was in pleading with God for it. By the words he expresses still more plainly in
what way it is that God teaches his own people &#8212; that he does so by
illuminating with sound knowledge their understandings, which otherwise would be
blind. It would profit us little to have the divine law sounding in our ears, or
to have it exhibited in writing before our eyes, and to have it expounded by the
voice of man, did not God correct our slowness of apprehension, and render us
docile by the secret influence of his Spirit. We are not to suppose that David
advances any meritorious claims before God when he boasts of being his servant.
Men, indeed, commonly imagine that when we are previously well prepared, God
then adds new grace, which they term <i>subsequent grace. </i>But the Prophet,
so far from boasting of his own worth, rather declares how deep the obligations
were under which he lay to God. It is not in the power of any man to make
himself a servant of the Most High, nor can any man bring anything of his own as
a price with which to purchase so great an honor. Of this the Prophet was well
aware. He knew that there is not one of the whole human family who is worthy of
being enrolled among that order; and therefore he does nothing more than adduce
the grace he had obtained, as an argument that God according to his usual way
would perfect what he had begun. In a similar manner he speaks in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
116:6,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"I am thy servant and the
son of thine handmaid:"</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">in which place it is abundantly manifest that he does
not boast of his services, but only declares that he is one of the members of
the Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>126.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is time for thee, O Jehovah!
to be doing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It being the object of the
Prophet to imprecate upon the impious and wicked the vengeance which they have
deserved, he says, that the fit time for executing it had now arrived, inasmuch
as they had carried to a great extent their wanton forwardness against God. The
general verb
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>doing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is more emphatic than if one more specific had been used. The language is as
if he had said, that God would seem to delay too long, if he did not now execute
the office of a judge. It is the peculiar work of God to restrain the wicked,
and even to punish them severely when he finds that their repentance is utterly
hopeless. If it is alleged, that this prayer is inconsistent with the law of
charity, it may be replied, that David here speaks of reprobates, whose
amendment is become desperate. His heart, there is no doubt, was governed by the
spirit of wisdom. Besides, it is to be remembered, that he does not complain of
his own private wrongs. It is a pure and honest zeal which moves him to desire
the destruction of the wicked despisers of God; for he adduces no other reason
for the prayer, than that the wicked <i>destroyed God's law. </i>By this he
gives evidence, that nothing was dearer to him than the service of God, and that
nothing was held by him in higher recommendation than the observance of the law.
I have already repeatedly warned you, in other places, that our zeal is forward
and disordered whenever its moving principle is a sense of our own personal
injuries. It is, therefore, to be carefully noticed, that the Prophet's grief
proceeded from no other cause than that he could not endure to see the divine
law violated. In short, this is a prayer that God would restore to order the
confused and ruinous state of things in the world. It remains for us to learn
from David's example, whenever the earth is fraught and defiled with wickedness
to such a degree that the fear of him has become almost extinct, to call upon
him to show himself the maintainer of his own glory. This doctrine is of use in
sustaining our hope and patience whenever God suspends the execution of his
judgments longer than we would incline. Previous to his addressing himself to
God, the Prophet adopts it as a principle, that, although God may seem for a
time to false no notice of what his creatures do, yet he never forgets his
office, but delays the execution of his judgments for wise reasons, that at
length he may execute them when the seasonable time
arrives.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>127.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And therefore I have loved thy
statutes above gold.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This verse, I have
no doubt, is connected with the preceding; for otherwise the illative particle
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>therefore</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>would be without meaning. Viewing it in this connection, I understand the
Psalmist as intimating, that the reason why he esteemed God's law as more
valuable than gold and precious stones, was because he had fixed in his mind a
thorough persuasion of the truth, that although God may connive for a time at
wickedness, the making havoc of all uprightness and equity will not always
remain unpunished. Yea, the more he saw the wicked outrageously breaking forth
into wickedness, the more was he incited by a holy indignation burning in his
heart, to love the law. This is a passage deserving of special attention, for
the baneful influence of evil example is well known, every man thinking that he
may lawfully do whatever is commonly practiced around him. Whence it comes to
pass, that evil company carries us away like a tempest. The more diligently then
ought we to meditate on this doctrine, That when the wicked claim to themselves
an unbridled liberty, it behoves us to contemplate with the eyes of faith the
judgments of God, in order to our being thereby quickened to the observance of
the divine law. If attention to this doctrine has been needful from the
beginning, at the present day it is necessary to exert ourselves, that we may
not be involved in violating the law of God with the wicked conspiracy which
almost the whole world have formed to violate it. The more outrageously the
wicked vaunt themselves, let our veneration for and our love of the divine law
proportionally increase.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>128.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore I have esteemed all
thy commandments to be altogether
right</i>.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe7</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino">This verse, like the preceding, is
connected with the 26th, and the connection may be brought out by observing,
that the Prophet, waiting patiently for God's judgments, and also earnestly
calling for their infliction, had subscribed to the law of God in every
particular, and embraced it without a single exception &#8212; and moreover,
that he hated every false way. Literally, it is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all the commandments of
all</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but the words <i>of all </i>are to
be referred to things and not to persons, as if he had said, that he approved of
all the laws which God had ordained, whatever they
enjoined.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe8</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> A similar form of expression occurs in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;264430&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
44:30, "all<i> </i>oblations of all things" &#8212; that is to say, whatever
kind of oblations men offer. The Prophet has not laid down this sentiment in
such express terms without good reason; for there is nothing to which we are
naturally more inclined than to despise or reject whatever in God's law is not
agreeable to us. Every man, according as he is tainted with this or that
particular vice, would desire their the commandment which forbids it were razed
out of the law. But we cannot lawfully make any addition to it, or take away
anything from it; and since God has joined his commandments together by a sacred
and inviolable bond, to separate any one of them from the rest is altogether
unwarrantable. We perceive then how the Prophet, inspired with a holy jealousy
for the law, contended against the wicked rebellion of those who despised it.
And assuredly, when we see that the ungodly mock God with such effrontery, at
one time rising up audaciously against him, trod at another perverting every
part of the law, it becomes us to be the more inflamed with zeal, and to be the
more courageous in maintaining the truth of God. The extreme impiety of our age
especially demands of all the faithful that they should exercise themselves in
this holy zeal. Profane men strive to outdo one another in scornfully aspersing
the doctrine of salvation, and endeavor to bring God's sacred Word into contempt
by their derisive jeers. Others pour forth their blasphemies without
intermission. We cannot, therefore, avoid being chargeable with the crime of
treacherous indifference, if our hearts are not warmed with zeal, and unless we
burn with a holy jealousy. The Prophet not merely says, that he approved of
God's law wholly and without exception, but he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he hated every way of
lying</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or <i>every false way. </i>And,
undoubtedly, no one subscribes in good earnest to the law of God, but he who
rejects all the slanders by which the wicked taint or obscure the purity of
sound doctrine. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By way of
lying</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the Prophet doubtless means
whatever is opposed to the purity of the law, intimating that he detested all
corruption's which are contrary to the Word of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

to avoid an ambiguous form of expression. The Prophet does not. simply mean,
that the doctrine of the law is wonderful, but that it contains high and hidden
mysteries. Accordingly he declares, that the sublime and admirable wisdom which
he found comprehended in the divine law led him to regard it with reverence.
This is to be carefully marked, for the law of God is proudly despised by the
great majority of mankind, when they do not duly taste its doctrine, nor
acknowledge that God speaks from his throne in heaven, that, the pride of the
flesh being abased, he may raise us upward by the apprehension of faith. We also
gather from this passage, that it is impossible for any man to keep the law of
God from the heart, unless he contemplate it with feelings of reverence: for
reverence is the beginning of pure and right subjection. Accordingly, I have
said that many despise God's Word, because they think it inferior to the
acuteness of their own understandings. Yea, many are led to break forth more
audaciously into this heaven-daring contempt, from the vanity of showing their
own ingenuity. But, although worldly men may flatter themselves in that proud
disdain of the divine law, yet the commendation which the Prophet pronounces
upon it still holds true, that it comprehends mysteries which far transcend all
the conceptions of the human mind.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>130.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The entrance of thy word is
light.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The amount is, that the light of
the truth revealed in God's word, is so distinct that the very first sight of it
illuminates the mind. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jtp</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>pethach, </i>properly signifies <i>an
opening,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe10</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but metaphorically it is taken
for <i>a gate. </i>Accordingly the old translator has rendered it <i>beginning,
</i>which is not improper, provided it is understood of the rudiments or first
elements of the divine law. It is as if the Prophet had &#8212; "Not only do
those who have attained an accurate acquaintance with the whole law, and who
have made the study of it the business of their lives, discern there a clear
light, but also those who have studied it even very imperfectly, and who have
only, so to speak, entered the porch." Now we must reason from the less to the
greater. If tyroes and novices begin to be enlightened at their first entrance,
what will be the case when a man is admitted to a full and perfect
knowledge?</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the second clause the Prophet
unfolds his meaning more fully. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>little
ones</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he denotes such as neither excel in
ingenuity nor are endued with wisdom, but rather are unskilled in letters, and
unrefined by education. Of such he affirms that, as soon as they have learned
the first principles of the law of God, they will be endued with understanding.
It ought to have a most powerful influence in exciting in us an earnest desire
to become acquainted with the law of God, when we are told that even those who,
in the estimation of the world, are fools, and contemptible simpletons, provided
they apply their minds to this subject, acquire from it wisdom sufficient to
lead them to eternal salvation. Although it is not given to all men to attain to
the highest degree in this wisdom, yet it is common to all the godly to profit
so far as to know the certain and unerring rule by which to regulate their life.
Thus no man who surrenders himself to the teaching of God, will loose his labor
in his school, for from his first entrance he will reap inestimable fruit.
Meanwhile we are warned, that all who follow their own understanding, wander in
darkness. By affirming that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
little ones are enlightened</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>David
intimates, that it is only when men, divested of all self confidence, submit
themselves with humble and docile minds to God, that they are in a proper state
for becoming proficient scholars in the study of the divine law. Let the Papists
mock, as they are accustomed to do, because we would have the Scriptures to be
read by all men without exception; yet it is no falsehood which God utters by
the mouth of :David, when he affirms that the light of his truth is exhibited to
fools. God will not, therefore, disappoint the desire of such as acknowledge
their own ignorance, and submit themselves humbly to his
teaching.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>131.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I opened my mouth and
panted.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe11</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words the Psalmist would
have us to understand that he was inflamed with such love to and longing for the
divine law, that lie was unceasingly sighing after it. In comparing himself to
such as are hungry, or to such as burn with parching thirst, he has used a very
appropriate metaphor. As such persons indicate the vehemence of their desire by
opening the mouth, and by distressful panting, as if they would suck up the
whole air, even so the Prophet affirms that he himself was oppressed with
continual uneasiness. The opening of the mouth, then, and the drawing of breath,
are. set in opposition to a cold assent to the word of God. Here the Holy Spirit
teaches with what earnestness of soul the knowledge of divine truth is to be
sought. Whence it follows, that such as make little or no proficiency in God's
law, are punished by their own indolence or carelessness. When David affirms
that he panted continually, he points out not only his ardor but also his
constancy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>132.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Look upon me, and be merciful to
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In this verse he beseeches God to have a
regard to him: as he is accustomed always to look to those who are his people.
The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fp&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>mishpat, </i>translated
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>signifies in this passage, as in many others, <i>a common rule, </i>or
<i>ordinary usage.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe12</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He next adds the purpose for
which he desires that God would look upon him, namely, that he may be relieved
from his miseries. This, then, is the prayer of an afflicted man, who, when
apparently destitute of all help, and unable to come to any other conclusion
than that he is neglected and forsaken of God, yet reflects with himself, that,
for God to forsake him, was foreign to his nature and to his usual manner of
procedure. It is as if he had said &#8212; Although I can perceive no token of
thy favor, yea, although my condition is so wretched and desperate, that,
judging according to sense and reason, I deem that thou hast turned the back:
upon me; yet, as from the beginning of the world to the present day, thou hast
testified, by numberless proofs, that thou art merciful to thy servants, I
beseech time that, acting according to this rule, thou wouldst now exercise the
like loving-kindness towards me. It is to be particularly noticed, lest those
whom God does not immediately answer may become discouraged, that the Prophet
had been long oppressed by miseries, without any prospect of relief. Yet it is
at the same time to be observed, that the Prophets sole ground of confidence in
asking this from God is his free goodness. Whence we gather that, although he
was a man of eminent sanctity, yet the undeserved grace of God was his only
refuge. With respect to the word</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>let us learn from the
Prophet's example to acquaint ourselves with the nature of God, from the various
experiences we have had of it that we may have certain evidence that he is
merciful to us. And, in truth, were not his grace known to us from the daily
experience we have of it, which of us would dare to approach him? But if our
eyes are not blind, we must perceive the very clear testimonies by which he
fortifies our faith, so that we need not doubt that all the godly are the
objects of his regard; only we must endeavor to be among the number of those
<i>who love his name. </i>By this title is meant genuine believers; for those
who only slavishly fear God are not worthy of being reckoned among his servants.
He requires a voluntary obedience from us, so that nothing may be more
delightful to us than to follow whithersoever he calls us. It is, however, at
the same time to be observed, that this love proceeds from faith; yea, the
Prophet here commends the grand effect of faith, by separating the godly, who
lean upon the grace of God, from worldly men, who, having given their hearts to
the enticements of the world, never lift up their minds towards
heaven.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>133.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Direct my steps according to thy
word.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words he shows, as he has
often done before in other places, that the only rule of living well is for men
to regulate themselves wholly by the law of God. We have already repeatedly seen
in this Psalm, that so long as men allow there-selves to wander after their own
inventions, God rejects whatever they do, however laborious the efforts they may
put forth. But as the Prophet declares that men's lives are then only framed
aright when they yield themselves wholly to the obeying of God, so, on the other
hand, he confesses that to do this is not within their own will or power. God's
law, it is evident, will not make us better by merely prescribing to us what is
right. Hence the outward preaching of it is compared to a dead letter. David,
then, well instructed in the law, prays for an obedient heart being given him,
that he may walk in the way set before him. Here two points are particularly
deserving of our notice &#8212; first, that God deals bountifully with men, when
he invites them to himself by his word and doctrine; and, secondly, that still
all this is lifeless and unprofitable, until he govern by his Spirit those whom
he has already taught by his word. As the Psalmist desires not simply to have
his steps directed, but to have them directed to God's word, we may learn that
he did not hunt after secret revelations, and set the word at nought, as many
fanatics do, but connected the external doctrine with the inward grace of the
Holy Spirit; and herein consists the completeness of the faithful, in that God
engraves on their hearts what he shows by his word to be right. Nothing,
therefore, is more foolish than the fancy of those who say, that in enjoining
upon men what lie would have them to do, God estimates the strength which they
have to perform it. In vain does divine truth sound in our ears, if the Spirit
of God does not effectually pierce into our hearts. The Prophet confesses that
it is to no purpose for him to read or hear the law of God, unless his life is
regulated by the secret influence of the Holy Spirit, that he may thus be
enabled to walk in that righteousness which the law enjoins. In the second
clause he reminds us how necessary it is for us to be continually presenting
this prayer at the throne of grace, acknowledging that he is the bond-slave of
sin until God stretch forth his hand to deliver him. <i>direct </i>me, says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that iniquity may not have
dominion in me.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe13</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>So long, then, as we are left to
ourselves, Satan exercises', over us his despotic sway uncontrolled, so that we
have not power to rid ourselves of iniquity. The freedom of the godly consists
solely in this &#8212; that they are governed by the Spirit of God, and thus
preserved from succumbing to iniquity, although harassed with hard and painful
conflicts.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>134.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Deliver me from the oppression of
men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>When recounting what had befallen
himself, the Prophet shows, by his own example, that all the godly are exposed
to rapine and oppression, and that, like sheep in the mouths of wolves, they
will be inevitably destroyed unless God defend them. As very few are governed by
the Spirit of God, it is no wonder if all love of equity is banished from the
world, and if all men are found everywhere rushing into all kinds of wickedness,
some impelled by cruelty,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe14</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and others devoted to fraud and deceit.
When, therefore, the Prophet saw that he was overwhelmed on all sides with
injuries, he betook himself to God as his deliverer. By the word <i>deliver
</i>he intimates, that unless he is preserved in a wonderful manner, it is all
over with him. In the second clause, he engages that he will not prove
ungrateful for his deliverance:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will keep thy
precepts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Nothing more effectually
strengthens us, in an earnest desire and endeavor to follow after integrity and
righteousness, than when we find by experience, that God's defense is of more
value to us than all the unlawful helps to which worldly men unusually have
recourse. We are taught from this passage, that when engaged in contest with the
wicked, we ought not to suffer our minds to be actuated by malice, but that,
however violently and unjustly they may assault us, we should rest; contented
with the delivers. nee which God bestows, and with that alone; and again, that
every instance in which we experience the grace of God in delivering us, should
be a spur to incite us to follow after uprightness. He delivers us for no other
end, but that the fruits of our deliverance may be manifested in our life; and
we are too perverse if that experience is not sufficient to convince us, that
all who persevere in the unfeigned fear of God, will always abide in safety by
his aid, although the whole world may be against
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>135.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Make thy face to shine upon thy
servant.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There is here the repetition of
a prayer which we have several times met with before in this Psalm. The Prophet
intimates, that he regarded nothing as of more importance than rightly to
understand the divine law. When he beseeches God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to make his face to shine upon
his servant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he, in the first place,
seeks to win the fatherly favor of God &#8212; for nothing is to be hoped for
from Him unless we have an interest in his favor &#8212; but he at the same
time, shows the greatness of the blessing. There is no testimony of the love of
God, as if he had said, which I am more desirous to obtain than to be enabled to
make progress in his law. Whence we gather, as I have lately observed, that he
preferred divine truth to all the possessions of the world. Would to God that
this affection were vigorous in our hearts! But that which the Prophet extols so
highly, is neglected by the great proportion of mankind. If individuals are to
be found stimulated by this desire, we see them presently falling back to the
Measurements of the world, so that there are very few, indeed, who renouncing
all other desires, seek earnestly with David to become acquainted with the
doctrine of the law. Besides, as God vouchsafes this privilege only to those
whom he has embraced with his fatherly love, it is proper for us to begin with
this prayer, That he would make his face to shine upon us. This form of
expression, however, conveys something more &#8212; it implies, that it is only
when God illumines the minds of his believing people with the true knowledge of
the law, that he delights them with the beams of his favor. It often happens
that, even in regard to them, God's countenance is overcast with clouds in this
respect, namely, when he deprives them of tasting the sweetness of his
word.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>136.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rivers of waters run from my
eyes.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe15</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here David affirms that he was
inflamed with no ordinary zeal for the glory of God, inasmuch as he dissolved
wholly into tears on account of the contempt put upon the divine law. He speaks
hyperbolically; but still he truly and plainly expresses the disposition of mind
with which he was endued; and it corresponds with what he says in altogether
place, "The<i> </i>zeal of thine house hath eaten me up."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;196909&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
69:9.) Wherever the Spirit of God reigns, he excites this ardent zeal, which
burns the hearts of the godly when they see the commandment of the Most High God
accounted as a thing of nought. It is not enough that each of us endeavor to
please God; we must also desire that his law may be held in estimation by all
men. In this way holy Lot, as the Apostle Peter testifies, vexed his soul when
he beheld Sodom a sink of all kinds of wickedness.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;610208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Peter 2:8.) If, in former times, the ungodliness of the world extorted from the
children of God such bitter grief, so great is the corruption into which we at
this day are fallen, that those who can look upon the present state of things
unconcerned and without tears, are thrice, yea four times, insensible. How great
in our day is the frenzy of the world in despising God and neglecting his
doctrine? A few, no doubt, are to be found who with the mouth profess their
willingness to receive it, but scarcely one in ten proves the sincerity of his
profession by his life. Meanwhile countless multitudes are hurried away to the
impostures of Satan and to the Pope; others are as thoughtless and indifferent
about their salvation as the lower
animals;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe16</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and many Epicureans openly mock at all
religion. If there is, then, the smallest portion of piety remaining in us, full
rivers of tears, and not merely small drops, will flow from our eyes. But if we
would give evidence of pure and uncorrupted zeal, let our grief begin at
ourselves &#8212; at our seeing that we are yet far from having attained to a
perfect observance of the law; yea, that the depraved lusts of our carnal nature
are often rising up against the righteousness of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;y</font><font face="Palatino">
as a substantive, the sense will be almost the same. All men indeed grant that
God is righteous; but the Prophet has expressed more than the common sort of
men, yea than the whole world, perceive in reference to this subject; for in
designating God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteous</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he means, that as soon as we depart from Him, we will not find a particle of
righteousness anywhere else. When he adds that the evidence and testimony of
this righteousness are to be seen in the law, he teaches us that God is robbed
of his praise, if we do not subscribe to all his commandments. To the same
purpose is the following verse, which declares that God has taught in his law
full and perfect righteousness and truth. The adverb,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dam</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>meod, </i>which signifies
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>greatly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commanded</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>inasmuch as it was God's design to exhibit in the law a perfect rule of
righteousness. The doctrine of the law is honored with these encomiums, that all
of us may learn to derive wisdom from it, and that no man may devise for himself
any other standard of rectitude or righteousness than that which is exhibited in
the law; a very necessary lesson, since every man would willingly frame for
himself a new pattern or standard of
righteousness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>139.</b>

persecutors, by whom it is certain he had been subjected to much trouble. But
although they were virulent and cruel towards him, he avows that it was not so
much his own private wrongs which offended him as the violation of God's law;
yea rather, that he was so consumed with grief on that account as not to be
affected at all with his own individual troubles. This is an example from which
much profit may be derived. We are too tender and delicate in bearing wrongs;
and hence it is that if we are but touched with a finger, we are instantly
inflamed with anger, whilst at the same time we are but coldly affected at the
most grievous offenses committed against God. But if we are animated with the
zeal that inspired the Prophet it will carry us away to another kind of sorrow,
which will take entire possession of our
souls.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>140.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy word is exceedingly

the cause of his zeal was the love which he bore to heavenly doctrine. For to be
displeased with or severely to condemn the contempt of divine truth, unless we
are bound to it by the cords of love, is pure hypocrisy. And he affirms that his
love to God's word was not a rash, or a blind and inconsiderate affection, but
that he loved it, because like gold or silver which has been refined, it was
pure and free from all dregs and dross. This is the idea contained in the
metaphorical term

commonplace, yet, vindicating God's word from all perverse and malicious
judgments, it expresses graphically the true obedience of faith. How few are
there who are not guilty, either by their distrust, or waywardness, or pride, or
voluptuousness, of casting upon God's word some spot or stain! The flesh then
being so rebellious, it is no small commendation of revealed truth, when it is
compared to gold well refined, so that it shines pure from all defilement.
Farther, it serves not a little to show the truth of this testimony, that the
Prophet confirms it by his own experience. The more effectually to repress the
foolish rashness with which we are chargeable whenever we imagine that there is
any fault in God's word, he declares that in commending it he gives utterance to
the unfeigned feeling of his heart, having experienced a blissful pleasure in
that purity of which he speaks.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>141.</b>

he was tried with poverty and many other calamities, he steadily persevered in
the exercise of true godliness, and in the observance of the law. On that
account, as he states, he was despised by wicked men. Every man gives praise to
God just in proportion as he is gorged with his benefits; and very few will be
found applying their minds to the service of God, unless they have all their
wishes gratified. Hence it comes to pass that hypocrites, as long as they are
pampered to the full, accumulate riches and increase in power, are very lavish
in praising God. But let them be treated in some degree roughly, and immediately
the blessed name of God is heard of no more. Since then men are ordinarily
mercenary in serving God, let us learn from the Prophet's example that true
godliness is disinterested, so that when under its influence we <i>cease </i>not
to praise God, although he may afflict us with adversity and make us despised in
the eyes of the world. These upbraiding words of Christ in

doctrine of the law with all the human precepts which were ever delivered, that
he may bring all the faithful in subjection to it, since it is the school of
perfect wisdom. There may be more of plausibility in the refined and subtle
disquisition's of men; but there is in them nothing firm or solid at bottom, as
there is in God's law. This firmness of the divine law he proves in the
following verse from one instance &#8212; the continual comfort he found in it
when grievously harassed with temptations. And the true test of the profit we
have reaped from it is, when we oppose to all the distresses of whatever kind
which may straiten us, the consolation derived from the word of God, that
thereby all sadness may be effaced from our minds. David here expresses
something more than he did in the preceding verse; for there he only said that
he reverently served God, although from his rough and hard treatment he might
seem to lose his labor; but now when distressed and tormented, he affirms that
he finds in the law of God the most soothing delight, which mitigates all
grief's, and not only tempers their bitterness, but also seasons them with a
certain sweetness. And assuredly when this taste does not exist to afford us
delight, nothing is more natural than for us to be swallowed up of sorrow. Nor
ought we to omit noticing the form of expression which the Prophet employs, by
which he teaches, that although lie was besieged and shut up on all sides, he
found a remedy sufficiently powerful in improving the consolation offered him by
the word of God. As this could not be true of the bare commandments, which so
far from remedying our distresses, rather fill us with anxiety, there is no
doubt that under the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commandments</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>there is comprehended by the figure synecdoche, the<i> </i>whole doctrine of
the law, in which God not only requires what is right, but in which also calling
his elect ones to the hope of eternal salvation, he opens the gate of perfect
happiness. Yea, under the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>law</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>are comprehended both free adoption, and also the promises which flow from
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>144.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The righteousness of thy
testimonies endureth forever.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The
Psalmist repeats what lie had already before stated, that there is a great
dissimilarity between the righteousness of God's testimonies and man's
inventions; the splendor of the last quickly vanishing away, whereas the other
continues steadfast for ever. He repeats this twice; for although the world is
forced to attribute the praise of righteousness to the law of God, yet the
majority of mankind are carried away after their own speculations, so that there
is nothing more difficult than to hold us fast in our obedience to God. David's
drift is to show that everlasting righteousness is not comprehended elsewhere
than in God's law, and that it is in vain to seek for it anywhere else; and
there is accordingly here laid down a clearer definition of righteousness, which
is, that righteousness consists in our keeping ourselves within the bounds of
the law. As to the last clause of the verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Give me understanding and I shall
live</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>I read it in connection with the
preceding clause; for although David desires to have his mind enlightened by
God, yet he does not conceive of any other way by which he was to obtain an
enlightened understanding than by his profiting aright in the study of the law.
Farther, he here teaches, that men cannot, properly speaking, be said to live
when they are destitute of the light of heavenly wisdom; and as the end for
which men are created is not that, like swine or asses, they may stuff their
bellies, but that they may exercise themselves in the knowledge and service of
God, when they turn away from such employment, their life is worse than a
thousand deaths. David therefore protests that for him to live was not merely to
be fed with meat and drink, and to enjoy earthly comforts, but to aspire after a
better life, which he could not do save under the guidance of faith. This is a
very necessary warning; for although it is universally acknowledged that man is
born with this distinction, that he excels the lower animals in intelligence,
yet the great bulk of mankind, as if with deliberate purpose: stifle whatever
light God pours into their understandings. I indeed admit that all men desire to
be sharp-witted; but how few aspire to heaven, and consider that the fear of,God
is the beginning of wisdom. Since then meditation upon the celestial life is
buried by earthly cares, men do nothing else than plunge into the grave, so that
while living to the world, they die to God. Under the term <i>life, </i>however,
as I have elsewhere said, the Prophet denotes the utmost he could wish. Lord, as
if he had said, although I am already dead, yet if thou art pleased to illumine
my mind with the knowledge of heavenly truth, this grace alone will be
sufficient to revive me.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

he was inflamed with an intense desire to keep the law, he continually made
supplication to God on that subject. But the subsequent verse compels us to take
a different view, for the same thing is, no doubt, there again repeated. The
Prophet then requests that God would hear him; and in token of his gratitude he
promises to keep God's commandments. He simply uses the indefinite term <i>cry;
</i>and thus he does not express what the prayers were which he offered up to
God, but only shows, that while the children of this world are distracted by a
multiplicity of objects, he directed all the affections of his heart exclusively
to God, because he depended solely on him. As the world is compelled to
acknowledge that God is the author of all good things, many formal prayers
proceed from that principle. It was the consideration of this which led David to
affirm that he prayed with his whole heart. When he shall have obtained his
requests, he proposes to himself the glory of God as his end, resolving to
devote himself with so much the more ardent affection to the work of serving
him. Although God declares that he is served aright by the sacrifice of praise,
yet David, to distinguish himself from hypocrites who profane the name of God by
their cold and feigned praises, with good reason declares that he will give
thanks by his life and works.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the following
verse he makes no new statement; but he speaks more expressly. In the first
place, he says that he cried to God; and next he adds, that he commended his
welfare to Him by prayer; thereby intimating that whether he was in safety, or
whether imminent danger threatened him with death, he uniformly reposed upon
God, being fully persuaded that the only way in which he could continue safe was
by having him for the guardian and protector of his
welfare.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>147.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have prevented the

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;&ccedil;n</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
nesheph, </i>is in this place improperly translated by <i>crepusculum, twilight;
</i>for it rather signifies the dawn of morning. But as the Latin's derive the
word <i>crepusculum, </i>from <i>creperus, </i>which signifies <i>doubtful
</i>or <i>uncertain, </i>so that it may signify the doubtful and intermediate
time between light and darkness, I have not been particularly nice in the
selection of the term only let my readers understand that the evening twilight
commencing with sunset is not here denoted, but the imperfect light which
precedes the rising of the sun. David then expresses the most eager haste when
he says, that he prevented the dawn of the morning by his prayers. The verb
<i>cry </i>always conveys the idea of earnestness; referring, as it does, not so
much to the loudness of the voice as to the vehemency and ardor of the mind. In
mentioning his haste, his object is the better to set forth his perseverance;
for he tells us, that although he betook himself to prayer with such
promptitude, yet he did not immediately become weary of that exercise, like the
unbelieving, who, if God does not suddenly grant them their requests, murmur and
complain against him. Thus, in conjoining patience of hope with earnestness of
desire, he shows what is the true manner of praying; even as Paul, in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;500406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
4:6, when he exhorts us to</font><br></div>

<i>suach, </i>is put for <i>to discourse. </i>If this opinion is admitted, the
sense will be, that the Prophet, not from ostentation, but for the welfare of
his brethren, was so desirous of communicating instruction, that he gave himself
no rest. The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>meditate</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is, however, more appropriate in this place; for the night is an
unseasonable time for discoursing upon the law of God; but at that season, when
alone, he silently recalled to his memory what he had previously learned, so
that he passed no part of the night without meditating upon the
law.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>149.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Hear my voice, O Jehovah! according to thy
mercy.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In the first place he declares,
that the goodness of God was the only ground of his hope of being heard by him.
Whatever blessings the saints may plead for in prayer, their opening argument
must be the free and unmerited grace of God. Nor is the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgments</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fe22</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in the second clause to be taken in a different sense. As God has revealed
his goodness in his word, his word is the source from which we must derive our
assurance of his goodness. The Prophet, then, sensible that he had need of the
divine mercy, betook himself directly to the word, in which God, sweetly
alluring men to himself, promises that his grace will be ready and open for all.
That each, therefore, may be confidently persuaded that God will be merciful to
him in particular, let him learn from the example of the Prophet to entreat God
to show himself such as he has promised to be. Some expound the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgments</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

deal graciously with all his people. I would not altogether reject this
exposition; but I think it is harsh and foreign to the scope of the text, while
the meaning which I have adduced comes out very naturally. Moreover, he desires
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to be

midst of life he is dead, except in so far as he is sustained by the power of
God. And assuredly, all who are duly acquainted with their own infirmity,
esteeming their life as nothing, will crave to be quickened every moment. It is
also to be added, that God often so exercised his servant, that with good reason
he might send up his prayers, as it were, out of the sepulcher, to be restored
from death to

off from God's law, since they east far from them all regard to uprightness and

the assurance of this immutabiliy of God's word may be rooted in our minds, the
inward revelation of the Holy Spirit is indeed necessary; for until God seal
within us the certainty of his word, our belief of its certainty will be
continually wavering. Yet the Prophet, not without cause, affirms, that he

example that those who are devoted to the service and fear of God, must not be
discouraged though they are not rewarded for it in this world. Their condition
upon earth is one of warfare, and therefore they should not be dismayed by
diversity, but rather rest satisfied with the consolatory consideration, that
the gate of prayer is open to them. Yet the Prophet does not boast of his,
endeavors to keep the law, as if he would have God to pay him wages for his
service, but only to show that he was one of God's servants, just as he has
spoken of his hope that he was so in other places. This reason,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for I have not forgotten thy law,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">on account of which he beseeches God to
consider his affliction and to rescue him, is peculiarly forcible in the present
case; for it is an evidence of no ordinary courage when, instead of being led
away from the fear of God by adversity, we wrestle against temptations and seek
him even when he seems purposely to drive us away from
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>154.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Debate thy cause, and redeem
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this verse David specifics the
kind of his affliction, which was the wrongful and harassing treatment which he
met with at the hands of evil and unprincipled men. The reading literally is,
<i>Plead my cause, </i>which is the same thing as to undertake a cause, or to
take the charge of defending one in judgment, or to maintain the right of the
oppressed. In the first place the Prophet in invoking God to defend his cause,
shows that he is wrongfully oppressed, either by violence, calumnies, or crafty
policies; and in seeking </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to be
redeemed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he intimates that he was
unable to make any resistance, or that he was so entangled in their snares, as
to have no remaining hope except in the deliverance of God. In the second clause
the letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

caph, </i>the mark of similitude,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe29</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as would appear from his having used a
little before (Psalm 119:149) a similar form of prayer. Again, as David here
complains that he is held as it were in fetters by his enemies, unless he is
delivered by the hand of his Redeemer, he with good reason beseeches God to
restore him to life; for he who is rims abased is like a person dead. It is also
aptly added </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to thy
word</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for it is from the promises which
God makes in his word of becoming our deliverer that the hope of life shines
upon us. Whence the Prophet, when earnestly desiring to be brought from darkness
to light, sustains and encourages himself by the word. If a different sense is
preferred, then David is not to be understood as simply asking that life may be
given him, but as praying for spiritual life, that he may be encouraged to
exercise faith, to cultivate the fear of God, and to cherish the desire of
living a holy
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>155<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Safety is far from the wicked.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Fully
persuaded that the world is governed by the secret providence of God, who is a
just judge, the Prophet draws from that source the doctrine, That the wicked are
far removed from safety, and safety from them. Hence proceeds the confidence of
prayer; for as God is turned away from the despisers of his word, so he is ready
to succor his servants. It is to be noticed, that when the Prophet saw that his
enemies were elated by their prosperity, he on the contrary lifted up his heart
by faith that thus he might come to the settled persuasion that all their
delights were cursed and tended to destruction. Whenever then the wicked prosper
in the world according to their wishes, so that being pampered to the full they
exult in their own fatness, let us learn, in order to defend ourselves, to lay
hold upon this buckler which the Holy Spirit is holding out to us, namely, that
they shall at length miserably perish, because they seek not the commandments of
God. From this we draw a contrary doctrine, That although genuine believers,
whilst they walk sincerely in the fear of God may be as sheep appointed to the
slaughter, yet their salvation, which is under the special care and protection
of God's secret providence, is just at hand. In this sense the Prophet adds in
the following verse,</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>156.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Jehovah,! thy tender mercies
are many;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as if he had said that no
offenders are safe but those who betake themselves to the divine mercy. Farther,
to encourage himself to approach God with the greater confidence, he not only
says that God is merciful, but he mightily magnifies and extols his
compassion's. From this we gather that he was so contented with them, as not to
seek any aid from his own merits. It is however at the same time to be noted,
that the Prophet was far from being lightly troubled with many temptations,
seeing he was forced to oppose to them this vast abundance of mercy. It makes
little difference whether we read <i>great </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>many</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>The prayer which follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Quicken me according to thy
judgments</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>I explain as referring to the
promises. The original word for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is by some translated <i>manner </i>or <i>custom; </i>but I have already
shown above that such a translation is less suitable than the other. The Prophet
then again confirms the truth, That life cannot be hoped for or asked from God,
unless hope is produced by his word; and he often repeats this truth, because it
is one of which we are marvelously forgetful. But that we may boldly appropriate
to ourselves all the grace which God promises to his servants, let the doctrine
of the great and manifold tender mercies of God be ever present to our thoughts.
If we imagine that God makes his promises because he is bound to do it, or
because we have deserved it, doubting or mistrust will steal upon our minds,
which will shut the gate against our prayers. But if we are thoroughly persuaded
that the sole cause by which God is moved to promise us salvation is the mercy
inherent in his own nature, we will approach him without hesitation or doubt,
because he has bound himself to us of his own
accord.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>157.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My persecutors and oppressors are
many.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist here as in other
places testifies, that although lie had been provoked by many injuries, yet he
had not departed from the right way; which, as I have elsewhere observed, was an
evidence of great and singular constancy. It is an easy matter to act well when
we are among the good; but if wicked men afflict us, if one man openly assault
us by force, if another rob us of our property, if a third circumvent us by
wiles, and a fourth attack us by calumnies, it is difficult for us to persevere
in our integrity, and we rather begin to howl among the wolves. Besides, the
license which is allowed them of doing what they please without the fear of
being punished, is a powerful engine for shaking our faith, because, when God
thus winks at the wicked, he seems to abandon us for a prey. The Prophet
therefore, by <i>God's testimonies, </i>means not only the rule of holy and
righteous living, but also the promises. Lord, as if he had said, I have not
turned away from the path of integrity, although the conduct of the wicked has
presented me with a temptation to do so; nor have I shaken off nay confidence in
thy grace, but have waited patiently for thy succor. Both these are necessary.
For although he who has suffered wrongs may contend against the malice of his
enemies by his well &#8212; doing, and may refrain from every act of
retaliation, yet, provided he does not depend wholly upon God,. this uprightness
will not be sufficient to save him. :Not that any man behaves himself in a
manner so moderate, except he who leans upon God and waits upon him as his
deliverer; but granting that such could be the ease, there would not be
sufficient power in this half virtue to save him. The salvation of God is
reserved for the faithful who ask it in the exercise of lively faith. And
whoever, persuaded that God will be his deliverer, pillars and supports his mind
on the divine promises, will endeavor also to overcome evil with
good.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>158.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
I saw the perfidious and child them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In
this verse the Psalmist proceeds yet farther, declaring that he was inflamed
with a holy zeal when he saw the law of God despised by the wicked. Expositors
are not however agreed as to one word in the text, namely the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hffwqta</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
ethkotatah, </i>which we have rendered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>chid</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>some deriving it from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fwq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kut, </i>which often signifies <i>to debate </i>or <i>contend with, </i>it
being in the conjugation <i>hithpael, </i>while others derive it from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ffq</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
karat, </i>which signifies <i>to kill </i>or <i>to destroy. </i>I adopt the
former interpretation, because it is more generally received among the learned,
and is most appropriate. The Prophet then teaches that he was inflamed with such
zeal for the law of God that he could no longer endure the impious mockery
directed against it. The verb <i>debate </i>may however be understood as well of
the vexation or anger which he felt in himself, as of the rebuke which he openly
administered to the despisers of God; and therefore some translate it, <i>I
shuddered, </i>or <i>I was grieved
</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fe30</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Nor assuredly will any person enter into debate with others for maintaining
the glory of God, but he who is first chafed within himself, and has been
grieved at heart; even as on the other hand, after this holy indignation there
almost always follows transitive action; that is to say, it passes from the
thought to the effect.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe31</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In short, we are admonished by the
example of the Prophet, that we ought to feel such displeasure at the contempt
of God's word as that our heart grows hot even to chiding. In the first place,
then, let grief affect us inwardly; and next, whenever opportunity shall present
itself, let; us strenuously endeavor to repress the forwardness and pride of the
wicked, and let us not hesitate to do so from the fear of provoking their
resentment against us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>159.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, O Jehovah how I have
loved thy commandments.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>What I have
state before must be remembered &#8212; that when the saints speak of their own
piety before God they are not chargeable with obtruding their own merits as the
ground of their confidence; but they regard this as, a settled principle, that
God, who distinguishes his servants from the profane and wicked, will be
merciful to them because they seek him with their whole heart. Besides, an
unfeigned love of God's law is an undoubted evidence of adoption, since this
love is the work of the Holy Spirit. The Prophet, therefore, although he
arrogates nothing to himself, very properly adduces his own piety for the
purpose, of encouraging himself to entertain the more assured hope of obtaining
his request, through the grace of God which he had experienced. At the same time
we are taught that there can be no true keeping of the law but what springs from
free and spontaneous love. God demands voluntary sacrifices, and the
commencement of a good life is to love him, as Moses declares,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
10:12,)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"And<i> </i>now, O
Israel! what doth the Lord require of
thee,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">but to love
him."</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The same thing is also repeated in the summary of the
law:
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
6:5,) "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God." For this reason David has previously
stated, that the law of God was not only precious but also delightful to him.
Now as in keeping the law it behoves us to begin with voluntary obedience, so
that nothing may delight us more than the righteousness of God, so on the other
hand, it must not be forgotten that a sense of the free goodness of God and of
his fatherly love is indispensably necessary in order to our hearts being beheld
to this affection. So far are the bare commandment's from winning men to obey
them, that they rather frighten them away. Hence it is evident, that it is only
when a man shall have tasted the goodness of God from the teaching of the law,
that he will apply his heart to love it in return. The frequency with which the
Prophet repeats the prayer, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that
God would quicken him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>teaches us that
he knew well the frailty of his own life, so that in his estimation men live
only in so far as God every moment breathes life into them. Besides, it is
probable that he had been continually besieged by many deaths, to the end he
might the more earnestly betake himself to the fountain of life. He again rests
his faith upon the goodness of God as its foundation &#8212;<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>quicken me according to thy
loving-kindness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>&#8212; from<i>
</i>which we perceive how far he was from boasting of his own merits when he
protested in the preceding sentence that he loved God's
law.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>160.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The beginning of thy word is
truth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The design of the Prophet it is
not difficult to perceive; but the words admit of being understood in two ways.
Some interpret the noun
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>beginning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>as denoting that the truth of God shines forth conspicuously in his word,
immediately when we enter for the first time upon the study of it, so that this
entrance may justly be called the beginning of the word. This sentence contains
the profitable doctrine, that if we are finished with eyes of understanding, we
will no sooner cast our eyes upon heavenly doctrine than the truth of it will
meet our view. Others, however, give a different explanation, and perhaps with
no less propriety, eliciting this sense, That the word of God has been from the
beginning certain and infallible truth, and will continue so even to the end.
These two clauses hang very well together &#8212; that God has been true to his
word from the beginning, and that he will continue to be so everlastingly and
immutably. The interpretation which refers the
word</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to the works of God and not to
his doctrine, I would not altogether condemn, yet it is not in harmony with the
context. Let us then retain this sense, That from the time when God began to
speak he has always been faithful to his promises, and has never disappointed
the hope of his people; and that the course of this faithfulness has been so
uniform, that from the beginning even to the end his word is true and
faithful.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

fe34</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here the Psalmist, informs us
that sore and grievous as his temptation had been, he was restrained by the fear
of God from desiring to attempt anything unworthy of the character of a godly
man. We are prone to fall into despair when princes who are armed with power to
overwhelm us are hostile to and molest us. The evil is also aggravated from the
consideration that it is the very persons who ought to be as<b> </b>bucklers to
defend us, who employ their strength in hurting us. Yea, when the afflicted are
stricken by those in high places, they in a manner think that the hand of God is
against them. There was also this peculiarity in the case of the Prophet, that
he had to encounter the grandees of the chosen people &#8212; men whom God had
placed in such honor-able stations, to the end they might be the pillars of the
Church. Some give, more restricted exposition, which is, that David followed the
exhortation of Christ in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401028&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
10:28,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Fear<i> </i>not them who
kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. but rather fear him who is
able to destroy both soul and body in hell;"</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">a sentiment which although :it had not as yet been
uttered by Christ's mouth, ought nevertheless to have been fixed in the hearts
of all the godly. The sense, then, in their opinion is, that the Prophet had not
been turned aside from the fear of God by any of the threatening or terrors of
his enemies. But his commendation of his own constancy is to be understood in a
more extended sense than this. The exhortation of Isaiah is well
known,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Neither<i> </i>fear ye
their fear, nor be afraid; sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be
your fear, and let him be your dread."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230812&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
8:12,13)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet in that place shows in general what the
weapons are, with which the faithful being armed will succeed in vanquishing all
the assaults of the world &#8212; he shows that they will do so, provided they
not only stand in awe of God, but also rest assured that he will always be the
guardian of their welfare, so that they may cast all their cares upon him. Thus
it will come to pass that, resting contented with his protection, they will not
turn aside to practice whatever may be sinful to secure their safety. In like
manner the Prophet, in the passage before us, affirms that although being
oppressed by the wrongful violence of princes, he presented a sad spectacle, yet
he did not succumb, but considered what was lawful for him to do, and did not
attempt to rival their wicked practices, by repelling craft with craft and
violence with violence. In this text, as is evident from the connection,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to be afraid at God's
word,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is to restrain one's. self and to
attempt nothing which is unlawful. I have already said that the adverb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;nj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>hinnam, </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>without a
cause</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is added for the sake of
amplification; for the temptation was so much the harder from the fact, that the
tyrants, without cause and merely to gratify their own wicked inclination,
assaulted an innocent individual. Men of a good disposition and of a noble mind,
it is well known, are more easily excited to anger when the object assaulted is
one who has done wrong to nobody. It was therefore a signal proof of
self-control for the Prophet to bridle himself by the word of God, that he might
not vie with others in evil doing, or, overcome with temptation, go out of the
place which had been assigned him in the social body. Let us then learn to
remain peaceable, although princes tyrannically abuse the power which God has
committed to them, lest by creating insurrection we break in upon the peace and
order of society.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>162.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have rejoiced at thy word as
one who hath found great spoil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>No gain,
it is well known, brings greater joy than that which conquerors acquire from the
spoil of their enemies; for to the gain there is added the glory of triumph; and
when profit comes on a sudden, the delight experienced is from that circumstance
the greater. This is the reason why David compares the knowledge he had obtained
of heavenly doctrine with spoils rather than with other riches; for by these
words he intimates that his greatest joy was derived from the word of God, to
which no gain however desirable could at all approach. From this was learn that
he was contented with the word of God as a thing in which was all his delight,
and in which he found solid felicity; which could not be, but, in the way of his
first withdrawing his heart from all depraved desires. :Nor is it wonderful to
find David placing the whole sum of a happy life in the word of God, in which he
well knew the treasure of eternal life to be included and offered to him by
means of free adoption.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>163.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have hated and abhorred
deceit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this verse he declares more
distinctly what I have adverted to a little before, that he was cleansed from
corrupt affections that he might bestow upon the law of God such honor and
estimation as it deserved. Having elsewhere met with almost the same sentence, I
shall but briefly touch upon the reason why the Prophet affirms that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he hated
deceit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>before he speaks of his love and
devotedness to the law. As hypocrisy is in the hearts of all men by nature, and
as we are naturally prone to vanity and deceitfulness, we ought diligently to
labor to purge our hearts, that the love of the law may reign in them. Now if
the beginning of a good life and the first point of righteousness is to hate and
abhor deceit, it follows that nothing is more excellent than integrity; for
unless that virtue hold the chief place, all the other virtues speedily
disappear. Nor is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>abhorring</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>superfluously added to <i>hating, </i>the design being to teach us that it
is not enough to hate falsehood with a common hatred, but that God's children
must hate it with a deadly hatred. Now if the love of the law and the hatred of
falsehood are inseparably conjoined, it is a plain inference that all who are
not taught in the school of God are infected with deceit and
hypocrisy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>164.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Seven times a day have I praised
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By the adverb
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seven
times</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the Prophet means that he was
continually or very often engaged in celebrating the praises of God; just as it
is said in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;202416&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
24:16, "A<i> </i>just man falleth seven times," when he often falls into divers

fe35</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The phrase
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the judgments of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>being in many places taken for the
punishments which God inflicts upon sinners, and also sometimes applied in
general to the providence by which he governs the world, some understand the
Prophet as praising God because he affords such manifest proofs of his justice
both in punishing the wicked and in the whole government of the world. But I
rather agree with others who refer the phrase to the divine law; not that I
dislike the former interpretation, but because in this psalm the great topic
upon which the Psalmist chiefly insists is the commendation of God's law. The
amount then is, that when David was assiduously occupied in meditating upon the
law of God, he found it distinguished by so great perfection of righteousness
and wisdom, that from time to time he burst forth into the exercise of praise
and thanksgiving. This diligence in praising God shows that David not only spoke
reverently and honourably of the divine law, but that he accounted it an
inestimable boon conferred upon the human race. It was not simply admiration
which constrained him to this commendation, but a principle of gratitude; for he
saw that nothing more excellent could be bestowed upon men than their being
renewed to a blessed and an endless life by the incorruptible seed of heavenly
truth. Yet scarcely one in a hundred of those to whom God offers this treasure
puts himself to the trouble of giving God thanks for it even in an ordinary
manner. On the contrary, there reigns such vile ingratitude everywhere in the
world, that some scornfully reject divine truth, and others despise or slight
it, while others rail and gnash their teeth against it if they find anything in
it which does not please them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>165.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Great peace have they who
love thy law.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>If we take the word
<i>peace </i>for a prosperous or happy condition of life &#8212; a sense in
which the Hebrews often employ it &#8212; the word rendered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stumbling-block</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>to correspond with it, will be used for <i>adversity; </i>as if it had been
said, that those who love God's law shall continually prosper and retain their
position, although the whole world should fall into ruins. But a different
interpretation will be equally appropriate, namely, that they have great peace,
because, being persuaded that both their persons and their life are acceptable
to God, they calmly repose themselves on a good conscience. This tranquil state
of conscience, this serenity of mind, is justly reckoned the chief point of a
happy life, that is to say it is so, when it proceeds from God's being
reconciled to us, and from his fatherly favor shining in our hearts. The Prophet
justly teaches that we attain this peace from the love of the law; for whoever
would make it to depend upon anything else, will be from time to time trembling
at every little blast. If this sense is adopted, the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stumbling-block</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>in the second clause, will signify all the troubles and disquietudes of mind
with which all who lean not upon God's word are miserably distressed and
tormented, and with which they are driven about either by their own depraved
passions, or by the caprice of other men. But in whatever way understand these
two words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stumbling-block</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>the design of the Prophet will remain the same, which is to show, that those
who are not devoted to God are miserable; for although they may applaud
themselves for a time, yet they will meet with many stumbling-blocks to drive
them suddenly out of their course. From the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>we gather that this peace is not acquired by a slavish observance of the
law, but proceeds from faith; for the law has no sweetness to attract us to it,
unless it exhibit to us God in the character of a father, and tranquilize our
minds by the assurance of eternal salvation. So far from enjoying peace, all
worldly men and despisers of God are justly punished by their own depravity and
obdurate rebellion; for each of them is his own executioner, and the more
fiercely they rage against the word of God, the sorer are they tormented, until
they bring upon themselves utter destruction. The godly, it is true, are also
tormented or distressed, but this inward consolation wipes away all their
sorrow, or, raising them up, enables them to surmount all stumbling-blocks, or
so relieves them, that they faint
not.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>166</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
O Jehovah! I have waited for thy salvation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>It is not without cause that the Prophet often repeats this sentence, which
is in all men's mouths, there being nothing easier than to ascribe to God the
praise and office of saving, while yet there is hardly to be met with in the
world a single example of steadfast hope, when men come to wrestle with
temptations for any length of time. From the order of the words we learn, that
if a man would keep himself in the fear of God, and the love of the law, it is
necessary for him, above all things,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe36</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to seek for salvation in God. If faith
in God's grace be removed from our minds, or patience shaken off, we will be
carried away hither and thither, and will cease any longer to cultivate
godliness. The chief virtue of the faithful, therefore, is a patient endurance
of the cross and mortification by which they calmly submit themselves to God;
for so long as no adversity happens to hypocrites, they seem, also to be
well-affectioned to the work of serving him. There are also other reasons why it
behoves us to keep our minds intent upon the salvation of God, if we desire to
regulate our life aright; for if the, allurements of the world hold us in their
snares, we will immediately become discouraged. The reason, as we plainly see,
why the hearts of the great majority fail, is because it is difficult to believe
assuredly that salvation is to be hoped for only from the grace of God. That we
may therefore persevere in serving God, it is indispensable that faith shine on
the future before us, and next, that patience accompany us, to nourish within us
the love of righteousness. For, as we have said, our alacrity in persevering
proceeds from this, that with a patient spirit we suffer our salvation to lie
hidden in the bosom of God, and that we doubt not of his at length, proving a
faithful rewarder of all such as seek him, although he may withdraw his favor
from the eye of sense. In the subsequent verse the Psalmist confirms this
doctrine by other words, saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he kept God's testimonies
with his soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>he expresses still more forcibly than before, that he had the doctrine of
the law enclosed within the deepest recesses of his heart. The cause of this
peculiarly diligent keeping of the law, was the singular love which he had to
it, as he states in the concluding clause of the verse. He who by constraint and
in a slavish manner obeys the law, is so far from receiving it into the secret
habitation of his heart to keep it there, that he would have it removed far away
from
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>168</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
have kept thy commandments and thy
testimonies.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>What the Psalmist had
expressed more strongly, he now repeats more simply, adding there to reason. He
abbreviates the statement as made in the preceding verse only by here omitting
the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>which he there uses, whilst to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commandments</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>he joins
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>testimonies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>in order the more distinctly to show that he does not speak exclusively of
the rule of an upright and holy life, but also comprehends the whole covenant of
salvation. And, assuredly, the doctrine of the law could not be so sweet and
attractive from its commanding what is right, did it not at the same time
exhibit the free favor of God. The reason which the Prophet assigns for his
keeping God's commandments and testimonies &#8212;<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for all my ways are before
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fe37
</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>&#8212;</i> is<i> </i>to this effect, That
the truth, which he well knew, that nothing is hidden from God, served as a
bridle to keep him devoted to the cultivation of godliness; for if we live not
as under the omniscient inspection of God, the fickle lustfulness of the flesh
quickly carries us away now one way and now another. The meaning, also, may be
this &#8212; that he made God the arbiter and judge of his life; for in
Scripture language those are said <i>to walk before God, </i>who refer all their
actions to him, and, as it were, withdrawing themselves from the sight of men,
present themselves at his judgment-seat. In this way he gives us to understand
that he had endeavored not only to be free from all fault and blame before men..
but also to offer to God a sound and sincere heart. Whichever of these senses is
adopted, he testifies that it is only when we consider that we have to deal with
God, who searcheth the heart, and from whose eyes nothing is hidden, that we
will observe his law aright. This concluding clause may also be a form of
protestation; as if the Prophet had said, Lord, thou art the best witness of the
fidelity with which I have kept thy law, for nothing is hidden from thee. But he
seems rather to have intended to intimate that the principle of his holy living,
was his having consecrated his life to God, and having kept his thoughts fixed
on the diverse presence.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

fe38</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> near into thy
presence.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist repeats the same
sentiment which has already come under our notice &#8212; that his chief desire,
and what he, most of all pressed after, regarding everything else as of
secondary importance, was to make progress in the study of the divine law. By
the word <i>cry </i>he denotes earnestness. I am anxious, as if he had said,
above all things, and am chiefly inflamed with this desire, (even as it is just
and reasonable,) that the light of understanding by which we excel the lower
animals, and approach very near to God, may be preferred by me to all earthly
advantages. The expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to thy
word</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>may be understood in two ways. It
may denote that David besought God to impart to him understanding according to
his promise; or, as some explain it, it may intimate that he desired to have his
mind framed according to the rule of God's word, so that he might :not be wise
otherwise than according to the doctrine of the law. This last sense would not
be inappropriate, did not these words in the following verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Deliver me according to thy
word</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>present an objection to such an
interpretation. Having no doubt that these two sentences have a corresponding
meaning &#8212; though at first. sight it is more specious to understand David
as praying to be made wise according to the rule of the law &#8212; I rather
incline to the other sense, That he beseeches God to endue him with
understanding, in fulfillment of his promise. And whilst God liberally promises
all blessings to his people, to enlighten them by his Spirit, that they may
excel in true and sound wisdom, is justly entitled to be ranked among the chief
of his promises. This doctrine is profitable to us in many ways. In the first
place we are taught that nothing is more to be desired than to have God guiding
us by his light, that we may not be like brute beasts. In the second place we
are taught that this is the peculiar gift of the Holy Spirit; for it would have
been in vain for David to have besought. God to bestow upon him that which he
had naturally in himself, or which he might have attained by his own
painstaking. In the third place, what I have said concerning the promise is to
be attended to, to the end the faithful may not hesitate to offer themselves to
God to be enlightened by Him, who declares that he will be the guide of the
blind, and who refuses not to be a master and teacher of little ones and of the
humble.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>170.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let my prayer come into thy
presence.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>After having made supplication
that the gift of right understanding might be imparted to him, the Psalmist now
implores God for deliverance, by which he acknowledges that lie was continually
involved in multiplied dangers from which he found it impossible to escape,
unless God stretched forth his hand from heaven to his aid. We know, indeed,
that whenever any distress was pressing hard behind him, he called upon God for
succor; but as he does not here specify any particular distress, I have no doubt
that, in commending his life in general terms to the protection of God, he
thought again and again how he was shut up on every side by innumerable deaths,
from which lie could not escape if God did not prove his continual deliverer.
But this is an inestimable comfort to us, that God assures us that in all
dangers he will be ready and prepared to help
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>171.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My lips shall speak
praise.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David now shows in another way
than in the preceding verse, how high a privilege lie accounted it to be
admitted by God among the number of His disciples, and to profit aright in His
school, by declaring that, if so privileged, he will hasten forward to render
thanks to him with fluent tongue. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[bn</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
naba, </i>which he employs, is a metaphor taken from the bubbling up of
fountains, and accordingly it signifies not simply <i>to speak, </i>but to pour
forth speech copiously. As therefore he a little before showed the earnestness
of his desire by praying, so now he affirms that his rejoicing will bear
testimony that he desires nothing more than to be thoroughly imbued with
heavenly truth. He again confirms the doctrine, That the way by which we become
truly wise is, first by submitting ourselves to the Word of God, and not
following our own imaginations; and, secondly, by God's opening our
understanding and subduing it to the obedience of his will. He here joins
together both these truths &#8212; namely, that when God has set before us His
law, from which we are to learn what, ever is profitable for our welfare, He, at
the same time, teaches us inwardly. It were not enough to have our ears stricken
with the outward sound, did not God illuminate our minds by the Spirit of
understanding, and correct our obduracy by the Spirit of docility. As the labor
of teachers is to no purpose until virtue and efficacy has been given to it.. so
it is also to be noticed that such as are truly taught of God, are not led away
from the law and the Scriptures by secret revelations, like some fanatics, who
think that they linger still at their A B C, unless disdainfully trampling under
foot the Word of God, they fly away after their own foolish
fancies.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>172.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My tongue shall speak of thy
word.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here the Psalmist says, that when
he shall have profited in God's law he will also employ himself in teaching it
to others. This order is undoubtedly to be observed, That divine truth take root
in our hearts before we engage in the work of teaching it to others. Yet every
man, according to the measure of his faith, ought to communicate to his brethren
what he has received, that the doctrine, whose use and fruit God 'would have to
be displayed for the common edification of the Church, may not be buried. There
is added the reason which ought to stir up all the godly to declare the law of
God &#8212; namely, because by this means righteousness is spread abroad through
the whole world. When the Prophet honors the commandments of God with the title
of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he does not simply express his approbation of them, but he indirectly shows,
that, until this rule bear sway in governing mankind, the whole world is one
scene of sad and horrible confusion. Yet, let my readers judge whether the word
<i>answer </i>or <i>witness, </i>which the Hebrew verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hn[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>anah, </i>properly signifies, is not more suitable in this place than
<i>speak; </i>bringing out this sense &#8212; " My tongue shall bear witness or
answer to thy word; because the true knowledge of righteousness is to be sought
only in the word;" but in that case, it will be necessary to supply the letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lamed, in </i>the word

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let thy hand be to succor
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As he had devoted himself to the
doctrine of the law, David requests that the hand of God may be stretched forth
for his aid. Farther, by these words he declares, that those who yield
themselves to God to be governed by His word have continually need of His help.
The more sincerely any individual studies to be a good man, so much the more
numerous are the ways in which Satan troubles him, and so much the more are the
enemies multiplied who molest him on all sides. But when God sees those who once
embraced the truth of his word remaining steadfast in their resolution, he is so
much the more inclined to aid them. By the word <i>choose </i>in the second
clause, the Psalmist has expressed that nothing had hindered him from devoting
himself to the law of God. No man will apply this mind to the love of the law
without a great struggle, since the thoughts of every man are drawn away to a
variety of objects, by the depraved affections of the flesh. This choosing then
spoken of shows that it is not through ignorance or an inconsiderate zeal that.
the children of God desire above all things heavenly doctrine; but as they
partake of the flexibility or pliancy of mind common to men, and feel the
various impulses of the flesh, they purposely subdue their minds to the
obedience of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>174.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have longed for thy salvation,
O Jehovah!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although all men desire to be
in happy circumstances, and no man avowedly repudiates God's favor; yet so
confused and uncertain are the ideas which they entertain of that in which a
life of happiness or propriety consists, that very few are to be found directing
their aspirations to God. Some are carried away by their own ambition, some are
wholly possessed with avarice, and others burn with lust, all imagining, that
the farther they recede from God, everything will prosper so much the better
with them. In short, in proportion as each man is desirous to be safe, in the
same proportion does he provoke the anger of God, by seeking the means of his
safety in all directions. The construction in the Hebrew text denotes
steadfastness, or constancy of desire; for literally it is, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">He Had <i>longed for the salvation
of God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and not that he only at the
present time began to long for it. He next expresses the manner in which we are
patiently to long for salvation; which is, by seeking consolation and relief in
all our calamities from the word of God; for whoever does not comfort himself by
a reliance on the grace promised in the word, will quail at the slightest
assault made upon him. The Prophet then wisely kept his thoughts close upon the
divine word, that he might not be turned away from hoping for the salvation of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>175.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let my soul live and let it
praise thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As the verbs are in the
future tense, <i>shall live, shall praise, </i>this sentence may be expounded
thus: Lord, when thou shalt have bestowed life upon me, I will endeavor, by
celebrating thy praises, to show that I am not ungrateful. If this sense is
approved, the sentence will be a kind of rejoicing, in which the Prophet,
depending upon the divine promises, confidently proclaims, that his life will
continue in safety. And, certainly, although our life is hidden under the shadow
of death, we may, nevertheless, boast that it is safe, because God is its
faithful guardian; and this assured confidence proceeds from his quickening
grace, which is offered to us in his word. Yet, as the majority of Commentators
translate these words in the optative mood, let us follow the more generally
received interpretation, which is, that David in asking to have his life
prolonged, shows, at the same time, that the end for which he desired to live
was, that he might exercise himself in singing the praises of God, even as it is
said in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
114:18, "We<i> </i>who shall remain in life shall praise Jehovah." In the second
clause it would be harsh to understand the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgments</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of the commandments, to which it does not properly belong to give help. It
seems then, that the Prophet, perceiving himself liable to numberless calamities
&#8212; even as the faithful, by reason of the unbridled license of the wicked,
dwell in this world as sheep among wolves, &#8212; calls upon God to protect him
in the way of restraining, by his secret providence, the wicked from doing him
harm. It is a very profitable doctrine, when things in the world are in a state
of great confusion, and when our safety is in danger amidst so many and varied
storms, to lift up our eyes to the judgments of God, and to seek a remedy in
them. As, however, in this Psalm the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgments</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is commonly referred to God's commandments, we may also fitly interpret it
of them in this place, so that the Prophet attributes to the word of God the
office and charge of giving succor; for God does not feed us with delusive
promises, but, whenever an emergency arises, confirms and ratifies his word by
giving some palpable manifestation of the operation of his hand. Thus, when the
Prophet calls the divine law to his help, lie pronounces a singular encomium
upon the efficacy of the divine word. If any would prefer expounding the
sentence of the keeping of the law, I offer no objections. In this sense it is
as if the Prophet had said, &#8212; O Lord, let the uprightness which I have
practiced, and the zeal with which I have employed myself in keeping thy
commandments, be a defense to me.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>176.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have wandered like a
lost sheep.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He is not to be understood
as here confessing his sins, &#8212; an opinion erroneously held by many,
&#8212; as if he had been drawn into the trails of Satan; for this is
inconsistent with the second clause, in which he denies that he had forgotten
God's law. It is a poor solution of this difficulty to say, that:, previous to
the time of his calling, he was a wandering sheep, but that from the time of his
calling he was devoted to godliness &#8212; or that in straying he was withheld
by some godly affection from utterly casting off the fear of God; for the same
time is undoubtedly referred to in both clauses. Again it is easy to gather,
that the two clauses of this verse ought to be connected together by
<i>although, </i>or <i>notwithstanding, </i>or some other such particle, as the
Latins call adversative,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe39</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as if the Prophet had said, Although I
have wandered about like a lost sheep, yet I have not forgotten the law of God.
His meaning, I conceive, is, that he wandered, because, being chased by the
force and violence of his enemies, he transported himself from place to place in
great fear, in quest of retreats in which he might hide himself. We know for
certain, that David was so hunted that in his exile he could nowhere find a
secure place. This similitude would therefore very properly apply to him,
because, although driven away and hunted after by his persecutors, he yet never
turned aside from the law of God. Moreover, as the wolves pursued him
everywhere, he prays God to bring him back and give him a place of safety and
tranquillity, that he may at length cease from any longer wandering hither and
thither, and being as a vagabond.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe40</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He had a very good ground for believing
that he would be heard in the fact, that although provoked by manifold wrongs he
yet never swerved from the fear of God &#8212; a statement which, however, ought
to be referred rather to the general course of his life than to particular acts.
Although when he fell into adultery he continued for a time in a state of
insensibility, yet it cannot be denied that in his adversities he was restrained
by a holy patience, so as to persevere in following after
righteousness.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

calumniously charged him with crimes of which he was altogether innocent. If a
different supposition is preferred, the language will be a simple and general
complaint against false reports. This Psalm, and the immediately subsequent
fourteen, are called </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Psalms of

agreed upon, even among the Hebrew doctors. Some conceive that there were

Babylonish captivity</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe43</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; an interpretation which is
altogether forced; for it is manifest that the greater part of these Psalms were

while he was alive and on the throne. Others think that the word <i>ascents

Psalm is not expressed, but the style of it throughout presents David to our
view. Although, therefore, I cannot positively affirm, yet I am rather inclined
to think that it was composed by him. Nor will it be improper, in my judgment,
to explain it as if his name had been mentioned in the inscription. This, then,
being granted, I would observe that although David, when in this verse he
affirms that the Lord had heard him, gives thanks to him, yet his chief purpose
was to set forth, in the form of complaint, how wickedly and cruelly Saul's
flatterers employed all their ingenuity and power to accomplish his destruction.
He, however, sets out with an expression of his gratitude to God, telling us
that he had not called upon Him in vain; and he does this, that by his own
example he might encourage others, especially when oppressed with adversity, to
confidence in prayer. Men, it is true, have need of God's help every moment; but
there is not a more suitable season for seeking him than when some great danger
is immediately menacing us. It is therefore worthy of notice, that he was heard
when, constrained and shut up by tribulation, he betook himself to the
protection of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Jehovah! deliver my soul

points out the kind of his affliction, declaring that he was loaded with false
accusations. In charging his enemies with lying and falsehood, he asserts his
own innocence of the crimes which they slanderously imputed to him. His
complaint therefore amounts to this, that as he was conscious of having
committed no fault, he was assaulted <i>by </i>the wicked contrary to all law,
human and divine, and that they brought him into hatred without his having given
them any occasion for such injurious treatment. Deceitful tongues assault good
and simple people in two ways' they either circumvent them by wiles and snares,
or wound their reputation by calumnies. It is of the second way that the Prophet
here complains. Now if David, who was endued with such eminent virtue, and free
from every mark of disgrace, and far removed from every <i>wicked </i>action,
was yet assailed with contumely, is it to be wondered at if the children of God
in the present day labor under false accusations, and that when they have
endeavored to conduct themselves uprightly they are yet in reported of? As they
have the devil for their enemy, it is indeed impossible for them to escape being
loaded with his lies. Yea, we see that slanderous tongues did not spare even the
Son of God &#8212; a consideration which should induce us to bear the more
patiently our condition, when the wicked traduce us undeservedly; since it is
certain that we have here described the common lot of the whole

of his enemies by asserting that they were so wickedly inclined as to be driven
to evil speaking when they saw no prospect of deriving any advantage from such a
course of conduct. He however seems to express more than this, &#8212; he seems
farther to intimate, that after they have poured forth all the venom of their
calumnies, their attempts will nevertheless be vain and ineffectual. As God is
the maintainer of the innocence of his servants, David, inspired with hope from
this truth, rises up against them with heroic courage, as if about to triumph
over the whole crowd of his
calumniators,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe51</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> reproaching them for doing nothing else
than betraying an impotent passion for evil speaking, which God at length would
cause to recoil upon their own heads. It is a consideration well fitted to
assuage the grief of all the godly, when their good name is unrighteously
wounded by calumniators, that such malicious characters will gain nothing
thereby in the end, because God will disappoint their
expectation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

that, without deriving any advantage from it, they were impelled by an unbridled

here which he did not experience in his own person, it may be inferred that if
it behoved him and men of a similar character to be assailed by their enemies

that he was doomed to linger for a long time among a perverse people; his
condition resembling that of some wretched individual who is compelled to live

<i>Kedar, </i>by which term the Ishmaelites are unquestionably intended, I have
no doubt that <i>Mesech </i>is to be understood of the Arabians who were their
neighbors. If any one is of opinion that the Mesechites obtained this name from
their dexterity in shooting with the bow, I will make no objections, provided it
is admitted that the Prophet &#8212; as if he had been confined within a country
of robbers &#8212; expresses the irksomeness of an uncomfortable and an annoying
place of residence. Although he names the Arabians, yet under the terms employed
he speaks metaphorically of his own countrymen, just as he elsewhere applies the
appellation of Gentiles to the corrupt and degenerate
Jews.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe56</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><b> </b>But here, with the view of
putting still more dishonor upon his enemies, he has purposely selected the name
by which to designate them from some of the savage and barbarous nations whose
horrible cruelty was well known to the Jews. From these words we are taught,
that scarcely a more distressing evil can befall the people of God, than for
them to be placed in circumstances which, notwithstanding their living a holy
and an inoffensive life, they yet cannot escape the calumnies of venomous
tongues. It is to be observed, that although David was living in his own
country, he yet was a stranger in it, nothing being more grievous to him than to
be in the company of wicked men. Hence we learn that no sin is more detestable
to God, by whose Spirit David spake, than the false accusations which shamefully
deface the beauty of God's Church, and lay it waste, causing it to differ little
from the dens of robbers, or other places rendered infamous from the barbarous
cruelty of which they are the scene. Now if the place where the uprightness of
good men is overwhelmed by the criminations of lying lips is to the children of
God converted into a region of miserable exile, how could they have pleasure, or
rather, how could they fail to feel the bitterest sorrow, in abiding in a part
of the world where the sacred name of God is shamefully profaned by horrible
blasphemies, and his truth obscured by detestable lies? David exclaims,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Alas for

brethren and a bastard race of Abraham, he was wrongfully molested and tormented

Church of Rome, religion is dishonored by all manner of disgraceful imputations,
faith torn in pieces, light turned into darkness, and the majesty of God exposed
to the grossest mockeries, it will certainly be impossible for those who have
any feeling of true piety within them to lie in the midst of such pollutions
without great anguish of spirit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>

deliberate malice, set themselves to make war upon the good and unoffending. To
the same purpose he adds immediately after, that his heart was strongly inclined
to seek after peace, or rather, that he was wholly devoted to it, and had tried
every means in order to win their favor, but that the implacable cruelty of
their disposition invariably impelled them to do him mischief. When he says,
<i>I peace, </i>it is an abrupt, yet not an obscure expression, implying that he
had not done them any injury or wrong which could give occasion for their hatred
there having been always peace on his part. He even proceeds farther, asserting,
that when he saw them inflamed with resentment against him, he endcavourcd to
pacify them, and to bring them to a good understanding; for <i>to speak, </i>is
here equivalent to offering conditions of peace in an amicable spirit, or to
treating of reconciliation. From this it is still more apparent, how savage and
brutal was the pride of David's enemies, since they disdained even to speak with
him &#8212; to speak with a man who had deserved well at their hands, and who
had never in any respect injured them. We are taught by his example, that it is
not enough for the faithful to abstain from hurting others: they must, moreover,
study to allure them by gentleness, and to bend them to good will. Should their
moderation and kindness be rejected, let them wait in patience, until God at
length show himself from heaven as their protector. Let us, however, remember,
that if God does not immediately stretch forth his hand in our behalf, it is our
duty to bear the wearisomeness occasioned by delay, like David, whom we find in
this Psalm giving, thanks to God for his deliverance, while, at the same time,
as if worn out with the weariness of waiting for it, he bewails the long
oppression to which he had been subjected by his enemies.</font><br></div>

</i>The inspired writer, whoever he was, seems, in the opening of the Psalm, to
speak in the person of an unbelieving man. As God prevents his believing people
with his blessings, and meets them of his own accord, so they, on their part,
immediately east their eyes directly upon him. What then is the meaning of this
unsettled looking of the Prophet, who casts his eyes now on this side and now on
that, as if faith directed him not to God? I answer, that the thoughts of the
godly are never so stayed upon the word of God as not to be carried away at the
first impulse to some allurements; and especially when dangers disquiet us, or
when we are assailed with sore temptations, it is scarcely possible for us, from
our being so inclined to the earth, not to be moved by the enticements presented
to us, until our minds put a bridle upon themselves, and turn them back to God.
The sentence, however, may be explained as if expressed in a conditional form.
Whatever we may think, would the Prophet say, all the hopes which draw us away
from God are vain and delusive. If we take it in this sense, he is not to be
understood as relating how he reasoned with himself, or what he intended to do,
but only as declaring, that those lose their pains who, disregarding God, gaze
to a distance all around them, and make long and devious circuits in quest of
remedies to their troubles. It is indeed certain, that in thus speaking of
himself, he exhibits to us a malady with which all mankind are afflicted; but
still, it will not be unsuitable to suppose, that he was prompted to speak in
this manner from his own experience; for such is the inconstancy natural to us,
that so soon as we are smitten with any fear, we turn our eyes in every
direction, until faith, drawing us back from all these erratic wanderings,
direct us exclusively to God. All the difference between believers and
unbelievers in this respect is, that although all are prone to be deceived, and
easily cheated by impostures, yet Satan bewitches unbelievers by his
enchantments; whereas, in regard to believers, God corrects the vice of their
nature, and does not permit them to persevere in going astray. The meaning of
the Prophet is abundantly obvious, which is, that although all the helps of the
world, even the mightiest, should offer themselves to us, yet we ought not to
seek safety anywhere but in God; yea, rather, that when men shall have long
wearied themselves in hunting after remedies, now in one quarter and now in
another, they will at length find. from experience, that there is no assured
help but in God alone. By the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mountains</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>the Prophet means whatever is great or excellent in the world; and the
lesson he teaches is, that we ought to account all such favor as
nothing.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Farther, these two verses ought to be
read connectedly, bringing out this sense: When I shall have lifted up my eyes
to the mountains, then I will at length experience that I have fallen into a
rash and unprofitable mistake, until I direct them to God alone, and keep them
fixed upon him. It is at the same time to be observed, that God in this place is
not in vain honored with the title of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Creator of heaven and
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>it being intended hereby tacitly
to rebuke the ingratitude of men, when they cannot rest contented with his
power. Did they in good earnest acknowledge him as Creator, they would also be
persuaded, that as he holds the whole world in his hand, and governs it as
seemeth good in his sight, he is possessed of infinite power. But when, hurried
away by the blind impetuosity of their passions, they have recourse to other
objects besides him, they defraud him of his right and empire. In this way ought
we to apply this title of God to the case in hand. The amount is, that whilst we
are naturally more anxious than is needful in seeking alleviation and redress to
our calamities, especially when any imminent danger threatens us, yet we act a
foolish and mistaken part in running up and down through tortuous mazes: and
that therefore we ought to impose a restraint upon our understandings, that they
may not apply themselves to any other but God alone. Nor is the opinion of those
unsuitable, who think that the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">la</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
el, </i>which we translate <i>to, </i>namely,

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will not suffer thy foot

to recall the faithful to the right path, and to defeat the influence of all the
allurements which are wont to distract their minds, affirms that whatever
advantages worldly men are accustomed to desire or hope for from the world, true
believers will find abundantly and at hand in God alone. He not only attributes
power to God, but also teaches that He is so affectioned towards us, that he
will preserve us in all respects in perfect safety. As often as the power of God
is extolled, there are many who immediately reply, It is very true that he can
do such and such things if he is so inclined, but we do not certainly know what
is his intention. In this passage, therefore, God is exhibited to the faithful
as their guardian, that they may rest with assured confidence on his providence.
As the Epicureans, in imagining that God has no care whatever about the 'world,
extinguish all piety, so those who think that the world is governed by God only
in a general and confused manner, and believe not that he cherishes with special
care each of his believing people, leave men's minds in suspense, and are
themselves kept in a state of constant fluctuation and anxiety. In short, never
will the hearts of men be led in good earnest to call upon God, until a
persuasion of the truth of this guardianship is deeply fixed in their minds. The
Psalmist declares that the purpose for which God is our keeper, is, that he may
hold us up. The Hebrew word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fwm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mot, </i>which is here used, signifies both <i>a sliding </i>or <i>falling,
</i>and <i>a trembling </i>or <i>staggering. </i>Now, although it often happens
that the faithful stagger, yea, are even ready to fall altogether, yet as God
sustains them by his power, they are said to stand upright. And as amidst the
many dangers which every moment threaten us, it is difficult for us to get rid
of all anxiety and fear, the Prophet at the same time testifies, that God keeps
watch unceasingly over our safety.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>

will not slumber nor sleep.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe64</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>To recall each individual to the
consideration of the common covenant, he represents the Divine providence as
extending to the whole body of the Church. In order that each of us for himself
may be assured that God will be gracious to him, it behoves us always to begin
with the general promise made to all God's people,. This form of expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he will not slumber nor
sleep</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>would be improper in other
languages, according to the idiom of which it should rather be, <i>He will not
sleep, yea, he will not slumber: </i>but when the Hebrews invert this order,
they argue from the greater to the less. The sense then is, that as God never
slumbers even in the smallest degree, we need not be afraid of any ham befalling
us while he is asleep. The design of the Prophet is now obvious. To persuade
true believers that God has a special care of each of them in particular, he
brings forward the promise which God made to the whole people, and declares God
to be the guardian. of his Church, that from this general principle, as from a
fountain, each might convey streams to himself. Accordingly immediately after,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19C105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
121:5,) addressing himself to each in particular, he repeats,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah is thy
keeper</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that no person might hesitate to
apply to himself that which belonged to the whole community of Israel. Besides,
God is called </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a defense at the
right hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>to teach us that it is not
necessary for us to go far in seeking him, but that he is at hand, or rather
stands at our side to defend
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The sun shall not smite thee
by day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these forms of expression the
Psalmist magnifies the advantages which result to us from our having God present
with us; and, by the figure synecdoche, under one particular, he declares in
general that the faithful shall be safe from all adversities, defended as they
are by Divine power. The language is metaphorical, the cold of night and the
heat of day denoting all kind of inconveniences. The sense then is, that
although God's people may be subject in common with others to the miseries of
human life, yet his shadow is always at their side to shield them from thereby
receiving any harm. The Prophet does not, however, promise the faithful a
condition of such felicity and comfort as implies an exemption from all trouble;
he only, for the purpose of assuaging their sorrows, sets before them this
consolation &#8212; that being interested in the Divine layout, they shall be
secure from all deadly harm; a point which he unfolds more distinctly in the
following verses, where he tells us that God will so keep his own people from
all evils, as to maintain their life in safety. The statement in the text before
us is indeed general, but he afterwards specifies the chief parts of human
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah will keep thy going
out and thy coming in.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The sense is,
Whatever thou shalt undertake or engage in during thy life shall come to a happy
and successful termination. God no doubt directs by his Holy Spirit the,
deliberations of his servants; but it appears to me, that this passage is rather
to be referred to prosperous issues. If, however, any one would give it a more
extended meaning I have no objection. It is enough for me to embrace that sense
which is indisputably certain and solid, That God will be the continual guide of
his people, so that stretching out his hand to them he will conduct them
according to their hearts' desire from the beginning even to the end. Farther,
it is of importance to mark the reason why the Prophet repeats so often what he
had briefly and in one word expressed with sufficient plainness. Such repetition
seems at first sight superfluous; but when we consider how difficult it is to
correct our distrust, it will be easily perceived that he does not improperly
dwell upon the commendation of the divine providence. How few are to be found
who yield to God the honor of being a keeper, in order to their being thence
assured of their safety, and led to call upon him in the midst of their perils!
On the contrary, even when we seem to have largely experienced what this
protection of God implies, we yet instantly tremble at the noise of a leaf
falling from a tree, as if God had quite forgotten us. Being then entangled in
so many unholy misgivings, and so much inclined to distrust, we are taught from
the passage that if a sentence couched in a few words does not suffice us, we
should gather together whatever may be found throughout the whole Scriptures
concerning the providence of God, until this doctrine-" That God always keeps
watch for us" &#8212; is deeply rooted in our hearts; so that depending upon his
guardianship alone we may bid adieu to all the vain confidences of the
world.</font><br></div>

often told Moses, that his Sanctuary would one day have a certain and fixed
place of abode; yet from the time of Moses, for the space of more than a
thousand years, the Ark of the Covenant had been carried about from place to
place, as if it had been in a state of pilgrimage. At length it was revealed to
David, that mount Zion was the spot where God would have his ark to be settled,
and his temple built. Now, as David himself received this revelation with
exceeding great joy, so he affirms that he was glad to find the whole people
with one consent agreeing thereto. This circumstance has not been duly
considered, and the consequence is, that interpreters have given the unhappy
translation&#8212;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I was glad with
those that said to me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Such a rendering,
however, only renders the sense a little obscure; but the translation of the
Septuagint and the Vulgate, which puts upon the second verb of the verse a
neuter signification, entirely vitiates the meaning, <i>I was glad in the things
which, were said to me. </i>I indeed admit that literally the reading
is&#8212;<i>I was</i> <i>glad in those who said to me; </i>but it is no uncommon
thing for the letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
beth, </i>which commonly signifies <i>in, </i>to be resolved into the adverb of
time <i>when; </i>and here the scope of the text requires such a rendering.
David testifies that he felt in his heart a double joy on observing that the
whole people concurred in yielding obedience to the oracle which declared mount
Zion to be the place which God had chosen for his solemn worship. By this
example we are taught, that our joy, in like manner, should be doubled, when God
by his Holy Spirit not only frames each of us to the obedience of his word, but
also produces the same effect upon others, that we may be united together in the
same faith. So stubborn and rebellious is human nature, that the great majority
of mankind invariably murmur against God whenever he speaks. We have, therefore,
no small ground for rejoicing when all harmoniously rank themselves with us on
the side of God. Such as translate, <i>with those who said to me, </i>deduce
this meaning: I take delight in the company of those who allure me to the
service of God, and offer themselves to me as companions, that we may go to the
sanctuary together. But from the second verse it will be still more obvious,
that the joy of which David speaks proceeded from his seeing the people, with
the ready obedience of faith, giving their consent to the utterance of the
heavenly oracle, respecting the spot chosen to be the lawful and permanent scat
of the ark of the covenant. For it immediately follows
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Our feet shall be standing
within thy gates, O Jerusalem!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In the
Hebrew text the verb is indeed in the past tense, which it would not be
unsuitable to retain; but as it makes. little <i>difference </i>as to the
meaning whether the one reading or the other is adopted, I have no difficulty in
leaving my readers to their own <i>choice. </i>David rehearses the language in
which all the godly in common expressed themselves &#8212; that they should at
length stand with sure footing in Jerusalem, because it was the will of God
there to establish his Sanctuary, which hitherto had often changed its lodgings,
and had been carried from place to place. By such a pilgrimage state of the ark,
God reminded the people that he had not without cause spoken by Moses what I
have a little ago adverted to. Thus, whenever the ark of the covenant was
conveyed from one place to another, God thereby stirred up the hearts of his
servants to desire and pray that a certain settled place might be appointed to
it. Moreover, this fixing of its seat was not a matter of small moment. As while
it was frequently changing its abode, the faith of the people hung in suspense,
so after God had chosen for it a permanent residence, he by this testified more
unequivocally that he would be the ever, lasting and unchangeable protector of
his people. It is, therefore, not surprising to find the faithful gratefully
acknowledging that their feet, which had hitherto been wont to run from place to
place, should henceforth stand steadfast within the gates of Jerusalem. The ark,
it is true, dwelt a long time in Shiloh,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;090103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 1:3,) but God having made no promise concerning that place, it could not
be the permanent abode of that symbol of the divine presence. On the contrary,
since, as we shall see on Psalm 132:14, it was said of mount Zion &#8212; "This
is my rest for ever," the faithful, depending upon that promise, confidently
boast that their feet shall hereafter be at rest and stand firm. Farther, as

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jerusalem is built as a
city.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here David begins to celebrate<i>
</i>the praises of Jerusalem<i>; </i>and he does this with the design of
encouraging the people to persevere with uniform steadfastness in their
obedience. It was of great importance for the minds of the godly, instead of
being drawn hither and thither, to be kept constantly fixed on that city<i>,
</i>which was the bond of a holy unity. When the people came to be divided into
two bodies, that was the commencement<i> </i>of melancholy devastation. It is
not surprising, then, to find David commending with such earnestness the place
which God had chosen, knowing, as he did, that the prosperity of the Church
depended upon the children of Abraham worshipping God there in purity, according
to the appointed observances of the law; and next, upon their acknowledging the
royal seat which the same God had erected there by his own authority, and had
taken under his own protection<i>. </i>When it is said that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jerusalem is built as a
city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it is not to be understood as
referring only to the walls, or towers, or ditches of that city, but chiefly to
the good order and holy polity by which it was distinguished, although I allow
that there is some allusion to its ancient state. Salem, indeed, had been a
noted town even from the beginning; but when God selected it to be the head of
the kingdom, it changed its appearance, and in a manner its nature, so that then
it began to deserve the name of a well-regulated city. At first sight it may
seem a poor commendation to call Jerusalem a city; but it is to be observed that
it is here exhibited as it were standing alone in the whole world &#8212; taking
the precedence of all other cities, which will in vain attempt to equal it.
David, certainly, in thus speaking, does not intend to divest other cities of
the rank to which they may be entitled, but he raises Jerusalem higher, that it
may appear conspicuous above them all, even as we find Isaiah,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
2:2,) when speaking of mount Zion, asserting that it "shall<i> </i>be
established in the top of the mountains, and. shall be exalted above the hills."
In that passage the Prophet, to magnify this little hill, brings down the
loftiest mountains of the world, that they may not obscure its glory. In like
manner David here affirms that Jerusalem is compacted as a city, to induce the
faithful, instead of gazing in all directions around them, to rest contented
with the city which God had chosen, since they would nowhere find its equal.
After having humbled all other cities, he shows, in a few words, the excellence
of Jerusalem, representing it as regularly built, or fitly and neatly joined
together in all its parts. Some take these words as expressing literally and
without figure, that its citizens live together in peace and unity; but I see no
impropriety in supposing that they describe, metaphorically, the peaceable state
of a city. Thus the mutual concord which reigns among the citizens of a city,
and by which they are united to each other, is compared to buildings, compacted
together by a skillful and elegant workmanship, so that there is nothing
imperfect, in joined together, or rent, but throughout a beautiful harmony'. By
this David teaches us, that the Church can only remain in a state of safety when
unanimity prevails in her, and when, being joined together by faith and charity,
she cultivates a holy unity.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thither the tribes
ascended.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David here invests Jerusalem
with two titles of honor, calling it the sacred and regularly appointed place
for calling upon the name of God; and next, the royal sea, to which the whole
people were to have recourse for obtaining justice. All our salvation depends
upon these two points; first, that Christ has been given to us to be our priest;
and, secondly, that he has been established king to govern us. This God showed
to his ancient people under figures. The sanctuary erected on mount Zion was
intended to keep their faith fixed upon the spiritual priesthood of Christ; and
in like manner, by the kingdom of David, there was presented to their view an
image of the kingdom of Christ. The Psalmist, therefore, says in the first
place, that the tribes or families of God shall come to Jerusalem; and then he
immediately adds, that there the seat of judgment is erected, on which he and
his posterity will sit. The reason why it was the will of God that there should
be only one temple and one altar was, that the people might not fall away to
various superstitions. David therefore here declares that this place was
appointed by God's own mouth, that all the families of God, or the twelve
tribes, might there assemble from all quarters. To express more plainly how
important it was, for this form of God's worship to be preserved pure and
complete, he says that it </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was for
a testimony</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The noun employed comes
from the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dw[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ud, </i>which signifies <i>to bear witness, </i>or <i>to covenant. </i>Now by
the word in this place is denoted a mutual declaration or agreement between God
and the people. When the tribes shall come thither, says the Prophet
substantially, it will not be at random, because their fancy thus leads them,
but because God by his own mouth invites them. The amount therefore is, that the
holy assemblies which shall be kept at Jerusalem will not be vain and
unprofitable, since God has made a covenant with his people, determining and
appointing that place for his service. Whence we learn, that in judging of the
true temple of God, it is necessary to<i> </i>take into account the doctrine
taught. With respect to<i> </i>the time in which David lived, as God had adopted
the Jewish people, and as it was his will that they should be employed in the
external worship of his name, he prescribed to them a rule from which it was
unlawful for them to deviate. Thus when the faithful assembled on mount Zion, it
was not foolishness or inconsiderate zeal, or the impulse of their own minds,
which brought them thither, as if they resembled those men whom we daily see
inventing for themselves, out of their own heads, numberless kinds of divine
worship; but they were led thither by the command of God, that they might
worship him on mount Zion, by which word the Prophet intimates, that all other
temples are unholy, and all other religions perverse and corrupt, because they
do not correspond with the rule laid down in God's word. He next subjoins the
end of this contract or covenant, which was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the name of God might be
praised.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>And, indeed, as to yield to God
the glory of all good things is the end of our adoption, so it is the end of all
our actions.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For there were set thrones
for judgment.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He means, that the throne
of the kingdom was fixed or established at Jerusalem, or that there it had its
permanent seat. Among that people some order of judgments had always existed.
these, however, had formerly been in an unsettled state, and frequently changed,
but God at length ordained, in the person of David, a new government which
should flow in a continual course; for it was his will that the children of
David should succeed their father in this royal dignity from age to age until
the coming of Christ. The Prophet has a little before spoken of the Temple and
the priesthood; and now he affirms, that this kingdom, which God had erected,
will be firm and stable; in order to distinguish it from all the other kingdoms
of the world, which are not only temporary, but also frail and subject to a
variety of changes. This everlastingness of the kingdom has been expressly
confirmed by other Prophets in various parts of their' writings, and not without
cause; for the object was, to teach the faithful that God would be the guardian
of their welfare only upon the supposition of their remaining under the
protection and defense of David, and that, therefore, if they desired to
continue in safety and to prosper, they should not make for themselves new kings
at their own pleasure<i>, </i>but should live quietly under that kind of
government which God had set up among them. The repetition of the word <i>throne
</i>is emphatic. There, says the Psalmist, the throne of judgment and equity is
erected. Then he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the throne
of the house of David;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for it was the
will of God that the right and prerogative of reigning should continue in
David's posterity, until the true everlastingness of this kingdom should be
manifested in the person of
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

devout worshippers of God to make supplication for the prosperity of the holy
city. The more effectually to stir them up to such exercise, he promises that,
in this way the divine blessing will descend upon them. The reason why he was so
deeply concerned about the prosperity of Jerusalem was, as we have formerly
stated &#8212; and he again repeats the same thing at the end of the
Psalm&#8212;because the welfare of the whole Church was inseparably connected
with that kingdom and priesthood. Now as each of us in particular, were the
whole Church to be involved in ruin, must <i>necessarily </i>perish miserably,
it is not surprising to find David <i>recommending to </i>all the children of
God to cultivate this anxious concern about the Church. If we would order our
prayers aright, let us always begin with pleading that the Lord would be pleased
to preserve this sacred community. Whoever<i>, </i>confining his attention to
his own personal advantage, is indifferent about the common weal, he not only
gives evidence<i> </i>that he is destitute of all true feeling of godliness, but
in vain desires his own prosperity, and will profit nothing by his prayers,
since he does not observe the due
order.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe72</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Similar is the drift of the promise
which is added immediately after:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall prosper that love

form of a wish, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>May those who
love thee prosper</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But the sense in
either case is almost the same. Farther, although the Hebrew verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hl&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shalah, </i>which the Prophet here uses, signifies <i>to live in quietness
</i>or <i>peace, </i>yet as the Hebrew noun for <i>peace, </i>from which it is
derived, is employed by him generally for a joyful and happy condition, I have
no doubt that he here announces in general to all the godly who have the well
being of the Church near their heart, that they shall enjoy the blessing of God
and a prosperous life. This sentence frequently occurs in the Prophecies of
Isaiah, from the 54th chapter to the end of the book (Isaiah 54-66). Hence we
learn that the curse of God rests upon all such as afflict the Church, or plot
and endeavor by any kind of mischief to accomplish its
destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Peace be within thy

the same sentiment, and, therefore, the meaning of the first is gathered from
the second. The term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>signifies nothing else than prosperity. The noun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwl&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shalvah, </i>in the second clause, sometimes signifies <i>rest, </i>but it is
more frequently taken for <i>abundance </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prosperity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.

</i>agrees better with the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>towers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>which occurs at the close of the verse. The amount is, that David prays for
the prosperity of the Church through its whole extent. Moreover, it is to be
noticed, that when he offers supplication for its external prosperity, it is not
to be understood as implying that he was unconcerned about its internal state or
spiritual well being; but under the similitude of
<i>walls,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the sake of my brethren
and neighbors.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He specifies two causes
on account of which he felt a care about the Church, for the purpose of stirring
up, by his example, all the faithful to exercise the same care. These words,
however, seem to contain a tacit contrast. Among the wicked and malicious he
might be the object of suspicion, or, at least, he was in danger of being
slandered; as if, in commending Jerusalem, he had rather an eye to his own
particular advantage than to the public welfare. In order, therefore, to remove
all ground for objecting, that in thus speaking he was craftily endeavoring to
establish his own kingdom, he protests, that he is not influenced by personal
considerations, but by a concern for the whole Church, which he embraced with a
sincere affection of heart. I will speak, says he, O Jerusalem! of thy peace,
not because it will be profitable for me or mine, but because thy prosperity
shall extend itself to all the children of God; for under the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

of God so far from remaining entire would go to ruin unless Jerusalem continued
standing. If then the salvation of our brethren is regarded by us as an object
of importance, if religion is with us a matter of heart-work, we ought, at the
same time, as much as in us lies, to <i>take </i>an interest in the prosperity
of the Church. Whence it follows, that such as are indifferent about her
condition, are no less cruel than impious; for if she is "the<i> </i>pillar and
foundation of truth," the inevitable consequence of her destruction must be the
extinction of true piety. And if the body is destroyed, how can each of the
members fail to be involved in destruction? Farther, this passage teaches us,
that the Church is not an empty title, but must be sought for where the true
religion prevails. Whence it appears, how foolish the Papists are, who,
notwithstanding their having rejected and overthrown the doctrine of the Gospel,
yet mightily boast of the name of the

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I lift my eyes to thee, who
dwellest in the heavens.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is uncertain
at what time, or even by what Prophet, this Psalm was composed. I do not think
it probable that David was its author; because, when he bewails the persecutions
which he suffered in the time of Saul, it is usual with him to inter-pose some
particular references to himself. My opinion, then, rather is, that this form of
prayer was composed for all the godly by some Prophet, either when the Jews were
captives in Babylon, or when Antiochus Epiphanes exercised towards them the most
relentless cruelty. Be this as it may, the Holy Spirit, by whose inspiration the
Prophet delivered it to the people, calls upon us to have recourse to God, when
&#8212; ever wicked men unrighteously and proudly persecute, not one or two of
the faithful only, but the whole body of the Church. Moreover, God is here
expressly called </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God who
dwelleth in the heavens</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>not simply to
teach his people to estimate the divine power as it deserves, but also that,
when no hope of aid is left for them on earth, yea rather, when their condition
is desperate, just as if they were laid in the grave, or as if they were lost in
a labyrinth, they should then remember that the power of God remains in heaven
in unimpaired and infinite perfection. Thus these words seem to contain a tacit
contrast between the troubled and confused state of this world and God's
heavenly kingdom, from whence he so manages and governs all things, that
whenever it pleases him, he calms all the agitations of the world, comes to the
rescue of the desperate and the despairing, restores light by dispelling
darkness, and raises up such as were cast down and laid prostrate on the ground.
This the Prophet confirms by the verb
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lift
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>which intimates, that although all
worldly resources fail us, we must raise our eyes upward to heaven, where God
remains unchangeably the same, despite the mad impetuosity of men in turning all
things here below upside down.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold as the eyes of
servants look to the hand of their masters.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>This similitude is very suitable to the present case. It implies that
without the protection of God true believers have no comfort, are completely
disarmed and exposed to all manner of wrongs, have neither strength nor courage
to resist; in short, that their safety depends entirely upon aid derived from
another. We know how shamefully servants were treated in ancient times, and what
reproaches might be cast upon them, whilst yet they durst not move a finger to
repel the outrage. Being therefore deprived of all means of defending
themselves, the only thing which remained for them to do was, what is here
stated, to crave the protection of their masters. The same explanation is
equally applicable to the case of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>handmaids</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Their condition was indeed shameful and degrading; but there is no reason
why we should be ashamed of, or offended at being compared to slaves, provided
God is our defender, and takes our life under his guardianship; God, I say, who
purposely disarms us and strips us of all worldly aid, that we may learn to rely
upon his grace, and to be contented 'with it alone. It having been anciently a
capital crime for bond-men to carry a sword or any other weapon about them, and
as they were exposed to injuries of every description, their masters were wont
to defend them with so much the more spirit, when any one causelessly did them
violence. Nor can it be doubted that God, when he sees us placing an exclusive
dependence upon his protection, and renouncing all confidence in our own
resources, will as our defender encounter, and shield us from all the
molestation that shall be offered to us. It is, however, certain that we have
here properly the description of a period in which the people of God were
reduced to a state of extreme necessity, and brought even to the brink of
despair. As to the word</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it is very well known to be put
for <i>help.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe74A</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Have mercy upon us, O
Jehovah!</i></font><font face="Palatino"> etc. The Psalmist prosecutes and
confirms the preceding doctrine. He had said that the godly, finding themselves
utterly broken in spirit and cast down, intently directed their eyes to the hand
of God: now he adds that they are filled with reproach. From this we learn that
the wicked not only assaulted them by such ways of violence as suggested
themselves to their minds, but that by their mockery they as it were trampled
under foot the children of God. The repetition of the prayer,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Have mercy upon
us,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which is a sign of vehement and
ardent desire, indicates that they were reduced to the last degree of misery.
When insult is added to wrongs, there is nothing which inflicts a deeper wound
upon well constituted minds. The Prophet therefore complains chiefly of that, as
if it were the consummation of all calamities. He says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rich and proud
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>treated the Church with insolent
triumph; for it commonly happens that those who are elevated hi the world, look
down with contempt upon the people of God. The lustre of their he. hour and
power dazzles their eyes, so that they make no account of God's spiritual
kingdom: yea, the more the wicked prosper and are smiled on by fortune, to the
greater extent does their pride swell, and the more violently does it throw off
its foam. This passage teaches us, that it is no new thing for the Church to be
held in contempt by the children of this world who abound in riches. The epithet
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>proud</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is justly applied to the same persons who are described as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rich</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>for wealth engenders pride of heart. Farther, as we see that in old time the
Church of God was covered with reproaches, and pointed at with the finger of
scorn, we ought not to be discouraged if the world despise us, nor should we
allow our faith to be shaken by the wicked when they assault us with their
scoffs, yea, even defame us with their injurious and insulting language. We must
always bear in mind what is here recorded, that the heart not of one man only,
or of a few, but of the whole Church, was filled not merely with the violence,
cruelty, craft, and other evil doings of the wicked, but also with reproaches
and mockery. It is also to be remembered, that all the loftiness and pride
existing in the world are here represented as in opposition to the Church, so
that she is accounted as nothing better than "the<i> </i>filth of the world and
the offscouring of all things," as the Apostle Paul declares in 1 Corinthians.
4:13. When the same thing happens to us at the present day, let us leave the
wicked to swell with their pride until they burst; and let it suffice us to
know, that we are notwithstanding precious in the sight of God. By the verb
<i>cloy, </i>especially as it is emphatically repeated, the Prophet intended to
express a long continued oppression, which filled the hearts of the godly with
weariness and sorrow. How necessary the lesson taught in this text is in our own
day, it requires no lengthened discussion to demonstrate. We see the Church
destitute of all worldly protection, and lying under the feet of her enemies,
who abound in riches, and are armed with dreadful power. We see the Papists
boldly rising up, and with all their might pouring forth their mockeries against
us and the whole service of God. On the other hand, there are mingled amongst
us, and flying about everywhere, Epicureans, who deride our simplicity. There
are also many giants, who overwhelm us with reproaches; and this baseness has
lasted from the time that the Gospel began to emerge from the corruption's of
Popery even to the present day. What then remains to be done, but that, finding
ourselves environed with darkness on all sides, we seek the light of life in
heaven? and that our soul, although it may be filled to satiety with all kinds
of reproaches, breathe forth prayers to God for deliverance with the importunity
of the famished?</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But for Jehovah, who was on
our side.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some expositors think that
this Psalm describes the very sad and calamitous condition of the Church when
the, residue of the people were carried away into Babylon. This opinion is,
however, without any good foundation for the complaints made, apply with equal
propriety to the persecutions which the Church suffered under the tyranny of
Antiochus Epiphanes. It is another objection to this interpretation, that the
Psalm bears in its inscription the name of David, and historically recounts the
deliverance which the people had obtained from extreme danger by the power of
God. To get quit of this difficulty they observe, that what had not yet come to
pass is described prophetically; but this is a forced conjecture, for the
Prophets usually speak of things to come in a different manner. It is more
probable that David here sets forth a known history, and exhorts the faithful to
reflect upon the divine succor which they had already actually experienced. I
dare not, however, limit what is here spoken to David's time. It is indeed true
that the heathen nations often waged war against the people of God, armed with
such power as to come rushing upon them with the impetuosity of a deluge; but as
David does not specify any particular instance, he is not, I conceive, to be
understood as celebrating only some one deliverance, but in general all the
instances in which God had succoured his Church. The heathen at many different
times, as is well known, rose up against the Church, with such mighty hosts,
that she was brought almost to the verge of destruction. David then represents
as in a mirror the uncertain and changeable condition of the Church, just such
as it had been from the beginning, to teach the faithful that its stability had
not been owing to its own intrinsic strength, but that it had been preserved by
the wonderful grace of God; and to habituate them to call upon God in the midst
of dangers.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But for Jehovah who was on
our side.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is not without cause that
he twice repeats the same sentence. So long as we are in danger our fear is
immoderate; but no sooner are we delivered than we lessen the greatness of our
calamity, and Satan, deceiving us by this artifice, leads us to obscure the
grace of God. Since then, after having been wonderfully preserved by the Lord,
we for the most part devise all sorts of imaginary circumstances, in order to
efface from our minds the remembrance of his grace, David, by introducing the
people as struck with amazement, purposely dwells upon the amplification of the
danger. In these words a bridle is put upon us, to keep us meditating upon our
dangers, lest the sense of God's grace should vanish from our minds. The common
translation, <i>Had not the Lord been on our side, </i>does not sufficiently
express David's meaning; for he affirms that the deliverance and the salvation
of the people proceeded from nothing else than God's succor, and at the same
time shows that this succor was both certain and evident. Two things then are
here to be distinctly noticed; first, that the Lord had been at hand to afford
aid to his servants, and had taken their part; and secondly, that being already
in a desperate condition, they could not by help from any other quarter, or in
another manner, have escaped from danger. Thus we are taught, that men then only
ascribe the glory of their preservation to God, when they are persuaded of his
being so favourably inclined towards them as to defend them and maintain them
safe. In the second clause there is extolled in high terms the infinite power of
God, of which he had given abundant proof in delivering the people, to teach us
that such a manner of preserving does not belong to man. By the noun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;da</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
adam, </i>which when it is collective signifies men in general, David seems to
denote a vast number of enemies. The people of God, as if he had said, had not
to contend merely against a few men, or against one nation, but were assailed by
almost the whole world; it being abundantly manifest that all mankind were the
enemies of the Jews.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he says,

alive,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe76</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he not only expresses barbarous
cruelty, but also disproportion of strength. He describes then in the first
place how violent was the onset of the enemy, and secondly, how feeble and
inadequate the Jews were to withstand them, since these cruel beasts had no need
of swords for slaughter, but without a battle or an effort of strength, could
easily devour that unwarlike and defenceless
flock.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The waters had then
overwhelmed us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He embellishes by an
elegant metaphor the preceding sentiment, comparing the dreadful impetuosity of
the enemies of the Jews to an inundation, which swallows up whatever it meets
with in its overflowing course. And he continues to preserve the character of a
man affrighted. He names </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
waters</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>next
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
torrent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>thirdly,

proud</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or <i>impetuous waters. </i>He
says, <i>over us, </i>and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>over
our soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as if, by presenting the thing
to the eye, he intended to strike terror into the people. And certainly this
impassioned language ought to have all the effect of a graphic representation,
that the faithful might the better feel from what a profound gulf they had been
rescued by the hand of God. He only truly attributes his deliverance to God, who
acknowledges himself to have been lost before he was delivered. The adverb
<i>them </i>is here either demonstrative, as if the Psalmist had pointed to the
thing with the finger, or it is taken for <i>long ago. </i>The former
signification is, however, more suitable to the present
passage.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

godly to a grateful acknowledgment of the divine goodness, and as it were puts
words into their mouth. Here also he shows by another similitude, that it would
have been all over with them had not God succoured them; affirming that they
were delivered not otherwise than if some one had plucked
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the prey from the
teeth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of a wild and cruel beast. Of the
same import is the third similitude, That they were on all sides entrapped and
entangled in the snares of their enemies, even as <i>little birds </i>caught in
the net lie stretched under the hand of the fowler; and that when they were
delivered, it was just as if one should set at liberty birds which had been
taken. The amount is, that the people of God, feeble, without counsel, and
destitute of aid, had not only to deal with blood-thirsty and furious beasts,
but were also ensnared by bird-nets and stratagems, so that being greatly
inferior to their enemies as well in policy as in open force, they were besieged
by many deaths. From this it may be easily gathered that they were miraculously
preserved.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Our help is in the name of

of the Church in all ages that which the faithful had already experienced. As I
interpret the verse, he not only gives thanks to God for one benefit, but
affirms that the Church cannot continue safe except in so far as she is
protected by the hand of God. His object is to animate the children of God with
the assured hope, that their life is in perfect safety under the divine
guardianship. The contrast between the help of God, and other resources in which
the world vainly confides, as we have seen in

<div><font face="Palatino">is to be noticed, that the faithful, purged from all
false confidence, may betake themselves exclusively to his succor, and depending
upon it, may fearlessly despise whatever Satan and the world may plot against
them. The </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>name of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is nothing else than God himself;
yet it tacitly conveys a significant idea, implying that as he has disclosed to
us his grace by his word, we have ready access to him, so that in seeking him we
need not go to a distance, or follow long circuitous paths. Nor is it without
cause that the Psalmist again honors God with the title of Creator. We know with
what disquietude our minds are agitated till they have raised the power of God
to its appropriate elevation, that, the whole world being put under, it alone
may be pre-eminent; which cannot be the case unless we are persuaded that all
things are subject to his will. He did not show once and in a moment his power
in the creation of the world and then withdraw it, but he continually
demonstrates it in the government of the world. Moreover, although all men
freely and loudly confess that God is the Creator of heaven and of earth, so
that even the most wicked are ashamed to withhold from him the honor of this
title, yet no sooner does any terror present itself to us than we are convicted
of unbelief in hardly setting any value whatever upon the help which he has to
bestow.</font><br></div>

125</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As the faithful being mingled in this world with the
ungodly seem to be exposed to all the ills of life in the same manner as other
people, the Prophet, comparing them to Jerusalem, shows that they are defended
by an invincible bulwark. And if God at any time suffer them to be plagued by
the malice of the wicked, he exhorts them to be of good hope. He however at the
same time distinguishes between true and false Israelites, that hypocrites may
not apply to themselves what is here said concerning the safety of the
righteous.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They who confide in Jehovah
are as mount Zion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The present Psalm
differs from the preceding in this &#8212; that while in the other it was said
that the Church </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had been
preserved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>by the power of God, without
any human means, the Holy Spirit, in the one before us, teaches that <i>in the
time to come </i>she shall always continue in <i>perfect </i>safety, because she
is defended by the invincible power of God. When the Church is emblematically
described by the situation of the city of Jerusalem, the design of the Prophet
is to encourage each of the faithful to believe, that the safety promised in
common to all the chosen people belongs to him. But in exhibiting to the eyes<i>
</i>a visible image of the Church, he accommodates himself to the rudeness of
those who, detained by the dulness of the flesh, still continue settled down in
the earth. It ought then, in the first place, to be noticed, that to those who
may not sufficiently apprehend by faith the secret protection of God, the
mountains which environ Jerusalem are exhibited as a mirror, in which they may
see, beyond all doubt, that the Church is as well defended from all perils, as
if it were surrounded on all sides with like walls and bulwarks. Moreover, it is
profitable to know what I have just now touched upon &#8212; that whenever God
speaks to all his people in a body, he addresses himself also to each of them in
particular. As not a few of the promises are extended generally to the whole
body of the Church, so many contemplate them as at a distance, as far removed
from them, and will not presume to appropriate them to themselves. The rule here
prescribed must therefore be observed, which is, that each apply to himself
whatever God promises to his Church in common. Nor does the Psalmist without
cause make Jerusalem a representation of the Church, for the sanctuary of God
and the ark of the covenant were there.</font><br><font face="Palatino">With
respect to the explanation of the words, it is to be observed that the last two
verbs of the first verse may be understood in two ways. They may both be
governed by Jerusalem as the nominative. But some understand the first verb,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fwmy
al</font><font face="Palatino"> al, <i>lo
yimmot,</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> shall not be
removed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>only as spoken of Jerusalem and
the latter verb,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b&ccedil;y</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>yesheb, </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall
abide</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as referring to the faithful, so
that according to this view there is a change of number, which is very common
among the Hebrews &#8212; the singular number,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b&ccedil;y</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>yesheb, </i>being used instead of the plural,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wb&ccedil;y</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>yeshbu. </i>And certainly the sentence might not improperly be translated
thus: <i>They who trust in Jehovah, as mount Zion shall not be removed, shall
dwell for ever, </i>or <i>continue steadfast, </i>for the verb translated <i>to
abide </i>is taken in this sense. We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet,
which is, that although the world is subject to so many and so sudden changes as
almost to put on a new face every moment, and although the faithful are mingled
with and placed in the same external condition as others, yet their safety
continues steadfast under the invincible protection of God. Not that they are
permitted to dwell undisturbed and at ease; but because their safety being under
the guardianship of God is assaulted in vain; at least they can never altogether
fall, although they may stumble. But let us notice that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yjmbh</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
habbtechim, </i>which signifies, <i>those who hope </i>or <i>wait for,
</i>conveys an implicit injunction to steadfastness of faith. Whoever, then,
desires to be sustained by the hand of God, let him constantly lean upon it; and
whoever would be defended by it, let him patiently repose himself under it. When
God suffers us to be often carried hither and thither, or driven about like
chaff by the wind, this comes to pass through our own inconstancy &#8212;
because we prefer fluttering in the air to fixing our minds on the rock of his
help. The similitude employed in the second verse is abundantly plain, teaching
us, that as the continuous chain of mountains round about Jerusalem exhibits the
appearance of walls, so God encompasses the faithful by his power, to ward off
from them all harm.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe79A</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Similar forms of expression are
frequently to be met with in the Scriptures' God often promises to be a wall and
a fore-wall to his people. But David, or whoever was the author of the psalm,
proceeds still farther, showing under the figure of mountains the secret
protection with which God defends his own people, to the end that the ignorant
and feeble-minded who are still held down to the earth by their own dulness of
understanding, aided by the sight of the mountains, may raise their minds
upwards to the conception and contemplation of heavenly
things.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

shall not rest upon the lot of the just.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>This is, as it were, a correction of the preceding sentence. The Psalmist
had said that the hand of God was extended on all sides to defend his Church.
But as we are disposed to draw the divine promises to our own advantage, in the
way of interpreting them as securing our exemption from all trouble, we are here
warned that the guardianship of God does not secure us from being sometimes
exercised with the cross and afflictions, and that therefore the faithful ought
not to promise themselves a delicate and easy life in this world, it being
enough for them not to. be abandoned of God when they stand in need of his help.
Their heavenly Father, it is true, loves them most tenderly, but he will have
them awakened by the cross, lest they should give themselves too much to the
pleasures of the flesh. If, therefore, we embrace this doctrine, although we may
happen to be oppressed by the tyranny of the wicked, we will wait patiently till
God either break their scepter, or shake it out of their hands. It is a sore
temptation, I admit, to see the wicked exercising cruelty in the heritage of the
Lord, and the faithful lying extended beneath their feet; but as God does not
without just reason thus humble his people, they should comfort themselves from
the consideration suggested in the text.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
reason is added why God will not suffer the wicked always to triumph over the
righteous &#8212; namely, lest the just, overcome by temptation, abandon
themselves wholly to sinning, a reason which ought to be carefully marked. Hence
we gather that God, from his willingness to bear with our weakness, moderates
our adversities. Although, then, we may not possess in ourselves a sufficient
amount of fortitude and constancy to enable us to persevere in our duty for a
single moment, yet let this sentiment be present to our minds, That God will
take care that, broken as we may be by afflictions, we shall not forsake his
service. Were he even to afflict us without intermission during the whole course
of our life, the cross is doubtless always profitable to us; for we see how
indomitable is the rebellion of our flesh, and with what vehement impetuosity it
is continually boiling up; yea, rather how it ceases not to kick amidst the very
afflictions by which it ought to be reduced to obedience. So much the more
necessary then is this lesson of instruction &#8212; that the Lord seasonably
sets limits to our temptations, because he knows that we are too feeble to
withstand them. Nor does the Prophet merely say, that the weak are in danger of
failing, but that even the just, who serve God in truth and from the heart, and
who are devoted to the cultivation of a holy life, are in danger of sinking
under the load. However vigorous, then, the fear of God may be in our hearts,
let us remember that we are not endowed with adequate strength for enduring to
the end, unless the Lord have a regard to our infirmity. If the Holy Spirit
makes this declaration concerning the best champions, what will be the case as
to tyroes, who are as yet but imperfectly trained for the combat? It is also
proper to mark the form of speech employed<i> &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lest they stretch forth their
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>by which it is intimated that the
assaults of temptations. are so violent, that the hands of the just, which were
before, as we may say, bound, and whose motions were also framed and regulated
according to the will of God, being now, as it were, let loose, apply themselves
to the commission of sin without
restraint.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Do good, O Jehovah to the
good.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Prophet has already promised
to all the faithful the seasonable help of God; but still he has recourse to
prayer, and that not without cause; for although faith may sustain us, yet, as
our carnal sense and reason are wavering, we ought to mingle prayers for our
confirmation. Let us then follow this rule of the Prophet, who, having exhorted
all the faithful to cherish confidence, teaches them at the same time, that
instead of sitting in listless inactivity, they should betake themselves to God,
earnestly beseeching him by prayer, for what he has bidden them hope for by his
word. And assuredly the importance of using this remedy is apparent from the
consideration, that amidst the darkness of afflictions, the aid of God is not
discerned, but that he rather seems to make no difference between the righteous
and the wicked. Nor does the Psalmist simply pray that God would deal graciously
with the good, he also defines the goodness by which they are characterized, as
what proceeds from sincere affection of heart. It would not be enough for the
children of God to abstain from all wrong-doing, were they not distinguished by
corresponding integrity of heart, or rather did it not govern their whole
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>those who cause to turn

for verbs in that conjugation to be taken in a neuter sense, the, version which
I have followed is probably the correct one. Still, as the active signification
is not less appropriate, I would leave the reader freely to exercise his own
judgment. The meaning is, that God does not always connive at the wickedness of
those who, while boasting of a hollow and counterfeit profession, wander hither
and thither according to their own lust, or even corrupt the simple, and draw
them into the same excess of sinning with themselves. I have no doubt that the
Psalmist here speaks of hypocrites, who are so hardened by temporary impunity,
as to claim to. themselves a place among the holiest of men, because God
exercises forbearance towards them. Not only do we see the good mingled with the
bad in the world, but we also behold on the barn-floor of the Lord the wheat
lying hidden under the chaff and refuse. In this dubious and confused state of
matters, the bad are elated with pride, as if they were among the best of God's
servants. We ought therefore to pray that God would drag them into the light,
and, with the workers of iniquity, thrust them down into the punishment which
they have deserved. The consequence is
that</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which the Prophet desires may be
the privilege of Israel. He does not speak generally of all the race of Abraham,
according to the. flesh; he rather wishes that the Church of God may be purged
of hypocrites, who occupy a place in her, until God lift up his hand to
judgment. On this account I have said, that the peace of the Church springs from
this &#8212; that; God, while executing his just vengeance upon reigned and
counterfeit Israelites, who rend and tear in pieces her bowels, gathers together
the upright in heart, and openly shows by his blessing the fatherly love which
he bears towards them.</font><br></div>

Prophet exhorts the faithful, who had returned from the captivity, to gratitude,
and highly extols the grace displayed in their deliverance, to show them, beyond
all doubt, that they were brought back to their own country by the hand of God,
and not by a fortuitous conjuncture of circumstances, or by the favor of men. In
the second part a prayer is added, that God would perfect his own work which he
had begun. Finally, although there was no immediate prospect of a full
restoration, yet he mitigates the feeling of weariness which delay might
occasion, and assures them, that though at present the seed was watered with
tears, the harvest would be joyous.</font><br></div>

there is no room left for ingratitude. As often as God works by ordinary means,
men, through the malignity of their natures, usually exercise their ingenuity in
devising various causes of the deliverance wrought, in order to darken the grace
of God. But the return of the Jewish people from the Babylonish captivity,
having been a miracle of such splendor as was sufficient to swallow up and
confound all the thoughts of men, it compels us. to own that it was a signal
work of God. This is the reason why the Prophet compares this deliverance to a
dream. "So far,"<i> </i>he materially says, "is<i> </i>any mind from
comprehending this unparalleled benefit of God, that the bare thinking upon it
transports us with amazement, as if it were a dream, and not an event which had
already taken place. What impiety, then, will it be, not to acknowledge the
author of it."<i> </i>Moreover, he does not mean that the faithful were so dull
of understanding as not to perceive that they were delivered by the hand of God,
but only that, judging according to carnal sense and reason, they were struck
with astonishment; and he was apprehensive lest, in reasoning with themselves
about that redemption, as about an ordinary thing, they should make less account
of the power of God than it became them to do. The noun

</i>If, however, we admit what some Hebrew Doctors affirm, that the force of
this particle is to change the future tense into the past, the adverb <i>then

obscure. He would have the people so to rejoice on account of their return, as
not to bury in forgetfulness the grace of God. He therefore describes no
ordinary rejoicing, but such as so fills their minds as to constrain them to
break forth into extravagance of gesture and of voice. At the same time he
intimates that there was good ground for this joy, in which it became the
children of God to indulge, on account of their return to their own land. As
there was at that period nothing more wretched than for them to live in
captivity, in which they were in a manner dispossessed of the inheritance God
had promised them; so there was nothing which ought to have been more desirable
to them than to be restored. Their restoration to their own country having been
therefore a proof of their renewed adoption by God, it is not surprising to find
the Prophet asserting that their mouth was filled with laughter, and their
tongue with exultation. With a similar joy does it become us at the present day
to exult when God gathers together his Church and it is an undoubted evidence
that we are steel-hearted, if her miserable dispersion does not produce in our
minds grief and lamentation. The Prophet proceeds farther, declaring that this
miracle was seen even by the blind; for in that age of the world, as is well
known, the heathen were wandering in darkness like blind men, no knowledge of
God having shone upon them; and yet God's power and operation were so
conspicuous in that event, that they burst forth into the open acknowledgment
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that God had done great things
for his people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>So much the more
shame-fill then was the indifference of the Jews to be accounted, if they did
not freely and loudly celebrate God's grace, which had acquired so much renown
among the unbelieving. The form of speech employed is also to be marked, which
forcibly expresses the idea intended to be conveyed, that the mighty power of
God in this deliverance was known by the Gentiles. In the following verse the
Prophet repeats in his own person, and in that of the Church, the words uttered
by the heathen in the last member of the preceding verse. Let us at least, as if
he had said, put forth a confession corresponding to that which God has extorted
from the unbelieving Gentiles. When he adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they were
glad</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>there is an implied antithesis
between this fresh joy and the long continued sorrow with which they were
afflicted in their captivity. he expressly declares that joy was restored to
them, to enable them the better to estimate the dismal condition from which they
had been extricated.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

O Jehovah! bring back our captivity.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The
second part of the Psalm, as I have said, contains a prayer that God would
gather together the residue of the captives. The Holy Spirit endited this form
of prayer for the Jews who were already come home to their own country, that
they might not forget their poor brethren who were still in exile. All the Jews,
no doubt, had a door opened to them, and perfect liberty granted them, to come
out of the land of their captivity, but the number of those who partook of this
benefit was small when compared with the vast multitude of the people. Some were
kept from returning by fear, and others by sloth and want of courage, on seeing
such perils at hand as they apprehended they had not power to overcome, choosing
rather to lie torpid in their own filthiness, than to undertake the hardship of
the journey. It is probable also that many of them preferred their present ease
and comfort to eternal salvation. What the Prophet Isaiah had foretold was no
doubt fulfilled,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231022&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
10:22,). That although the people were in number as the sand of the sea, yet
only a remnant of them should be saved. Since, then, many openly refused the
benefit when it was offered them, and as there were not; wanting many
difficulties and impediments to be encountered by those who availed themselves
of this liberty granted them by the good pleasure of the
king,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe89</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> so that it was only a few of sounder
judgment and of a more intrepid heart, who dared to move a foot &#8212; and even
they with reluctance, &#8212; it is no wonder that the Prophet requires the
Church still to make supplication to God for the bringing back of the captivity.
Along with this, the state of those who had already returned is also to be
noted; for their land being in the possession of strangers, who were all their
inveterate and sworn enemies, they were no less captives in their own country
than among the Babylonians. It was therefore necessary, on a twofold account,
that the Church should earnestly beseech God to gather together such as were
dispersed; first, that he would give courage to the timid, awaken the torpid,
cause the besotted to forget their pleasures, and stretch forth his hand to be a
guide to all; and, secondly, that he would settle the body of the people who had
returned in liberty and ease.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As to the
similitude which follows, many think the sense to be, that the bringing back of
their captivity prayed for would be as grateful to them as if water should flow
through a desert.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe90</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We know how grievous and painful a thing
it is to travel in a hot country through and sands. The <i>south, </i>is taken
for the wilderness, because the region on the south of Judea was waste and
almost uninhabitable. Yet it seems to me more just to say, that the grace of God
is here magnified, and still more enlarged by the Prophet's comparing it to a
miracle. "Although<i> </i>it is a difficult matter," he substantially says,
"for<i> </i>the dispersed remnant to be again united into one body, yet God, if
he please, can do this, just as he can cause rivers of water to flow through a
parched desert." He, at the same time, alludes to the road intervening between
Judea and Babylon, as appears from the situation of the two countries. Thus the
words will not require any supplement, the meaning being simply this, that the
bringing back of their captivity would be as if a river should run through a
barren and and country. And, certainly, to open up a way for the people who, so
to speak, were swallowed up in a deep gulf, was as if a course had been opened
up for irrigating waters to flow through a
desert.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They who sow in tears shall
reap in joy.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This sentence<i>, </i>in my
opinion, ought not less to be extended to the future than understood of the
past. The carrying away of the Jews into Babylon was to them as a
seed-time;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe91</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> God having, by the prophecy of Jeremiah,
encouraged them to hope for the harvest. Still, it was not without very great
heaviness and anguish of heart that they were dragged into such long continued
captivity. It was, as if in the time of dearth the poor husbandman, who already
experiences the gnawings of hunger, were compelled to abridge himself of his
ordinary food in order to provide for the coming year; and although this is a
hard and distressing case, he is yet moved to sow from the hope of the harvest.
The Jews then, when led into captivity, were, doubtless, no less sorrowful than
he who, in the time of scarcity, casts the precious seed into the ground; but
afterwards a joyful harvest followed, when they were delivered; for the Lord
restored to them gladness, like that which is experienced in a most abundant
increase.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe92</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I, however, also conceive that the
Prophet exhorts the faithful to patience in reference to the future. The
restoration of the Church was not yet completed, and even, for the two reasons
which I have a little before specified, that period was evidently the time of
sowing. Although the edict of the king frankly invited the Jews to return, yet
only a few of many returned, gradually and fearfully, in small companies.
Moreover, those who did so were unkindly and harshly welcomed by their
neighbors, and to so much<i> </i>trouble were they subjected that their former
bondage appeared equally tolerable. Whence we gather, that they had still to
suffer &#8212; the full time of harvest, not having yet arrived; and, therefore,
the Prophet, not without cause, exhorts them strenuously to labor, and to
persevere in the midst of continual difficulties without fainting, until they
found themselves placed in more favorable circumstances. With respect to the
words, some translate.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
meshech, a price; </i>and others, <i>a basket </i>or <i>seed
vessel.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe93</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For the latter translation there
is no foundation. Those who translate <i>price </i>quote in support of their
version that passage in the book of Job:28:18 "The<i> </i>price of wisdom is
above rubies." But as the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mashach, </i>from which this noun is derived, signifies <i>to extend </i>or
<i>to draw out, </i>it may perhaps, both here and in that other place, be more
fitly taken in its proper signification. In the text quoted from Job it is
profound wisdom, and not intellectual acuteness, which is commended, and thus
the extending of wisdom, that is to say, a continual course of wisdom, is, from
its being deeply grounded, better than pearls. In like manner, in the passage
before us, the drawing out of the seed is applied to the husbandmen themselves,
implying, that they extend and prolong their life when they sow. If, however,
the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>price</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is preferred, the sense will be, that when corn is scarce, seed is committed
to the ground with tears, because it is precious and costly. This doctrine
extends still farther. Our life is, in other parts of Scripture, compared to the
seed-time, and as it will often happen that we must sow in tears, it becomes us,
lest sorrow should weaken or slacken our diligence, to raise our minds to the
hope of the harvest. Besides, let us remember that all the Jews who were carried
captives into Babylon did not sow; for as really among them, who had hardened
themselves against God and the Prophets, had despised all threatenings, so they
lost all hope of returning. Those in whom such despair brooded were consumed in
their miseries; but those who were sustained by the promise of God, cherished in
their hearts the hope of harvest, although in a time, of extreme scarcity they
cast their seed into the ground, as it were, at venture. In order then that joy
may succeed our present sorrow, let us learn to apply our minds to the
contemplation of the issue which God promises. Thus we shall experience that all
true believers have a common interest in this prophecy, That God not only will
wipe away tears from their eyes, but that he will also diffuse inconceivable joy
through their hearts.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Except Jehovah build the
house.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There is no reason why the Jews
should deny that this Psalm was composed by Solomon. They think that the letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lamed, </i>which we translate of, is equivalent to, <i>in behalf of Solomon;
</i>which is at variance with common usage, for such a title in all cases
designates the author. Accordingly, they absurdly devise a new sense, for which
there is no necessity, it being very suitable for Solomon, who was endued with
the spirit of wisdom hi the affairs of government, to discourse of things which
he knew and had experience about. In affirming that God governs the world and
the life of man, he does so for two reasons: First, whatever prosperous event
may fall out to men, their ingratitude is instantly manifested by their
ascribing it wholly to themselves; and thus God is defrauded of the honor which
is his due. Solomon, to correct such a perverse error, declares, that nothing
happens prosperously to us except in so far as God blesses our proceedings.
Secondly, his purpose was to beat down the foolish presumption of men, who,
setting God aside, are not afraid to undertake to do anything, whatever it may
be, in exclusive reliance upon their own wisdom and strength. Stripping them,
therefore, of that which they groundlessly arrogate to themselves, he exhorts
them to modesty and the invocation of God. He does not, however, reject either
the labor, the enterprises, or the counsels of men; for it is a praiseworthy
virtue diligently to discharge the duties of our office. It is not the will of
the Lord that we should be like blocks of wood, or that we should keep our arms
folded without doing
anything;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fe97</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but that we should apply to use all the talents and advantages which he has
conferred upon us. It is indeed true that the greatest part of our labors
proceeds from the curse of God; and yet although men had still retained the
integrity of their primitive state, God would have had us to be employed, even
as we see how Adam was placed in the garden of Eden to dress it.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
2:15.) Solomon, therefore, does not condemn watchfulness, a thing which God
approves; nor yet men's labor, by which when they undertake it willingly,
according to the commandment of God, they offer to him all acceptable sacrifice;
but lest, blinded by presumption, they should forcibly appropriate to themselves
that which belongs to God, he admonishes them that their being busily occupied
will profit them nothing, except in so far as God blesses their exertions. By
the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>he means not only a building of wood or stone, but he comprehends the whole
domestic order and government of a family, even as a little after by the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>he denotes not only the buildings or enclosure of the walls, but also the
general state of the whole commonwealth. There is likewise a synecdoche in the
words <i>builder </i>and <i>keeper; </i>for he intends to say in general that
whatever labor, foresight, and skill men may employ in maintaining a family, or
in preserving a city, will be to no purpose unless God grant from heaven a
prosperous issue to the whole.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It behoves us to
remember what I have just now touched upon, that since the minds of men are
commonly possessed with such headstrong arrogance as leads them to despise God,
and to magnify beyond measure their own means and advantages, nothing is of more
importance than to humble them, in order to their being made to perceive that
whatever they undertake it shall dissolve into smoke, unless God in the exercise
of pure grace cause it to prosper. When philosophers argue concerning the
political affairs of a state they ingeniously gather together whatever seems to
them to answer their purpose &#8212; they acutely point out the means of
erecting a commonwealth, and on the other hand the vices by which a
well-regulated state is commonly corrupted; in short, they discourse with
consummate skill upon everything that is necessary to be known on this subject,
except that they omit the principal point &#8212; which is, that men, however
much they may excel in wisdom and virtue, and whatever may be the undertakings
in which they may engage, can effect nothing, unless in so far as God stretches
forth his hand to them, or rather makes use of them as his instruments. Which of
the philosophers ever acknowledged that a politician is nothing else but an
instrument guided by the hand of God? Yea, rather they held that good management
on the part of man constituted the chief cause of the happiness of the social
body. Now, since mortal men thus rise up with profane boldness to build cities,
and to order the state of the whole world, the Holy Spirit justly reproves such
madness. Let us then so occupy ourselves, each according to the measure of his
ability and the nature of his office, as that at the same time the praise of the
success attending our exertions may remain exclusively with God. The partition
which many devise &#8212; that he who has behaved himself valiantly, while he
leaves the half of the praise to God, may take the other half to himself, is
deserving of all condemnation. The blessing of God should have the whole share
and exclusively hold the throne.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, if our
terrestrial condition depends. entirely upon the good pleasure of God, with what
wings shall we fly up into heaven? When a house is planned, or a certain manner
of life is chosen &#8212; yea, even when laws are enacted and justice
administered, all this is nothing else than to creep upon the earth; and yet the
Holy Spirit declares, that all our endeavors in this way are fruitless and of no
value. So much the less to be borne with, then, is the folly of those who strive
to penetrate even into heaven by their own power. Farther, we may gather from
this doctrine, that it is not wonderful to find in the present day the state of
the world so troubled and confused as it actually is &#8212; justice put to
flight in cities, the husband and the wife mutually accusing each other, fathers
and mothers complaining of their children &#8212; in short, all bewailing their
own condition. For how few are to be found who, in their vocation, turn to God,
and who, being rather inflated with arrogance, do not wickedly exalt themselves?
God then justly renders this sad reward to ungrateful men when he is defrauded
of his honor. But were all men humbly to submit themselves to the providence of
God, there is no doubt that this blessing which Solomon here commends would shed
its lustre on all parts of our life, both public and
private.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lm[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>amal, </i>which we have translated <i>to labor, </i>signifies not only to
employ one's self in something or other, but also to busy one's self even to
lassitude and distress. I have said that by the word <i>keepers </i>is to be
understood not only those who are appointed to keep watch, but all magistrates
and judges. If they are characterized by vigilance, it is the gift of God. There
is, however, need of another vigilance &#8212; that of God; for unless he keep
watch out of heaven no perspicacity of men will be sufficient to guard against
dangers.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is vain for you in
hastening to rise early.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Solomon now
expresses more plainly that men in vain wear themselves out with toiling, and
waste themselves by fasting to acquire riches, since these also are a benefit
bestowed only by God. The more effectually to move them, he addresses himself to
every man in particular</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>. It
is,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in vain for
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He particularizes two means which
are thought to contribute in an eminent degree to the amassing of riches. It is
not surprising to find those growing rich in a short time who spare no exertion,
but consume night and day in plying their occupations, and allow themselves only
scanty fare from the product of their labor. Solomon, however, affirms that
neither living at a small expense, nor diligence in business will by themselves
profit anything at all. Not that he forbids us to practice temperance in our
diet and to rise early to engage in our worldly business; but to;stir us up to
prayer, and to calling upon God, and also to recommend gratitude for the divine
blessings, he brings to nought whatever would obscure the grace of God.
Consequently, we shall then enter upon our worldly avocations in a right way
when our hope depends exclusively upon God, and our success in that case will
correspond to our wishes. But if a man, taking no account of God, eagerly makes
haste, he will bring ruin upon himself by his too precipitate course. It is not,
therefore, the design of the Prophet to encourage men <i>to </i>give way to
sloth, so that they should think upon nothing all their life long, but fall
asleep and abandon themselves to idleness- his meaning rather is, that, in
executing what God has enjoined upon them, they should always begin with prayer
and calling upon his name, offering to him their labors that he may bless them.
The expression, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the bread of
sorrows</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>may be explained in two ways,
either as denoting what is acquired by hard and anxious toil, or what is eaten
with disquietude of mind; just as we see parsimonious and close-handed persons,
when they have scarcely tasted a bit of bread, pulling back their hand from
their mouth. It is of no great importance which of these senses is adopted; for
we are simply taught that parsimonious men profit nothing &#8212; no not even
when through their own niggardliness they grudge to eat as much as nature
requires.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thus will he
give sleep to his beloved.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The inspired
writer intimates that the blessing of God, of which he has spoken, is actually
seen in his children and servants. It will not suffice to believe this doctrine
&#8212; that whatever, men attempt is to no purpose; it is necessary that the
promise be added, in order to their being led with assured hope to perform their
duty. The sentence may be read either &#8212; <i>he will give sleep to his
beloved, </i>or, <i>he will give in sleeping; </i>that is, he will give them
those things which unbelievers labor to acquire by their own industry. The
particle,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;k</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
ken, thus, </i>is put to express
certainty;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fe98</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for with the view of producing a more undoubted persuasion of the truth &#8212;
4hat God gives food to his people without any great care on their part &#8212;
which seems incredible, and a fiction, Solomon points to the thing as it were
with the finger. He indeed speaks as if God nourished the slothfulness of his
servants by his gentle treatment; but as we know that men are created with the
design of their being occupied, and as in the subsequent Psalm we shall find
that the servants of God are accounted happy when they eat the labor of their
hands, it is certain that the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sleep</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is not to be understood as implying slothfulness, but a placid labor, to
which true believers subject themselves by the obedience of faith. Whence
proceeds this so great ardor in the unbelieving, that they move not a finger
without a tumult or bustle, in other words, without tormenting themselves with
superfluous cares, but because they attribute nothing to the providence of God!
The faithful, on the other hand, although they lead a laborious life, yet follow
their vocations with composed and tranquil minds. Thus their hands are not idle,
but their minds repose in the stillness of faith, as if they were asleep. If it
is again objected, that God's people are often agitated with distressing cares,
and that, oppressed with pinching poverty, and destitute of all resources, they
are anxiously concerned about the morrow, I answer, that if faith and love to
God were perfect in his servants, his blessing, of which the Prophet makes
mention, would be manifest. Whenever they are tormented above measure, this
happens through their own default, in not resting entirely upon the providence
of God. I farther add, that God punishes them more severely than unbelievers,
because it is profitable for them to be agitated by disquietude for a season,
that at length they may attain to this peaceful sleep. In the meantime, however,
God's grace prevails, and always shines forth in the midst of darkness, in
respect of his cherishing his children as it were by
sleep.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lo! children are the heritage
of Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Solomon here adduces one
instance in which, in a particular manner, he would have us to recognize the
truth which he has hitherto asserted generally &#8212; that the life of men is
governed by God. Nothing seems more natural than for men to be produced of men.
The majority of mankind dream, that after God had once ordained this at the
beginning, children were thenceforth begotten solely by a secret instinct of
nature, God ceasing to interfere in the matter; and even those who are endued
with some sense of piety, although they may not deny that He is the Father and
Creator of the human race, yet do not acknowledge that his providential care
descends to this particular case, but rather think that men are created by a
certain universal motion. With the view of correcting this preposterous error,
Solomon calls children <i>the heritage of God, </i>and the fruit of the womb
<i>his gift; </i>for the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rk&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
sachar, </i>translated
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reward</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>signifies whatever benefits God bestows upon men, as is plainly manifest
from many passages of Scripture. The meaning then is, that, children are not the
fruit of chance, but that God, as it seems good to him, distributes to every man
his share of them. Moreover, as the Prophet repeats the same thing twice,
<i>heritage </i>and <i>reward </i>are to be understood as equivalent; for both
these terms are set in opposition to fortune, or the strength of men. The
stronger a man is he seems so much the better fitted for procreation. Solomon
declares on the contrary, that those become fathers to whom God vouchsafes that
honor.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As the majority of children are not
always a source of joy to their parents, a second favor of God is added, which
is his forming the minds of children, and adorning them with an excellent
disposition, and all kinds of virtues. Aristotle in his Politics very properly
discusses the question whether
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">poluteknia</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that is, the having of many children, ought to be accounted among good
things or no; and he decides it in the negative, unless there is added
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eujgeneia</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that is, generosity or goodness of nature in the children themselves. And
assuredly it would be a far happier lot for many to be without children, or
barren, than to have a numerous offspring, proving to them only the cause of
tears and groans. In order, then, to set forth this blessing of God &#8212; the
having offspring &#8212; in a clear light, Solomon commends a virtuous and
generous disposition in children. The similitude introduced for this purpose is,
that as an archer is armed 'with a well-furnished bow, so men are defended by
their children, as it were with a bow and all arrow. This similitude might seem,
at first sight, a little too harsh; but if it is examined somewhat more closely,
its elegance will be readily admitted. The Prophet means that those who are
without children are in a manner unarmed; for what else is it to be childless
but to be solitary? It is no small gift of God for a man to be renewed in his
posterity; for God then gives him new strength, that he who otherwise would
straightway decay, may begin as it were to live a second
time.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The knowledge of this doctrine is highly
useful. The fruitfulness even of the lower animals is expressly ascribed to God
alone; and if He would have it to be <i>accounted </i>his benefit that kine, and
sheep, and mares <i>conceive, </i>how inexcusable will be the impiety of men, if
when he adorns them with the honorable title of fathers, they account this favor
as nothing. It is also to be added, that unless men regard their children as the
gift of God, they are careless and reluctant in providing for their support,
just as on the other hand this knowledge contributes in a very eminent degree to
encourage them in bringing up their offspring. Farther, he who thus reflects
upon the goodness of God in giving him children, will readily and with a settled
mind look for the continuance of God's grace; and although he may have but a
small inheritance to leave them, he will not be unduly careful on that
account.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall not be ashamed
when they speak with their enemies in the
gate.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here Solomon describes such
children as, distinguished by uprightness and integrity, have no hesitation in
rendering an account of their life, that they may shut the mouths of the
malevolent and of calumniators. In ancient times, as is well known, judicial
assemblies</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe102</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> were held at the gates of cities. He
therefore here speaks of the gate, as if in the present day one should speak of
the bench, or the courts, or the senate. Let it be observed that what is chiefly
praised in children is innocence, that fathers may estimate this grace at its
true value. In the preceding clause he had compared children endued with virtue
and excellence of nature to arrows. Now, that no man may put a violent
construction upon this comparison, as if it were intended to give children
leave, like robbers, to rush upon doing mischief to such as come in their way,
reckless of right and wrong, he expressly represents virtue and moral integrity
as constituting the protection which they ought to afford to their fathers. He
teaches us, then, that the children which we ought to wish for, are not such as
may violently oppress the wretched and suffering, or overreach others by craft
and deceit, or accumulate great riches by unlawful means, or acquire for
themselves tyrannical authority, but such as will practice uprightness, and be
willing to live in obedience to the laws, and prepared to render an account of
their life. Farther, although fathers ought diligently to form their children
under a system of holy discipline, yet let them remember that they will never
succeed in attaining the object aimed at, save by the pure and special grace of
God. Solomon also tacitly intimates that however zealously we may be devoted to
the practice of integrity, we shall never be without detractors and slanderers;
for if integrity of life were exempt from all calumny, we would have no quarrel
with our enemies.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
128</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This Psalm is akin to the preceding, and, so to
speak, a kind of appendage to it; for it declares that the divine blessing, to
the diffusion of which among the whole human race Solomon testified, is to be
seen most conspicuously in the ease of God's true and sincere
servants.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessed is the man who
feareth Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In the preceding Psalm
it was stated that prosperity in all human affairs, and in the whole course of
our life, is to be hoped for exclusively from the grace of God; and now the
Prophet admonishes us that those who desire to be partakers of the blessing of
God must with sincerity of heart devote themselves wholly to him; for he will
never disappoint those who serve him. The first verse contains a summary of the
subject-matter of the Psalm; the remaining portion being added only by way of
exposition. The maxim "that those are blessed who fear God, especially in the
present life," is so much with variance with the common opinion of men, that
very few will give it their assent. Everywhere are to be found fluttering about
many Epicureans, similar to Dionysius, who, having once had a favorable wind
upon the sea and a prosperous voyage, after having plundered a
temple,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe104</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> boasted that the gods favored church
robbers. Also the weak are troubled and shaken by the prosperity of evil men,
and they next faint under the load of their own miseries. The despisers of God
may not indeed enjoy prosperity, and the condition of good men may be tolerable,
but still the greater part of men are blind in considering the providence of
God, or seem not in any degree to perceive it. The adage, "That<i> </i>it is
best not to be born at all, or to die as soon as possible," has certainly been
long since received by the common consent of almost all men. Finally, carnal
reason judges either that all mankind without exception are miserable, or that
fortune is more favorable to ungodly and wicked men than to the good. To the
sentiment that those are blessed who fear the Lord, it has an entire aversion,
as I have declared at length on Psalm 37. So much the more requisite then is it
to dwell upon the consideration of this truth. Farther, as this blessedness is
not apparent to the eye, it is of importance, in order to our being able to
apprehend it., first to attend to the definition which will ]be given of it by
and bye, and secondly, to know that it depends chiefly upon the protection of
God. Although we collect together all the circumstances which seem to contribute
to a happy life, surely nothing will be found more desirable than to be kept
hidden under the guardianship of God. If this blessing is, in our estimation, to
be preferred, as it deserves, to all other good things, whoever is persuaded
that the care of God is exercised about the world and human affairs, will at the
same time unquestionably acknowledge that what is here laid down is the chief
point of happiness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But before I proceed
farther, it is to be noticed that in the second part of the verse there is with
good reason added a mark by which the servants of God are distinguished from
those who despise him. We see how the most depraved, with no less pride than
audacity and mockery, boast of fearing God. The Prophet therefore requires the
attestation of the life as to this; for these two things, the fear of God and
the keeping of his law, are inseparable; and the root must necessarily produce
its corresponding fruit. Farther, we learn from this passage that our life does
not meet with the divine approbation, except it be framed according to the
divine law. There is unquestionably no religion without the fear of God, and
from this fear the Prophet represents our living according to the commandment
and ordinance of God as proceeding.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For when thou shalt eat the
labor of thy hands thou shalt be blessed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Some divide this sentence into two members, reading these words, <i>For thou
shalt eat the labor of thy hands, </i>as a distinct sentence, and then what
follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt be
blessed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as the beginning of a new
sentence. I indeed grant that it is true, as they assert, that the grace of God,
manifested in the faithful enjoying the fruits of their labor is set in
opposition to the curse to which all mankind have been subjected. But it is more
natural to read the words as one sentence, bringing out this meaning &#8212;
That God's children are happy in eating the fruits of their labor; for if we
make them two sentences, these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou, shalt be blessed, and it
shall be well with thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>would contain a
cold and even an insipid repetition. Here the Prophet, confirming the doctrine
stated in the first verse, teaches us that we ought to form a different estimate
of what happiness consists hi from that formed by the world, which makes a happy
life to consist in ease, honors, and great wealth. He recalls God's servants to
the practice of moderation, which almost all men refuse to exercise. How few are
to be found who, were it left to their own choice, would desire to live by their
own labor; yea, who would account it a singular benefit to do so! No sooner is
the name of happiness pronounced, than instantly every man breaks forth into the
most extravagant ideas of what is necessary to it, so insatiable a gulf is the
covetousness of the human heart. The Prophet therefore bids the fearers of God
be content with this one thing &#8212; with the assurance that having God for
their foster-father, they shall be suitably maintained by the labor of their own
hands; just as it is said in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
34:10,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The young lions do lack,
and suffer hunger; but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good
thing."</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must remember that the Prophet does not speak of
the highest blessedness, which consists not in meat and drink, nor is confined
within the narrow bounds of this transitory life; but he assures God's believing
people that even in this pilgrimage or earthly place of sojourn they shall enjoy
a happy life, in so far as the state of the world will permit; even as Paul
declares that God promises both these to such as fear him, in other words, that
God will take care of us during the whole course of our life, until he has at
last brought us to eternal glory.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 4:8.) The change of person serves also to give greater emphasis to the
language; for after having),' spoken in the third person, the Prophet comes to
address his discourse to. <i>each </i>individual in particular, to this effect:
&#8212; Not only does immortal felicity await thee in heaven, but during thy
pilgrimage in this world God will not cease to perform the office of the father
of a family in maintaining thee, so that thy daily food will be administered to
thee by his hand, provided thou art contented with a lowly
condition.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy wife shall be as a
fruitful vine on the sides of thy house.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Here again it is promised, as in the preceding Psalm, that God will make
those who honor him fruitful in a numerous offspring. The majority of mankind
indeed desire to have issue, and this desire may be said to be implanted in them
by nature; but many, when they have obtained children, soon become cloyed
therewith. Again it is often more grateful to want children than to leave a
number of them hi circumstances of destitution. But although the world is
carried away by irregular desires after various objects, between which it is
perpetually fluctuating in its choice, God gives this his own blessing, the
preference to all riches, and therefore we ought to hold it in high estimation.
If a man has a wife of amiable manners as the companion of his life, let him set
no less value upon this blessing than Solomon did, who, in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;201914&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
19:14, affirms that it is God alone who gives a good wife. In like manner, if a
man be a father of a numerous offspring, let him receive that goodly boon with a
thankful heart. If it is objected that the Prophet in speaking thus, detains the
faithful on the earth by the allurements of the flesh, and hinders them from
aspiring towards heaven with free and unencumbered minds, I answer, that it is
not surprising to find him offering to the Jews under the law a taste of God's
grace and paternal favor, when we consider that they were like children. He has,
however, so tempered, or mixed it, as that by it; they might rise in their
contemplations to the heavenly life. Even at the present day God, though in a
more sparing manner, testifies his favor by temporal benefits, agreeably to that
passage in Paul's first Epistle to Timothy just now quoted,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 4:8,)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Godliness is profitable
unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to
come."</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But by this he does not cast any hindrance or
impediment in our way to keep us from elevating our minds to heaven, but ladders
are by this means rather erected to enable us to mount up thither step by step.
The Prophet, therefore, very properly reminds the faithful that they already
receive some fruit of their integrity, when God gives them their food, makes
them happy in their wives and children, and condescends to take care of their
life. But his design in commending the present goodness of God is to animate
them to hasten forward with alacrity on the path which leads to their eternal
inheritance. If the earthly felicity described in this Psalm may not always be
the lot of the godly, but should it sometimes happen that their wife is a
termagant, or proud, or of depraved morals, or that their children are dissolute
and vagabonds, and even bring disgrace upon their father's house, let them know
that their being deprived of God's blessing is owing to their having repulsed it
by their own fault. And surely if each duly considers his own vices he will
acknowledge that God's earthly benefits have been justly withheld from
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
128:4-6	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b> Lo! surely, thus blessed
shall be the man who feareth Jehovah. <b>5.</b> Jehovah shall bless thee from
Zion; and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life:
<b>6.</b> And thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lo! surely, thus blessed
shall be the man who feareth Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>The preceding doctrine, that even in the outward condition of God's servants
while in this transitory state there is afforded such evidence of the divine
favor and goodness as demonstrates that we do not lose our labor in serving him,
is here confirmed by the Prophet. Yet as the reward of godliness does not appear
eminently conspicuous, he, in the first place, uses the demonstrative particle,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lo</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>!</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe105</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and then adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>surely</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>for so I interpret the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ki. </i>We must, however, always remember, as I have previously noticed, that
the divine blessing is promised to us upon earth in such a way as that it may
not engross our thoughts and keep them grovelling in the dust; for it is not
meet that our hope of the life to come should be stifled. This is the reason why
we do not at all times equally enjoy the benefits of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah shall bless thee from
Zion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some, would have this sentence to
be a prayer, and therefore they resolve the future tense into the optative mood.
But it seems rather to be a continued statement of the same doctrine previously
dwelt on, the Prophet now expressing more plainly that the benefits which he has
recounted are to be ascribed to God as their author. Although the gifts of God
often present themselves before our eyes, yet through the obscurity which false
imaginations throw around them our perception of them is dim and imperfect.
Hence this repetition of the sentiment, That whenever true believers meet with
any prosperous events in the course of their life, it is the effect of the
divine blessing, is not to be deemed superfluous. The persons described are said
to be blessed </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from
Zion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>to lead them to call to
remembrance the covenant into which God had entered with them, for he had
graciously promised to be favorable to the observers of his law; and these
principles of godliness they had imbibed from their infancy. The Prophet,
therefore, declares that it is no novel doctrine or something before unheard of
which he adduces, the law having long ago taught them that it is made manifest
even by the temporary benefits conferred on those who serve God, that the pains
taken in serving him are not thrown away; and he affirms that of this they shall
actually have the experience. What is added concerning
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the good of
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is to be regarded as
en-joining upon the godly the duty not only of seeking their own individual
welfare, or of being devoted to their own peculiar interests, but rather of
having it as chief desire to see the Church of God in a flourishing condition.
It would be a very unreasonable thing for each member to desire what may be
profitable for itself, while in the meantime the body was neglected. From our
extreme proneness to err in that respect, the Prophet, with good reason,
recommends solicitude about the public welfare; and he mingles together domestic
blessings and the common benefits of the Church in such a way as to show us that
they are things joined together, and which it is unlawful to put
asuader.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
129</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This Psalm teaches, in the first place, that God
subjects his Church to divers troubles and affections, to the end he may the
better prove himself her deliverer and defender. The Psalmist, therefore,
recalls to the memory of the faithful how sadly God's people had been persecuted
in all ages, and how wonderfully they had been preserved, in order by such
examples to fortify their hope in reference to the future. In the second part,
under the form of an imprecation, he shows that the divine vengeance is ready to
fall upon all the ungodly, who without cause distress the people of

composed at a time when the Church of God, reduced to a state of extreme
distress, or dismayed by some great danger, or oppressed with tyranny, was on
the verge of total destruction. This conjecture, I conceive, is supported by the
adverb of time,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>now</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>which appears to me to be emphatic. It is as if the Prophet; had said, When
God's faithful ones are with difficulty drawing their breath under the burden of
temptations, it is a seasonable time for them to reflect on the manner in which
he has exercised his people from the beginning, and from age to age. As soon as
God has given loose reins to our enemies to do as they please we are distressed
with sorrow, and our thoughts are wholly engrossed with the evils which
presently harass us. Hence proceeds despair; for we do not remember that the
patience of the fathers was subjected to the like trial, and that nothing
happens to us which they did not experience. It is then an exercise eminently
fitted to comfort true believers to look back to the conflicts of the Church in
the days of old, in order thereby to know that she has always labored under the
cross, and has been severely afflicted by the unrighteous violence of her
enemies. The most probable conjecture which occurs to me at present is, that
this Psalm was written after the Jews had returned from the Babylonish
captivity, and when, having suffered many grievous and cruel injuries at the
hands of their neighbors, they hadn't length almost fainted under the tyranny of
Antiochus Epiphanes. In this dark and troublous state of matters, the Prophet
encourages the faithful to fortitude, nor does he address himself to a few of
them only, but to the whole body without exception; and in order to their
sustaining such fierce assaults, he would have them to oppose to them a hope
inspired by the encouraging consideration, that the Church, by patient
endurance, has uniformly proved victorious. Almost every word is emphatic.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let Israel now
say</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, let him consider the trials of
the Church in ancient times, from which it may be gathered, that the people of
God have never been exempted from bearing the cross, and yet that the various
afflictions by which they have been tried have always had a happy issue. In
speaking of the enemies of Israel simply by the pronoun
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>without being more specific, the Psalmist aggravates the greatness of the
evil more than if he had expressly named the Assyrians or the Egyptians. By not
specifying any particular class of foes, he tacitly intimates that the world is
fraught with innumerable bands of enemies, whom Satan easily arms for the
destruction of good men, his object being that new wars may arise continually on
every side. History certainly bears ample testimony that the people of God had
not to deal with a few enemies, but that they were assaulted by almost the whole
world; and farther, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>were molested not only by external foes, but also by those of an internal
kind, by such as professed to belong to the
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The term

beginnings,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe106A</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and refers not only to the time when
God brought the people out of Egypt, but also to the time when he wearied
Abraham and the patriarchs during almost their whole life, by keeping them in a
condition of painful warfare. If these patriarchs were strangely driven about in
the land of Canaan, the lot of their descendants was still worse during the time
of their sojourning in Egypt, when they were not only oppressed as slaves, but
loaded with every kind of reproach and ignominy. At their departure from that
land we know what difficulties they had to encounter. If in tracing their
history from that period we find seasons in which some respite was granted them,
<i>yet </i>they were not in a state of repose for any length of time, until the
reign of David. And although during his reign they appeared to be in a
prosperous condition, yet soon after troubles and even. defeats arose, which
threatened the people of God with total destruction. In the Babylonish
captivity, all hope being well-nigh extinguished, they seemed as if hidden in
the grave and undergoing the process of putrefaction. After their return they
obtained, with difficulty, some brief intermission to take their breath. They
were certainly often put; to the sword, until the race of them was almost wholly
destroyed. To prevent it, therefore, from being supposed that they had received
only some slight hurt, they are justly said <i>to have been afflicted; </i>as if
the Prophet placed them before our eyes as it were half-dead, through the
treatment of their enemies, who, seeing them prostrated under their feet,
scrupled not to tread upon them. If we come to ourselves, it will be proper to
add the horrible persecutions, by which the Church would have been consumed a
thousand times, had not God, by hidden and mysterious means, preserved her,
raising her as it were from the dead. Unless we have become stupid under our
calamities, the distressing circumstances of this unhappy age will compel us to
meditate on the same doctrine.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When the Prophet
says twice, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they have afflicted
me, they have afflicted me</i></font><font face="Palatino">, the repetition is
not superfluous, it being intended to teach us that the people of God had not
merely once or twice to enter the conflict, but that their patience had been
tried by continual exercises. He had said that they had commenced this conflict
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from their
youth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>intimating that they had been
inured to it from their first origin, in order to their being accustomed to bear
the cross. He now adds, that their being subjected to this rigorous training was
not without good reason, inasmuch as God had not ceased, by a continued course,
to make use of these calamities for subduing them to himself. If the exercises
of the Church, during her state of childhood, were so severe, our effeminacy
will be very shameful indeed, if in the present day, when the Church, by the
coming of Christ, has reached the age of manhood, we are found wanting in
firmness for enduring trials. Matter of consolation is laid down in the last
clause, which informs us that the enemies of Israel, after having tried all
methods, never succeeded in realizing their wishes, God having always
disappointed their hopes, and baffled their
attempts.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>

fe107</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here the Prophet, by an apparent
similitude, embellishes his preceding statement respecting the grievous
afflictions of the Church. He compares the people of God to a field through
which a plough is drawn. He says that the furrows were made long, so that no
corner was exempted from being cut up by the ploughshare. These words vividly
express the fact &#8212; that the cross has always been planted on the back of
the Church, to make long and wide furrows.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In
the subsequent verse a ground of consolation under the same figure is subjoined,
which is, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the righteous Lord
hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>The allusion is to a plough, which, as we all know, is tied with cords to
the necks of the oxen. The language very aptly conveys the idea, that the
wicked, &#8212; since they would never have become tired or satiated in
exercising their cruelty, and also in consequence of their being well armed,
&#8212; were prepared to proceed farther, but that the Lord, in a way altogether
unexpected, repressed their fury, just as if a man should unyoke oxen from the
plough by cutting in pieces the cords and thongs which tied them to it. Hence we
perceive what is the true condition of the Church. As God would have us
contentedly to take his yoke upon us, the Holy Spirit not unfitly compares us to
an arable field, which cannot make any resistance to its being cut, and cleaved,
and turned up by the ploughshare. Should any one be disposed to indulge in
greater refinement of speculation, he might say that the field is ploughed to
prepare it for receiving the seed, and that it may at length bring forth fruit.
But in my opinion the subject to which the Prophet limits his attention is the
afflictions of the Church. The epithet
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteous</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>with which he honors God, must, in a suitableness to the scope of the
passage, be explained as implying that, although God may seem to dissemble for a
time, yet he never forgets his righteousness, so as to withhold relief from his
afflicted people. Paul in like manner adduces the same reason why God will not
always suffer them to be persecuted,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">It is a point worthy of special notice, that the
welfare of the Church is inseparably connected with the righteousness of God.
The Prophet, also, wisely teaches us. that the reason why the enemies of the
Church did not prevail, was because God brought to nothing their enterprises,
and did not suffer them to go beyond what he had determined in his own
mind.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

the time to come. Since all the verbs are in the future tense, it is certainly a
very appropriate interpretation to understand him as deriving from times past
instruction as to what is to be hoped for in future, even to the end. In
whichever way we understand the passage, he declares that the faithful have no
reason to be discouraged when they behold their enemies raised on high. The
grass which grows upon the house-tops is not, on account of its higher
situation, more valuable than the blade of corn which in the low ground is
trampled under foot; for although it stands elevated above men's heads, it is,
in the first place, unprofitable; and secondly, it quickly withers

properly signifies <i>to be brought forth, </i>or <i>to come forth, </i>the
meaning, in my opinion, is that the grass'. on the housetops, so far from
continuing long in a state of freshness, withers and perishes at its first
springing up, because it has no root under it, nor earth to supply it with sap
or moisture for its nourishment. Whenever, then, the splendor or greatness of
our enemies strikes us with fear, let us bring to our recollection this
comparison, that as the grass which grows upon the house-tops, though high, is
yet without root, and consequently of brief duration, so these enemies, the
nearer they approach the sun by the height of their pride, shall be the sooner
consumed by the burning heat, since they have no root, it being humility alone

confirmation of the truth, that although the wicked mount high or elevate
themselves, and form an extravagant opinion of their own importance, yet they
continue mere grass, not bringing forth any good fruit, nor reaching a state of
ripeness, but swelling only with fresh appearance. To make this obvious, the
Psalmist sets them in opposition to fruit-bearing herbs, which in valleys and
low grounds produce fruit for men. In fine, he affirms that they deserve to be
hated or despised of all, whereas commonly every one in passing by the corn
fields blesses them and prays for the

illustration of his doctrine from the affairs of ordinary life, we are taught
that whenever there is a hopeful prospect of a good harvest, we ought to beseech

would give full effect to his blessing. And considering that the fruits of the
earth are exposed to so many hazards, it is certainly strange that we are not
stirred 'up to engage in the exercise of prayer from the absolute necessity of
these to man and beast. Nor does the Psalmist, in speaking of passers by
blessing the reapers, speak exclusively of rite children of God, who are truly
taught by his word that the fruitfulness of the earth is owing to his goodness;
but he also comprehends worldly men in whom the same knowledge is implanted
naturally. In conclusion, provided we not only dwell in the Church of the Lord,
but also labor to have place among the number of her genuine citizens, we will
be able fearlessly to despise all fire might of our enemies; for although they
may flourish and have a great outward show for a time, yet they are but barren

130</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whether the Prophet in this Psalm prays in his own
name in particular, or represents the whole Church, it is manifest, that finding
himself overwhelmed with adversities, he supplicates deliverance with passionate
ardor. And while acknowledging that he is justly chastised by the hand of God,
he encourages himself and all genuine believers to cherish good hope, since God
is the everlasting deliverer of his people, and has always in readiness the
means of effecting their rescue from death.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Out of the deep places have I

noticed that the Prophet speaks of himself as sending forth his voice, as it
were from out of a deep gulf,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe115</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> feeling himself overwhelmed with
calamities. As the miseries to which there is no prospect of a termination
commonly bring despair in their train, nothing is more difficult than for
persons, when involved in grievous and deep sorrow, to stir up their minds to
the exercise of prayer. And it is wonderful, considering that whilst we enjoy
peace and prosperity we are cold in prayer, (because then our hearts are in a
state of infatuated security, how in adversities, which ought to quicken us, we
are still more stupefied. But the Prophet derives confidence in coming to the
time one of grace from the very troubles, cares, dangers and sorrow into which
he was plunged. He expresses his perplexity and the earnestness of his desire
both by the word cry, and by the repetition continued in the second verse. So
much the more detestable then is the barbarous ignorance of the Papist's, in
shamefully profaning this Psalm by wresting; it to a purpose wholly foreign to
its genuine application. To what intent do they mumble it over for the dead, if
it; is not that, in consequence of Satan having bewitched them, they may by
their profanity extinguish a doctrine of singular utility? From the time that
this Psalm was, by, a forced interpretation, applied to the souls of the dead,
it is very generally believed to be of no use whatever to the living, and thus
the world has lost an inestimable
treasure.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>

that although grievously afflicted he had justly deserved such punishment, as
had been inflicted upon him. As by his own example he gives a rule which the
whole Church ought to observe, let no man presume to intrude himself into the
presence of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>but in the way of humbly deprecating his wrath; and especially when God
exercises severity in his dealings towards us, let us know that we are required
to make the same confession which is here uttered. Whoever either flatters
himself or buries his sins by inattention to them, deserves to pine away in his
miseries; at least he is unworthy of obtaining from God the smallest
alleviation. Whenever God then exhibits the tokens of his wrath, let even the
man who seems to others to be the holies of all his fellows, descend to make
this confession, that should God determine to deal with us according to the
strict demands of his law, and to summon us before his tribunal, not one of the
whole human race would be able to stand. We grant that it is one man only who
here prays, but he at once pronounces sentence upon the whole human race. "All
the children of Adam," he substantially says, "from the first to the last, are
lost and condemned, should God require them to render up an account of their
life." It is therefore necessary that even the holiest of men should pass under
this condemnation, that they may betake themselves to the mercy of God as their
only refuge. The Prophet does not however mean to extenuate his own fault by
thus involving others with himself, as we see hypocrites do, who when they dare
not altogether justify themselves, resort to this subterfuge, "Am<i> </i>I the
first or the only man who has offended?"<i> </i>and thus, mingling themselves
with a multitude of others, they think themselves half absolved from their
guilt. But the Prophet, instead of seeking to shelter himself under such a
subterfuge, rather confesses, after having thoroughly examined himself, that if
of the whole human race not even one can escape eternal perdition, this instead
of lessening rather increased his obnoxiousness to punishment. Whoever, as if he
had said, shall come into the presence of God, whatever may be his eminence for
sanctity, he must succumb and stand
confounded,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe117</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> what then will be the case as to me,
who am not one of the<i> </i>best? The right application of this doctrine is,
for every man to examine in good earnest his own life by the perfection which is
enjoined upon us in the law. In this way he will be forced to confess that all
men without exception have deserved everlasting damnation; and each will
acknowledge in respect to himself that he is a thousand times undone. Farther,
this passage teaches us that, since no man can stand by his own works, all such
as are accounted righteous before God, are righteous in consequence of the
pardon and remission of their sins. In no other manner can any man be righteous
in the sight of God. Very differently do the Papists think. They indeed confess
that the deficiencies of our works are supplied by the lenity which God
exercises towards us; but at the same time they dream of a partial
righteousness, on the ground of which men may stand before God. In entertaining
such an idea they go very far astray from the sense of the Prophet, as will
appear more plainly from the
sequel.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But with thee there is
forgiveness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This verse leads us
farther. Though all men confess with the mouth that there is no human being in
the world whom God may not justly adjudge to everlasting death, should it so
please him, yet how few are persuaded of the truth which the Prophet now adds,
that the grace of which they stand in need shall not be denied them? They either
sleep in their sins through stupidity, or fluctuate amidst a variety of doubts,
and, at length, are overwhelmed with despair. This maxim, "that no man is free
from sin,"<i> </i>is, as I have said, received among all men without dispute,
and yet the majority shut their eyes to their own faults, and settle securely in
hiding - places to which, in their ignorance, they have betaken themselves, if
they are not forcibly roused out of them, and then, when pursued close by the
judgments of God, they are overwhelmed with alarm, or so greatly tormented as to
fall into despair. The consequence of this want of hope in men, that God will be
favorable to them, is an indifference about coming into the Divine presence to
supplicate for pardon. When a man is awakened with a lively sense of the
judgment of God, lie cannot fail to be humbled with shame and fear. Such
self-dissatisfaction would not however suffice, unless at the same time there
were added faith, whose office it is to raise up the hearts which were cast down
with fear, and to encourage them to pray for forgiveness. David then acted as he
ought to have done when, in order to his attaining genuine repentance, he first
summons himself before God's judgment seat; but, to preserve his confidence from
failing under the overpowering influence of fear, he presently adds the hope
which there was of obtaining pardon. It is, indeed, a matter which comes under
our daily observation, that those who proceed not beyond the step of thinking
themselves deserving of endless death, rush, like frenzied men, with great
impetuosity against God. The better, therefore, to confirm himself and others,
the Prophet declares that God's mercy cannot be separated or torn away from
himself. "As soon as I think upon thee," he says in amount, "thy clemency also
presents itself to my mind, so that I have no doubt that thou wilt be merciful
to me, it being impossible for thee to divest thyself of thy own nature: the
very fact that thou art God is to me a sure guarantee that thou wilt be
merciful<i>.</i>"<i> </i>At the same time let it be understood, that he does not
here speak of a confused knowledge of the grace of God, but of such a knowledge
of it as enables the sinner to conclude with certainty, that as soon as he seeks
God he shall find him ready to be reconciled towards him. It is not therefore
surprising that among the Papists there is no steady calling upon God, when we
consider that, in consequence of their mingling their own merits, satisfactions,
and worthy preparation - as they term it - with the grace of God, they continue
always in suspense and doubt respecting their reconciliation with God. Thus it
comes to pass, that by praying they only augment their own sorrows and torments,
just as if a man should lay wood upon a fire already kindled. Whoever would reap
profit from the exercise of prayer, must necessarily begin with free remission
of sins. It is also proper to mark the final cause - as we say - for which God
is inclined to forgive, and never comes forward without showing himself easy to
be pacified towards those who serve him; which is the absolute necessity of this
hope of obtaining forgiveness, to the existence of piety, and the worship of God
in the world. This is another principle of which the Papists are ignorant. They,
indeed, make long sermons</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe118</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> about the fear of God, but, by keeping
poor souls in perplexity and doubt, they build without a foundation. The first
step to the right serving of God unquestionably is, to submit ourselves to him
willingly and with a free heart. The doctrine which Paul teaches concerning
alms-deeds,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 9:7, that "God loveth a cheerful giver," is to be extended to all
parts of the life. How is it possible for any man to offer himself cheerfully to
God unless he rely upon his grace, and be certainly persuaded that the obedience
lie yields is pleasing to him? When this is not the case all men will rather
shun God, and be afraid to appear in his presence, and if they do not altogether
turn their back upon him, they will catch at subterfuges. In short, the sense of
God's judgment, unless conjoined with the hope of forgiveness, strikes men with
terror, which must necessarily engender hatred. It is no doubt true, that the
sinner, who, alarmed at the Divine threatenings, is tormented in himself, does
not. despise God, but yet lie shuns him; and this shunning of him is downright
apostasy and rebellion. Whence it follows, that men never serve God aright
unless they know that he is a gracious and merciful being. The other reason to
which I have adverted must also be remembered, which is, that unless we are
assured that what we offer to God is acceptable to him, we will be seized with
indolence and stupidity which will keep us from doing our duty. Although
unbelievers often show a great deal of earnestness, just as we see the Papists
laboriously occupied with their superstitions, yet, from their not being
persuaded that God is reconciled to them, they do not all the while render to
him any voluntary obedience. Were they not held back by a slavish fear, the
horrible rebellion of their heart, which this fear keeps hidden and suppressed,
would soon manifest itself
externally.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

general that God is ready to show mercy to poor sinners who betake themselves to
him, the Psalmist concludes that he is thereby encouraged to entertain good
hope. The past tense in the verbs <i>wait </i>and <i>trust </i>is put for the
present</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>. I have
waited</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for <i>I wait; I have hoped
</i>for <i>I hope. </i>The repetition occurring in the first part of the verse
is emphatic; and the word <i>soul </i>gives additional emphasis, implying, as it
does, that the Prophet trusted in God even with the deepest affections of his
heart. From this we also gather that he was not only patient and constant in the
sight. of men, but that even in the inward feelings of his heart he had
maintained quietness and patience before God; which is a very evident proof of
faith. Many, no doubt, are restrained by vain glory from openly murmuring
against God or betraying their distrust, but there is hardly one in ten who,
when removed from the inspection of his fellow-men, and in his own heart, waits
for God with a quiet mind. The Psalmist adds, in the concluding clause, that
what supported his patience was the confidence which he reposed in the divine
promises. Were these promises taken away, the grace of God would necessarily
vanish from our sight, and thus our hearts would fail and be overwhelmed with
despair. Besides, he teaches us, that our being contented with the word of God
alone affords a genuine proof of our hope. When a man, embracing the word,
becomes assured of having his welfare attended to by God, this assurance will be
the mother of waiting or patience. Although the Prophet here speaks to himself
for the purpose of confirming his faith, yet there is no doubt that he suggests
to all the children of God like matter of confidence in reference to themselves.
In the first place he sets before them the word, that they may depend entirely
upon it; and next he warns them that faith is vain and ineffectual unless it
frame us to patience.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My soul hath waited for the
Lord before the watchers of the morning.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>In this verse he expresses both the ardor and the perseverance of his
desire. In saying that he anticipated the watchmen, he shows by this similitude
with what diligence and alacrity he breathed after God. And the repetition is a
proof of his perseverance; for there is no doubt that thereby he intended to
express an uninterrnitted continuance of the same course, and consequently
perseverance. Both these qualities in his exercise, are worthy of attention; for
it is too manifest how slow and cold we are in elevating our minds to God, and
also how easily we are shaken and even fall at every little blast of wind.
Farther, as the watches of the night were in ancient times usually divided into
four parts, this passage may be explained as implying that as the watchmen of
the night, who keep watch by turns, are careful in looking when the morning will
dawn, so the Prophet looked to God with the greatest attention of mind. But the
more natural sense seems to be, that as in the morning the warders of the gates
are more wakeful than all other people, and are the earliest in rising, that
they may appear at the posts assigned them, so the mind of the Prophet hastened
with all speed to seek God. The repetition, as I have already observed:, shows
that he stood keeping his gaze perseveringly fixed upon its object. We must
always beware of allowing our fervor to languish through the weariness of delay,
should the Lord for any length of time keep us in
suspense.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

and exhibited in his own person an example for all to follow, he now applies the
doctrine to the whole body of the Church. It is to be noticed that the
foundation upon which he would have the hope of all the godly to rest is the
mercy of God, the source from which redemption springs. In the first clause he
reminds them that although they bring with them no worth or merits of their own,
it ought to suffice them that God is merciful. This mutual relation between the
faith of the Church and the free goodness of God is to be attentively marked, to
the end we may know that all those who, depending upon their own merits,
persuade themselves that God will be their rewarder, have not their hope
regulated according to the rule of Scripture. From this mercy, as from a
fountain, the Prophet derives redemption; for there is no other cause which
moves God to manifest himself as the redeemer of his people but his mercy. He
describes this redemption as <i>plenteous, </i>that the faithful, even when
reduced to the last extremity, may sustain themselves from the consideration
that there are in the hand of God many and incredible means by which to save
them. This Psalm may have been composed at a time when the Church was in so very
afflicted a condition as might have discouraged one and all, had not the
infinite greatness of the power of God served as a buckler to defend them. The
true use of the present doctrine is, first, that the faithful, even when plunged
in the deepest gulfs, should not doubt of their deliverance being in the hand of
God, who, whenever necessity shall require, will be able to find means, which
are now hidden and unknown to us; and, secondly, that they should hold it as
certain, that as often as the Church shall be afflicted he will manifest himself
to be her deliverer. To this truth the sentence immediately following
refers.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall redeem Israel
from all his iniquities.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here the
Psalmist applies more closely to the Church what he has said in the preceding
verse. He concludes that it is not to be doubted that God, who has it in his
power to save by multiplied means, will prove himself the deliverer of the
people whom he has chosen. By these words he teaches us, that when we have
evidence of our being adopted by God, we ought also to regard our salvation as
certain. His meaning might be explained more familiarly in this way: As to
redeem is the continual office of God, and as he is not the redeemer of all men
indiscriminately, but only of his chosen people, there is no reason for
apprehending that the faithful will not emerge from all calamities; for were it
otherwise, God would cease to execute the office which he claims to himself. He
repeats the sentiment of the preceding verse, that, provided Israel with all
humility draw near to God to plead for pardon, his sins will not be an obstacle
in the way of God's showing himself his redeemer. Although the Hebrew word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;w[
</font><font face="Palatino"><i>, avon, </i>is often put for the punishment of
sin, yet it also contains a tacit reference to the fault. Whenever, then, God
promises a mitigation of the punishment, he at the same time gives assurance
that he will pardon the sins; or rather in offering to sinners a gratuitious
reconciliation, he promises them forgiveness. According to this exposition it is
here said that he will redeem his Church, not from the captivity of Babylon, or
from the tyranny and oppression of enemies, or from penury, or, in short, from
any other disasters but from sin; for until God pardon the sins of the men whom
he afflicts, deliverance is not to be hoped for. Let us then learn from this
passage in what way we are to expect deliverance from all calamities, or the
order which it becomes us to observe in seeking it. Remission of sins always
goes first, without which nothing will come to a favorable issue. Those who only
desire to shake off the punishment are like silly invalids, who are careless
about the disease itself with which they are afflicted, provided the symptoms
which occasion them trouble for a time are removed. In order, then, that God may
deliver us from our miseries, we must chiefly endeavor to be brought to a state
of favor with him by obtaining the remission of our sins. If this is not
obtained, it will avail us little to have the temporal punishment remitted; for
that often happens even to the reprobate themselves. This is true and
substantial deliverance, when God, by blotting out our sins, shows himself
merciful towards us. Whence, also, we gather, that having once obtained
forgiveness, we have no reason to be afraid of our being excluded from free
access to, and from enjoying the ready exercise of, the loving-kindness and
mercy of God; for </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to redeem from
iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is equivalent to moderating
punishments or chastisements. This serves as an argument to disprove the
preposterous invention of the Papists respecting satisfactions and purgatory, as
if God, in forgiving the fault, still reserved for a future time the execution
of the punishment upon the sinner. If it is objected that the Lord sometimes
punishes those whom he has already pardoned; in reply, I grant that he does not
always, at the very moment in which he reconciles men to himself, show them the
tokens of his favor, for he chastises them to render them circumspect for the
future, but while he does this, he in the meantime fails not to moderate his
rigour. This, however, forms no part of the satisfactions by which the Papists
imagine that they present to God the half of the price of their redemption. In
innumerable passages of Scripture, where God promises to his people outward
blessings, he always begins with a promise of the pardon of sin. It is therefore
the grossest ignorance to say, that God does not remit the punishment till they
have pacified him by their works. Moreover, while God's intention in inflicting
some punishments or chastisements upon the faithful, is to. bring them to yield
a more perfect obedience to his law, the Papists are mistaken in extending these
punishments beyond death. But it is not wonderful to find them heaping together
so many heathenish dreams, seeing they adhere not to the true and only way of
reconciliation, which is, that God is merciful only to such as seek the
expiation of their sins in the sacrifice of Christ. It is to be noticed that it
is said <i>from all iniquities, </i>that poor sinners, although they feel
themselves to be guilty in many ways, may not cease to cherish the hope that God
will be merciful to them.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Jehovah! My heart has not
been elated</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David had been made head
over God's people, and in order to prove that he was their lawful prince,
entitled to the allegiance of the faithful, he is desirous to show that he had
not been influenced, in anything which he had attempted, by ambition or pride,
but had submitted himself with a quiet and humble spirit to the divine disposal.
In this he teaches us a very useful lesson, and one by which we should be ruled
in life &#8212; to be contented with the lot which God has marked out for us, to
consider what he calls us to, and not to aim at fashioning our own lot - to be
moderate in our desires, to avoid entering upon rash undertakings, and to
confine ourselves cheerfully within our own sphere, instead of attempting great
things. He denies that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his heart
had, been lifted up,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for this is the
true cause of all unwarranted rashness and presumption in conduct Is not pride
what leads men, under the instigation of their passions, to dare such
presumptuous flights, to hurry on recklessly in their course, and throw the
whole world into confusion? Were this loftiness of spirit checked, the
consequence would be, that all men would study moderation of conduct. His
eyes<i> </i>were not; lifted up; there were no symptoms of pride in his looks or
gestures, as elsewhere
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191828&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
18:28) we find proud looks condemned. Something more than this, however, may be
intended, That while he put a restraint upon the risings of ambition in his
heart, he was careful that his eyes should not lend their assistance to the
heart in any covetous aspirations after greatness. All the senses, in short, as
well as his heart, were subjected to the restraints of humility. In denying that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he walked
in</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or <i>was conversant with, great
things, </i>he must be supposed to refer to the disposition or temper of his
soul. For, to hold as he did the office of a Prophet, to be invested with regal
dignity, nay, to sit upon the sacred throne of the only-begotten Son of God, not
to speak of other distinctions with which he was honored above the generality of
men, were great things. But the expression was applicable, in so far as he
strictly confined himself to the one object of being serviceable to God and to
the Church. Should any still be inclined to lay an undue stress upon the word
which is here employed, I would observe that the words <i>from </i>or <i>above
me, </i>at the close of the verse, are to be considered as connected with what
David here says of great things, as well as of the things
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shut
up,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hidden</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>so that we may read  I have <i>not walked in great things which are above
me. </i>The question, therefore, was not whether the lot of David was mean or
exalted; it is enough that he was careful not to pass beyond the proper bounds
of his calling. He did not think himself at liberty to move one step unless
called to it by God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">His submission in such
matters stands contrasted with the presumption of those who, without any call
from God, hurry themselves into unwarrantable undertakings, and involve
themselves in duties which properly belong to others; for so long as we have a
clear call from God things cannot be said to be shut up or hidden from us, or
too great for us, provided we stand ready for all obedience; and, on the other
hand, those who yield themselves up to the influence of ambition will soon lose
themselves in a labyrinth of perplexity. We see how God confounds the proud and
boasted enterprises of the children of this world. They run the full course of
their wild career, they turn the earth upside down at their pleasure, and put
forth their hand in every direction; they are filled with complacency at the
thought of their own talents and industry, and, in a moment, when all their
plans have been fully formed, they are entirely overthrown, because there is no
solidity in them. There are two different forms which the presumption of those
takes who will not submit to be humble followers of God, but must needs run
before him. Some rush forward with a reckless precipitancy, and seem as if they
would build to the skies; others do not so openly exhibit the inordinateness of
their desires, are slower in their movements, and cautiously calculate upon the
future, and yet their presumption appears no less from the very fact, that, with
a total oversight of God, as if heaven and earth were subject to them. they pass
their decree as to what shall be done by them some ten or twenty years
hereafter. These build, as it were, in the deep sea. But never shall it come to
the surface, however extended may be the term of their lives; while those who,
like David, submit themselves to God, keeping in their own sphere, moderate in
their desires, will enjoy a life of tranquillity and
assurance.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

appropriately explains what he meant, and likens himself to a weaned child; by
which is intended, that he dismissed all the anxieties which disquiet the man of
ambition, and was willing to be satisfied with small things. This assertion,
which some might be inclined to disbelieve, he makes with an oath, expressed in
that particular form of which I have elsewhere taken notice, in which the

are not agreed respecting the penman of this Psalm, though there is little doubt
that it was either David or Solomon. At the solemn dedication of the Temple,
when Solomon prayed, several verses are mentioned in the sacred history as
having been quoted by him, from which we may infer that the Psalm was
sufficiently well known to the people, or that Solomon applied a few words of it
for an occasion in reference to which he had written the whole Psalm. The name
of David is prominently mentioned, because it was to him that the continuance of
the kingdom and Temple was promised, and though dead, this could not affect the
truthfulness of God's word. The Church could very properly pray in the manner
which is here done, that God would perform what he had promised to his servant
David, not as a private individual, but in favor of all his people. It was
therefore a preposterous idea of the Papists to argue from this passage that we
may be benefitted by the intercession of the dead. Just as if the faithful were
here to be understood as calling up an advocate from the tomb to plead their
cause with God, when it is abundantly evident from the context that they look
entirely to the covenant which God had made with David, knowing well that though
given to one man, it was with the understanding that it should be communicated
to all. There is a propriety why mention should be made of his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>affliction</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>or <i>humiliation. </i>Some render the word <i>meekness, </i>but there is no
reason for this whatsoever. In
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;140642&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ydsj</font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>that is, <i>mercies, </i>which I consider to be there understood in the
passive sense, as meaning the benefits which had been conferred upon David; but
I am clearly of opinion that here the reference is to the anxious cares, the
numerous difficulties and struggles which David had to undergo, so long as he
was kept by God in suspense. Remember, as if it had been said, the great
anxieties, the heavy troubles, which David endured before he came to the
kingdom, and how fervently and earnestly he desired to build the Temple, though
he was not allowed to do it during his whole life. The dangers, labors, and
troubles which he underwent, must clearly have confirmed the faith of God's
people in the truth of the divine oracle, inasmuch as they showed how firmly and
certainly he was himself convinced of the truth of what God had spoken. Some
insert the copulative reading, <i>remember David and affliction; </i>but of this
I do not approve. The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ta</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>eth, </i>rather denotes that special respect in which they would have David
remembered, viz., as regarded his afflictions, or that he might come forth
before the view of God with his afflictions, and obtain his desire according to
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who sware to
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>One affliction of David is
particularly mentioned, That he was filled with perplexity on account of the
situation of the Ark. Moses had commanded the people ages before to worship God
in the place which he had chosen.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
12:5.) David knew that the full time had now arrived when the particular place
should be made apparent, and yet was in some hesitation &#8212; a state of
things which was necessarily attended with much anxiety, especially to one who
was so ardently attached to the worship of God, and so vehemently desirous to
have the fixed presence of God with the nation, for its defense and government.
It is said that he swore to see to the building of the Temple, and to postpone
every other consideration to the accomplishment of this
object.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe127</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The objurgation may seem to assume a
somewhat too harsh and severe form, when he declares his resolution to refuse
sleep, his food, and the common supports of life, until a place should have been
set apart for the Temple. To have acted in this way would have been to show an
inconsiderate zeal, for it did not become him to prescribe the time to God, nor
was it possible for him to endure any number of fasting days or sleepless
nights. Then when are we to consider that this vow was taken? I am aware indeed
that some Hebrew writers judge it to have been at that period when he fell down
trembling at the sight of the angel; but, without denying that the plot of
ground was pointed out to him immediately after that circumstance, it is
altogether a forced and unsupported conjecture to say, that what had so long
been in the thoughts of David was conceived at that exact time. Nor is there
anything which should prevent us from supposing that his language is here to be
understood as hyperbolical, and that this was not a vow in the strict form of
it, but to be understood in a qualified sense - that he would never enter his
house, nor ascend his couch, without feeling a concern upon this subject. He
felt persuaded that the settlement of the sanctuary was intimately connected
with the state of the kingdom; and we need not be surprised that so long as he
was kept in uncertainty regarding the place of the Temple, he should scarcely
have felt assured of his very crown, and have been incapable of sharing the
ordinary comforts of life with any satisfaction. Still, where Scripture has been
silent we can say nothing certain; and I may throw out these things as what
seems to me the most probable interpretation. And I think the sense of the
passage may very well bear to be that which I have mentioned, That until
informed of the place of the Ark's destined residence, David was full of concern
and anxiety, dwelling in his house, or when he lay upon his bed. As to the vow
itself, this and other passages afford no ground for supposing, with the
Papists, that God approves of whatever vows they may utter, without regard to
the nature of them. To vow unto God that which he has himself declared to be
agreeable to him, is a commendable practice; but it is too much presumption on
our part to say that we will rush upon such vows as suit our carnal inclination.
The great thing is that we consider what is agreeable to his will, otherwise we
may be found depriving him of that wherein indeed his principal right lies, for
with him "to obey is better than sacrifice."

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ephratha</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>because the Ark of the Covenant was never placed there. If the reference be
to past time, Shiloh should have been the place mentioned; but as it is plain
the Psalmist speaks of its new <i>residence, </i>the question returns, why
Ephratha and not Zion is specified? Some would get rid of the difficulty by
resorting to a frivolous conceit, That the place had two names, and that the
plat of ground which was shown to David

Samuel 24:18;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;132118&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

account Jerome styles it

</i>and yet is not very consistent with himself, for in another place, when he

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrp
</font><font face="Palatino"><i>parah, </i>which means to <i>bear fruit;
</i>just as Bethlehem, which is situated in the same quarter, was called for its
fruitfulness "the house of bread." But any conjecture founded upon the mere name
of the place is necessarily unsatisfactory, and we must seek some more probable
explanation. I might begin by mentioning one which is not without force. A rumor
had spread that the Ark of the Covenant was to be deposited in Ephratha, which
was the place of David's nativity</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe129</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, and we may suppose at least that his
native soil would seem to many the most appropriate locality for the Ark and
Sanctuary. We can easily understand how such an opinion should get abroad. In
that case the hearing referred to by the Psalmist alludes to the report which
had been circulated. Should this be taken as the meaning, the verb would be in
the pluperfect tense, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we HAD
heard that it was in Ephratha</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>but we
found it in the woods, that is, in a place by no means so attractive or well
cultivated. Jerusalem might be said to be woody, because we know that it was
surrounded by mountains, and that it was by no means in a part of the country
which was noted for fruitfulness. There is another meaning which I would submit
to the judgment of the reader. Let us suppose that the faithful here say that
they had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heard of its being in
Ephratha</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because God had spoken still
greater things of Ephratha than of Zion. It is true that the memorable
prediction
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;330502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah
5:2) had not yet been given, yet it may have been that God had already issued
some very great and signal prophecy regarding Bethlehem. We have heard, as if
they had said, of Bethlehem, but it is only as yet a dim expectation which we
have in reference to that place, and in the meantime we must worship God in this
place of the woods, looking forward to the fulfillment of the promise regarding
Ephratha. This interpretation, however, is far fetched, nor would I venture to
adopt it, or at least recommend it to others as the right one. The simpler way
seems to be to understand the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ephratha</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>as applying to David personally, and not so much to the place of that name,
the declaration of the Psalmist being to this effect - that now when God had
chosen a king from Ephratha, the place would necessarily<i> </i>at the same time
be marked out for the Ark of the Covenant. It is said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have
heard</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for the fixing of the place of
the Sanctuary depended upon the will of God; nor until this was declared could
men determine it according to their own fancy. The fact that now upon David's
mounting the throne this illustrious oracle concerning the permanent settlement
of the Temple was to take effect, afforded good ground of thanksgiving. We have
proof here that the people of God did not deposit the Ark at random in any
place, but had express directions from God himself as to the place where he
would be worshipped - all proper worship proceeding from faith, while faith
cometh by hearing.

habitations.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here he dictates to all the
Lord's people a common form of mutual exhortation to the duty of going up to the
place which had been pointed out by the Angel. The clearer the intimation God
may have given of his will, the more alacrity should we show in obeying it.
Accordingly, the Psalmist intimates that now when the people had ascertained
beyond all doubt the place of God's choice, they should admit of no
procrastination, and show all the more alacrity as God was calling them more
closely, and with a more privileged familiarity, to himself, now that he had
selected a certain place of rest amongst them. He thus passes a virtual
condemnation upon the lukewarmness of those whose zeal does not increase in
proportion to the measure of revelation which they enjoy.

</i>are spoken of in the plural number, and this it may be (though we may doubt
whether the Psalmist had such minute distinctions in his eye) because there was
in the temple an inner sanctuary, a middle apartment, and then the court. It is
of more importance to attend to the epithet which follows, where the Psalmist
calls the Ark of the Covenant <i>God's footstool, </i>to intimate that the
sanctuary could never contain the immensity of God's essence, as men were apt
absurdly to imagine. The mere outward temple with all its majesty being no more
than his foot. stool, his people were called upon to look upwards to the heavens
and fix their contemplations with due reverence upon God himself. We know that
they were prohibited from forming any low and carnal view of him. Elsewhere, it
is true, we find it called "God's<i> </i>face,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;192808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
28:8,) to confirm the faith of the people in looking to this divine symbol which
was set before them. Both ideas are brought out very distinctly in the passage
before us, that, on the one hand, it is mere superstition to suppose God
confined to the temple, and that, on the other hand, the external symbols are
not without their use in the Church - that, in short, we should improve these as
helps to our faith, but not rest in them. While God dwells in heaven, and is
above all heavens, we must avail ourselves of helps in rising to the knowledge
of him; and in giving us symbols of his presence, he sets, as it were, his feet
upon the earth, and suffers us to touch them. It is thus that the Holy Spirit
condescends for our profit, and in accommodation to our infirmity, raising our
thoughts to heavenly and divine things by these worldly elements. In reference
to this passage, we are called to notice the amazing ignorance of the Second
Council of Nice, in which these worthy weak
Fathers</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe130A</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of ours wrested it into a proof of
idolatry, as if David or Solomon commanded the people to erect statues to God
and worship them. Now, that the Mosiac ceremonies are abolished we worship at
the footstool of God, when we yield a reverential submission to. his word, and
rise from the sacraments to a true spiritual service of him. Knowing that God
has not descended from heaven directly or in his absolute character, but that.
his feet, are withdrawn from us, being placed on a footstool, we should be
careful to rise to him by the intermediate steps. Christ is he not only on whom
the feet of God rest, but in whom the whole fullness of God's essence and glory
resides, and in him, therefore, we should seek the Father. With this view he
descended, that we might rise
heavenward.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>

fe130</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Such language as this, inviting
the great God who fills heaven and earth to come into a new place of residence,
might seem strange and harsh, but the external symbols of religion which God had
appointed are spoken of in these exalted terms to put honor upon them, and the
better to ensure to them the regard of God's people. Should God institute no
medium of intercourse, and call us to a direct communication with heaven, the
great distance at which we stand from him would strike us with dismay, and
paralyze invocation. Although, therefore, he does not thereby change place
himself, he is felt by us to draw sensibly nearer. It was thus that he descended
amongst his ancient people by the Ark of the Covenant, which he designed to be a
visible emblem of his power and grace being present amongst them. Accordingly,
the second clause of the verse is of an exegetical <i>character, </i>informing
the Church that God was to be understood as having come in the sense of making a
conspicuous display of his power in connection with the Ark. Hence it is called
the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ark of his
strength</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>not a mere dead idle shadow to
look upon, but what certainly declared God's nearness to his Church. By the

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let thy

for the prosperity of the Church, as what stood intimately connected with the
previous statement, the promotion of our best interests being the great end for
which God dwells amongst us. Some construe the words into a wish that the
worship of God might be maintained in its purity, and think that the Psalmist
prays that the priests might be clothed with holiness in allusion to their
sacred garments. Upon a closer view of the words and the whole context, I am
rather inclined to be of another opinion, and to consider this a prayer that the
righteousness of God might be displayed amongst the people, being as an ornament
upon the priests, and communicating joy to all the people. Thus I take
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to mean the fruit or effects of righteousness, and this the righteousness of
God, not of men. The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>priests</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>are of course mentioned first, as holding a higher place in the appointed
order of the Church; while they have their due place assigned to them, it is
still the Church collectively to which the prayer refers as though the Psalmist
requested that the glory of this righteousness should be reflected from the
priests upon the people generally. God:is said to clothe us with his
righteousness when he appears as our Savior and help, defends us by his power,
and shows in his government of us that we are the objects of his care. The
<i>rejoicing </i>which is spoken of must have reference to a life of happiness.
And these two things being joined together may convince us that by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness
</i></font><font face="Palatino">nothing else is meant than God's guardianship
and government. Consistently with this we find it said afterwards - " Thy
priests shall be clothed with salvation;" and I may add, that Solomon:. in the
solemn prayer already referred to,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;140641&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 6:41,) makes no mention of righteousness, but of salvation. I have
repeatedly given the reason why the saints of God are called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ydysj
</font><font face="Palatino"><i>chasidim, </i>or <i>merciful ones, </i>because
mercy or beneficence is that grace which assimilates us most to
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
132:10-12	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b> For thy servant
David's sake turn not away the face of thy Christ. <b>11.</b> Jehovah has sworn
to David in truth, nor will he turn from it; of the fruit of thy belly will I

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thy servant David's
sake,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>etc. Some would connect the first
part of the verse with the preceding. without adducing reasons against this, it
must at once strike the reader that this verse must be taken together. Before
entering upon an explanation of the Psalmist's meaning I may just say that it
would be to put a forced sense upon the words were we to understand by
<i>turning away the face of thy Christ - </i>depriving<i> </i>us of a view of
the Redeemer. We may infer with certainty from Solomon's prayer, that they are a
request that God would show favor to the king. The same expression is employed
by Bathsheba in the request which she made to her son Solomon, "Turn<i> </i>not
away thy face," meaning that he would not cast her out of his sight.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;110220&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 2:20.) It is an expression tantamount to <i>shewing displeasure; </i>and
we might say a word or two in reference to it because the other idea of
referring the words to our Redeemer is plausible, and might mislead persons of
little discernment. Nothing more, then, is here asked than that God would not
despise and reject the prayers which David had preferred in the name of all the
people. The favor is asked for David's sake, only because God had made a
covenant with him. So far as that privilege was concerned, he did not stand
exactly upon the footing of any other ordinary man. The prayer, in short, is to
the effect that God in remembrance of his promise would show favor to the
posterity of David, for though this prayer for the Church must be considered as
dictated to each of the kings, the foundation was in the person of David. The
Church was thus taught figuratively that Christ, as Mediator, would make
intercession for all his people. As yet he had not appeared in the flesh, nor
entered by the sacrifice of himself into the Holiest of all, and in the meantime
the people had a figurative Mediator to embolden them in their
supplications.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah sware unto
David.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe131</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here he brings out the idea
still more clearly, that the only thing he had respect to in David was the free
promise which God had made to him. He takes notice of the fact, as confirmatory
to his faith, that God had ratified the promise by oath. As to the particular
words used, he speaks of God having sworn in truth, that is, not fallaciously,
but in good faith, so that no doubt could be entertained of his departing from
his word. The thing promised was a successor to David of his own seed; for
though he did not want children, he had already almost despaired of the regular
succession, from the fatal confusions which prevailed in his family, and the
discord which internally rent his household, and might eventually ruin it.
Solomon was particularly marked out, but the promise extended to a continuous
line of successors. This arrangement affected the welfare of the whole Church,
and not of David only, and the people of Godare encouraged by the assurance,
that the kingdom which he had established amongst them was possessed of a sacred
and enduring stability. Both king and people needed to be reminded of this
divine foundation upon which it rested. We see how insolently the sovereigns of
this world often deport themselves - filled with pride, though in words they may
acknowledge that they reign by the grace of God. How often, besides, do they
violently usurp the throne; how rarely do they come to it in a regular manner. A
distinction is therefore drawn between the kingdoms of this world and that which
David held by the sacred tenure of God's own
oracle.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If thy sons keep my
covenant.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>More distinct. notice is now
taken of the descending<i> </i>line, by which the perpetuity of the
succession,<i> </i>as I have already shown, is pointed out. Sons of princes
commonly succeed them in this world by right of inheritance, but there was this
undoubted peculiarity of privilege in the case of David's kingdom, that God
expressly declared that he would always have a descendant from his body upon the
throne, not for one age merely, but for ever. For though that kingdom was for a
time destroyed, it was restored again, and had its everlasting establishment in
Christ. Here the question occurs - Did the continuance of the kingdom rest upon
good conduct, or human merit? for the terms of this agreement would seem to
suggest that God's covenant would not be made good, unless men faithfully
performed their part, and that thus the effect of the grace promised was
suspended upon obedience. We must remember, in the first place, that the
covenant was perfectly gratuitous, so far as related to God's promise of sending
a Savior and Redeemer, because this stood connected with the original adoption
of those to whom the promise was made, which was itself free. Indeed the
treachery and rebellion of the nation did not prevent God from sending forth his
Son, and this was a public proof that he was not influenced by the consideration
of their good conduct. Hence Paul says,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:3,)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"What<i> </i>if some did
not believe</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">is therefore the truth
of God of none effect?"</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">intimating that God had not withdrawn his favor from
the Jews, having chosen them freely of his grace. We know, too, that
notwithstanding their efforts, as if it had been of set purpose, to destroy the
promises, God met their malicious opposition with displays of his marvellous
love, made his truth and faithfulness to emerge in a most triumphant manner, and
showed that he stood firm to his own purpose, independently of any merit of
theirs. This may serve to show in what sense the covenant was not conditional;
but as there were other things which were accessories to the
covenant,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe132</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> a condition was appended, to the effect
that God would bless them if they obeyed his commandments. The Jews, for
declining from this obedience, were removed into exile. God seemed at that time
"to<i> </i>make void or profane his covenant," as we have seen elsewhere. The
dispersion was a kind of breaking of the covenant, but only in part and to
appearance. This will be brought out more clearly by reference to what we learn,
from sacred history, to have occurred shortly after David's death. By the
defection of the ten tribes the kingdom suffered a severe blow, only a small
portion of it being left. Afterwards it was reduced by fresh disasters, till at
length it was torn up by the root. And although their return from the captivity
gave some hope of restoration, there was no one bearing the name of king, and
any dignity that attached to Zerubbabel was but obscure, till kings sprung up
who were spurious, and not of the right line. In this case would we not have
said that the covenant of God was abolished? and yet, as the Redeemer came forth
from the very source predicted, it is plain that it stood firm and stable. In
this sense it is said by Ezekiel of the crown,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;262126&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
21:26,)</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">where the Prophet might seem to cancel what God had
written with his own hand, and nullify his promise, for the safety of the people

in the Lamentations,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, we say, might seem to strike directly
against the covenant made by God, when he speaks of the crown being taken away,
and yet what he adds in the subsequent part of the sentence, proves that
covenant, in so far as it was gratuitous, to have been everlasting and
inviolable, since he holds out the promise of the Redeemer, notwithstanding the
conduct of the Jews, which was such as to exclude them temporarily from the
divine, favor. God, on the one hand, took vengeance upon the people for their
ingratitude, so as to show that the terms of the covenant did not run
conditionally to no purpose; while on the other, at the coming of Christ there
was a free performance of what had been freely promised, the crown being set
upon Christ's head. The obedience which God demands is particularly stated to be
the obedience of his covenant, to teach us that we must not serve him by human
inventions, but confine ourselves within the prescription of his
word.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

priesthood and sanctuary service, he declares it still more emphatically to have
been of divine and not human appointment. The connection is not to be
overlooked, on another account. The true strength and stability of that kingdom
were in Christ, and Christ's kingdom is inseparable from his priesthood. This
may explain why mention is made of Zion being chosen. God decreed nothing in
relation to the kingdom, but what had a certain connection with the sanctuary,
the more perfectly to prefigure the Mediator who was to come, and who was both
priest and king, after the order of Melchizedek. The kingdom and tabernacle
were, therefore, closely allied. Notice is taken of the reason upon which the
choice proceeded - that mount Zion was not chosen for any excellency belonging
to it, as we have seen,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;196816&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
68:16,) but because such was the will of God. His good pleasure is specified in
contrast with any merit in the place itself. This is another proof of what we
have already stated - that the covenant made by God with David proceeded from
his mere goodness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is my rest for
ever.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The same truth is here put into
the mouth of God, to give it additional weight; and it is declared not to have
been in vain that the Temple had been erected, since God would show effectually
and by practical testimonies the delight which he had in the worship of his own
appointment. God's resting, or talking up his habitation, are expressions which
denote his being present with men in the manifestation of his power. Thus <i>he
dwelt in Zion, </i>in the sense that there his people worshipped him according
to the prescription of his law, and found besides the benefit of the service in
his favorable answer to their requests. It was eventually seen, in a very
striking manner, that this was the promise of an infallible God, whet, after the
Temple had been overthrown, the altar cast down, and the whole frame of legal
service interrupted, the glory of the Lord afterwards returned to it once more,
and remained there up to the advent of Christ. We all know in what a wicked and
shameful manner the Jews abused the divine promise which is here made, under the
impression that it necessarily laid God under an obligation to favor them,
taking occasion from if, in the pride of their hearts, to despise, and even
cruelly persecute the Prophets. Luther on this account calls it "the bloody
promise;"<i> </i>for, like all hypocrites who make God's holy name a covert for
iniquity, they did not hesitate, when charged with the, worst, crimes, to insist
that it was beyond the power of the Prophets to take from them privileges which
God had bestowed. With them to assert that the Temple could be stripped of its
glory, was equivalent to charging God with falsehood, and impeaching his
faithfulness. Under the influence of this spirit of vain confidence they
proceeded such inconceivable lengths in shedding innocent blood. Were the Devil
of Rome armed with pretensions as splendid, what bounds would be set to its
audacity? As it is, we see how fiercely, and with what bloody pride it arrogates
the name of the Church, while outraging all religion, in open contempt of God
and flagrant violation of humanity. But what of that? the hierarchy would
otherwise fall, and this must stand, if Christ would not desert his spouse the
Church! The refutation of such a plea is not far to seek. The Church is limited
to no one place: now that the glory of the Lord shines through all the earth,
his rest is where Christ and his members are. It is necessary that we rightly
understand what the Psalmist says of the everlasting continuance of the Temple.
The advent of Christ was "the time of reformation," and the figures of the
former Testament, instead of being then proved or rendered vain, were
substantiated, and received their fulfillment in him. If it be still objected
that mount Zion is here spoken of as the everlasting residence of God, it is
sufficient to answer that the whole world became an enlarged mount Zion upon the
advent of Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessing I will

of the people was what constituted the great source of their blessedness; and
now some of the proofs are mentioned which he would give of his fatherly regard,
such as preparing and administering their ordinary food, relieving their wants,
clothing their priests with salvation, and filling all his people with joy and
gladness. This it was necessary should be added, for unless we have ocular
demonstration of the divine goodness, we are not spiritual enough to rise
upwards to the apprehension of it. We have a twofold demonstration of it in the
matter of our daily food; first in the earth's being enriched so as to furnish
us with corn, and wine, and oil; and again in the earth's produce being
multiplied, through a secret power, so as to provide us with sufficient
nourishment. There is here a promise that God would exert a special care over
his own people to supply them with food, and that though they might not have a
great abundance, yet the poor would be satisfied. We must not omit mentioning
the remarkable and ludicrous mistake which the Papists have made upon this
passage, and which shows the judicial stupidity they lie under to be such, that
there is nothing so absurd they will not swallow. By confounding two letters
into one, for <i>victus </i>they read <i>vidus, </i>and then conjectured that

</i>which in Hebrew is very commonly used to signify <i>force </i>or <i>power;
</i>but we are to mark that by the<i> horn budding </i>there is an allusion to
the humble original of the kingdom, and the singular restorations which it
underwent. David was taken from the menial drudgery of the sheepfold, and from
the lowly cottage where he dwelt, the youngest son of his father, who was no
more than an ordinary shepherd, and was advanced to the throne, and rose by a
series of unlooked for successes. Under Jeroboam the kingdom was at an early
period so effectually cut down again, that it was only by budding forth from
time to time that it maintained itself in a moderate degree of advancement.
Afterwards it underwent various shocks, which must have issued in its
destruction, had it not still budded anew. And when the people were dispersed in
the captivity, what must have become of them, had not God made the broken and
trampled horn of David. again to bud? Isaiah accordingly seems to have had this
in his eye when he compared Christ to a rod which should spring not from tree in
full growth, but from a trunk or stem.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah

Samuel 23:5, David makes use of the word employed in the verse before us, but in
somewhat a different sense, referring to the continual advancement of the
kingdom unto further measures of prosperity. Here the inspired penman rather
refers to the singular manner in which God would cause the horn of David to
revive again, when at any time it might. seem broken and withered. The figure of
<i>the lamp </i>is much to the same <i>effect, </i>and occurs in many other
places of Scripture, being a prophecy very generally in the mouths of the
people. The meaning is, that the kingdom, though it underwent occasional
obscurations, would never be wholly extinguished under the calamities which
overtook it, being as the lamp of God constantly burning, and pointing out
safety to the Lord's people, though not shining to a great distance. At that
time all the illumination enjoyed was but the feeble lamp which shone in
Jerusalem; now Christ, the sun of righteousness, sheds a full radiance all over
the world.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>

within. God must keep us from the various harms and evils which come upon us
from without, and hence we have this second promise added, which is one wherein
we recognize often the goodness of God even more than in the blessings which he
may shower upon us in the day of prosperity. The greater that fear which seizes
upon us when exposed to aggression from enemies, the more are we sensibly
awakened to take hold of divine help. The passage teaches us that the Church and
people of God will never enjoy such peace on earth as altogether to escape being
assaulted by the variety of enemies which Satan stirs up for their destruction.
It is enough to have it declared, upon divine authority, that their attempts
shall be unsuccessful, and that they will retire eventually with ignominy and
disgrace. The, clause which follows has been variously interpreted. The verb
which we have translated <i>to flourish, </i>in the Hiphil conjugation means
sometimes <i>to see, </i>so that some have explained the words - In that place
shall the crown of David be seen, when the horn shall have been made to bud.
Some derive the word from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#732;yx</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
tsits, a plate, </i>as if it had been said that the crown of the king would be
resplendent with plates of gold. But I consider that the crown is here said to
<i>flourish, </i>just as formerly the allusion was to budding or germinating.
Isaiah, on the other hand, speaks
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232805&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
28:5)of the crown of drunkenness of Ephraim as being a fading flower. Thus we
have it here declared that however frail to appearance the crown of David might
be in his posterity, it would be invigorated by some secret virtue, and flourish
for ever.</font><br></div>

that David in this Psalm renders thanks to God for the peace and harmony which
had succeeded a long and melancholy state of confusion and division in the
kingdom, and that he would exhort all individually to study the maintenance of
peace. This is the subject enlarged upon, at least so far as the shortness of
the Psalm admits of it. There was ample ground to praise the goodness of God in
the highest terms, for uniting in one a people which had been so deplorably
divided. When he first came to the kingdom the larger part of the nation
considered him in the light of an enemy to the public good, and were alienated
from him. Indeed so mortal was the feud which existed, that nothing else than
the destruction of the party in opposition seemed to hold out the prospect of
peace. The hand of God was wonderfully seen, and most unexpectedly, in the
concord which ensued among them, when these who had been inflamed with the most
violent antipathy cordially coalesced.
This</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe142A</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> peculiarity in the circumstances which
called forth the Psalm has been unfortunately by interpreters, who have
considered that David merely passes a general commendation upon brotherly union,
without any such particular reference. The exclamation with which the Psalm
opens,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is particularly expressive, not only as setting the state of things visibly
before our eyes, but suggesting a tacit contrast between the delightfulness of
peace and those civil commotions which had well-nigh rent the kingdom asunder.
He sets forth the goodness of God in exalted terms, the Jews having by long
experience of intestine feuds, which had gone far to ruin the nation, learned
the inestimable value of union. That this is the sense of the passage appears
still further from the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;g</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gam, </i>at the end of the verse. It is not to be understood with some, who
have mistaken the sense of the Psalmist, as being a mere copulative, but as
adding emphasis to the context. We, as if he had said, who were naturally
brethren, had become so divided, as to view one another with a more bitter
hatred than any foreign foe, but now how well is it that we should cultivate a
spirit of brotherly concord!</font><br><font face="Palatino">There can at the
same time be no doubt; that the Holy Ghost is to be viewed as commending in this
passage that mutual harmony which should subsist amongst all God's children, and
exhorting us to make every endeavor to maintain it. So long as animosities
divide us, and heart-burnings prevail amongst us, we may be brethren no doubt
still by common relation to God, but cannot be judged one so long as we present
the appearance of a broken and dismembered body. As we are one in God the
Father, and in Christ, the union must be ratified amongst us by reciprocal
harmony, and fraternal love. Should it so happen in the providence of God, that
the Papists should return to that holy concord which they have apostatized from,
it would be in such terms as these that we would be called to render
thanksgiving unto God, and in the meantime we are bound to receive into our
brotherly embraces all such as cheerfully submit themselves to the Lord. We are
to set ourselves against those turbulent spirits which the devil will never fail
to raise up in the Church, and be sedulous to retain intercourse with such as
show a docile and tractable disposition. But we cannot extend this intercourse
to those who obstinately persist in error, since the condition of receiving them
as brethren would be our renouncing him who is Father of all, and from whom all
spiritual relationship takes its rise. The peace which David recommends is such
as begins in the true head, and this is quite enough to refute the unfounded
charge of schism and division which has been brought against us by the Papists,
while we have given abundant evidence of our desire that they would <i>coalesce
</i>with us in God's truth, which is the only bond of holy
union.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Like the precious ointment
upon the head.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We have here clear proof
that David, as we have just said, holds all true union among brethren to take
its rise from God, and to have this for its legitimate object, that all may be
brought to worship God in purity, and call upon iris name with one consent.
Would the similitude have been borrowed from holy ointment if it had not been to
denote, that religion must always hold the first
place?</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe143</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Any concord, it is thus insinuated,
which may prevail amongst men, is insipid, if not pervaded by a sweet savor of
God's worship. We maintain, therefore, that men are to be united amongst
themselves in mutual affection, with this as the great end., that they may be
placed together under the government of God. If there be any who disagree with
these terms, we would do well rather to oppose them strenuously, than purchase
peace at the expense of God's honor. We must hold, that when mention is made of
the Priest, it is to intimate, that concord takes its rise in the true and pure
worship of God, while by the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>beard and skirts of the
garments,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>we are led to understand that
the peace which springs from Christ as the head, is diffused through the whole
length and breadth of the Church. The other figure, of the <i>dew </i>distilling
upon:mount Zion and Hermon, denotes, that a holy unity has not only a sweet
savor before <i>God, </i>but is productive of good effects, as the dew moistens
the earth and supplies it with sap and freshness. Moses, we know, said of Judea,
that it was not like Egypt fertilized by the overflowings of its river, but such
as drank daily of the rain of heaven.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051111&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
11:11.) David suggests, that the life of man would be sapless, unprofitable, and
wretched, unless sustained by brotherly harmony. It is evident, that mount
Hermon must have been rich and fruitful, being famed amongst places for pasture.
Mountains depend principally for fertility upon the dews of heaven, and this was
shown in the case of mount Zion. David adds in the close, that God commands his
blessing where peace is cultivated; by which is meant, that he testifies how
much tie is pleased with concord amongst men, by showering down blessings upon
them. The same sentiment is expressed by Paul in other words,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;471311&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 13:11;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;500409&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
4:9,) "Live in peace, and the God of peace shall be with you." Let us then, as
much as lies in us, study to walk in brotherly love, that we may secure the
divine blessing. Let us even stretch out our arms to those who differ from us,
desiring to bid them welcome if they will but return to the unity of the faith.
Do they refuse? Then let them go. We recognize no brotherhood, as I have said
already, except amongst the children of God.</font><br></div>

the Psalm, that the inspired penman addresses priests only, since he prescribes
the form of benediction which they were to offer up for the people, and this was
a duty belonging exclusively to the Priests. It would appear then, that the
Levites are here called servants of God, from the functions they discharged,
being specially appointed, and that by turns, to watch by night in the Temple,
as we read in the inspired history.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;030835&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus

of their duty before their eyes, for they were to be stimulated to devotion by
looking constantly to the Temple. We are to notice the Psalmist's design in
urging the duty of praise so earnestly upon them. Many of the Levites, through
the tendency which there is in all men to abuse ceremonies, considered that
nothing more was necessary than standing idly in the Temple, and thus overlooked
the principal part of their duty. The Psalmist would show that merely to keep
nightly watch over the Temple, kindle the lamps, and superintend the sacrifices,
was of no importance, unless they served God spiritually, and referred all
outward ceremonies to that which must be considered the main sacrifice - the
celebration of God's praises. You may think it a very laborious service, as if
he had said, to stand at watch in the Temple, while others sleep in their own
houses; but the worship which God requires is something more excellent than
this, and demands of you to sing his praises before all the people. In the
second verse he reminds them in addition, of the form observed in calling upon
the name of the Lord. For why do men <i>lift their hands </i>when they pray? Is
it not that their hearts may be raised at the same time to
God?</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe147</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is thus that the Psalmist takes
occasion to reprehend their carelessness in either standing idle in the Temple,
or trifling and indulging in vain conversation, and thus failing to worship God
in a proper manner.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah bless thee out of
Zion!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We have conclusive proof in my
opinion from this verse that the Psalm is to be considered as referring to the
priests and Levites only, for to them it properly belonged under the law to
bless the people.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;040623&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
6:23.) The Psalmist had first told them to bless God; now he tells them to bless
the people in his name. Not that God meant by any such injunction that the
people might themselves indulge in a life of carnal security - an opinion
prevalent among the Papists, who think that if the monks chant in the temples,
this is all the worship necessary on the part of the whole body of the people.
What God intended was, that the priests should lead the way in divine service,
and the people take example by what was done in the temple, and practice it
individually in their private houses. The duty of blessing the people was
enjoined upon the priests, as representing Christ's person. Express mention is
intentionally made of two things, which are in themselves distinct, when the God
who blessed them out of Zion is said to be also the Creator of heaven and earth.
Mention is made of his title as <i>Creator </i>to set forth his power, and
convince believers there is nothing that may not be hoped from God. For what is
the world but a mirror in which we see his boundless power? And those must be
senseless persons indeed, that are not satisfied with the favor of Him who is
recognized by them as having all dominion and all riches in his hand. Since
many, however, are apt, when they hear God spoken of as Creator, to conceive of
him as standing at a distance from them, and doubt their access to him, the
Psalmist makes mention also of that which was a symbol of God's nearness to his
people - and this that they might be encouraged to approach him with the freedom
and unrestrained confidence of persons who are invited to come to the bosom of a
Father. By looking to the heavens, then, they were to discover the power of God
- by looking to Zion, his dwelling-place, they were to recognize his fatherly
love.</font><br></div>

in the same manner with the preceding, the Psalmist would not appear to be
addressing the Levites exclusively, but the people generally, since the reasons
given for praising God are equally applicable to all God's children. No mention
is made of night watching, or of their standing constantly in the Temple. But
indeed, as it was the special duty of the priests to take the lead in this
devotional exercise, to give out, if we might use such an expression, and sing
the praises of God before the people, there is no reason why we should not
suppose that they are primarily addressed, and stirred up to their duty. We need
only to examine the 'words more closely in order to be convinced that the people
are included as next in order to the
priests.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

of disgust which might arise from the very frequent repetition of this

already observed, that there is no sacrifice in which he takes greater delight
than the expression of our gratitude. Thus,

<div><font face="Palatino">Particular attention is to be paid to those passages
of Scripture which speak in such high terms of that worship of God which is
spiritual; otherwise we may be led, in the exercise of a misguided zeal, to
spend our labor upon trifles, and in this respect imitate the example of too
many who have wearied themselves with ridiculous attempts to invent additions to
the service of God, while they have neglected what is of all other things most
important. This is the reason why the Holy Spirit so repeatedly inculcates the
duty of praise. It is that we may not undervalue, or grow careless in this
devotional exercise. It implies, too, an indirect censure of our tardiness in
proceeding to the duty, for he would not reiterate the admonition were we ready
and active in the discharge of it. The expression in the end of the verse
&#8212; <i>because it is sweet, </i>admits of two meanings &#8212; that the name
of God is sweet, as in the previous clause it was said that God is good &#8212;
or, that it is a sweet and pleasant thing to sing' God's praises. The Hebrew
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;y[n</font><font face="Palatino"><i>

But as it was only the children of Abraham who were favored with the knowledge
of God at that time, and were capable of praising him, the Psalmist directs them
to the fact of their ]roving been chosen by God to be his peculiar people, as
affording matter for thanksgiving. The mercy was surely one of incomparable
value, and which might well stir them up to fervent gratitude and praise,
adopted as they were into favor with God, while the whole Gentile world was
passed by. The praise of their election is given by the Psalmist to God &#8212;

their own, but to the free mercy of God the Father which had been extended to
them. He has laid all without exception under obligation to his service,

have here a general description of the power of God, to show the Israelites that
the God they worshipped was the same who made the world, and rules over all
according to his will, neither is there any other besides him. He would not
exclude others when he speaks of having known himself the greatness of God, but
is rather to be considered as taking occasion from his own experience to stir up
men generally to attend to this subject, and awake to the recognition of what
lies abundantly open to observation. The immensity of God is what none can
comprehend; still his glory, so far as was seen fit, has been sufficiently
manifested to leave all the world without excuse for ignorance. How can one who
has enjoyed a sight of the heavens and of the earth shut his eyes so as to
overlook the Author of them without sin of the deepest dye? It is with the view,
then, of stirring us up more effectually, &#8212; that the Psalmist makes
reference to himself in inviting us to the knowledge of God's glory; or rather
he reprehends our carelessness in not being alive enough to the consideration of
it. The second part of the verse makes the truth of the observation which I have
already stated still more apparent, &#8212; that the Psalmist's design was to
retain the Israelites in the service and fear of the one true God, by a
declaration to the effect that the God who cove-nanted with their Fathers was
the same who created heaven and earth, No sooner had he made mention of Jehovah
than he adds his being the God of Israel. It follows as a necessary consequence,
that all who depart from this God prefer a god who has no claim to the title,
and that Jews and Turks, for example, in our own day, are guilty of mere
trifling when they pretend to worship God the Creator of the world. Where
persons have diverged from the law and from the gospel, any show of piety they
may have amounts to a renunciation of the true God. The Psalmist had, therefore,
in his eye when he clothed God with a specific title,, to limit the Israelites
to that.God who was set forth in the doctrine of the Law. If by
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yhla</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Elohim, </i>we understand the false gods of the Gentiles &#8212; the title is
given them only by concession, for it could not be properly assigned to what are
mere lying' vanities; and the meaning is, that God's greatness altogether
eclipses any pretended deity. But the expression would seem to include the
<i>angels, </i>as has been already observed, in whom there is some reflection of
divinity, as being heavenly principalities and powers, but who are exalted by
God, and assigned such a subordinate place as may not interfere with his glory.

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whatsoever doth please
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. This is that immeasurable
greatness of the divine being, of which he had just spoken. He not only founded
heaven and earth at first, but governs all things according to his power. To own
that God made the world, but maintain that he sits idle in heaven, and takes no
concern in the management of it, is to cast an impious aspersion upon his power;
and yet the idea, absurd as it is, obtains wide currency amongst men. They would
not say, perhaps, in so many words, that they believed that God slept in heaven,
but in imagining, as they do, that he resigns the reins to chance or fortune,
they leave him the mere shadow of a power, such as is not manifested in effects;
whereas Scripture teaches us that it is a real practical power, by which he
governs the whole world as he does according to his will. The Psalmist expressly
asserts every part of the world to be under the divine care, and that nothing
takes place by Chance, or without determination. According to a very common
opinion, all the power necessary to be assigned to God in the matter, is that of
a universal providence, which I do not profess to understand. The distinction
here made between the heavens, earth, and waters, denotes a particular
governments. The term

chaphets, </i>is emphatical. The Holy Spirit declares that he does whatsoever
pleases him. That confused sort of divine government which many talk of, amounts
to no more than a certain maintenance of order in the world, without due
counsel. No account whatever is made of his will in this way, for will implies
counsel and method. Consequently there is a special providence exerted in the
government of the various parts of the world, there is:no such thing as chance,
and what appears most fortuitous, is in reality ordered by his secret wisdom. We
are not called to inquire why he wills events which contradict our sense of what
his administration should be, but if we would not unsettle the very foundations
of religion, we must hold by this as a firm principle, that nothing happens
without, the divine will and decree.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
FE160</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> His will may be mysterious, but it is
to be regarded with reverence, as the fountain of all justice and rectitude,
unquestionably entitled as it is to our supreme consideration. For farther
information upon this subject the reader may consult Psalm
115.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Causing the clouds to
ascend</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Psalmist touches upon one or
two particulars, in illustration of the point that nothing takes place of
itself, but by the hand and counsel of God. Our understandings cannot comprehend
a thousandth part of God's works, and it is only a few examples which he brings
forward to be considered:in proof of the doctrine of a divine providence which
he had just announced. He speaks of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the clouds ascending from the
ends of the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for the vapours which
rise out of the earth form clouds, when they accumulate more densely together.
Now who would think that the vapours which we see ascending upwards would
shortly darken the sky, and impend above our heads? It strikingly proves the
power of God, that these thin vapours, which steam up from the ground:, should
form a body over-spreading the whole atmosphere. The Psalmist mentions it as
another circumstance calling for our wonder, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lightnings are mixed with
rain,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>things quite opposite in their
nature one from another. Did not custom make us familiar with the spectacle, we
would pronounce this mixture, of fire and water to be a phenomenon altogether
incredible.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
FE161</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The same may be said of the phenomena
of the winds. Natural causes can be assigned for them, and philosophers have
pointed them out; but the winds, with their various currents, are a wonderful
work of God. He does not merely assert the power of God, be it observed, in the
sense in which philosophers themselves grant it, but he maintains that not a
drop of rain falls from heaven without a divine commission or dispensation to
that effect. All readily allow that God is the author of rain, thunder, and
wind, in so far as he originally established this order of things in nature; but
the Psalmist goes farther than this, holding that when it rains, this is not
effected by a blind instinct of nature, but is the consequence of the decree of
God, who is pleased at one time to darken the sky with clouds, and at another to
brighten it again with
sunshine.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

special benefits, by which God had laid his Church and chosen people under
obligation to his service. As it was the Lord's believing people only whom he
addressed, the chief point singled out as the subject of praise is God's having
adopted them, small as they were in numbers, from the mass of the human family.
Again, there was the fact of his having set himself in opposition, for their
sakes, to great kingdoms and mighty nations. The wonderful works done by God in
Egypt and in Canaan were all just so many proofs of that fatherly love which he
entertained for them as his chosen people. It is not strictly according to
historic order to begin with mentioning the destruction of the first-born of
Egypt; but this is instanced as a memorable illustration of the great regard God
had for the safety of his people, which was such that he would not spare even so
mighty and wealthy a nation. The scope of the passage is to show that God, in
delivering his people, had abundantly testified his power and his
mercy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He smote great
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He comes now to speak of the
end for which God delivered them from their bondage. He did not lead his people
out of Egypt, and then leave them to wander as they might, but brought them
forth that he might settle them in the promised inheritance. This the Psalmist
mentions as another signal proof of the favor of God, and his unwearied kindness
to them; for having once taken the children of Abraham. by the hand, he led them
on, in the continued exercise of his power, till he put them in possession of
the promised land. He takes occasion to extol God's power, from the circumstance
that it was only after the slaughter of many enemies that they came to the
peaceable possession of the country. And it was a striking illustration of the
divine goodness to manifest this preference for the Israelites, who were but a
multitude of inconsiderable persons, while those opposed to them were mighty
kings and powerful nations. Notice is taken of two kings, Sihon and Og, not as
being more powerful than the rest, but because shutting up the entrance to the
land in front they were the first formidable enemies met
with</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe163</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and the people, besides, were not as
yet habituated to war. As the crowning act of the Lord's goodness, the Psalmist
adds, that the Israelites obtained firm possession of the land. One has said

power of God was very<i> </i>eminently displayed in preserving them from 'being

name of God ought always to be kept up in the world, but here the Psalmist
speaks more especially of that everlasting praise which is due to him for
preserving his Church and people, the cause being immediately added &#8212; that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God will judge his
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The whole world is a theater for
the display of the divine goodness, wisdom, justice, and power, but the Church
is the orchestra, as it were &#8212; the most conspicuous part of it; and the
nearer the approaches are that God makes to us the more intimate and
condescending the communication of his benefits, the more attentively are we
called to consider them. The term <i>judging </i>in the Hebrew expresses
whatever belongs to just and legitimate
government,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe165</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the future tense denoting continued
action apparently, as it often does, so that what the Psalmist says is
tantamount to this &#8212; that God would always watch over and preserve his
people, and that being thus under God's guardian care, they would be placed<i>
</i>in safety. Or we may suppose that the Psalmist employs the future tense to
teach us that, under affliction, we must have a sustained hope, not giving way
to despondency, though God may seem to have overlooked and deserted us, since
whatever temporary delays there may be of his help, he will appear as our judge
and defender at the proper season, and when he sees that we have been
sufficiently humbled. This may recommend itself the more to be the true meaning,
because the Psalmist seems to allude to the expression of Moses,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053236&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:36,) whose very words indeed, he quotes. As some alleviation under the divine
chastisements which the people would suffer, Moses foretold that God would come
forth as their judge, to help and deliver them when in extremity. And this the
writer of the present Psalm, whoever he may have been, makes use of with a
general application to the Church, declaring that God would never allow it to be
altogether destroyed, since upon the event of its destruction he would cease to
be a King. To propose changing the tense of the verb into the past, and
understand it of God having shown himself to be the judge of his people against
the Egyptians, puts a feeble sense upon the passage, and one which does not suit
with the context, either of this Psalm or of the address of Moses. The Hebrew
verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;jn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nacham, </i>means either to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>repent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>or to <i>receive comfort, </i>and both meanings answer sufficiently well. On
the,one hand, when God returns in mercy to his people, though this implies no
change in him, yet there is a change apparent in the event itself. Thus he is
said <i>to repent </i>when he begins to show mercy<i> </i>to his people, instead
of manifesting his displeasure in just judgments against them. Again, he is said
to <i>receive consolation, </i>or to be appeased and reconciled towards his
people, when in remembrance of his covenant, which endures for ever, he visits
them with everlasting mercies, though he had corrected them for a moment.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
54:8.) The meaning, in short, is, that the displeasure of God towards his people
is but temporary, and that, in taking vengeance upon their sins, he remembers
mercy in the midst of wrath, as Habakkuk says.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;350302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
3:2.) Thus God is spoken of as man, manifesting a father's affection, and
restoring his children, who deserved to have been cast off, because he cannot
bear' that the fruit of his own body should be torn from him. Such is the sense
of the passage &#8212; that God has a compassion for his people because they are
his children, that he would not willingly be bereaved of them and left
childless, that he is placable towards them, as being dear to him, and that
having recoginsed them as his offspring, he cherishes them with a tender
love.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

of the Psalm has been explained elsewhere, it is needless to insist upon it, and
repetition might be felt irksome by the reader. I shall only in a few words,
therefore, show what is the scope of the Psalmist. In upbraiding the stupidity
of the heathen, who thought that they could not have God near them in any other
way than by resorting to idol worship, he reminds the Israelites of the signal
mercy which they had enjoyed, and would have them abide the more deliberately by
the simplicity and purity of God's worship, and avoid profane superstitions. He
declares, that idolaters only draw down heavier judgments upon themselves, the
more zealous they are in the service of their idols. And there is no doubt,
that, in denouncing the awful judgments which must fall upon the worshippers of
false gods, it is his object to deter such as had been brought up under the word
of God from following their example. In Psalm 115 the exhortation given is to
trust or hope in the Lord; here, to bless him. The Levites are mentioned in
addition to the house of Aaron, there being two orders of priesthood. Every
thing else in the two Psalms is the same, except that, in the last verse:, the
Psalmist here joins himself, along with the rest of the Lord's people, in
blessing God. He says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>out of
Zion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for when God promised to hear
their prayers from that place, and to communicate from it the rich display of
his favor, he thereby gave good ground why they should praise him from
it.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
FE168</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The reason is stated, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he dwelt in
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>which is not to be understood
in the low and gross sense that he was confined to any such narrow residence;
but in the sense, that he was there as to the visible manifestation of his
favor, experience showing, that while his majesty is such as to fill heaven and
earth, his power and. grace were vouchsafed in a particular manner to his own
people.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Psalmist reminds the Lord's people, that unless
they were assiduous in his praises, they were chargeable with defrauding him of
what was justly due to him for his benefits. And, in mentioning each benefit, he

the proper celebration of his praises that we own everything which we receive
from him to be bestowed gratuitously.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

clause again and again in so many short and abrupt sentences, may seem a vain
repetition, but verses repeated by way of chorus are both allowed and admired in
profane poets, and why should we object to the reiteration in this instance, for
which the best reasons can be shown, Men may not deny the divine goodness to be
the source and:Fountain of all their blessings, but the graciousness of his
bounty is far from being fully and sincerely recognised, though the greatest
stress is laid upon it in Scripture. Paul in speaking of it,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450323&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:23,) calls it emphatically by the general term of the glory of God,
intimating, that while God should be praised for all his works, it is his mercy
principally that we should glorify. It is evident from what we read in sacred
history, that it was customary for the Levites. according to the regulation laid
down by David for conducting the praises of God, to sing by response, "for his
mercy endureth for ever." The practice was followed by Solomon in the dedication
of the Temple,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;140703&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 7:3, 6,) and by Jehoshaphat in that solemn triumphal song mentioned
in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;142021&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 20:21, of the same book. [Before proceeding to recite God's works,
the Psalmist declares his supreme Deity, and dominion, not that such comparative
language implies that there is anything approaching] Deity besides him, but
there is a disposition in men, whenever they see any part of his glory
displayed, to conceive of a God separate from him, thus impiously dividing the
Godhead into parts, and even proceeding so far as to frame gods of wood and
stone. There is a depraved tendency in all to take delight in a multiplicity of
gods. For this reason, apparently, the. Psalmist uses the plural number, not
only in the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yhla</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
Elohim, </i>but in the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ynwda</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
Adonim, </i>so that it reads literally, <i>praise ye the Lords of Lords: </i>he
would intimate, that the fullest perfection of all dominion is to be found in
the one
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Who alone hath done great wonders</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Under
this term he comprehends all God's works from the least to the greatest, that he
may awaken our admiration of them, for notwithstanding the signal marks of
inconceivably great wisdom and divine power of God which are inscribed upon them
we are apt through thoughtlessness to undervalue them. He declares that whatever
is worthy of admiration is exclusively made and done by God, to teach us that we
cannot transfer the smallest portion of the praise due to him without awful
sacrilege, there being no vestige of divinity in the whole range of heaven and
earth with which it is lawful to compare or equal him. He then proceeds to
praise the wisdom of God, as particularly displayed in the skill with which
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the heavens are
framed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>giving evidence in a surprising
degree of the fine discrimination with which they are
adorned.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
FE172</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Next he comes to speak of <i>the earth,
</i>that he may lead us to form a proper estimate of this great and memorable
work of God, stretching forth as it does a bare and dry superficies above the
waters. As these elements are of a spherical form, the waters, if not kept
within their limits, would naturally cover the earth, were it not that God has
seen fit to secure a place of habitation for the human family. This philosophers
themselves are forced to admit as one of their principles and
maxims.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
FE173</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The earth's expanded surface, and the
vacant space uncovered with water, has been justly considered therefore one of
the great wonders of God. And it is ascribed to his mercy, because his only
reason for displacing the waters from their proper seat was that regard which he
had in his infinite goodness for the interests of
man.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who made the great
lights</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. &#8212; Moses calls the sun
and moon the two great lights, and there is little doubt that the Psalmist here
borrows the same phraseology. What is immediately added about the stars, is, as
it were, accessory to the others. It is true, that the other planets are larger
than the moon, but it is stated as second in order on account of its visible
effects. The Holy Spirit had no intention to teach astronomy; and, in proposing
instruction meant to be common to the simplest and most uneducated persons, he
made use by Moses and the other Prophets of popular language, that none might
shelter himself under the pretext of obscurity, as we will see men sometimes
very readily pretended an incapacity to understand, when anything deep or
recondite is submitted to their notice. Accordingly, as Saturn though bigger
than the moon is not so to the eye owing to his greater distance, the Holy
Spirit would rather speak childishly than unintelligibly to the humble and
unlearned. The same remark may be made upon what the Psalmist adds regarding
God's having assigned the sun and moon their respective parts, making the one to
<i>rule the day, </i>and the other <i>to rule the night, </i>by which we are not
to understand that they exercise any government, but that the administrative
power of God is very manifest in this distribution. The sun in illuminating the
earth through the day, and the, moon and stars by night, may be said to yield a
reverential homage to God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

sermonize upon the passage, it is unnecessary to detain the reader here with
many words, as nothing is mentioned but what has been treated elsewhere. Only we
may notice that the Egyptians are well said to have been smitten in their
first-born, because they continued in their outrageous obstinacy under the other
plagues, though occasionally terrified by them, but were broken and subdued by
this last plague, and submitted. As it was not intended to recount all the
wonders successively done in Egypt, the whole is summed up in one word when it
is said, that he led his people forth from the midst of it with a mighty and a
stretched out arm. For pressed down as they were on every side, it was only by a
wonderful display of divine power that they could effect an escape. The figure
of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an outstretched
arm</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is appropriate, for we stretch out
the arm when any great effort is required; so that this implies that God put

there can be no doubt that the Rabbinical writers were led to this by the devil,

asserts that the heaps of waters stood up on both sides, from which we infer
that the space between was one and

troops, and not one by one, the pathway being so broad as to admit of their

</i>with a reference to the people who passed through, this circumstance not a
little enhancing the mercy of God, that they saw large depths or channels dried
up, so that they had no difficulty in advancing in troops abreast. Another
circumstance which confirmed or enhanced the mercy shown, was, that Pharaoh was
shortly afterwards drowned; for the very different issue proved that it could
not be owing to any hidden cause of a merely natural kind, that some should have
perished, while others passed over with entire safety. The distinction made
afforded a conspicuous display of God's mercy in saving his people. Much is
included in the single expression that God was

the previous Psalm I pass over without observation; and I shall only touch very
briefly upon the others, which do not need lengthened consideration. We may just
observe that the Psalmist represents every age as affording' displays of the
same goodness as had been shown to their fathers, since God had never failed to
help his people by a continued succession of deliverances. It was a more notable
proof of his mercy to interpose for the nation at a time when it was nearly
overwhelmed by calamities, than to preserve it in its entire state and under a
more even course of affairs, there being something in the emergency to awaken
attention and arrest the view. Besides, in all the deliverances which God grants
his people, there is an accompanying remission of their sins. In the close he
speaks of the paternal providence of God as extending not only to all mankind,
but to every living creature, suggesting that we have no reason to feel surprise
at his sustaining the character of a kind and provident father to his own
people, when he condescends to care for the cattle, and the asses of the field,
and the crow, and the sparrow. Men are much better than brute beasts, and there
is a great difference between some men and others, though not in merit, yet as
regards the privilege of the divine adoption, and the Psalmist is to be
considered as reasoning from the less to the greater, and enhancing the
incomparably superior mercy which God shows to his own
children.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">At the Babylonish captivity the established order of

a great mistake to suppose that it is David who here prophetically apprises the
people of God of the captivity which should come upon them. The Prophets in
speaking of future events employ very different language. What is brought under
notice is the event as now historically come, and matter of experience. We shall
briefly explain the scope of the Psalmist. There was danger that the Jews when
cast off in such a melancholy manner should lose hold altogether of their faith
and of their religion. Considering how ready we are, when mixed up with the
wicked and ungodly, to fall into superstition or evil practices, it was to be
feared that they might wax profane amongst the population of Babylon. The people
of the Lord might be thrown into despondency, besides, by their captivity, the
cruel bondage they were subjected to, and the other indignities which they had
to endure. The writer of this Psalm, whose name is unknown, drew up a form of
lamentation, that by giving expression to their sufferings in sighs and prayers,
they might keep alive the hope of that deliverance<i> </i>which they despaired
of. Another end he has in view, is to warn them against, the decline of
godliness in an irreligious land, and against; defilement with the
contaminations of the heathen. Accordingly he denounces merited judgment upon
the children of Edom, and declares that Babylon, whose prosperity, shortlived as
it was destined to be in itself, eclipsed at that time the rest of the world,
was an object of pity, and near to destruction. The length of time during which
the captivity lasted, may of itself convince us how useful and even necessary it
must have been to support the fainting minds of God's people. They must have
been ready to acquiesce in the corrupt practices of the heathen, unless endued
with surprising mental fortitude through a period of seventy
years.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When they are said to have
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sat</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

</i>is emphatical, setting the subject, as it were, before the eyes of the
reader. Though the pleasantness of the country, irrigated by:streams, might have
had an effect in soothing their dejected minds, we are told that the Lord's
people, so long as they dwelt there, were continually in tears. The particle

Lord could not be tempted by all the luxuries of Babylon to forget their native
inheritance. The language is such as to intimate at the same time that they were
not so entirely overwhelmed by their calamities as not to recognize in them the
deserved chatisement of God, and that they were not chargeable with obstinately
struggling against him; for tears are the expression of humility and penitence,
as well as of distress. This appears still more plainly from its being
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>they remembered, which proves that what had charms for them was not any
advantage of a worldly kind they might there enjoy:, but the worship of God. God
had erected his sanctuary like a flag upon mount Zion, that as often as they
looked to it, they might be assured of his salvation. Fair then and fertile as
was the region where they dwelt, with charms which could corrupt effeminate
minds, and long as they 'were detained in it, tears, which are proverbially soon
dried up, never ceased to stream from their eyes, because they were cut off from
the worship of God, upon which they 'were wont to attend, and felt that they
were torn from the inheritance of
promise.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

FE180</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He deplores the suspension of
the songs of praise, which God had enjoined in his Temple. The Levites were set
over the department of singing, and led the way among the people in this
devotional exercise. Is it asked how they had carried their harps with them so
far from their native land, we have in this another proof mentioned by the
Psalmist of their faith and fervent piety, for the Levites when stripped of all
their fortunes had preserved their harps at least as a piece of precious
furniture, to be devoted to a former use when opportunity presented itself. We
may suppose that those who truly feared God put a high value upon the relics of
his worship, and showed the greatest care in preserving them, till the period of
their restoration.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>willows</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>are mentioned, this denotes the pleasantness of the banks, which were
planted with willows for coolness. But the Psalmist says that these shades,
however delightful, could not dispel a grief which was too deeply seated to
admit of common consolations or refreshment. As they sat upon the banks of the
rivers covered with the shadows of the trees, this was just the place where they
might have been tempted to take up their harps, and soothe their griefs with
song; but the Psalmist suggests that their minds were too heavily wounded with a
sense of the displeasure of the Lord to deceive themselves with such idle
sources of comfort. He would even go:farther, and intimate that joy of a good
and holy kind was at this time suspended. For though it was neither right nor
well judged to encourage their grief, we cannot wonder if the singing of praises
in public was given up till their return from the captivity, called as they were
by the chastisements of God to mourning and
lamentation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Then they that carried us away captive</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
etc<i>. </i>We may be certain that the Israelites were treated with cruel
severity under this barbarous tyranny to which they were subjected. And the
worst affliction of all was, that their conquerors reproachfully insulted them,
and even mocked them, their design being less to wound the hearts of these
miserable exiles, than to cast blasphemies upon their God. The Babylonians had
no desire to hear their sacred songs, and very likely would not have suffered
them to engage in the public praises of God, but they speak ironically, and
insinuate it as a reproach upon the Levites that they should be silent, when it
was their custom formerly to sing sacred songs. Is your God dead, as if they had
said, to whom your praises were formerly addressed? Or if lie delights in your
songs, why do you not sing them? The last clause of the verse has been variously
rendered by interpreters. Some derive

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wnylt</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
talinu, </i>the root of the noun here employed, is taken in the preceding verse

simplest one.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How shall we
sing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. The Psalmist puts a lofty and
magnanimous answer into the mouth of the Lord's people to their insolent
reproach, which is this, that they abstained from their songs, as from their
legal sacrifices, because the land where they now were was polluted. The
Chaldeans thought the Jews were bound down permanently to this place of their
exile; the Psalmist, when he calls it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a foreign
land,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>suggests that it was but the place
of their temporary stay. But the main idea is, that Chaldea was not worthy of
the honor of having God's praises sung in it. No doubt the children of God
wherever they have lived have always been strangers and foreigners in the world,
but the land of Canaan was the sacred rest provided for them, and the Psalmist
well describes them as being foreigners and sojourners when they were in other
climes. He would in this way have them to be always ready and prepared for their
return, tacitly enforcing what Jeremiah had prophesied, when, in order to
prevent them from forgetting their native country, he had definitely foretold
the time during which their exile should last,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;242511&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
25:11;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;242910&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
29:10.) He would in the meantime animate them to constancy, and have them not to
coalesce with the Babylonians through motives of fear. In our own day under the
Papacy, great as the danger may be to which the faithful expose themselves by
not conforming to the example around them, the Holy Spirit makes use of such a
barrier as this to separate them from sinful
compliances.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
FE183</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> To those, whether Frenchmen,
Englishmen, or Italians, who love and practice the true religion, even their
native country is a foreign clime when they live under that tyranny. And yet
there is a distinction between us and God's ancient<i> </i>people, for at that
time the worship of God was confined to one place, but now he has his Temple
wherever two or three are met together in Christ's name, if they separate
themselves from all idolatrous profession, and maintain purity of divine
worship. The Psalmist by the language which he employs would by no means put
down every attempt on their part to celebrate God's praises. He rather exhorts
them under their affliction to wait with patience till the liberty of publicly
worshipping God was restored, saying' upon the matter &#8212; We have been
bereft of our Temple and sacrifices, we wander as exiles in a polluted land, and
what remains but that in remembrance of our outcast state we should sigh and
groan:for the promised
deliverance.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

in the former verse, and leaves us in no difficulty to understand what the
Psalmist meant by it. For here God's people declare, and with the solemnity of
an oath, that the remembrance of the holy city would be ever engra-yen upon
their hearts, and never, under any circumstances,<i> </i>effaced. Having spoken
of song, and of the instruments of music, the Psalmist's appeal is made in terms
which corre-spond &#8212; that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his hand would
forager</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>its cunning, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his tongue cleave to his

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the roof of his
mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The meaning' is, that the Lord's
people, while they mourn under personal trials, should be still more deeply
affected by public calamities which befall the Church, it being' reasonable that
the zeal of God's house should have the highest place in our hearts, and rise
above all mere private considerations. The second part of the sixth verse some
interpret &#8212; If this be not my chief joy to see Jerusalem once more in a
flourishing condition. Others &#8212; Joy will never enter my heart more, till I
be gladdened by the Church's restoration. Both meanings are in my opinion
comprehended in the words of the Psalmist. The one cannot be separated from the
other; for if we set Jerusalem above our chiefest joy, the height of this joy
must arise from the consideration of its prosperity, and, if this be the
case,<i> </i>the grief we feel under its calamities will be such as effectually
to shut out all worldly joys.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Remember, O Jehovah! the
children of Edom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Vengeance was to be
executed upon the other neighboring nations which had conspired to destroy
Jerusalem, so that they are all doubtless included here under the children of
Edom, who are specified, a parr, for the whole, either because they showed more
hatred and cruelty than the rest, or that theirs were not so easily borne,
considering that they were brethren, and of one blood, being the posterity of
Esau, and that the Israelites had, by God's commandment, spared the Edomites,
when they devoted all beside them to destruction.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
2:4.) It was, therefore, the height of cruelty in them to invite the Babylonians
to destroy their own brethren, or fan the flames of their hostility. We are to
notice, however, that the Psalmist does not break forth into these awful
denunciations unadvisedly, but as God's herald, to confirm former prophecies.
God both by Ezekiel and Jeremiah had predicted that he would punish the
Edomites,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;262513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
25:13;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;244907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;250421&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Lamentations
4:21,22) and Obadiah distinctly gives the reason, answerable to what is here
stated &#8212; that they had conspired with the Babylonians.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;310111&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Obadiah
1:11.) We know that God intended in this way to comfort and support the minds of
the people under a calamity so very distressing, as that Jacob's election might
have seemed to be rendered frustrate, should his descendants be treated with
impunity in such a barbarous manner, by the posterity of Esau. The Psalmist
prays, under the inspiration of the Spirit, that God would practically
demonstrate the truth of this prediction. Anti when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Remember, O Jehovah!
</i></font><font face="Palatino">he would remind God's people of the promise to
strengthen their belief in his avenging justice, and make them wait for the
event with patience and submission. To pray for vengeance would have been
unwarrantable, had not God pro-raised it, and had the party against whom it was
sought not been reprobate and incurable; for as to others, even our greatest
enemies, we should wish their amendment and reformation. The <i>day of
Jerusalem,, </i>is a title given by him, and of frequent occurrence in
Scripture, to the time of visitation, which had a divinely appointed and
definite term.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>

laid waste</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>! </i>The Psalmist discerns the
coming judgment of God, though not yet apparent, by the eye of faith, as the
Apostle well calls faith "the beholding of things not seen."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:1.) Incredible as it might appear that any calamity should overtake so mighty
an empire as Babylon then was, and impregnable as it was generally considered to
be, he sees in the glass of the Word its destruction and overthrow. He calls
upon all God's people to do the same, and by faith from the elevation of
heaven's oracles, to despise the pride of that abandoned city. If the divine
promises inspire us with hope and confidence, and God's Spirit attemper our
afflictions to the rule of his own uprightness, we shall lift up our heads in
the lowest depths of affliction to which we may be east down, and glory in the
fact that it is well with us in our worst distresses, and that our enemies are
devoted to destruction. In declaring those to be happy who should
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pay back vengeance upon the
Babylonians,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he does not mean that the
service done by the Medes and Persians, in itself met with the approbation of
God;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe188</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for they were actuated in the war by
ambition, insatiable covetousness, and unprincipled rivalry; but he declares
that a war which was carried on in a manner under God's auspices, should be
crowned with success. As God had determined to punish Babylon, he pronounced a
blessing upon Cyrus and Darius, while on the,other hand Jeremiah
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;244810&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
48:10) declares those cursed who should do the work of the Lord negligently,
that is, fail in strenuously carrying out the work of desolation and
destruction, to which God had called them as his hired executioners. It may seem
to savor of cruelty, that he should wish the tender and innocent infants to be
dashed and mangled upon the stones, but he does not speak under the impulse of
personal feeling, and only employs words which God had himself authorized, so
that this is but the declaration of a just judgment, as when our Lord
says,</font><br></div>

to show more than ordinary gratitude. This is exercise which degenerates and is
degraded in the case of hypocrites to a mere sound of empty words, but he states

heart, for by the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whole

<i>Elohim, </i>sometimes means <i>angels, </i>and sometimes <i>kings, </i>and
either meaning will suit with the passage before us. The praise David;speaks of
is that which is of a public kind. The solemn assembly is, so to speak, a
heavenly theater, graced by the presence of attending angels; and one reason why
the cherubim overshadowed the Ark of the Covenant was to let God's people know
that the angels are present when they come to worship in the sanctuary. We might
very properly apply what is said here to <i>kings, </i>on account of their
eminence in rank, as in

107:32, "Praise ye the Lord in the assembly of the elders" &#8212; that is, as
we should say, in an assembly of an honored and illustrious kind. But I prefer
the former sense, and this because believers in drawing near to God are
withdrawn from the world, and rise to heaven in the enjoyment of fellowship with
angels, so that we find Paul enforcing his address to the Corinthians upon the
necessity of decency and order, by requiring them to show some respect at least
in their public religious assemblies to the angels.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

show more than private gratitude, and, in order to set an example before others,
come in compliance with the precept of the law into the sanctuary. He worshipped
God spiritually, and yet would lift his eyes to those outward symbols which were
the means then appointed for drawing the minds of God's people upwards. He
singles out the divine mercy and truth as the subject of his praise, for while
the power and greatness of God are equally worthy of commendation, nothing has a
more sensible influence in stimulating us to thanksgiving than his free mercy;
and in communicating to us of his goodness he opens our mouth to sing his
praises. As we cannot taste, or at least have any lively apprehensions in our
souls of the divine mercy otherwise than through the word, mention is made of
his faithfulness or truth. This coupling of mercy with truth is to be
particularly taken notice of, as I have frequently observed, for however much
the goodness of God may appear to us in its effects, such is our insensibility
that it will never penetrate our minds, unless the word have come to us in the
first place. Goodness is first mentioned, because the only ground upon which God
shows himself to us as true is his having bound himself by his free promise. And
it is in this that his unspeakable mercy shows itself &#8212; that he prevents
those with it who were at a distance from him, and invites them to draw near to
him by condescending to address them in a familiar manner. In the end of the

am satisfied David means to declare that God's name is exalted above all things,
specifying the particular manner in which he has exalted his name, by faithfully
performing his free promises. Nor can any doubt that owing to our blind
insensibility to the benefits which God bestows upon us, the best way in which
he can awaken us to the right notice of them is by first addressing his word to
us. and then certifying and sealing his goodness by accomplishing what he has

prayers, and surprises us, as it were, sleeping: but commonly he stirs us up to
prayer by the influence of his Spirit, and this to illustrate his goodness the
more by our finding that he crowns our prayers with success. David well infers
that his escape front danger could not have been merely fortuitous, as it
plainly appeared that God had answered him. This then is one thing noticeable,
that our prayers more nearly discover his goodness to us. Some supply a
copulative in the second part of the verse &#8212; Thou

known, and the report of it spread over all the world. In saying that even kings
had heard the words of God's mouth, he does not mean to aver that they had been
taught in the true religion so as to be prepared for becoming members of the
Church, but only that it would be well known everywhere that the reason of his
having been preserved in such a wonderful manner was God's having anointed him
king by his commandment.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

could be no doubt that he came to the crown by divine will and commandment. And

commendation upon God's general government of the world. The thing of all others
most necessary to be known is, that he is not indifferent to our safety; for
though in words we are all ready to grant this, our disbelief of it is shown by
the feat' we betray upon the slightest appearance of danger, and we would not
give way to such alarm if we had a solid persuasion of our being under his
fatherly protection. Some read,

throne governing the world; but I prefer considering, that there is an
opposition intended &#8212; that the greatness of God does not prevent his
having' respect to the poor and humble ones of the earth. This is confirmed by
what is stated in the second clause, That being highly exalted he recognises
afar off, or from a distance. Some read

which answers well to the context, That God does not honor the high and haughty

<i>yada, </i>is rendered, <i>to crush, </i>and they take the meaning to be, that
God, while he favors the lowly, treads down the mighty who glory in their
prosperity. There is reason to doubt, however, whether any such refinement of
meaning is to be attached to David's words, and it is enough to conclude, that
he here repeats the same sentiment formerly expressed, that God though highly
exalted, takes notice of what might be thought to escape his observation. Thus
we have seen,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning is, that though God's glory is far above
all heavens, the distance at which he is placed does not prevent his governing
the world by his providence. God is highly exalted, but he sees after off, so
that he needs not change place when he would condescend to take care of us. We
on our part are poor and lowly, but our wretched condition is; no reason why God
will not concern himself about us. While we view with admiration the immensity
of his glory as raised above all heavens, we must not disbelieve his willingness
to foster us under his fatherly care. The two things are, with great propriety,
conjoined here by David, that, on the one hand, when we think of God's majesty
we should not be terrified into a forgetfulness of his goodness and benignity,
nor, on the other, lose our reverence for his majesty in contemplating the
condescension of his mercy.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

sense in which he looked flint God would act the part of his preserver &#8212;
by giving him life from the dead, were that necessary. The passage is well
deserving our attention for by nature we are so delicately averse to suffering
as to wish that we might all live safely beyond shot of its arrows, and shrink
from close contact with the fear of death, as something altogether intolerable.
On the slightest approach of danger we are immoderately afraid, as if our
emergencies precluded the hope of Divine deliverance. This is faith's true
office, to see life in the midst of death, and to trust the mercy of God &#8212;
not as that which will procure<i> </i>us universal exemption from evil, but as
that which will quicken us in the midst of death every moment of our lives; for
God humbles his children under various trials, that his defense of them:may be
the more remarkable, and that he may show himself to be their deliverer, as well
as their preserver. In the world believers are constantly exposed to enemies,
and David asserts, that he will be safe under God's protection from all their
machinations. He declares his hope of life to lie in this, that the hand of God
was stretched out:for his help, that hand which he knew to be invincible, and
victorious over <i>every </i>foe. And from all this we are taught, that it is
God's method to exercise his children with a continual conflict, that, having
one foot as it were in the grave, they may flee with alarm to hide themselves
under his wings, where they malt abide in peace. Some translate the particle

FE198</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Yet the context would seem to
require.another sense, since, when it is added as a reason,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that Jehovah's mercy is

hands,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>the better sense would seem to be
<i>&#8212; Jehovah will perform for me, </i>that is, will continue to show that
he cares for my safety, and will fully perfect what he has begun. Having once
been delivered by an act of Divine mercy, he concludes that what had been done
would be perfected, as God's nature is unchangeable, and he cannot divest
himself of that goodness which belongs to him. There can be no doubt that the
way to maintain good hope in danger is to fix our eyes upon the Divine goodness,
on which our deliverance rests. God is under no obligation on his part, but
when, of his mere good pleasure, he promises to interest himself in our behalf.
David concludes with the best reason, from the eternity of the Divine goodness,
that the salvation granted him would be of no limited and merely evanescent
character. This he confirms still farther by what he adds, that it is impossible
God should leave his work, as men may do, in an imperfect or unfinished state
through lassitude or disgust. This David is to be understood as asserting in the
same sense in which Paul declares, that "the<i> </i>gifts and calling of God are
without repentance."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451129&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:29.) Men may leave off a work for very slight reasons which they foolishly
undertook from the first, and from which they may have been diverted through
their inconstancy, or they may be forced to give up through inability what they
enterprised above their strength; but nothing of this kind can happen with God,
and, therefore, we have no occasion to apprehend that our hopes will be
disappointed in their course towards fulfillment. Nothing but sin and
ingratitude on our part interrupts the continued and unvarying tenor of the
Divine goodness. What we firmly apprehend by our faith God will never take from
us, or allow to pass out of our hands. When he declares that God perfects the
salvation of his people, David would not encourage sloth, but strengthen his
faith and quicken himself to the exercise of prayer. What is the cause of that
anxiety and fear which are felt by the godly, but the consciousness of their own
weakness and entire dependence upon God? At the same time they rely with full
certainty upon the grace of God, "being<i> </i>confident," as Paul writes to the
Philippians,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"that he who has begun

<div><font face="Palatino">The use to be made of the doctrine is, to remember,
when we fall or are disposed to waver in our minds, that since God has wrought
the beginning of our salvation in us, he will carry it forward to its
termination. Accordingly, we should betake ourselves to prayer, that we may not,
through our own indolence,<i> </i>bar our access to that continuous stream of
the divine goodness which flows from a fountain that is
inexhaustible.</font><br></div>

deceptive coverings under which most men take refuge, and divest himself of
hypocrisy, insists at large upon the truth that nothing can elude the divine
observation &#8212; a truth which he illustrates from the original formation of
man, since he who fashioned us in our mother's womb, and imparted to every
member its particular office and function, cannot possibly be ignorant of our
actions. Quickened by this meditation to a due reverential fear of God, he
declares himself to have no sympathy with the ungodly and profane, and beseeches
God, in the confidence of conscious integrity, not to forsake him in this life.

thanksgiving. Equally forced is the meaning given to the words by others &#8212;

that though we speak not a word, and try by silence to conceal our secret

back; but David found himself hedged in behind as well as before. The other
clause of the verse has the same meaning; for those put a very forced
interpretation upon it who think that it refers to God's fashioning us, and
applying his hand in the sense of an artizan to his work; nor does this suit
with the context. And it is much better to understand it as asserting that God
by his hand, laid as it were upon men, holds them strictly under his inspection,

little world in himself; nor can we think without astonishment of the consummate
artifice apparent in the structure of the human body, and of the excellent
endowments with which the human soul is invested. But the context demands
another interpretation; and we are to suppose that David, prosecuting the same
idea upon which he had already insisted, exclaims against the folly of measuring
God's knowledge by our own, when it rises prodigiously above us. Many when they
hear God spoken of conceive of him as like unto themselves, and such presumption
is most condemnable. Very commonly they will not allow his knowledge to be
greater than what comes up to their own apprehensions of things. David, on the
contrary, confesses it to be beyond his comprehension, virtually declaring that
words could not express this truth of the absoluteness with which all things
stand patent to the eye of God, this being a knowledge having' neither bound nor

They misapply the passage who adduce it as a proof of the immensity of God's
essence; for though it be an undoubted truth that the glory of the Lord fills
heaven and earth, this was not at present in the view of the Psalmist, but the
truth that God's eye penetrates heaven and hell, so that, hide in what obscure
corner of the world he might, he must be discovered by him. Accordingly he tells
us that though he should fly to heaven, or lurk in the lowest abysses, from

bethinks himself of another remedy, and says, If no speed of mine can bear me
out of the range of God's vision, yet, on the supposition of light being
removed, the darkness might cover me, that I might have a short breath of
respite. But this also he declares to be hopeless, as God sees equally well in
the deepest darkness as at noon-day. It is a mistake in my opinion to consider,
as some have done, that the two clauses of the verse are to be taken separately,
and read, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If I shall say the

manifest before the eye of God. David is rather to be considered as in both
clauses expressing what he might be supposed to feel desirous of, and intimates
that, could he only find any covert or subterfuge, he would avail himself of the
license;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

greater liberty. That this is the proper construction of the words we may infer
from the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;g</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
gam. </i>If any one should 'think it a very unnecessary observation to say that
as respects God there is no difference between light and darkness, it is enough
to remind him that all observation proves with what reluctance and extreme
difficulty men are brought to come forward openly and 'unreservedly into God's
presence. In words we all grant that God is omniscient; meanwhile what none
would ever think of controverting we secretly make no account of whatsoever, in
so far as we make no scruple of mocking God, and lack even that reverence of him
which we extend to one of our fellow-creatures. We are ashamed to let men know
and witness our delinquencies; but we are as indifferent to what God may think
of us, as if our sins were covered and veiled from his inspection. This
infatuation if not sharply reproved will soon change light, so far as we are
concerned, into darkness, and therefore David insists upon the subject at length
in order to refute our false apprehensions. Be it our concern to apply the
reproofs given, and stir ourselves up by them, when we feel disposed to become
secure.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

subject, though he carries it out somewhat farther, declaring that we need not
be surprised at God's knowledge of the most secret thoughts of men, since he
formed their hearts and their reins. He thus represents God as sitting king in
the very reins of man, as the center of his jurisdiction, and shows it ought to
be no ground of wonder that all the windings and recesses of our hearts are
known to him who, when we were inclosed in our mother's womb, saw us as clearly
and perfectly as if we had stood before him in the light of mid-day. This may
let us know the design with which David proceeds to speak of man's original
formation, tits scope is the same in the verse which follows, where, with some
ambiguity in the terms employed, it is sufficiently clear and obvious that David
means that he had been fashioned in a manner wonderful, and calculated to excite
both fear and admiration,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fe212</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
so that he breaks forth into the praises of God. One great reason of the carnal
security into which we fall, is our not considering how singularly we were
fashioned at first by our Divine Maker. From this particular instance David is
led to refer in general to all the works of God, which are just so many wonders
fitted to draw our attention to him. The true and proper view to take of the
works of God, as I have observed elsewhere, is that which ends in wonder. His
declaration to the effect that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his soul should well
know</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>these wonders, which far transcend
human comprehension, means no more than that with humble and sober application
he would give his attention and talents to obtaining such an apprehension of the
wonderful works of God as might end in adoring the immensity of his glory. The
knowledge he means, therefore, is not that which professes to comprehend what,
under the name of wonders, he confesses to be incomprehensible, nor of that kind
which philosophers presumptuously pretend to, as if they could solve every
mystery of God, but simply that religious attention to the works of God which
excites to the duty of thanksgiving.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My strength was not hid from

now begins to prove from the way in which man is at first formed, and points out
God's superiority to other artificers in this, that while they must have their
work set before their eyes before they can form it, he fashioned us in our
mother's womb. It is of little importance whether we read
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>my
strength</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or <i>my bone, </i>though I
prefer the latter reading. He next likens the womb of the mother to

enhance what the Psalmist had just said. David no doubt means figuratively to
express the inconceivable skill which appears in the formation of the human
body. When we examine it, even to the nails on our fingers, there is nothing
which could be altered, without felt inconveniency, as at something disjointed
or put out of place; and what, then, if we should make the individual parts the

him when he was yet a shapeless mass,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">to&lt;

time of conception to birth inclusive. The argument is from the greater' to the
less. If he was known to God before he had grown to certain definite shape, much
less could he now elude his observation. He adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all things were written in his
book</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, the whole method of his
formation was well known to God. The term <i>book </i>is a figure taken from the
practice common amongst men of helping their memory by means of books and
commentaries. Whatever is an object of God's knowledge he is said to have
registered in writing, for he needs no helps to memory. Interpreters are not
agreed as to the second clause. Some read

<i>yamim, </i>in the nominative case,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when days were

&#8212; All my bones were written in thy book, O God! from the beginning of the
world, when days were first formed by thee, and when as <i>yet </i>none of them
actually existed. The other is the more natural meaning, That the different
parts of the human body are formed in a succession of time; for in the first
germ there is no arrangement of parts, or proportion of members, but it is
developed, and takes its peculiar form
progressively.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
FE216</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There is another point on which
interpreters differ. As in the particle

not. </i>According to the first reading, the sense is, that though the body is
formed progressively, it was always one and the same in God's book, who is not
dependent upon time for the execution of his work. A sufficiently good meaning,
however, can be got by adhering' without change to the negative particle,
namely, that though the members were formed in the course of days, or gradually,
none of them had existed; no order or distinctness of parts having been there at
first, but a formless substance. And thus our admiration is directed to the
providence of God in gradually giving' shape and beauty to a confused
mass.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h[r</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>reah, </i>which is used here as in the second verse, and means <i>thought,
</i>not <i>companion </i>or <i>friend, </i>as many have rendered it, after the
Chaldee translator, under the idea that the Psalmist is already condescending
upon the distinction between the righteous and the wicked. The context requires
that he should still be considered as speaking of the matchless excellence of
divine providence. He therefore repeats &#8212; and not without reason &#8212;
what he had said before; for we apparently neglect or underestimate the singular
proofs of the deep wisdom of God, exhibited in man's creation, and the whole
superintendence and government of his life. Some read<i> &#8212; How rare are
thy thoughts; </i>but this only darkens the meaning. I grant we find that word
made use of in the Sacred History,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;090301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 3:1,) where the oracles of the Lord are said to have been rare, in the
time of Eli. But it also means
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>precious</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and it is enough that we retain the sense which is free from all ambiguity.
He applies the term to God's thoughts, as not lying within the compass of man's
judgment. To the same effect is what he adds that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sums</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>or aggregates of them were great and mighty; that is, sufficient to
overwhelm the minds of men. The exclamation made by the Psalmist suggests to us
that were men not so dull of apprehension, or rather so senseless, they would be
struck by the mysterious ways of God, and would humbly and tremblingly sist
themselves before his tribunal, instead of presumptuously thinking that they
could evade it. The same truth is set forth in the next verse, that if any
should attempt to number the hidden judgments or counsels of God, their
immensity is more than <i>the sands of the sea. </i>Our capacities conseqently
could not comprehend the most infinitesimal part of them. As to what follows
&#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have a waked, and am
still with, thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>interpreters have
rendered the words differently; but I have no doubt of the meaning simply being
that David found new occasion, every time he awoke from sleep, for meditating
upon the extraordinary wisdom of God. When he speaks of rising, we are not to
suppose he refers to one day, but agreeably to what he had said already of his
thoughts being absorbed in the incomprehensible greatness of divine wisdom, he
adds that every time </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he
awoke</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he<i> </i>discovered fresh matter for
admiration. We are thus put in possession of the true meaning of David, to the
effect that God's providential government of the world is such that nothing can
escape him, not even the profoundest thoughts. And although many precipitate
themselves in an infatuated manner into all excess of crime, under the idea that
God will never discover them, it is in vain that they resort to hiding-places,
from which, however reluctantly, they must be dragged to light. The truth is one
which we would do well to consider more than we do, for while we may cast a.
glance at our hands and our feet, and occasionally survey the elegance of our
shape with complacency, there is scarcely one in a hundred who thinks of his
Maker. Or if any recognize their life as coming from God, there is none at least
who rises to the great truth that he who formed the ear, and the eye, and the
understanding heart, himself hears, and sees, and knows
everything.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
139:19-24	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b> If thou shalt slay, O

some have done, to connect this with the preceding verse. Nor does it seem
proper to view the words as expressing a wish &#8212; " I wish," or, "Oh!<i>
</i>if thou God wouldst slay the wicked." Neither can I subscribe to the idea of
those who think that David congratulates himself upon the wicked being cut off.
The sentiment seems to me to be of another kind, that he would apply himself to
the consideration of the divine judgments, and advance in godliness and in the
fear of his name, so often as vengeance was taken upon the ungodly. There can be
no question that God designs to make an example of them, that his elect ones may
be taught by their punishment to withdraw themselves from their society. David
was of himself well disposed to the fear and worship of God, and yet he needed a
certain check, like other saints, as Isaiah says,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
26:9,) "when<i> </i>God has sent abroad his judgments, the inhabitants of the
earth shall learn righteousness," that is, to remain in the fear of the Lord. At
the same time, I have no doubt that the Psalmist presents himself before God as
witness of his integrity; as if he had said, that he came freely and ingenuously
to God's bar, as not being one of the wicked despisers of his name, nor having
any connection with them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who have spoken of thee
wickedly.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He intimates the extent to
which the wicked proceed when God spares them, and forbears to visit them with
vengeance. They not merely conclude that they may perpetrate any crime with
impunity, but openly blaspheme their Judge. He takes notice of their <i>speaking
wickedly, </i>in the sense of their taking no pains to disguise their sin under
plausible pretences, as persons who have some shame remaining will exercise a
certain restraint upon their language, but they make no secret of the contempt
they entertain for God. The second clause, where he speaks of their taking God's
name falsely, some have interpreted too restrictedly with reference to their sin
of perjury. Those,come nearer the truth who consider that the wicked are spoken
of as taking God's name in vain, when they conceive of him according to their
own idle fancies. We see from experience, that most men are ignorant of what God
is, and judge of him rather as one dead than alive. In words they all
acknowledge him to be judge of the world, but the acknowledgment comes to
nothing, as they straightway denude him of his office of judgment, which is to
take God's name in vain, by tarnishing the glory of it, and, in a manner,
deforming it. But as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is not in the original, and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">a&ccedil;n</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
nasa, </i>means <i>to lift Up, </i>or <i>on high, </i>I think we are warranted
rather to interpret the passage as meaning', that they carried themselves with
an arrogant and false pride. This elation or haughtiness of spirit is almost
always allied with that petulance of which he. had previously taken notice. What
other reason can be given for their vending such poisonous rancour against God,
but pride, and forgetfulness, on the one hand, of their own insignificance as
men, and on the other, of the power which belongeth unto the Lord? On this
account he calls them God's <i>adversaries, </i>for all who exalt themselves
above the place which they should occupy, act the part of the giants who warred
against heaven.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall I not hold in hatred those
that hate thee?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He proceeds to mention
how greatly he had profited by the meditation upon God into which he had been
led, for, as the effect, of his having realized his presence before God's bar,
and reflected upon the impossibility of escaping the eye of him who searches all
deep places, he now lays down his resolution to lead a holy and pious life. In
declaring his hatred of those who despised God, he virtually asserts thereby his
own integrity, not as being free from all sin, but as being devoted to
godliness, so that he detested in his heart everything which was contrary to it.
Our attachment to godliness must be inwardly defective, if it do not generate an
abhorrence of sin, such as David here speaks of. If that zeal for the house of
the Lord, which he mentions elsewhere,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;196909&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
69:9,)<i> </i>burn<i> </i>in our hearts, it would be an unpardonable
indifference silently to look on when his righteous law was violated, nay, when
his holy name was trampled upon by the wicked. As to the last word in the verse,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fwq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kut</i>, means <i>to dispute with, </i>or <i>contend, </i>and may be
understood as here retaining' the same sense in the Hithpael conjugation, unless
we consider David to have more particularly meant, that he inflamed himself so
as to stir up his mind to contend with them. We thus see that he stood forward
strenuously in defense of the glory of God, regardless of the hatred of the
whole world, and waged war with all the workers of
iniquity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I hate them with perfect
hatred.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Literally it is, I hate them
with perfection of hatred. He repeats the same truth as formerly, that such was
his esteem for God's glory that he would have nothing' in common with those who
despised him. He means in general that he gave no countenance to the works of
darkness, for whoever connives at sin and encourages it through silence,
wickedly betrays God's cause, who has committed the vindication of righteousness
into our hands. David's example should teach us to rise with a lofty and bold
spirit above all regard to the enmity of the wicked, when the question concerns
the honor of God, and rather to renounce all earthly friendships than falsely
pander with flattery to the favor of those who do everything to draw down upon
themselves the divine displeasure. We have the more need to attend to this,
because the keen sense we have of what concerns our private interest, honor, and
convenience, makes us never hesitate to engage in contest when any one injures
ourselves, while we are abundantly timid and cowardly in defending the glory of
God. Thus, as each of us studies his own interest and advantage, the only thing
which incites us to contention, strife, and war, is a desire to avenge our
private wrongs; none is affected when the majesty of God is outraged. On the
other hand, it is a proof of our having a fervent zeal for God when we have the
magnanimity to declare irreconcilable war with the wicked and them who hate God,
rather than court their favor at the expense of alienating the divine layout. We
are to observe, however, that the hatred of which the Psalmist speaks is
directed to the sins rather than the persons of the wicked. We are, so far as
lies in us, to study peace with all men; we are to seek the good of all, and, if
possible, they are to be reclaimed by kindness and good offices: only so far as
they are enemies to God we must strenuously confront their
resentment.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Search me, O
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>! </i>He:insists upon this as being the
only cause why he opposed the despisers of God, that he himself was a genuine
worshipper of God, and desired others to possess the same character. It
indicates no common confidence that he should submit, himself so boldly to the
judgment of God. But being fully conscious of sincerity in his religion, it was
not without due consideration that he placed himself so confidently before God's
bar; neither must we think that he claims to be free from all sin, for he
groaned under the felt burden of his transgressions. The saints in all that they
say of their integrity still depend only upon free grace. Yet persuaded as they
are that their godliness is approved before God, notwithstanding their falls and
infirmities, we need not wonder that (hey feel themselves at freedom to draw a
distinction between themselves and the wicked. While he denies that his heart
was double or insincere, he does not profess exemption from all sin, but only
that he was not devoted to wickedness; for

59:7,) that in the ways of such men there is "trouble and destruction," because
they carry everything by violence and wickedness. Others think the allusion is
to a bad conscience, which afflicts the wicked with inward torments, but this is
a forced interpretation. Whatever sense we attach to the word, David's meaning
simply is, that though he was a man subject to sin, he was not devotedly bent
upon the practice of it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b><i>

over to punishment. It is true, that "the<i> </i>way of all the earth" is an
expression used sometimes to denote death, which is common to all, but the verb
here translated to <i>lead </i>is more commonly taken in a good than a bad
sense, and I question if the phrase

Selah.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the chief
Musician,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> etc. I cannot bring myself to
restrict this Psalm to Doeg, as the great body of interpreters do, for the
context will clearly show that it speaks of Saul, and of the counselors who
ceased not to inflame the king &#8212; himself sufficiently incensed against the
life of one who was a saint of God. Being as he was a figure of Christ, we need
not wonder that the agents of the devil directed so much of their rage against
him. And this is the reason why he animadverts so sharply upon their rancor and
treachery.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The terms
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wicked</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and <i>violent</i> men denote their unwarranted attempts at his destruction
without provocation given. He therefore commends his cause to God, as having
studied peace with them, as never having injured them, but being the innocent
object of their unjust persecution. The same rule must be observed by us all, as
it is against violence and wickedness that the help of God is extended. David is
not Multiplying mere terms of reproach as men do in their personal disputes, but
conciliating God's favor by supplying a proof of his innocence, for he must
always be upon the side of good and peaceable
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who imagine mischief's in their
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here he charges them with inward
malignity of heart. And it is plain that the reference is not to one man merely,
for he passes to the plural number (in a manner sufficiently common,) reverting
from the head to all his associates and copartners in guilt. Indeed what was
formerly said in the singular number may be taken indefinitely, as grammarians
say. In general he repeats what I have noticed already, that the hostility to
which he was subjected arose from no cause of his. From this we learn that the
more wickedly our enemies assail us, and the more of treachery and clandestine
acts they manifest, the nearer is the promised aid of the Holy Spirit, who
himself dictated this form of prayer by the mouth of David. The second clause
may be rendered in three ways. Literally it reads, who gather wars, and so some
understand it. But it, is well known that the prepositions are often omitted in
the Hebrew, and no doubt lie means that they stirred up general enmity by their
false information's being as the trumpet which sounds to battle. Some render the
verb &#8212; <i>to conspire, or plot together</i>, but this is a farfetched and
meager sense. He intimates afterwards in what manner they stirred up unjust war
by the wicked calumnies which they spread, as they could not crush a good and
innocent person by violence, otherwise than by first overwhelming him with
calumny.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Keep me, O
Jehovah!</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To complaints and accusations he now
again adds prayer, from which it appears more clearly, as I observed already,
that it is God whom he seeks to be his avenger. It is the same sentiment
repeated, with one or two words changed; for he had said
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deliver
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">, now he says <i>keep me</i>, and for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wicked
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he substitutes the <i>hand of the
wicked</i>. He had spoken of their conceiving mischief's, now of their plotting
how they might ruin a poor unsuspecting individual. What he had said of their
fraud and deceit he repeats in figurative language, which does not want
emphasis. He speaks of nets spread out on every side to circumvent him, unless
God interposed for his help. Though at first sight the metaphors may seem more
obscure than the prayer was in its simple unfigurative expression, they are far
from darkening the previous declarations, and they add much to the strength of
them. From the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yag</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>geim</i>, which signifies
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>proud</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or <i>lofty</i> in the Hebrew, we learn that he does not speak of common men,
but of men in power, who considered that they would have no difficulty in
crushing an insignificant individual. When our enemies attack us in the
insolence of pride, let us learn to resort to God, who can repel the rage of the
wicked. Nor does he mean to say that they attacked him merely by bold and
violent measures, for he complains of their spreading gins and snares; both
methods are spoken of, namely, that while they were confident of the power which
they possessed, they devised stratagems for his
destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

prayers were not merely those of the lips, as hypocrites will make loud appeals
to God for mere appearance sake, but that he prayed with earnestness, and from a
hidden principle of faith. Till we have a persuasion of being saved through the
grace of God there can be no sincere prayer. We have here an excellent
illustration of the nature of faith, in the Psalmist's turning himself away from
man's view, that he may address God apart, hypocrisy being excluded in this
internal exercise of the heart. This is true prayer &#8212; not the mere idle
lifting up of the voice, but the presentation of our petitions from an inward
principle of faith. To beget in himself a persuasion of his obtaining his
present requests from God, he recalls to his mind what deliverance's God had
already extended to him. He speaks of his having been to him as a shield in
every time of danger. Some read the words in the future tense &#8212; "Thou wilt
cover my head in the day of battle." But it is evident David speaks of
protection formerly experienced from the hand of God, and from this derives
comfort to his faith. He comes forth, not as a raw and undisciplined recruit,
but as a soldier well tried in previous engagements. The strength of salvation
is equivalent to salvation displayed with no ordinary
power.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>

the desires of the wicked, and frustrate all their aims and attempts. We see
from this that it is in his power, whenever he sees proper, to frustrate the
unprincipled designs of men, and their wicked expectations, and to dash their
schemes. When, therefore, it is found impracticable to bring our enemies to a
right state of mind, we are to pray that the devices which they have imagined
may be immediately overthrown and thwarted. In the next clause there is more
ambiguity. As the Hebrew verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qwp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>puk</i>, means to lead out, as well as to strike or fall, the words might
mean, that God would not carry out into effect the counsels of the wicked. But
the opinion of those may be correct who read &#8212; <i>their thought is thou
wilt not strike</i>, David representing such hopes as the wicked are wont to
entertain. We find him elsewhere
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
10:6) describing their pride in a similar way, in entirely overlooking a divine
providence, and considering all events as subject to their control, and the
world placed under their sole management. The word which follows with thus come
in appropriately &#8212; they shall be <i>lifted up</i>, in illusion to the
wicked being inflated by pride, through the idea that they can never be
overtaken by adversity. If the other reading be preferred, the negative particle
must be considered as repeated &#8212; "Suffer not their attempts to be carried
into effect; let them not be exalted." At any rate David is to be considered as
censuring the security of his enemies, in making no account of God, and in
surrendering themselves to unbridled
license.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>

that he would be the Judge of all the ungodly. Some translate what follows
&#8212; <i>the wilt cast them into the fire</i>, which might pass. But as:
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>beth</i>, in the Hebrew often denotes instrumentality, we may properly render
the words &#8212; <i>thou wilt cast them down</i> By <i>fire</i>, or With
<i>fire</i>, as God sent it forth against Sodom and Gomorrha. He prays they may
be sunk into deep pits, whence they may never rise. God sometimes heals those
whom he has smitten with great severity; David cuts off the reprobate from the
hope of pardon, as knowing them to be beyond recovery. Had they been disposable
to repentance, he would have been inclinable on his part to
mercy.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

<i>loquacious</i> <i>man</i>, but the sense is too restricted; nor is the
reference to a reproachful, garrulous, vain and boastful man, but the man of
virulence, who wars by deceit and calumny, and not openly. This is plain from
what is said of the other class of persons in the subsequent part of the
sentence, that his enemies were given to open violence as well as to treachery
and cunning &#8212; like the lion as well as the wolf &#8212; as formerly he
complained that the poison of the asp or viper was under their lips. The words
run in the future tense, and many interpreters construe them into the optative
form, or into a prayer; but I prefer retaining the future tense, as David does
not appear so much to pray, as to look forward to a coming deliverance. Whether
his enemies wrought by treachery, or by open violence, he looks forward to God
as his deliverer. The figure drawn from hunting is expressive. The hunter, by
spreading his toils on all sides, leaves no way of escape for the wild beast;
and the ungodly cannot by any subterfuge elude the divine judgments.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Mischief hunts them into

here seals or corroborates his prayer by turning his thoughts and discourse to
the providential judgments of God, for, as I have already said, doubtful prayer
is no prayer at all. He declares it to be a thing known and ascertained that God
cannot but deliver the afflicted. As he may connive for a time, however, and
suffer good and upright persons to be grievously tried, David suggests as
consideration which may meet this temptation, that God does so advisedly, that
he may relieve those who are in affliction, and recover those who are oppressed.
He accordingly says in express words that he will be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the judge of the poor and the
afflicted</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In this way does he encourage both
others and himself under continued troubles, till the time proper for
deliverance arrive, intimating that though he might be universally considered an
object of pity in being exposed to the fury of the wicked, and in not being
immediately delivered by the hand of God, he would not give way to despair, but
remember that it was the very part of God to undertake the cause of the poor. It
were to weaken the passage if we considered David merely to be speaking of his
own individual case.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He infers
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19E013&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

For the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ach</i>, which is often adversative in the Hebrew, is here affirmative, and
denotes inference or consequence from what was formerly stated. Though the godly
may be silenced for a time, and through the force of trouble may not raise the
praises of God, David expresses his conviction that what was taken away would be
speedily restored, and they would celebrate the loving kindness of the Lord with
joy and alacrity. As this is not easily believed in circumstances of trial, the
already referred to is inserted. We must endeavor, though with a struggle, to
rise to a confident persuasion, that however low they may be brought, the Lord's
people will be restored to prosperity, and will soon sing his praises. The
second clause of the verse gives the reason of their thanksgiving's. He speaks
of this as being the ground of the praises of the righteous, that they
experience God's care of them, and concern for their salvation. For

praying, it is evident that David was laboring under no small trial, as he
repeats his requests, and insists upon receiving help. Without venturing to say
anything definite upon the point, we would not disapprove of the conjecture that
this Psalm was written by David with reference to the persecutions he suffered
from Saul. He teaches us by his example to make application immediately to God,
and not be tempted, as wicked men are, to renounce prayer, and rely on other
resources. He says that he cried to God, not to heaven or earth, to men or to
fortune, and other vain objects, which are made mention of, in the first place
at least, in such cases by the ungodly. If they do address themselves to God, it
is with murmurs and complaints, howling rather than
praying.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the second verse the allusion is
evidently to the legal ceremonies.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe235</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> At that time the prayers of God's

of incense and sacrifices, and David depended upon this
promise.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
FE236</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As to the conjecture some have made,
that he was at this time an exile, and cut off from the privileges of the
religious assembly, nothing certain can be said upon that point; their idea
being that there is a tacit antithesis in the verse &#8212; that though
prevented from continuing with God's worshippers into the sanctuary, or using
incense and sacrifice, he desired God would accept his prayers notwithstanding.
But as there seems no reason to adopt this restricted sense, it is enough to
understand the general truth, that as these symbols taught the Lord's people to
consider their prayers equally acceptable to God with the sweetest incense, and
most excellent sacrifice, David derived confirmation to his faith from the
circumstance. Although the view of the fathers was not confined entirely to the
external ceremonies, David was bound to avail himself of such helps. As he
considered, therefore, that it was not in vain the incense was burned daily on
the altar by God's commandment, and the evening offering presented, he speaks of
his prayers in connection with this ceremonial worship.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The lifting up of the

translate

As the word, which is derived from

<i>nasa</i>, means</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> lifting
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"> in the Hebrew, the natural inference is,
that prayer is meant, in allusion to the outward action practiced in it. And we
can easily suppose that David here as elsewhere repeats the same thing twice. As
to the reason which has led to the universal practice amongst all nations of
lifting up the hand in prayer, I have taken notice of it
elsewhere.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Set a watch, O Jehovah! upon my
mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As David was liable to be hurt at the
unbridled and unprincipled rage of his enemies, so as to be tempted to act in a
manner that might not be justifiable, he prays for divine direction, and not
that he might be kept back from manual violence merely, but that his tongue
might be restrained from venting reproach, or words of complaint. Even persons
of the most self-possessed temper, if unwarrantably injured, will some &#8212;
times proceed to make retaliation, through their resenting the unbecoming
conduct of their enemies. David prays accordingly that his tongue might be
restrained by the Lord from uttering any word which was out of joint. Next he
seeks that his heart be kept back from every mischievous device that might issue
in revenge. The words added &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that I may not eat of their
delicacies</i></font><font face="Palatino">, are to be understood figuratively,
as a petition that he might not be tempted by the prosperity which they enjoyed
in sin to imitate their conduct. The three things mentioned in the context are
to be connected; and it may be advisable to consider each of them more
particularly. Nothing being more difficult than for the victims of unjust
persecution to bridle their speech, and submit silently and without complaint to
injuries, David needed to pray that his mouth might be closed and guarded
&#8212; that the door of his mouth might be kept shut by God, as one who keeps
the gate watches the ingress and egress &#8212;
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrxn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nitsrah</i>, being the imperative of the verb, rather than a noun. He next
subjoins </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that God would not
incline his heart to an evil thing</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rbd</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>dabar</i>, is here, as in many other places, used to signify <i>a thing</i>.
Immediately after he explains himself to mean, that he would not desire to
strive with them in wickedness, and thus make himself like his enemies. Had that
monk of whom Eusebius makes mention duly reflected upon this resolution of
David, he would not have fallen into the silly fallacy of imagining that he had
shown himself the perfect scholar by observing silence for a whole term of seven
years. Hearing that the regulation of the tongue was a rare virtue, he betook
himself to a distant solitude, from which he did not return to his master for
seven years; and being asked the cause of his long absence, replied that he had
been meditating upon what he had learned from this verse. It would have been
proper to have asked him at the same time, whether during the interim he had
thought none, as well as spoken none. For the two things stand connected the
being silent, and the being free from the charge of evil thoughts. It is very
possible that although he observed silence, he had many ungodly thoughts, and
these are worse than vain words. We have simply alluded in passing to this
foolish notion, as what may convince the reader of the possibility of persons
running away with a word torn from its connection, and overlooking the scope of
the writer. In committing himself to the guidance of God, both as to thoughts
and words, David acknowledges the need of the influence of the Spirit for the
regulation of his tongue and of his mind, particularly when tempted to be
exasperated by the insolence of opposition. If, on the one hand, the tongue be
liable to slip and too fast of utterance, unless continually watched and guarded
by God; on the other, there are disorderly affections of an inward kind which
require to be restrained. What a busy workshop is the heart of man, and what a
host of devices is there manufactured every moment! If God do not watch over our
heart and tongue, there will confessedly be no bounds to words and thoughts of a
sinful kind, &#8212; so rare a gift of the Spirit is moderation in language,
while Satan is ever making suggestions which will be readily and easily complied
with, unless God prevent. It need not seem absurd to speak of God inclining our
hearts to evil, since these are in his hand, to turn them whithersoever he
willeth at his pleasure. Not that he himself prompts them to evil desires, but
as according to his secret judgments he surrenders and effectually gives over
the wicked to Satan's tyranny, he is properly said to blind and harden them. The
blame of their sins rests with men themselves, and the lust which is in them;
and, as they are carried out to good or evil by a natural desire, it is not from
any external impulse that they incline to what is evil, but spontaneously and of
their own corruption. I have read &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to work the works of
iniquity;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> others read &#8212; <i>to think the
thoughts of iniquity</i>. The meaning is the same, and it is needless to insist
upon the preference to be given. By

<i>manammim</i>, translated
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>delicacies</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
is meant the satisfaction felt by the ungodly when their sins are connived at
through the divine forbearance. While their insolence in such a case becomes
more presumptuous, even the Lord's people are in danger of being deceived by the
prosperity they see enjoying, and to take liberties themselves. David had reason
therefore to pray for the secret restraints of the Holy Spirit, that he might be
kept from <i>feasting on their delicacies</i>; that is, being intoxicated into
license or sinful pleasure through anything debasing, flattering, or agreeable
in outward circumstances.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

allurements, they, at the same time, deceive one another by flattery, which
leads David to declare, that he would much rather be awakened to his duty by the
severe rod of reproof, than be seduced through pleasing falsehoods. Among those
who hold religion in contempt no reproof is administered to one who has
contracted any sin, and, therefore, if we have any concern for our spiritual
safety we will connect ourselves with good men, who restore such as have fallen
by upright admonition, and bring back those who have erred to the right way. It
is not agreeable to corrupt nature to be reproved when we sin, but, David had
brought himself to that degree of docility and self-denial which led him to
consider no reproof distasteful which he knew to proceed from the spirit of
kindness. As there is some ambiguity in the words, we may see to ascertain the
proper meaning of them. The noun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dsj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chesed</i>, can very well be resolved into the adverb &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the righteous shall smite me
mercifully</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or in <i>mercy</i>, supplying the
preposition. And this is the meaning adopted by most interpreters, that David
reckoned as the best ointment such reproofs as breathed charity and kindness, or
proceeded from a kind and dispassionate spirit. Should this reading be preferred
it is to be remembered, that David refers, not so much to the outward manner in
which the reproof is to be administered, as to the frame of the heart. However
how good men may be, and whatever severity of language they may employ in
admonishing those who have erred, they are still actuated by the force of
brotherly affection. My, the very severity is, in fact, occasioned by their holy
anxiety and fear of their brother's safety. The righteous act mercifully under
all this apparent sharpness and severity &#8212; as the wicked, on the other
hand, act cruelly who censure only in a very gentle manner. By noticing this
feature in reproof, David besides would distinguish that kind of it which takes
its rise in sincere affection, from invectives which proceed from hatred or
private animosity, as Solomon says.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;201012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
10:12.) The other rendering of the words, however, which I have adopted, is
equally suitable <i>&#8212;</i></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Let
the righteous censure me, it shall be mercy, or, I will reckon it a benefit, let
him reprove me, this shall be precious ointment that will not hurt my
head.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The last clause some interpret in another
way &#8212; <i>the oil of the head let it not break my head</i>, that is, let
not the wicked seduce me to destruction by their pleasing
flatteries.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
FE239</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>oil</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">they understand the pernicious adulations by which
the wicked would ruin us, and plunge us deeper and deeper in destruction, while
they seem to administer pleasure. This would make the passage convey a fuller
meaning, That while David was pliable and yielding in the matter of reproof, he
fled from flattery as from the fatal songs of the Sirens. However sweet praise
may be to the taste at first, every one who lends an ear to flattery, drinks in
a poison which will presently diffuse itself through the whole heart. Let us
learn by David's example to reject all flatteries, prone as we are naturally to
receive them, and to renounce waywardness and obstinacy, lest we should put away
from us those corrections which are wholesome remedies for our vices. For such
is the infatuated love men have to their own destruction, that even when forced
to condemn themselves they wish to have the approbation of the world. And why?
that by superinducing torpor of conscience, they may, by their own spontaneous
act, devote themselves to
ruin.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For yet my
prayer</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. Three explanations of this clause
have been suggested. According to some the meaning of it is, that, as we are
ever ready to be corrupted by bad example, David here prays, that he might not
decline to their evils, or the evils which they practiced. The second sense
assigned is, that David, recognizing their mischievous devices, prays that he
may be kept by the Lord from their wickedness. The third sense, that recognizing
them as reduced to desperate calamities, he prays that the just vengeance of God
might be executed upon them according to their deserts. The very opposite
meaning might seem the more suitable, that David was not prevented by their
obstinacy in wickedness from praying for their welfare. For there is the adverb
yet emphatically inserted. Or, what if David is to be considered as predicting
their unfortunate end, intimating, that though the ungodly now riot in excess,
they shall shortly be arrested, and that before long his compassion would be
exercised towards them? The way in which the words stand connected favors this
view; for he does not say &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yet my prayer shall be in their
calamities</i></font><font face="Palatino">, but rather separately, "<i>yet</i>,
or, <i>yet a little while</i>, and then my power shall be in their calamities."
As David was in danger of being tempted to yield to similarly vain courses with
them, he very properly suggests a sustaining motive to his soul, why he should
retain his integrity, that erelong they would be overtaken with so awful a
destruction as to entreat compassion from him and others of the people of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>

down upon stony places</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">FE240</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Almost all interpreters agree, that the tense of the verb should be changed from
the preterit to the future, and then resolve it into the optative <i>&#8212; let
them be thrown down</i>. It appears to me that the sense of David would be made
very plain by reading, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When their
judges have been cast down from the rock, or upon stony places, they shall hear
my words</i></font><font face="Palatino">. David, on perceiving the rage which
the common people expressed towards him, as carried away through the influence
of error and misrepresentation, lays the blame upon their leaders. When their
power should be taken away, he is confident that the simple, who had been
misled, would be brought to a right mind.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Casting from the rocks, or upon
stony places,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is a metaphorical expression in
reference to the high and dignified position in which they were placed. Although
not without blame in following evil counselors so as to persecute unjustly a
good and godly man, yet he had reason to entertain more hope of their
repentance, that they would return to consideration when God executed vengeance
upon those who were at their head. We see how ready the common people are to
judge by impulse rather than deliberation, and to be hurried into most
condemnable proceedings by blind prejudice, while afterwards upon being
admonished they retrace their steps with equal precipitation. So that, granting
cruelty must always be sinful, and simplicity no excuse, we are taught by
David's example to pray that sound counsel may be sent to such as are in error,
with a view to enabling them to hear the truth and the right with
patience.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As one who
breaketh</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. Here David complains that his
enemies were not satisfied with inflicting upon him one death &#8212; death of a
common description &#8212; but must first mangle him, and those associated with
him, and then cast them into the grave. The common robber on the highway throws
the body of his murdered victim whole into the ditch; David tells us, that he
and those with him were treated more barbarously, their Bones being dispersed,
as one cleaves wood or stones into fragments, or digs the earth. From this it
appears, that David, like Paul,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 1:9,) was delivered from deaths oft;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fe241</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and we may learn the duty of continuing to cherish hope of life and deliverance
even when the expression may apply to us, that our bones have been broken and
scattered.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because to thee, O

comprehended under the previous figure of their bones being broken, his praying
in such circumstances is just as if the torn fragments of a mangled corpse
should cry unto God. This may give us some idea of the heroical courage of
David, who could continue to direct his eyes to God even under such overwhelming
difficulties; this being the very part faith ought to discharge, in making us
collected and composed when our senses would otherwise be
confounded.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
FE243</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Great a miracle as it would have been
for God to have preserved them in life, when their bones were scattered abroad,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Keep

snares of his enemies, unless set free by a higher hand. In praying to God under
the straits to which he was reduced, he proves what a high estimate he formed of
what his mercy could effect, as elsewhere he says, that the issues from death
belong to him.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;196820&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
68:20.) God often delays interposing, that the deliverance may be the more
signal; and afterwards he makes the devices of the wicked to recoil upon their
own heads. It seems absurd to refer the pronoun

to Saul, as if the sense were that Doeg and others of that character would fall
into the snares of Saul. It would seem to be God who is intended. First, he had
spoken of being preserved by God from the toils of the wicked, and now to these
snares which the wicked spread for the upright he opposes the snares with which
God catches the crafty in their own devices. And as the number of his enemies
was great, he uses the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>let them fall
together</i></font><font face="Palatino">, for escape would have been
impossible, had he not been persuaded that it was easy for God to overthrow any
combined force and array of men. What follows admits of two meanings. Many read,
<i>I shall always pass</i>. But we may suppose order of the words changed and
read, <i>until I pass</i>. It prays that his enemies should be held in the snare

142</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When Saul came into the cave where David lay
concealed, this saint of God might upon such an occurrence have been either
thrown into consternation, or led by his alarm into some unwarrantable step, it
being common for persons in despair either to be prostrated with dismay, or
driven into frenzy. But it appears from this Psalm that David retained his
composure, relying with assured confidence upon God, and resigning himself to
vows and prayers instead of taking any unauthorized steps.</font><br></div>

mind in David that he was not paralyzed with fear, or that he did not in a
paroxysm of fury take vengeance upon his enemy, as he easily might have done;
and that he was not actuated by despair to take away his life, but composedly
addressed himself to the exercise of prayer. There was good reason why the title
should have been affixed to the Psalm to note this circumstance, and David had
good grounds for mentioning how he commended himself to God. Surrounded by the
army of Saul, and hemmed in by destruction on every side, how was it possible
for him to have spared so implacable an enemy, had he not been fortified against
the strongest temptations by prayer? The repetition he makes use of indicates
his having prayed with earnestness, so as to be impervious to every assault of
temptation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He tells us still more clearly in
the next verse that he disburdened his ears unto God. To pour out one's thoughts
and tell over his afflictions implies the reverse of those perplexing anxieties
which men brood over inwardly to their own distress, and by which they torture
themselves, and are chafed by their afflictions rather than led to God; or it
implies the reverse of those frantic exclamations to which others give utterance
who find no comfort in the superintending providence and care of God. In short,
we are left to infer that while he did not give way before men to loud and
senseless lamentations, neither did he suffer himself to be tormented with
inward and suppressed cares, but made known his grief's with unsuspecting
confidence to the Lord.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When, my

anxiety, yet he confirms what he had said as to the constancy of his faith. The
figure which he uses of his spirit being <i>perplexed</i>,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fe246
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">aptly represents the state of the mind in
alternating between various resolutions when there was no apparent outgate from
danger, and increasing its distress by resorting to all kinds of devices. He
adds, that though there was no apparent way of safety, God knew from the
beginning in what way his deliverance should be effected. Others put a different
meaning upon this clause, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou
knowest my way,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> as if David asserted God to
have been witness of his integrity, but the other is the more correct, that God
knew the way to deliver him, while his own mind was distracted by a variety of
thoughts, and yet could not conceive any mode of extrication. The words teach
us, when we have tried every remedy and know not what to do, to rest satisfied
with the conviction that God is acquainted with our afflictions, and condescends
to care for us, as Abraham said &#8212;</font><br></div>

etc., He shows that there was good cause for the dreadful sufferings he
experienced, since no human aid or comfort was to be expected, and destruction
seemed inevitable. When he speaks of having looked and yet not perceived a
friend amongst men, he does not mean that he had turned his thoughts to earthly
helps in forgetfulness of God, but that he had made such inquiry as was
warrantable after one on the earth who might assist him. Had any person of the
kind presented himself, he would no doubt have recognized him as an instrument
in the hand of God's mercy, but it was God's purpose that he should be abandoned
of all assistance from man, and that his deliverance from destruction should
thus appear more extraordinary. In the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>none seeking after my
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino">, the verb to <i>seek after</i> is used in
a good sense, for being solicitous about any man's welfare or

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I cried unto thee, O

interposition, David complains of the low estate he was reduced to, and of his
extremity; the term cry denoting vehemence, as I have elsewhere noticed. He
speaks of deliverance as being plainly needed, since he was now held a prisoner.
By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prison</i></font><font face="Palatino">
some suppose he alludes to the cave where he was lodged, but this is too
restricted a meaning. The subsequent clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the righteous shall compass
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">, is translated differently by some, <i>they
shall wait me</i>. I have retained the true and natural sense. I grant that it
is taken figuratively for surrounding, intimating that he would be a spectacle
to all, the eyes of men being attracted by such a singular case of deliverance.
If any consider the words not to be figurative, the sense will be, That the
righteous would not only congratulate him, but place a crown upon his head in
token of victory. Some explain the passage, They will assemble to congratulate
me, and will stand round me on every side like a crown. As the words literally
read, <i>they will crown</i> upon me, some supply another pronoun, and give this
sense, that the righteous would construe the mercy bestowed upon David as a
glory conferred upon themselves; for when God delivers any of his children he
holds out the prospect of deliverance to the rest, and, as it were, gifts them
with a crown. The sense which I have adopted is the simplest, however, That the
mercy vouchsafed would be shown conspicuously to all as in a theater, proving a
signal example to the righteous for establishment of their faith. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lmg</font><font face="Palatino">,

and means <i>to confer a benefit</i>, as I have shown

the just judgment of God in it all, and seeks to conciliate his favor by humbly

declared that amidst all his affliction he still remembered God, he prays for
restoration, and the guidance of God's Spirit, that the remainder of his life

the oppression of his enemies must have been extreme, when David laments his
case in such earnest and pathetic terms. The introductory words show that the
grief he felt was great. His reason for speaking of the justice and faithfulness
of God in connection we have shown elsewhere. Under the term <i>justice</i>, or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
we are not to suppose that he speaks of merit, or hire, as some ignorantly
imagine, but of that goodness of God which leads him to defend his people. To
the same effect does he speak of God's
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or <i>faithfulness</i>; for the best proof he can give of his faithfulness is in
not forsaking those whom he has promised to help. In helping his people he shows
himself to be a just and true God, both in not frustrating their expectation,
and in so far as he shows in this extension of mercy what his nature is, that
David very properly encourages himself in prayer by making mention of
both.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And enter not into
judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fe249</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
etc. I have hinted already why he proceeds to pray for pardon. When overtaken by
adversity, we are ever to conclude that it is a rod of correction sent by God to
stir us up to pray. Although he is far from taking pleasure in our trials, it is
certain that our sins are the cause of his dealing towards us with this
severity. While those to whom David was opposed were wicked men, and he was
perfectly conscious of the rectitude of his cause as regarded them, he freely
acknowledged his sin before God as a condemned suppliant. We are to hold this as
a general rule in seeking to conciliate God, that we must pray for the pardon of
our sins. If David found refuge nowhere else than in prayer for pardon, who is
there amongst us who would presume to come before God trusting in his own
righteousness and integrity? Nor does David here merely set an example before
God's people how they ought to pray, but declares that there is none amongst men
who could be just before God were he called to plead his cause. The passage is
one fraught with much instruction, teaching us, as I have just hinted, that God
can only show favor to us in our approaches by throwing aside the character of a
judge, and reconciling us to himself in a gratuitous remission of our sins. All
human righteousnesses, accordingly, go for nothing, when we come to his
tribunal. This is a truth which is universally acknowledged in words, but which
very few are seriously impressed with. As there is an indulgence which is
mutually extended to one another amongst men, they all come confidently before
God for judgment, as if it were as easy to satisfy him as to gain man's
approval. In order to obtain a proper view of the whole matter, we are first to
note what is meant by being justified. The passage before us clearly proves that
the man who is justified, is he who is judged and reckoned just before God, or
whom the heavenly Judge himself acquits as innocent. Now, in denying that any
amongst men can claim this innocence, David intimates that any righteousness
which the saints have is not perfect enough to abide God's scrutiny, and thus he
declares that all are guilty before God, and can only be absolved in the way of
acknowledging they might justly be condemned. Had perfection been a thing to be
found in the world, he certainly of all others was the man who might justly have
boasted of it; and the righteousness of Abraham and the holy fathers was not
unknown to him; but he spares neither them nor himself, but lays it down as the
one universal rule of conciliating God, that we must cast ourselves upon his
mercy. This may give us some idea of the satanic infatuation which has taken
hold of those who speak so much of perfection in holiness, with a view to
supersede remission of sins. Such a degree of pride could never be evinced by
them, were they not secretly influenced by a brutish contempt of God. They speak
in high and magnificent terms of regeneration, as if the whole kingdom of Christ
consisted in purity of life. But in doing away with the principal blessing of
the everlasting covenant &#8212; gratuitous reconciliation &#8212; which God's
people are commanded to seek daily, and in puffing up both themselves and others
with a vain pride, they show what spirit they are of. Let us hold them in
detestation, since they scruple not to put open contempt upon God. This of
itself, however, which we have stated, is not enough; for the Papists themselves
acknowledge that were God to enter upon an examination of men's lives as a
judge, all would lie obnoxious to just condemnation. And in this respect they
are sounder, more moderate and sober, than those Cyclopses and monsters in
heresy of whom we have just spoken. But though not arrogating to themselves
righteousness in the whole extent of it, they show, by obtruding their merits
and satisfactions, that they are very far from following the example of David.
They are always ready to acknowledge some defect in their works, and so, in
seeking God's favor, they plead for the assistance of his mercy. But there is
nothing intermediate between these two things, which are represented in
Scripture as opposites &#8212; being justified by faith and justified by works.
It is absurd for the Papists to invent a third species of righteousness, which
is partly wrought out by works of their own, and partly imputed to them by God
in his mercy. Without all doubt, when he affirmed that no man could stand before
God were his works brought to judgment, David had no idea of this complex or
twofold righteousness, but would shut us up at once to the conclusion that God
is only favorable upon the ground of his mercy, since any reputed righteousness
of man has no significance before him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the enemy hath persecuted my
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Having acknowledged that he only suffered
the just punishment of his sins, David comes now to speak of his enemies; for to
have begun by speaking of them would have been a preposterous order. Their
cruelty was shown in their not resting satisfied but with the destruction of one
who was a saint of God; he declares that he must even now perish unless God
should help him speedily. The comparison is not merely to a dead man, but a
putrid corpse; for by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the dead of
an age</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe250</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> are meant those who have been long
removed from the world. Such language intimates that he not only trusted in God
as he who could heal him of a deadly disease, but considered that though his
life should be buried, as it were, and long out of mind, God could raise it
again, and restore his very
ashes.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

troubles that were without, now he acknowledges the feebleness of his spirits,
from which it is evident that his strength, vas not like that of the rock,
imperturbable or without feeling, but that, while overwhelmed with grief as to
the feeling of the flesh, he owed his support entirely to faith and the grace of
the Spirit,. We are taught by his example not to throw up the conflict in
despair, however much we may be weakened, and even exanimated by afflictions, as
God will enable us to surmount them, if we only rise to him with our hearts
amidst all our anxieties.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the next verse
David mentions that he had diligently sought means whereby to mitigate his
grief. It is not to be wondered at, that many who spontaneously give themselves
up to inaction, should sink under their trials, not using means to invigorate
themselves by calling to remembrance the grace of God. Sometimes, it is true,
our trials are only more keenly felt when we recall the former kindness which
God may have shown to us, the comparison tending to awaken our feelings, and
render them more acute; but David proposed a different end than this to himself,
and gathered confidence from the past mercies of God. The very best method in
order to obtain relief in trouble, when we are about to faint under it, is to
call to mind the former loving-kindness of the Lord. Nor does David mean such as
he had experienced from childhood, as some have thought, adopting in my judgment
too restricted a sense; for the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;dq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kedem</i>, has a more extensive signification. I have no doubt, therefore,
that he includes past history, as well as his own personal experience, it being
easy to discover proofs there of God's continued goodness to his people. We
should ourselves learn by his example, in reflecting upon personal favors
received from God, to remember also how often he has assisted those that served
him, and improve the truth for our own benefit. Should this not immediately or
at once abate the bitterness of our grief, yet the advantage of it will
afterwards appear. In the passage before us, David complains that he did not get
relief from his anxieties and cares from this consolatory source, but he
prosecuted his meditations in expectation of finding the good result in due
time. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hw&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>suach</i>, I have elsewhere observed, may mean either<i> to declare with the
tongue</i>, or <i>to revolve in the mind</i>. Some accordingly read &#8212; "I
have discoursed of thy works." But as the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hgh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>hagah</i>, means to <i>meditate</i>, I consider that the Psalmist repeats the
same thing twice, and this in token of earnestness. We will often upon a slight
exercise of the thoughts upon God's works, start aside from them almost
immediately; nor is it matter of surprise, that, in this case, there results no
solid comfort. That our knowledge may be abiding we must call in the aid of
constant attention.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have stretched forth my hands
to thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here appears the good effect of
meditation, that it stirred David up to pray; for if we reflect seriously upon
the acting's of God towards his people, and towards ourselves in our own
experience, this will necessarily lead out our minds to seek after him, under
the alluring influence of his goodness. Prayer, indeed, springs from faith; but
as practical proofs of the favor and mercy confirm this faith, they are means
evidently fitted for dissipating languor. He makes use of a striking figure to
set forth the ardor of his affection, comparing
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his soul to the parched
earth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In great heats we see that the earth is
cleft, and opens, as it were, its mouth to heaven for moisture. David therefore
intimates, he drew near to God with vehement desire, as if the very sap of life
failed him, as he shows more fully in the verse which follows. In this he gives
another proof of his extraordinary faith. Feeling himself weak, and ready to
sink into the very grave, he does not vacillate between this and the other hope
of relief, but fixes his sole dependence upon God. And heavy as the struggle was
that he underwent with his own felt weakness, the fainting of spirit he speaks
of was a better stimulant to prayer than any stoical obstinacy he might have
shown in suppressing fear, grief, or anxiety. We must not overlook the fact, how
in order to induce himself to depend exclusively upon God, he dismisses all
other hopes from his mind, and makes a chariot to himself of the extreme
necessity of his case, in which he ascends upwards to
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
143:8-12	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b> Cause me to hear thy
loving-kindness in the morning, for in thee have I hoped; show me the way in
which I may walk, for I have lifted up my soul to thee. <b>9.</b> Deliver me, O
Jehovah! from my enemies; I have hidden with thee. <b>10.</b> Teach me that I
may do thy will, for thou art my God; let thy good Spirit lead me into the right
land. <b>11.</b> For thy name's sake, O Lord! thou wilt quicken me: in thy

servant.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cause me to hear thy
loving-kindness</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In this verse he again prays
that God would show him his favor visibly and effectually. The expression cause
me to hear, may seem not very proper, as the goodness of God is rather felt than
heard; but as the mere perception of God's benefits, without a believing
apprehension and improvement of them, would do us little good, David very
properly begins with hearing. We see how wicked men riot in the abundance of
them, while yet they have no sense of the Lord's goodness, through want of
attention to the word, and a believing apprehension of God as a father. The
adverb in the morning some confine to a reference to sacrifices &#8212; which is
a meager interpretation &#8212; in allusion to the well-known fact that
sacrifices used to be offered twice, in the morning and in the evening. Others
give a more strained sense, understanding that when God deals in a more
favorable way with his people, he is said to form a new
day.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
FE253</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Others consider it to be a metaphor for
a prosperous and happy condition, as an afflicted and calamitous time is often
denoted by darkness. I wonder that there should be such a search after
extraneous meanings for this word, by which he is simply to be considered as
repeating his former prayer to God &#8212; make haste. In the morning means the
same with speedily or seasonably. He founds a reason here, as elsewhere, upon
his having hoped in God, this being something by which, in a sense, we lay God
under obligation to us, for in making a liberal offer of himself to us, and
promising to sustain the relationship of a father, he gives what men would call
a pledge. This, accordingly, is a species of obligation. But so far is this from
implying any worthiness or merit on our part, that the hope we entertain rather
proves our nothingness and helplessness. His prayer that a way might be opened
up for him to walk in, refers to the anxieties which perplexed him. He intimates
that he was dismayed, and brought to a stand, unable to move a step, if God did
not open a way, by his divine power; that all the desires of his soul terminated
upon him; and that he looked for counsel from him to procure relief in his
perplexity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Deliver me, O Jehovah! from my
enemies</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This prayer is to the same effect, his
enemies being so earnestly bent upon his destruction as to leave no outgate for
him. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ytysk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chisithi</i>, some render <i>to hope</i>: the proper meaning is <i>to
cover</i>, and I am unwilling to depart from it. The explanation some give is,
that David upon perceiving the imminent danger to which he was exposed, betook
himself to the covert of God's shadow, and concealed himself under the
protection of it. This seems a very natural rendering, at least I prefer it to
another which has recommended itself to some as being ingenious &#8212; that
David, instead of having recourse to various quarters for relief, was satisfied
to have God cognizant of his case, and called upon him in a hidden manner and
apart.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Teach me that I may do thy
will</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He now rises to something higher, praying
not merely for deliverance from outward troubles, but, what is of still greater
importance, for the guidance of God's Spirit, that he might not decline to the
right hand or to the left, but be kept in the path of rectitude. This is a
request which should never be forgotten when temptations assail us with great
severity, as it is peculiarly difficult to submit to God without resorting to
unwarrantable methods of relief. As anxiety, fear, disease, languor, or pain,
often tempt persons to particular steps, David's example should bad us to pray
for divine restraint, and that we may not be hurried, through impulses of
feeling, into unjustifiable courses. We are to mark carefully his way of
expressing himself, for what he asks is not simply to be taught what the will of
God is, but to be taught and brought to the observance, and doing of it. The
former kind of teaching is of less avail, as upon God's showing us our duty we
by no means necessarily follow it, and it is necessary that he should draw out
our affections to himself. God therefore must be master and teacher to us not
only in the dead letter, but by the inward motions of his Spirit; indeed there
are three ways in which he acts the part of our teacher, instructing us by his
word, enlightening our minds by the Spirit, and engraving instruction upon our
hearts, so as to bring us observe it with a true and cordial consent. The mere
hearing of the word would serve no purpose, nor is it enough that we understand
it; there must be besides the willing' obedience of the heart. Nor does he
merely say, Teach me that I may be capable of doing, as the deluded Papists
imagine that the grace of God does no more than make us flexible to what is
good, but he seeks something to be actually and presently
done.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He insists upon the same thing in the next
clause, when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let thy
good Spirit lead me</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc., for he desires the
guidance of the Spirit not merely as he enlightens our minds, but as he
effectually influences the consent of our hearts, and as it were leads us by the
hand. The passage in its connection warns us of the necessity of being
sedulously on our guard against yielding to inordinate passions in any contests
we may have with wicked persons, and as we have no sufficient wisdom or power of
our own by which to check and restrain these passions, that we should always
seek the guidance of God's Spirit, to keep them in moderation. More generally,
the passage teaches us what we are to think of free will; for David here denies
the will to have the power of judging rightly, till our hearts be formed to a
holy obedience by the Spirit of God. The term leading, which I have already
adverted to, proves also that David did not hold that middle species of grace
which Papists talk so much about, and which leaves man in a state of suspension
or indecision, but asserts something much more effectual, agreeably to what Paul
says,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;503813&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:13,) that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"it is God who works in
us both to will and to do</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">of his

<div><font face="Palatino">By the words
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>right
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino">, I understand, figuratively,
<i>uprightness</i>; David's meaning being, that we are drawn into error whenever
we decline from what is agreeable to the will of God. The term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is tacitly opposed to that corruption which is natural to us; what he says being
tantamount to this, that all men's thoughts are polluted and perverted, till
reduced to right rule by the grace of the Spirit. It follows that nothing which
is dictated by the judgment of the flesh is good or sound. I grant that wicked
men are led away by an evil spirit sent from God, for he executes his judgments
by the agency of devils,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;091614&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 16:14;) but when David in this place speaks of God's
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">, I do not imagine that he has any such
strained allusion, but rather that he takes here to himself the charge of
corruption, and assigns the praise of whatever is good, upright, or true, to the
Spirit of God. When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because thou art my
God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he shows that his confidence of obtaining
his request was founded entirely upon the free favor and promises of God. It is
not a matter lying within our own power to make him our God, but it rests with
his free preventing grace.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thy name's sake, O
Jehovah!</i></font><font face="Palatino"> etc. By this expression he makes it
still more clear that it was entirely of God's free mercy that he looked for
deliverance; for, had he brought forward anything of his own, the cause would
not have been in God, and only in God. He is said to help us
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for his own name's
sake,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> when, although he discovers nothing in us
to conciliate his favor, he is induced to interpose of his mere goodness. To the
same effect is the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
for God, as I have said elsewhere, has made the deliverance of his people a
means of illustrating his righteousness. He at the same time repeats what he had
said as to the extraordinary extent of his afflictions: in seeking to be
quickened or made alive, he declares himself to be exanimated, and that he must
remain under the power of death, if the God who has the issues of life did not
recover him by a species of
resurrection.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And in thy
mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. In this verse he repeats for the
fifth or sixth time that he looked for life only of God's free mercy. Whatever
severity may appear on the part of God when he destroys the wicked, David
affirms that the vengeance taken upon them would be a proof of fatherly mercy to
him. Indeed these two things often meet together &#8212; the severity and the
goodness of God; for in stretching out his hand to deliver his own people, he
directs the thunder of his indignation against their enemies. In short, he comes
forth armed for the deliverance of his people, as he says in
Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The day of vengeance is
in mine heart,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and this is the year

honor to be got by our own struggles or exertions &#8212; to be reckoned among
God's servants; it depends upon his free choice, by which he condescends before
we are born to take us into the number and rank of his followers, as David

bestowed upon him, is led at the same time, either from a consideration of the
many trials to be met with in the whole course of human life, or from the
connection he still had with wicked men, to pray that God would continue to show
this favor to the end. There is this difference between it and Psalm
18,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe255</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that the latter is triumphant
throughout, the kingdom having been thoroughly subdued, and affairs going

celebrates the favor of God in such high terms, had not only obtained the
kingdom, but gained signal victories. When he calls God
<i>his</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
strength</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he acknowledges that any courage he
had was given him from above, not only because he had been made from a country
shepherd a mighty warrior, but because the constancy and perseverance he had
shown was signally a gift from God. This term answers better than were we to
translate it rock; for, by way of explanation, he adds immediately afterwards,
that he had been formed under God's teaching for war. The words certainly imply
an acknowledgment, that though of a warlike spirit, he was not born for warlike
enterprises but needed to undergo a change. What kind of a commencement, for
example, did he show in the case of Goliah? That attempt would have been
preposterous on any other supposition than his being upheld by secret divine
support, so as to be independent of mere human help.

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191850&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
18:50) he calls himself "God's king," not in the sense of his having dominion
over God, but being made and appointed king by him. Having experienced God's
kindness in so many ways, he calls him "his goodness," meaning that whatever
good he possessed flowed from him. The accumulation of terms, one upon another,
which follows, may appear unnecessary, yet it tends greatly to strengthen faith.
We know how unstable men's minds are, and especially how soon faith wavers, when
they are assailed by some trial of more than usual severity. It is not enough,
if God would sustain us under such weakness, to promise us his help in
individual or single expressions; and, even however many aids he supplies us
with, we are subject to very great vacillations, and a forgetfulness of his
mercy creeps in upon us which almost overwhelms our minds. We are to remember
that it is not merely in token of his gratitude that David heaps together so
many terms in declaring the goodness of God, but to fortify God's people against
all attacks of the world, and of the evil one. He had a reason for reckoning it
among the chiefest of God's mercies, that he controlled the people under his
government. For

such a forced rendering, as David means simply that the settled state of the
kingdom was owing not to any counsel, valor, or authority of his own, but to
God's secret favor. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ddr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>radad</i>, is used appropriately, signifying <i>to spread out</i>. The idea
some have, that by a people spread out is meant a people set down at ease in a
prosperous and happy condition, is farfetched. I have as great objections to the
idea of others, that he means a people laid prostrate, so as that they may be
trodden under foot; for a violent domination like this would not have been
desirable over the chosen people, and sacred inheritance of the Lord. When a
people yields a cordial and willing obedience to the laws, all subordinating
themselves to their own place peaceably, this signally proves the divine
blessing. And in such a settlement as this, where there is no turbulence, nor
confusion, the people are appropriately represented, according to what we have
said above, as being <i>spread out</i>. David accordingly having ascribed the
victories lie had gained over foreign enemies to God, thanks him at the same
time for the settled state of the kingdom. Raised indeed as he was from an
obscure station, and exposed to hatred from calumnious charges, it was scarcely
to have been believer[that he would ever obtain a peaceable reign. The people
had suddenly and beyond expectation submitted to him, and so surprising a change
was eminently God's work.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Jehovah! what is

God by instituting a comparison. Having declared how singularly he had been
dealt with, he turns his eyes inward, and asks, "Who am I, that God should show
me such condescension? " He speaks of man in general; only the circumstance is
noticeable that he commends the mercy of God, by considering his lowly and
abject condition. In other places he mentions grounds of humiliation of a more
personal or private nature, &#8212; here he confines himself to what has
reference to our common nature; and though even in discussing the nature of man
there are other reasons he might have specified why he is unworthy of the regard
and love of God, he briefly adverts to his being like the smoke, and as a
<i>shadow.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
FE259</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We are left to infer that the riches of
the divine goodness are extended to objects altogether unworthy in themselves.
We are warned, when apt at any time to forget ourselves, and think we are
something when we are nothing, that the simple fact of the shortness of our life
should put down all arrogance and pride. The Scriptures, in speaking of the
frailty of man, comprehend whatever is necessarily connected with it. And,
indeed, if our life vanish in a moment, what is there stable about us? We taught
this truth also &#8212; that we cannot properly estimate the divine goodness,
unless we take into consideration what we are as to our condition, as we can
only ascribe to God what is due unto him, by acknowledging that his goodness is
bestowed upon undeserving creatures. The reader may seek for further information
upon this point in the eighth Psalm, where nearly the same truth is insisted
upon.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

goodness of God, he requests him to furnish such help for the preservation of
the kingdom as was necessary in the present exigency. As formerly we saw that he
had gloried in God with a heroical courage, so here he makes use of the same
lofty terms in his prayers, That he would bow the heavens &#8212; that he would
make the mountains to smoke &#8212; disturb the air with thunderings &#8212; and
shoot forth arrows; forms of speech by which, doubtless, he would put away from
him all the obstacles which stand between us and a believing apprehension of the
omnipotence of God, and from which we find it so difficult to emerge. He employs
almost the same phraseology in the eighteenth Psalm, but it is in praising God
for help already extended, and to signify that he had been preserved from above
in a wonderful and unusual manner. For although such signs as he mentions might
not always occur when God interposed in his behalf, he had good ground to
celebrate what had happened to him of an unexpected kind, by reference to
extraordinary phenomena. In the passage before us his purpose is different.
Threatened by destruction of various kinds, which might overwhelm his mind with
despair, he would realize the wonderful power of God, before which all obstacles
of a worldly kind must necessarily give way. We may be certain at least that he
indulged in this figurative phraseology for a good reason, that he might not
confine deliverance to human remedies; for nothing could be more preposterous at
such a time than to measure divine power by ordinary
rules.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Send thy
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. In one word we are now made to see
what was meant by the figures formerly used &#8212; that in the absence of all
earthly help, God would put forth his hand from above, the greatness of the
exigency making extraordinary help necessary. Accordingly he compares his
enemies to great and deep waters. He calls them strangers, not in respect of
generic origin, but character and disposition. It were a mistake to refer the
term to the uncircumcision, for David rather animadverts upon degenerate Jews
who gloried in the flesh; and shortly afterwards he hints that he had to do with
internal foes rather than a foreign enemy, who would openly assault him with
violence and arms. By the right hand of falsehood some understand rash attempts,
which David hoped would be frustrated. Others limit the phrase to the solemn
ceremony of taking an oath, as if he said they were
perjured;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe263</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> while others explain it as meaning that
they not only lied with the tongue, but executed wicked devices with the
hand.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
FE264</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But as it was customary in making

16:5,) I have no doubt David's reference here is to false, treacherous, and
perfidious persons. The two things go naturally together in the verse &#8212;
the lying tongue and the deceitful hand, meaning upon the matter that nothing
was to be looked for from any of their promises, since it was only to deceive
that they flattered with their mouth and gave the
hand.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

self-possession, to the exercise of praising God, not doubting but he would
continue those mercies which he had once bestowed. I have taken notice in
another place that by a </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>new
song</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is meant one of a singular or uncommon
kind; and we are left from this to infer that David's expectations stretched
beyond the conclusions of man's judgment; for, with a view to the greatness of
the help to be extended, he promises a song of praise unprecedented in its
nature, and distinguished, by the title here applied to it, from ordinary
thanksgiving's. As to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nablum</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>psaltery</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
I have elsewhere observed that they formed part of that system of training under
the law to which the Church was subjected in its infancy. But the chief thing to
be noticed is the subject of his songs that God, who is the preserver of kings,
had kept &#8212; and even rescued from the sword &#8212; David, whom he had made
and anointed king by his authoritative decree. As to the idea of there being
implied in the term <i>kings</i> an opposition to the commonalty, David meaning
that not only the common class of people are indebted to divine preservation,
but the more influential, and such as appear to have sufficient and abundant
strength of their own, I question whether it be well founded. His meaning seems
to me rather to be different from this, That while God preserves all men without
exception, his care is peculiarly extended to the maintenance of political
order, which is the foundation of the common safety of all. It is in effect as
if he called him the guardian and defender of kingdoms; for as the very mention
of government is an odious thing, and none willingly obeys another, and nothing
is more contrary to natural inclination than servitude, men would seek to throw
off the yoke, and subvert the thrones of kings, were these not hedged round by a
hidden divine presidency. David, however, distinguishes himself from other
kings, as elsewhere he is called "the firstborn of kings,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;198927&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
89:27;) at least he speaks of the goodness of God as having been preeminently
shown to him, representing himself as holding the highest place, on account of
the holy anointing which had been more eminently bestowed upon him. As a title
of distinction, he claims the special name of <i>God's servant</i>; for although
all kings are God's servants, and Cyrus has the name applied to him by Isaiah
emphatically,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
45:1,) yet as no heathen prince ever recognized himself as called of God, and
David alone of all others in the world was invested with legitimate authority,
and had a warrant to reign which faith could rest upon with certainty, it was
not without reason that this mark of distinction is applied to him. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the hurtful
sword</i></font><font face="Palatino">, are doubtless meant all the dangers he
had passed through for a series of years, which were such that he might be truly
said to have come to the throne by deaths oft, and to have been settled upon the
throne in the midst of them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

FE271</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Others think that David congratulates
himself, and all the people, that through the divine blessing every species of
mercy was showered down prosperously upon them. I have no doubt that David
commemorates, by way of thanksgiving, the liberality which God had shown to his
people. But it consists very well with this, to suppose that he prays at the
same time for the continuance or preservation of those divine benefits which
must well-nigh be cut off altogether by wicked men and domestic foes, unless God
should interpose, in the troubles and confusions which prevailed. The end he has
in view therefore is, that God would not suffer the signal blessings with which
he had loaded his people to fail and depart. He begins by making mention of the
children, comparing the male portion of them, by way of commendation of their
excellency, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to plants which have
grown up in their youth</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for trees rarely come
to any height if they do not grow large early, and when yet tender. He speaks of
the girls as being like </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>corners
skillfully and ingeniously cut out</i></font><font face="Palatino">, to make the
building beautiful; as if he would say that they adorned the house by their
comeliness and elegance. It is not surprising that he should reckon a noble and
well trained offspring to be the very first of God's earthly blessings, a point
of which I have spoken elsewhere more at large. As David speaks in the name of
the whole people, and of his own condition as mixed up with that of the
community, we may infer from this that he was not exclusively occupied with his
own private interests.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>

But as the word comes from the same root with
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwz</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>zavah</i>, which is rendered corner in the previous verse, it seems more
agreeable to the etymology to translate the words as I have done &#8212; "that
the recesses or corners were full." The participle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yqypm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mephikim</i>, some take transitively, and read <i>producing</i>, but the
meaning comes to the same thing, that abundance of every blessing flowed from

manifold nature of the blessings, rather than, as some interpreters think, so
abundant a produce as would issue in the different species being mixed, and
forming a confused heap owing to the unmanageable plenty. We have no need to
have recourse to this strained hyperbole, and the words as they stand evidently
do not favor that sense, for had a confused heap been meant, it would have read
simply </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;z
&#710;z</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>zan</i>. The meaning in short is, that
there prevailed amongst the people such plenty, not only of wheat, but all kinds
of produce, that every corner was filled to sufficiency with every
variety.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>

<i>mesubbalim</i>, to mean robust,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe274</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as unless they were strong oxen they
would not be fit for carriage, or bearing burdens. Others think they are spoken
of as laden with fat. There is no need for insisting upon this point, as it does
not affect the main scope of the passage. It may be more important to notice,
that God's fatherly care of his people is celebrated on the account that he
condescends to attend to every the smallest matter which concerns their
advantage. As in the verse before he had ascribed the fruitfulness of the herds
and flocks to God's goodness, so now the fattening of their oxen, to show that
there is nothing relating to us here which he overlooks. As it would signify
little to have abundance of everything unless we could enjoy it, he takes notice
of it as another part of the Lord's kindness that the people were peaceable and
quiet. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>breach</i></font><font face="Palatino">
I have no doubt that he alludes to hostile incursions, that there was no enemy
to break in upon them through demolished gates or walls. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>goings
out</i></font><font face="Palatino"> it is surprising that any should understand
exile, that the people were not torn away from the bounds of their native
country. All he means simply is, in my opinion, that there was no necessity of
sallying out to repel an enemy, none offering violence or molestation. To the
same effect is the expression, as to any crying in the streets, the effect of a
sudden tumult. The meaning is, accordingly, that there was no disturbance in the
cities, because God kept enemies at a
distance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Happy the
people</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. He thus concludes that the divine
favor had been sufficiently shown and manifested to his people. Should any
object that it breathed altogether a gross and worldly spirit to estimate man's
happiness by benefits of a transitory description, I would say in reply that we
must read the two things in connection, that those are happy who recognize the
favor of God in the abundance they enjoy, and have such a sense of it from these
transitory blessings as leads them through a persuasion of his fatherly love to
aspire after the true inheritance. There is no impropriety in calling those
happy whom God blesses in this world, provided they do not show themselves
blinded in the improvement and use which they make of their mercies, or
foolishly and supinely overlook the author of them. The kind providence of God
in not suffering us to want any of the means of life is surely a striking
illustration of his wonderful love. What more desirable than to be the objects
of God's care, especially if we have sufficient understanding to conclude from
the liberality with which he supports us he is our Father? For everything is to
be viewed with a reference to this point. Better it were at once to perish for
want than have a mere brute satisfaction, and forget the main thing of all, that
they and they only are happy whom God has chosen for his people. We are to
observe this, that while God in giving us meat and drink admits us to the
enjoyment of a certain measure of happiness, it does not follow that those
believers are miserable who struggle through life in want and poverty, for this
want, whatever it be, God can counterbalance by better
consolations.</font><br></div>

do himself, as stir up and urge all others to this religious service of offering
to God the praises due to his name. The design with which he declares God to be
beneficent to the children of men is, to induce them to cultivate a pious
gratitude, he insists upon the necessity of persevering in the exercise; for
since God is constant in extending mercies, it would be highly improper in us to
faint in his praises. As he thus gives his people new ground for praising him,
so he stimulates them to gratitude, and to exercise it throughout the whole
course of their life. In using the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>daily</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he denotes perseverance in the exercise. Afterwards he adds, that should he live
through a succession of ages he would never cease to act in this manner. The
repetitions used tend very considerably to give emphasis to his language. As it
is probable that the Psalm was written at a time when the kingdom of David was
in a flourishing condition, the circumstances deserves notice, that in calling
God <i>his king</i> he gives both himself and other earthly princes their proper
place, and does not allow any earthly distinctions to interfere with the glory
due to God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This is made still more manifest in
the verse which follows, where, in speaking of the greatness of God as
unmeasurable, he intimates that we only praise God aright when we are filled and
overwhelmed with an ecstatic admiration of the immensity of his power. This
admiration will form the fountain from which our just praises of him will
proceed, according the measure of our
capacity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Generation to

general truth, that all men were made and are preserved in life for this end,
that they may devote themselves to the praise of God. And there is an implied
contrast between the eternal name of God, and that immortality of renown which
great men seem to acquire by their exploits. Human excellencies are eulogized in
histories; with God it stands differently, for there is not a day in which he
does not. renew remembrance of his works, and cherish it by some present effect,
so as indelibly to preserve it alive upon our minds. For the same reason he
speaks of the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>glorious
brightness</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or beauty of his excellence, the
better to raise in others a due admiration of it.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the words of his wonderful
works, </i></font><font face="Palatino">I consider that there is an allusion to
the incomprehensible method of God's works, for so many are the wonders that
they overwhelm our senses. And we may infer from this, that the greatness of God
is not that which lies concealed in his mysterious essence, and in subtle
disputation upon which, to the neglect of his works, many have been chargeable
with mere trifling, for true religion demands practical not speculative
knowledge. Having said that he would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>speak
of</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or <i>meditate upon God's works</i>, (for
the Hebrew word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hjy&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>asichah</i>, as we have elsewhere seen, may be rendered either way,) he
transfers his discourse to others, intimating, that there will always be some in
the world to declare the righteousness, goodness, and wisdom of God, and that
his divine excellencies are worthy of being sounded, with universal consent, by
every tongue. And, should others desist and defraud God of the honor due to him,
he declares that he would himself at least discharge his part, and, while they
were silent, energetically set forth the praises of God. Some think, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the might of his terrible
works</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is an expression to the same effect with
what had been already stated. But it seems rather to denote the judgments of God

<i>nabang</i>, means properly to <i>gush out</i>, some suppose, that, as applied
to speech, it means not simply speaking, but an overflowing utterance, like

<i>yerannenu</i>, in the close of the verse, answers to this, meaning <i>to
shout</i>, or <i>sing aloud</i>. To celebrate the memory of the Lord's goodness,
is the same with recalling to memory what we have personally experienced of his
goodness. We cannot deny God's claim to praise in all his excellencies, but we
are most sensibly affected by such proofs of his fatherly mercy as we have
ourselves experienced. David makes use, therefore, of this alluring
consideration to induce us the more readily and cheerfully to engage in the
praises of God, or rather, (according to the figurative word already used,) to
burst forth in celebration of them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah is

which he spoke by using several expressions, as that God is inclined to mercy,
(for such is the proper meaning of the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wnj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>channun</i>,) and that he helps us willingly, as one sympathizing with our
miseries. It is to be noticed that David has borrowed the terms which he here
applies to God from that celebrated passage in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;023406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
34:6; and as the inspired writers drew their doctrine from the fountain of the
law, we need not wonder that they set a high value upon the vision which is
there recorded, and in which as clear and satisfactory a description of the
nature of God is given us as can anywhere be found. David, therefore, in giving
us a brief statement of what it was most important we should know in reference
to God, makes use of the same terms employed there. Indeed no small part of the
grace of God is to be seen in his alluring us to himself by such attractive
titles. Were he to bring his power prominently into view before us, we would be
cast down by the terror of it rather than encouraged, as the Papists represent
him a dreadful God, from whose presence all must fly, whereas the proper view of
him is that which invites us to seek after him. Accordingly, the more nearly
that a person feels himself drawn to God, the more has he advanced in the
knowledge of him. If it be true that God is not only willing to befriend us, but
is spoken of as touched with sympathy for our miseries, so as to be all the
kinder to us the more that we are miserable, what folly were it not to fly to
him without delay? But as we drive God's goodness away from us by our sins, and
block up the way of access, unless his goodness overcome this obstacle, it would
be in vain that the Prophets spoke of his grace and
mercy.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
FE280</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It was necessary, therefore, to add
what follows, that great is his mercy, that he pardons sins, and bears with the
wickedness of men, so as to show favor to the unworthy. As regards the ungodly,
although God shows them his long-suffering patience, they are incapable of
perceiving pardon, so that the doctrine on which we insist has a special
application to believers only, who apprehend God's goodness by a living faith.

application than the former, for the declaration of David is to the effect, that
not only does God, with fatherly indulgence and clemency, forgive sin, but is
good to all without discrimination, as he makes his sun to rise upon the good
and upon the wicked.

praises, observing a wicked silence regarding them, David declares that they
shine forth everywhere, appear of themselves, and are sounded, as it were, by
the very dumb creatures. He then assigns the special work of declaring them to
believers, who have eyes to perceive God's works, and know that they cannot be
employed better than in celebrating his mercies. What is added &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall speak the glory of thy

only to believers. If any incline to think that these words rather apply to
God's creatures universally, I would not object to that view. But the particular
kind of speaking or teaching which David here refers to, applies only to saints.
Accordingly I have retained the future tense of the verbs, rather than the
optative mood, as others have done. In using the term kingdom, David intimates
that this is the tendency of the manifestation of God's works, to reduce the
whole world to a state of order, and subject it to his government. He insists
upon the excellency of this kingdom, that men may know that things are to be
considered as in disorder and confusion, unless God alone be acknowledged
supreme. He denies it to be transitory, like all earthly kingdoms, asserting
that it will stand fast for ever. And to call our attention more particularly to
its everlasting nature, he breaks out into an admiring exclamation, and
addresses his discourse to
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

helps such as are in distress, so that all ought not only to look upon his
divine government with reverence, but willingly and cordially submit themselves
to it. Another lesson taught us is, that none will be disappointed who seeks
comfort from God in his affliction.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The eyes of all hope in
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. David adduces an additional proof of
God's goodness, in giving food to all living creatures, and thus showing himself
in the character of the father of a family. Some interpreters, led by the term
hope, which is employed, restrict the application to men, as being endued with
reason and intelligence, to seek their food from their heavenly father, while
the beasts seek it only in a gross manner, by sight or smell. But although not
endued with the exercise of reason, leading them to depend upon God's
providence, necessity itself forces even them, by a certain hidden instinct, to
seek their food, so that they may very properly be said to hope in God, as
elsewhere the young ravens are said to cry unto him.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19E709&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
147:9.) Besides, those who would restrict the words to man, still leave them
open to the charge of impropriety; for the wicked have no regard to the fatherly
care of God, more than the ox or the ass. Since such is the order established in
nature that all animals are brought to a dependence upon their Maker, there is
no impropriety in supposing the affection of desire or expectation to be here
put for the fact of dependence itself.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
FE282</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> All ambiguity is taken away by the next
verse, where every living thing is said to be satisfied. It is said that he
gives them their food, and in its season, for the very variety of it serves more
to illustrate the providence of God. Each has its own way of feeding, and the
different kinds of aliment are designed and adapted for different uses. David
therefore speaks of that food which is particular to them. The pronoun is not in
the plural, and we are not to read <i>in their season</i>, as if it applied to
the animals. The food he notices as given in its season; for here also we are to
notice the admirable arrangements of divine providence, that there is a certain
time appointed for harvest, vintage, and hay crop, and that the year is so
divided into intervals, that the cattle are fed at one time upon grass, at
another on hay, or straw, or acorns, or other products of the earth. Were the
whole supply poured forth at one and the same moment, it could not be gathered
together so conveniently; and we have no small reason to admire the
seasonableness with which the different kinds of fruit and aliment are yearly
produced.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou openest thine
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. The figure is a beautiful one. Most
men pass over without observation the singular goodness of God apparent in this
admirable ordering of things in nature, and David therefore represents him as
stretching out his hand to distribute to the animals their food. We sinfully
confine our attention to the earth which yields us our food, or to natural
causes. To correct this error David describes God as opening his hands to put
the food into our mouths. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wxr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ratson</i>, some render <i>desire</i>, as though he meant that God supplied
each kind of animal with food according to its wish. And a little afterwards we
do indeed find it used in that sense. Others, however, refer it rather to God's
feeding them of his mere good pleasure and kindness; it not being enough to say
that our food is given us by God, unless we add, as in the second clause of the
verse, that his kindness is gratuitous, and that there is no extrinsic cause
whatever moving him to provide so liberally for every living creature. In that
case the cause is put for the effect; the various kinds of provision being
effects of his good pleasure &#8212;
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">carismata thv
ca&gt;ritov</font><font face="Palatino">. If it be found that men and others of
his creatures often suffer and die from want, this is to be traced to the change
which has come upon nature by sin. The fair order which subsisted in it by God's
original appointment often fails since the fall through our sins, and yet in
what remains of it, though marred, we may see the kindness of God referred to by
David, for in the severest failures of crop, there is no year so barren and
unproductive, that God may not be said to open his hand in
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
145:17-21	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b> Jehovah is righteous
in all his ways, and merciful in all his works. <b>18.</b> Jehovah is near to
all who call upon him, to all who call upon him in truth. <b>19.</b> He will
perform the desire of them that fear him, and will hear their cry, and will save
them. <b>20.</b> Jehovah preserves all them that love him, and will destroy all
the wicked. <b>21.</b> My mouth shall speak the praise of Jehovah, and all,

ever.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah is righteous in all his
ways</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He does not now speak of God's goodness
merely in providing all his creatures with their daily food, but comprehends
other parts of his providence, as in correcting men for their sins, restraining
the wicked, trying the patience of his people under the cross, and governing the
world by judgments which are often inscrutable to us. The ground upon which
praise is here ascribed to God may seem a common one, being in every one's
mouth; but in nothing is wisdom shown more than in holding fast the truth, that
God is just in all his ways, so as to retain in our hearts an unabated sense of
it amidst all troubles and confusions. Though all acknowledge God to be just,
most men are no sooner overtaken by affliction than they quarrel with his
severity: unless their wishes are immediately complied with, they are impatient,
and nothing is more common than to hear his justice impeached. As it is
everywhere abused by the wicked imputations men cast upon it, here it is very
properly vindicated from such ungrateful treatment, and asserted to be constant
and unfailing, however loudly the word may disparage it. It is expressly added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in all his ways and
works,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> for we fail to give God due honor unless
we recognize a consistent tenor of righteousness in the whole progress of his
operation. Nothing is more difficult in the time of trouble, when God has
apparently forsaken us, or afflicts us without cause, than to restrain our
corrupt feelings from breaking out against his judgments; as we are told of the
emperor Mauricius in a memorable passage of history, that seeing his sons
murdered by the wicked and perfidious traitor Phocas, and being about to be
carried out himself to death, he cried out &#8212; "Thou art righteous, O God,
and just are thy judgments!" As this man of no bad character opposed such a
shield to the cruel trials he met with, we must learn to put a check upon our
spirits, and always give God's righteousness the honor due to it. David,
however, goes farther still, intimating that God, even when he seems to be most
severe, is so far from being cruel as to temper his heaviest judgments with
equity and clemency.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah is near to all that call
upon him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This truth is principally applicable
to believers, whom God in the way of singular privilege invites to draw near
him, promising that he will be favorable to their prayers. Faith, there is no
doubt, lies idle and even dead without prayer, in which the spirit of adoption
shows and exercises itself, and by which we evidence that all his promises are
considered by us as stable and sure. The inestimable grace of God, in short,
towards believers, appears in this, that he exhibits himself to them as a
Father. As many doubts steal upon us when we pray to God, and we either approach
him with trembling, or fail by becoming discouraged and lifeless, David declares
it to be true without exception, that God hears all who call upon him. At the
same time, as most men pervert and profane the method of calling upon God
through inventions of their own, the right manner of praying is laid down in the
next part of the verse, which is, that we should pray in truth. Although men
resort to God in a cold manner, or even in their prayers expostulate with him,
while their hearts are swelling with pride or with anger, they yet complain
that. they are not heard; just as if there were no difference between praying
and quarreling, or the exercise of faith and hypocrisy. The greater part of men,
involved in infidelity, scarcely believe that there is a God in heaven at all;
others would banish him from it if they could; others would tie him down to
their views and, wishes, while some seek slight and insufficient ways of
reconciling him, so that the common way of praying is but an idle and empty
ceremony.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
FE283</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And although nearly all men without
exception have recourse to God in the time of their need, they are few indeed
who bring the smallest measure of faith or repentance. It were better that the
name of God should be buried in oblivion than exposed to such insults. There is
good reason, therefore, why truth should be said to be necessary in our prayers
&#8212; that they come from a sincere heart. The falsehood, which is the
opposite of this sincerity, is of various kinds; indeed it were difficult to
enumerate them &#8212; infidelity, wavering, impatience, murmuring, pretended
humility, in short there are as many sorts of it as there are sinful
dispositions. The truth being one of no small importance, David again confirms
and enlarges upon it in the next verse. The repetition is worthy of our
particular notice, for such is our tendency to unbelief, that there are few who
in calling upon God do not look upon their prayers as fruitless. Hence the
perverse manner in which the wandering minds of men are tossed hither and
thither, as in the Papacy they invented patrons without number, holding it of no
importance almost to embrace with an unwavering faith the promises by which God
invites us to himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino">To throw the door still
more open, the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, tells us, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God will accommodate himself to
the desires of all who fear him. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This is a mode
of expression of which it is difficult to say how much it ought to impress our
minds. Who is man, that God should show complaisance to his will, when rather it
is ours to look up to his exalted greatness, and humbly submit to his authority?
Yet he voluntarily condescends to these terms, to obtemper our desires. At the
same time, there is a check to be put upon this liberty, and we have not a
license of universal appetency, as if his people might forwardly clamor for
whatever their corrupt desires listed, but before God says that he will hear
their prayers, he enjoins the law of moderation and submission upon their
affections, as we learn from John, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"We know that he will
deny us nothing,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">if we seek it
according to his will."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;620514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
John 5:14.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For the same reason, Christ dictated that form of
prayer, "Thy will be done," setting limits round us, that we should not
preposterously prefer our desires to those of God, nor ask without deliberation
what first comes into our mouth. David, in making express mention of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>them that fear
God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> enjoins fear, reverence, and obedience
upon them before holding out the favorable indulgence of God, that they might
not think themselves warranted to ask more than his word grants and approves.
When he speaks of their cry, this is a kind of qualification of what he had
said. For God's willingness to grant our prayers is not always so apparent that
he answers them at the very moment they are made. We have, therefore, need of
perseverance in this trial of our faith, and our desires must be confirmed by
crying. The last clause &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he will save
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; is also added by way of
correction, to make us aware how far, and for what end God answers the prayers
of his people, namely, to evidence in a practical manner that he is the faithful
guardian of their welfare.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah
preserves</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. He insists upon the same truth,
&#8212; that God is near to his people to help them in the time of need; this
being a sure proof of his presence, that by his mercy they come safe and unhurt
out of every danger which befalls them. It is worthy of our notice, that,
instead of fear, he now speaks of love; for, in distinguishing believers by this
title, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they love
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he intimates it to be the root of true
godliness, that they submit themselves to him voluntarily, which again is the
effect of faith. Till God draw us by the attractions of his grace, this placid
submission will never follow. The love spoken of by David, however, is perhaps
more extensive, as God's people not only attach themselves to him in the way of
obedience to his authority, but knowing that union to him is of all other things
most desirable, aspire with their whole soul after this happiness. Still there
can be no doubt, that the reference is to it here as the chief part of holiness
and righteousness, as was said by Moses,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"And now, O Israel, what
does the Lord thy God require of thee," etc.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
10:12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This effect of godliness in securing our safety and
preservation under the divine guardianship, David exemplifies by an opposition
clause, declaring, that all the wicked shall, in the just judgment of God,
miserably perish. That he might close as he had begun, he again affirms,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he will publish the praises
of God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and urges all to the same duty by his
example. Some would read,<i> every living thing shall bless</i>, but this does
not seem to me a proper reading. When Moses, speaking of the flood, says, that
"all
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">
in which was the breath of life perished," I grant that the term comprehends the
brute creation, but wherever "flesh" is mentioned without any addition, the
reference is only to men. Nor is David here stating what they would, but what
they should do, declaring all men bound by the great and inexhaustible goodness
of God constantly and for ever to praise him.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM

<div><font face="Palatino">After stirring up himself, and others by his example,
to praise God, David animadverts upon the diseased disposition, almost
universally prevalent, to deceive ourselves by expectations entertained from
various quarters. He, at the same time, points out the remedy &#8212; that our
whole hope should be centered in God. To persuade us to resort to him more
readily, he touches shortly upon some proofs of his power and
mercy.</font><br></div>

But having in general called upon all to praise God, he addresses himself, or,
which is the same thing, his soul, only that under the name of <i>soul</i> he
addresses his inward self more emphatically. We may infer from this, that the
influence which moved him was not volatile and superficial, (as many will blame
themselves with remissness on this point, and then immediately lapse into it
again,) but a staid and constant affection, followed up by activity, and proved
by its effects not to be feigned. As David felt, that good endeavors are
frustrated or hindered through the craft of Satan, he thinks it proper to apply
a stimulus for exciting his own zeal, in the first place, before professing to
be a leader or teacher to others. Although his heart was truly and seriously in
the work, he would not rest in this, until he had acquired still greater ardor.
And if it was necessary for David to stir himself up to the praises of God, how
powerful a stimulant must we require for a more difficult matter when we aim at
the divine life with self-denial. As to the religious exercise here mentioned,
let us feel that we will never be sufficiently active in it, unless we
strenuously exact it from ourselves. As God supports and maintains his people in
the world with this view, that they may employ their whole life in praising him,
David very properly declares, that he will do this to the end of his
course.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Trust not in
princes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This admonition is
appropriately inserted, for one means by which men blind themselves is that of
involving their minds through a number of inventions, and being thus prevented
from engaging in the praises of God. That God may have the whole praise due to
him, David exposes and overthrows those false stays on which we would otherwise
be too much disposed to trust. His meaning is, that we should withdraw ourselves
from man in general, but he names
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>princes</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
from whom more is to be feared than common men. For what promise could poor
people hold out, or such as need the help of others? The great and wealthy,
again, have a dangerous attraction through the splendor attaching to them,
suggesting to us the step of taking shelter under their patronage. As the simple
are fascinated by looking to their grandeur, he adds, that the most powerful of
the world's princes is but a </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>son
of man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This should be enough to rebuke
our folly in worshipping them as a kind of demigods, as Isaiah says,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
31:3,) "The Egyptian is man, and not God; flesh, and not spirit." Although
princes then are furnished with power, money, troops of men, and other
resources, David reminds us, that it is wrong to place our trust in frail mortal
man, and vain to seek safety where it cannot be
found.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This he explains more fully in the verse,
which follows, where he tells us how short and fleeting the life of man is.
Though God throw loose the reins, and suffer princes even to invade heaven in
the wildest enterprises, the passing of the spirit, like a breath, suddenly
overthrows all their counsels and plans. The body being the dwelling-place of
the soul, what is here said may very well be so understood; for at death God
recalls the spirit. We may understand it more simply, however, of the vital
breath; and this will answer better with the context &#8212; that as soon as man
has ceased to breathe, his corpse is subject to putrefaction. It follows, that
those who put their trust in men, depend upon a fleeting breath. When he says
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in that day all his thoughts
perish</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or <i>flow away</i>, perhaps
under this expression he censures the madness of princes in setting no bounds to
their hopes and desires, and scaling the very heavens in their ambition, like
the insane Alexander of Macedon, who, upon hearing that there were other worlds,
wept that he had not yet conquered one, although soon after the funeral urn
sufficed him. Observation itself proves that the schemes of princes are deep and
complicated. That we may not fall, therefore, into the error of connecting our
hopes with them, David says that the life of princes also passes away swiftly
and in a moment, and that with it all their plans
vanish.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessed is
he</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. As it would not have been enough to
reprove the sin, he submits the remedy upon which the proper correction of it
depends; and this is, that the hopes of men are only stable and well-founded
when they rest entirely upon God. For even the wicked sometimes come the length
of acknowledging the folly of trust in man. Accordingly they are often angry
with themselves for being so inconsiderate as to expect deliverance from men;
but by neglecting the remedy, they are not extricated from their error. The
Psalmist having condemned the infatuation, which we have seen to be natural to
us all, wisely subjoins that they are blessed who trust in God. Jeremiah
observes the same order.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;241705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
17:5, 7.)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Cursed is he that
trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm," etc.;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and then &#8212; "Blessed is the man whose hope the
Lord is." When David pronounces
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>those blessed whose help is the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he does not restrict the happiness of
believers to present sense, as if they were only happy when God openly and in
outward acts appeared as their helper, but he places their happiness in this
&#8212; that they are truly persuaded of its being entirely by the grace of God
they stand. He calls him </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God
of Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino">, to distinguish him from the multitude
of false gods in which unbelievers gloried at that time; and there was good
reason for this; for while all propose to themselves to seek God, few take the
right way. In designating the true God by his proper mark, he intimates that it
is only by an assured faith of adoption that any of us can rest upon him; for he
must show himself favorable to us before we can look for help from
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
146:6-10	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b> Who made heaven and
earth, the sea, and all things which are in them: who keepeth truth for ever.
<b>7.</b> Rendering right to the unjustly oppressed, giving bread to the hungry,

generation. Hallelujah.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who made
heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. By all these epithets he confirms
the truth previously stated. For though at first sight it may seem inappropriate
to speak of the Creation, the power of God bears most pertinently upon his
helping us whenever danger is near. We know how easily Satan tempts to distrust,
and we are thrown into a state of trembling agitation by the slightest causes.
Now, if we reflect that God is the Maker of heaven and earth, we will reasonably
give him the honor of having the government of the world which he created in his
hands and power. There is in this first ascription, then, a commendation of his
power, which should swallow up all our fears. As it is not enough that God is
merely able to help us, but as a promise is farther necessary, to the effect
that he is willing and shall do it, David next declares
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he is faithful and
true</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that, on discovering his
willingness, no room may be left for
hesitation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rendering
right</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. He instances other kinds both of
the power and goodness of God, which are just so many reasons why we should hope
in him. All of them bear upon the point, that the help of God will be ready and
forthcoming to those who are in the lowest circumstances, that accordingly our
miseries will be no barrier in the way of his helping us; nay, that such is his
nature, that he is disposed to assist all in proportion to their necessity. He
says first, that God </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>renders
justice to the oppressed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> to remind us
that although in the judgment of sense God connives at the injuries done to us,
he will not neglect the duty which properly belongs to him of forcing the wicked
to give an account of their violence. As God, in short, would have the patience
of his people tried, he here expressly calls upon the afflicted not to faint
under their troubles, but composedly wait for deliverance from one who is slow
in interposing, only that he may appear eventually as the righteous judge of the
world. It follows, that he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gives
bread to the hungry</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We learn from this that he
is not always so indulgent to his own as to load them with abundance, but
occasionally withdraws his blessing, that he may succor them when reduced to
hunger. Had the Psalmist said that God fed his people with abundance, and
pampered them, would not any of those under want or in famine have immediately
desponded? The goodness of God is therefore properly extended farther to the
feeding of the hungry. What is added is to the same purpose &#8212; that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he looses them that are bound,
and enlightens the blind.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As it is the fate of
his people to be straitened by anxiety, or pressed down by human tyranny, or
reduced to extremity, in a manner equivalent to being shut up in the worst of
dungeons, it was necessary to announce, by way of comfort, that God can easily
find an outgate for us when brought into such straits.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To enlighten the
blind</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is the same with giving light in the
midst of darkness. When at any time we know not what to do &#8212; are in
perplexity, and lie confounded and dismayed, as if the darkness of death had
fallen upon us &#8212; let us learn to ascribe this title to God, that he may
dissipate the gloom and open our eyes. So when he is said
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to raise up the bowed
down,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> we are taught to take courage when weary
and groaning under any burden. Nor is it merely that God would here have his
praises celebrated; he in a manner stretches out his hand to the blind, the
captives, and the afflicted, that they may cast their grief's and cares upon
him. There is a reason for repeating the name <i>Jehovah </i>three times. In
this way he stimulates and excites men to seek him who will often rather chafe
and pine away in their miseries, than betake themselves to this sure asylum.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">FE288</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
What is added in the close of the verse &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that Jehovah loves the
righteous</i></font><font face="Palatino">, would seem to be a qualification of
what was formerly said. There are evidently many who, though they are grievously
afflicted, and groan with anxiety, and lie in darkness, experience no comfort
from God; and this because in such circumstances they provoke God more by their
contumacy, and by failing for the most part to seek his mercy, reap the just
reward of their unthankfulness. The Psalmist therefore very properly restricts
what he had said in general terms of God's helping the afflicted, to the
righteous &#8212; that those who wish to experience his deliverance, may address
themselves to him in the sincere exercise of
godliness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah
guarding</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. By <i>strangers, orphans</i>,
and <i>widows,</i> the Psalmist means all those in general who are destitute of
the help of man. While all show favor to those who are known to them and near to
them, we know that strangers are, for the most part, exposed to injurious
treatment. We find comparatively few who come forward to protect and redress
widows and orphans; it seems lost labor, where there is no likelihood of
compensation. Under these cases the Psalmist shows that whatever the grievance
may be under which we suffer, the reason can only be with ourselves if God, who
so kindly invites all who are in distress to come to him, does not stretch forth
his arm for our help. On the other hand, he declares that everything will have
an adverse and unfortunate issue to those who wickedly despise God. We have said
upon the first Psalm, that by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
way</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is meant the course of life in general. God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will destroy the way of the
wicked,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> inasmuch as he will curse all their
counsels, acts, attempts, and enterprises, so that none of them shall have good
success. However excellent they may be in planning, although they may be crafty
and sharp-sighted, and abound in strength of resources of every kind, God will
overturn all their expectations. While he extends his hand to those who are his
people, and brings them through all obstacles, and even impassable ways, he on
the contrary destroys the path of the wicked, when apparently most open and
plain before them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah shall
reign</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. He directs his discourse to the
Church, that he may more effectually persuade all God's people of their really
finding him to be such as he had just described. When he says that God is king
for ever, we are to remember at the same time the purpose for which he reigns
&#8212; taking our definition of it from the preceding ascription's. It follows
that, whether living or dying, we shall be safe under the keeping of a king who
reigns expressly for our salvation. Had he said no more than that Jehovah
reigned for ever, we would have been ready to object the distance between us and
his inconceivable greatness. He states, therefore, in express terms, his being
bound by sacred covenant to his chosen people.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
147</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This Psalm also incites the people of God to praise
him upon two accounts; first, for the display of his power, goodness, wisdom,
and other perfections in the common government of the world, and the several
parts of it, the heavens and the earth, but more particularly for his special
goodness in cherishing and defending the Church which he has chosen of his free
grace, in restoring it when fallen down, and gathering it when dispersed.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fe289</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
147:1-6	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b> Praise ye God; for it is

<b>2.</b> Jehovah building up Jerusalem, will gather the dispersed of Israel:

God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc. Though the benefits he speaks
of are such as God extends to all men indiscriminately, it is plain that he
addresses more especially God's people, who alone behold his works in an
enlightened manner, whereas stupidity and blindness of mind deprive others of
their understanding. Nor is his subject confined to the common benefits of God,
but the main thing which he celebrates is his mercy, as shown to his chosen
people. That the Church may address itself to the praises of God with more
alacrity, he states that this kind of exercise is good, delightful, and
pleasant, by which he indirectly censures a sin which is all but universal of
becoming wearied at the very mention of God, and counting it our highest
pleasure to forget both God and ourselves, that we may give way to unrestrained
indulgence. To teach men to take a delight in this religious exercise, the
Psalmist reminds them that praise is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>comely</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>or <i>desirable.</i> For the term
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwan</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>navah, </i>may be rendered either
way.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah building
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc. He begins with the special
mercy of God towards his Church and people, in choosing to adopt one nation out
of all others, and selecting a fixed place where his name might be called upon.
When he is here called the builder of Jerusalem, the allusion is not so much to
the outward form and structure, as to the spiritual worship of God. It is a
common figure in treating of the Church to speak of it as a building or temple.
The meaning is, that the Church was not of human erection, but formed by the
supernatural power of God; for it was from no dignity of the place itself that
Jerusalem became the only habitation of God in our world, nor did it come to
this honor by counsel, industry, effort or power of man, but because God was
pleased to consecrate it to himself. He employed the labor and instrumentality
of men indeed in erecting his sanctuary there, but this ought never to take from
his grace, which alone distinguished the holy city from all others. In calling
God the former and architect of the Church, his object is to make us aware that
by his power it remains in a firm condition, or is restored when in ruins. Hence
he infers that it is in his power and arbitrament to gather those who have been
dispersed. Here the Psalmist would comfort those miserable exiles who had been
scattered in various quarters, with the hope of being recovered from their
dispersion, as God had not adopted them without a definite purpose into one
body. As he had ordered his temple and altar to be erected at Jerusalem, and had
fixed his seat there, the Psalmist would encourage the Jews who were exiles from
their native country, to entertain good hope of a return, intimating that it was
no less properly God's work to raise up his Church when ruined and fallen down,
than to found it at first. It was not, therefore, the Psalmist's object directly
to celebrate the free mercy of God in the first institution of the Church, but
to argue from its original, that God would not suffer his Church altogether to
fall, having once founded it with the design of preserving it for ever; for he
forsakes not the work of his own hands. This comfort ought to be improved by
ourselves at the present period, when we see the Church on every side so
miserably rent asunder, leading us to hope that all the elect who have been
adjoined to Christ's body, will be gathered unto the unity of the faith,
although now scattered like members torn from one another, and that the
mutilated body of the Church, which is daily distracted, will be restored to its
entireness; for God will not suffer his work to
fail.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the following verse he insists upon the
same truth, the figure suggesting that though the Church labor under, and be
oppressed by many diseases, God will speedily and easily recover it from all its
wounds. The same truth, therefore, is evidently conveyed, under a different form
of expression &#8212; that the Church, though it may not always be in a
flourishing condition, is ever safe and secure, and that God will miraculously
heal it, as though it were a diseased
body.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Numbering the
multitude</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc. As the gathering
together of the people of whom the Psalmist spoke might appear to be an
impossibility, there seems some ground for the opinion of those who think that
he confirms it in this verse. The connection they give to the Psalmist's words
is this &#8212; that as it is at least not more difficult to gather men together
who are outcast and scattered, than to number the stars, there was no reason why
the wandering exile Israelites should despair of their return, provided they
should resort with one consent to God as their only head. There is some
probability, too, in the conjecture that the Psalmist may allude to that promise
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Look now towards the
stars of heaven, if thou canst tell
them,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">so shall thy seed be."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
15:5.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as the Psalmist immediately afterwards treats of
the order of things in nature generally, the simplest rendering, I think, is to
understand this verse with reference to the admirable work of God to be seen in
the heavens, where we behold his matchless wisdom, in regulating, without one
degree of aberration, the manifold, complex, winding courses of the stars. To
each of them he assigns its fixed and distinct office, and in all the multitude
there is no confusion. He therefore exclaims immediately &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Great is God, and boundless, both
in power and understanding. </i></font><font face="Palatino">We learn from this
that there cannot be greater folly than to make our judgment the measure of
God's works, displaying in these, as he often does, his incomprehensible power
and wisdom.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Raising
up,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> etc. The ascription of this to God fitly
tends to confirm our hope under affliction, and prevent our souls from fainting
under the cross. From this we may infer that although our fathers who lived
under the Law were more gently dealt with, they knew something at least of that
warfare with which God daily exercises us, in order to make us seek our true
rest elsewhere than in this world. Should a doubt steal upon the minds of those
who have been brought under heavy afflictions, as to the forthcoming of that
help which God has promised to extend, let the truth recur to our remembrance,
that we are brought low that God may lift us up again. And if upon seeing the
prosperity of the wicked we are smitten and inflamed with envy, let the words of
the Psalmist come into our mind, That they are lifted up that they may be cast
down into destruction. When he speaks of their being <i>cast down even to the
earth,</i> there can be no doubt that he passes an indirect censure upon their
pride which leads them to exalt themselves on high, as if they belonged to some
superior order of beings.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

mercy.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sing to Jehovah in
thanksgiving</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Again he exhorts to sing
the praises of God, intimating at the same time that abundant matter was not
wanting, since new proofs still meet our eyes of his power, goodness, and
wisdom. First he tells us that <i>he covers the heavens with clouds,</i> and
this change would awaken our attention, were we not chargeable with so much
thoughtlessness. Various as are the marvels to be seen in the heavens above us,
were the same serenity always to continue, we would not have so wonderful a
display of his power as when he suddenly veils them with clouds, withdrawing the
light of the sun, and setting a new face as it were upon the world. He
afterwards hints that in this way provision is made for all living creatures,
for thus the herbs germinate, and the earth is supplied with the moisture which
makes it fertile. Thus in connection with the proofs of his power God sets
before our eyes those of his mercy and fatherly consideration for the human
family; nay, he shows that he does not overlook even the wild beasts and cattle.
Philosophers discover the origin of rain in the elements, and it is not denied
that clouds are formed from the gross vapors which are exhaled from the earth
and sea, but second causes should not prevent us from recognizing the providence
of God in furnishing the earth with the moisture needed for fructification. As
the earth chapped with heat shows its thirst by opening its mouth, so God on his
part in sending rain distills drink for it. He might in other ways of a more
secret kind give it strength to preserve it from failing, but this irrigation is
something which passes before our eyes to image forth the continual care which
he has over us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who gives to the cattle their
food</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> By giving an instance he explains
more clearly what he had said, of God's providing food for every living
creature. When he speaks of the cattle and the ravens being fed, and not of men,
this is to give more emphasis to his argument. We know that it was for man's
sake the world was made at all, and endued with fertility and plenty; and in
proportion as we are nearer in the scale of existence to God, he shows us the
more of his goodness. But if he condescends to notice the brute creation, it is
plain that to us he will be a nurse and a father. For the same reason he names
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
ravens</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> the most contemptible of all
birds, to teach us that the goodness of God extends to every part of the world.
When he says that their young <i>cry unto God,</i> he no doubt refers to their
natural cry, but hints at the same time that they own that they must be in want
unless God give them meat from heaven. As to the Jewish fable that the ravens
desert their young ones as soon as put forth, and that worms are bred in the
barks of the trees to feed them, this is one of their customary stories, never
scrupling as they do, nor being ashamed, to invent anything, however unfounded,
when a difficulty comes in the way.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
FE292A</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is enough for us to know that the
whole system of nature is so regulated by God, that not even the young ravens
want their food, when with hoarse outcry they confess that they are in need, and
that they cannot have it supplied except by
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not in the strength of the
horse</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. After the Psalmist has shown that
there is proof of the divine goodness in every part of the world, he takes
particular notice that men have no strength but what is given them from above,
and this he adds with the express purpose of checking the pride by which almost
all men are inflamed, and which leads them to trust in their own strength. The
meaning of the passage is, that let man come in the preparation of his own
strength, and with all the assistance's that seem to him most prevalent, this
will only issue in smoke and vanity; nay, that in arrogating the very least to
himself, this will only be a hindrance in the way of the mercy of God, by which
alone we stand.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> The strength of
the horse</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is mentioned by synecdoche to denote
any kind of protection. Not that God is displeased with those things in
themselves considered which he has given us as helps, but it is necessary that
we be withdrawn from a false confidence in them, for very commonly when any
resource is at hand, we are foolishly intoxicated and lifted up with pride. He
opposes the fear of God therefore to the strength both of men and of horses, and
places his hope in his mercy, intimating that it is highly incumbent upon us to
show our moderation in worshipping God with reverence and holiness, and
depending upon his grace. Hence we learn that he only condemns that strength
which would take from God the honor due to
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
147:12-14	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b> Celebrate Jehovah, O

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Celebrate Jehovah, O
Jerusalem!</i> </font><font face="Palatino">Having spoken in general of the
mercies of God, he again addresses his discourse to the Lord's people, who
alone, as we have remarked already, can appreciate them, calling upon them to
recognize with thanksgiving the blessings which others riot upon without
acknowledgment. Under the name of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he comprises the whole Church, for in that place the faithful then held
their religious assemblies, and flowed together as it were to the standard of
the Lord. Although he will take occasion afterwards again to speak of the
government of the world at large, he here commemorates the goodness of God as
manifested to his own people, in protecting his own Church, bountifully
cherishing it, enriching it abundantly with all blessings, and preserving it in
peace and safety from all harm. When he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the bars of the gates are
strengthened by God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he means that the
holy city was perfectly guarded by him from all fear of hostile attack. To the
same effect is the other expression which comes after &#8212; that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all its bounds were made
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Enemies were under divine
restraint so as to cause no disturbance or confusions. Not that the Church is
always in a state of peace throughout its whole extent, and exempt from attack,
but that God in a visible manner stretches forth his hand to repel these
assaults, and it can securely survey the whole array of its enemies. A more
extensive meaning indeed may be given to the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
which is often taken to signify a happy and prosperous condition. But as mention
is made of <i>bounds</i>, the former sense seems most appropriate. The blessing
of God enjoyed within is next spoken of, consisting in this, that the citizens
dwell prosperously and happily in it, and are fed bountifully, even to satiety;
which does not mean that the children of God always wallow in abundance. This
might be the means of corrupting them, prone as our nature is to wantonness; but
it suggests that they recognize the liberality of God in their daily food more
clearly than others who want faith, and whom either abundance renders blind, or
poverty vexes with deplorable anxiety, or covetousness inflames with a desire
that never can be satisfied. God's paternal favor was shown more particularly to
our fathers under the law in the abundance of temporal provision, it being
necessary to lead them forward to something higher by what was
elementary.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>While he sends
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. He again touches upon some
instances of the operation of God, everywhere to be seen in the system of
nature. And as the changes which take place in the air, and upon the earth, and
which should be considered evidences of his power, may perhaps be regarded by
the world as the effect of chance, the Psalmist, before proceeding to speak of
the snow, hoar frost, and ice, expressly declares, that earth is governed by his
power and control. The </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sending
forth of his word</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is nothing else than the
secret influence by which he regulates and governs all things, for without his
orders and appointment no movement could take place among the elements, nor
could they be borne, now one way and now another, upon their own spontaneous
impulse without his foregoing secret decree. He says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his word runneth
quickly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> because, when once God has
intimated his will, all things concur to carry it into effect. If we do not hold
fast by this principle, however acutely we may investigate second causes, all
our perspicacity will come to nothing. It is thus that Aristotle, for example,
has shown such ingenuity upon the subject of meteors, that he discusses their
natural causes most exactly, while he omits the main point of all, upon which
the merest child, at least having any religion, has the superiority over him. He
must have little discernment who, in the sudden snows and hoar-frosts, does not
perceive how quickly the word of God runs. If, then, we would avoid a senseless
natural philosophy, we must always start with this principle, that everything in
nature depends upon the will of God, and that the whole course of nature is only
the prompt carrying into effect of his orders. When the waters congeal, when the
hail spreads through the air, and hoar frosts darken the sky, surely we have
proof how effectual his word is. But if all these wonders produce no effect upon
most men, at least the piercing cold which benumbs our bodies, should force us
to recognize the power of God. When the heat of the sun scorches us in summer,
and again, upon the succession of winter, all things are bound up, such a change
as this, which must have appeared incredible had we not been accustomed to it,
cries out loudly that there is a being who reigns
above.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He announces his words to
Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc. Here it is another word that
is spoken of than what was formerly mentioned; for God speaks in a different way
to the insensate works of his hands, which he silently subordinates to his will
by secret laws impressed upon them, than he does to men who are endued with
understanding, for these he teaches with articulate language, that they may obey
him intelligently and with consent. Although the blessings formerly mentioned
are not to be depreciated, they fall far short of this, that he has condescended
to be the teacher of his chosen people, by communicating to them that religious
doctrine which is a treasure of everlasting salvation. How little would it avail
the Church that it were filled with the perishing enjoyments of time, and
protected from hostile violence, did not its hope extend beyond this world.
This, accordingly, is the grand proof of his love, that he has set before us in
his word the light of eternal life. On this account it is appropriately
mentioned here as the crowning part of true solid happiness. And let us learn
from this, that we should not only receive the doctrine of God with reverential
and holy obedience, but embrace it with affection, for we can conceive of
nothing more delightful and desirable than that God should undertake our
salvation, and give testimony of this by stretching out his hand to bring us to
himself. For this is the design with which the doctrine has been given to us,
that amidst the thick darkness of this world, and the devious errors into which
Satan misleads the children of men, the great Father of us all may by it cast a
foregoing light upon our path before gathering us to the inheritance of heaven.
We are to notice, that the part which was sustained by Moses and the Prophets
according to divine appointment is here ascribed to God himself, for we only put
due honor upon the doctrine of religion, and estimate it at its proper worth
when we rise to the consideration of God, who, in using the instrumentality of
men, still claims to be considered our chief and only teacher. Thus its due
majesty is assigned to the word from the person of its author. Again, he
enhances the mercy shown by stating a comparison, intimating
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that this had not been done for
other nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> For if it be asked why
God preferred one people to others, this pre-eminence will certainly lead us to
gratuitous election as its source, since we will find that the children of
Israel did not differ from others in any excellency attaching to themselves, but
because God passed by others and condescended to adopt them into his
favor.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM

in which the praises of God are not to be heard, inasmuch as he everywhere gives
proof of his power, goodness, and wisdom. He then comes to speak of men, whom
God has constituted the proper heralds of his praises in this world. But as the
unbelieving portion of them is both blind to the consideration of God's works,
and dumb to his praises, the Psalmist at the close appeals to the children of
Israel, who were privileged with a special discovery of God, as principal
witnesses.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Praise Jehovah from the

stars as well as the angels, and, therefore, heaven itself, the air, and all
that is gendered in it; for afterwards a division is made when he first calls
upon angels, then upon the stars, and the waters of the firmament. With regard
to the angels, created as they were for this very end &#8212; that they might be
instant in this religious service, we need not wonder that they should be placed
first in order when the praises of God are spoken of. Accordingly, in that
remarkable vision which Isaiah describes,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230603&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
6:3,) the cherubim cry out &#8212; "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts." And in
several other places of Scripture the angels are represented as praising God by
such ascription's. How, then, can zeal like theirs stand in need of
exhortations? Or, if they require to be incited, what can be more unseemly than
that we, who are so sluggish in the service, should assume the part of exhorting
them to their duty? David, then, who did not equal the angels in zeal, but came
far behind them, was not qualified to be an exhorter to them. But neither did
this enter into his purpose; he would simply testify that it was the height of
his happiness and desire to join in sacred concert with elect angels in praising
God. And there is nothing unreasonable that, in order to stir himself up in the
praises of God, he should call as companions upon the angels, although these run
spontaneously in the service, and are fitter to lead the way. He calls them, in
the second part of the verse &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the armies of God;
</i></font><font face="Palatino">for they stand always ready to receive his
orders. "Ten thousand times ten thousand surround his throne," as Daniel says,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;270710&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
7:10.) The same name is applied also to the stars, both because they are
remarkable for the order which maintains among them, and because they execute
with inconceivable quickness the orders of God. But the angels are here called
armies, upon the same account as elsewhere principalities and powers, inasmuch
as God exerts his power by their
hands.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Praise him, ye sun and
moon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This passage gives no countenance
to the dream of Plato, that the stars excel in sense and intelligence. Nor does
the Psalmist give them the same place as he had just assigned to angels, but
merely intimates that the glory of God is everywhere to be seen, as if they sang
his praises with an audible voice. And here he tacitly reproves the ingratitude
of man; for all would hear this symphony, were they at all attent upon
considering the works of God. For doth not the sun by his light, and heat, and
other marvelous effects, praise his Maker? The stars when they run their course,
and at once adorn the heavens and give light to the earth, do they not sound the
praises of God? but as we are deaf and insensible, the Psalmist calls upon them
as witnesses to reprove our indolence. By the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heavens of
heavens</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he no doubt means the spheres.
Eclipses, and other things which we observe, plainly show both that the fixed
stars are above the planets, and that the planets themselves are placed in
different orbits.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
FE297A</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The excellency of this contrivance the
Psalmist justly commends, speaking expressly of the heavens of heavens; not as
if there were really more heavens than one, but to extol the matchless wisdom
which God has shown in creating the heavens; for the sun, moon, and stars are
not confusedly mixed together, but each has its own position and station
assigned to it, and their manifold courses are all regulated. As under the name
of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
heavens</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he comprehends the air, or at least all
the space from the middle region of the air upwards, he calls rains,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the waters above the
heavens</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> There is no foundation for the
conjecture which some have made, that there are waters deposited above the four
elements; and when the Psalmist speaks of these waters as being above, he
clearly points at the descent of the rain. It is adhering too strictly to the
letter of the words employed, to conceive as if there were some sea up in the
heavens, where the waters were permanently deposited; for we know that Moses and
the Prophets ordinarily speak in a popular style, suited to the lowest
apprehension. It would be absurd, then, to seek to reduce what they say to the
rules of philosophy; as, for example, in the passage before us, the Psalmist
notes the marvelous fact that God holds the waters suspended in the air, because
it seems contrary to nature that they should mount aloft, and also, that though
fluid they should hang in vacant space. Accordingly it is said elsewhere, that
they are held there as enclosed in bottles.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193307&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
33:7.) The Psalmist has borrowed the form of expression from Moses, who says
&#8212; "that the waters were divided from the waters."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
1:6.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let them praise the
name</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. As he speaks of things wanting
intelligence, he passes to the third person, from which we infer that his reason
for having spoken in the second person hitherto, was to make a deeper impression
upon men. And he asks no other praise than that which may teach us that the
stars did not make themselves, nor the rains spring from chance; for
notwithstanding the signal proofs we constantly have before our eyes of the
divine power, we with shameful carelessness overlook the great author. He says
emphatically &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for He
Himself created, </i></font><font face="Palatino">intimating that the world is
not eternal, as wicked men conjecture, nor made by a concourse of atoms, but
that this fair order of things which we see, suddenly sprang forth upon the
commandment of God. And, speaking of the creation, he adds what is even more
worthy of observation, that he gave that law to them which remains inviolable.
For many, while they grant that the world was made by God, lapse from this into
the senseless notion that now the order of nature stands of itself, and that God
sits idle in the heavens. The Psalmist very properly insists, therefore, that
the works of God above us in the heavens were not only made by him, but even now
move forward at his disposal; and that not only was a secret power communicated
to them at first, but while they go through their assigned parts, their
operation and ministry to their various ends is dependent upon
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

of the world; although deviating at the same time from the exact order, he mixes
up such things as are produced in the air &#8212; lightning's, snow, ice, and
storms. These should rather have been placed among the former class, but he has
respect to the common apprehension of men. The scope of the whole is, that
wherever we turn our eyes we meet with evidences of the power of God. He speaks
first of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
whales</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for, as he mentions the <i>abysses</i>
or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deeps</i></font><font face="Palatino">
immediately afterwards, I have no doubt that by
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ynynt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tanninim</i>, he means fishes of the sea, such as whales. It is only
reasonable to think that matter for praising God should be taken from the sea,
which is fraught with so many wonders. He then ascends to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hail,
snows</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>storms</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
which he says </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fulfill the word of

the heavens are clouded, or that a single drop of rain falls from the clouds, or
that the thunders rage, but one and all of these changes depend upon the secret
will of God, whether he will show his goodness to the children of men in
irrigating the earth, or punish their sins by tempest, hail, or other
calamities. The passage contains instruction of various kinds, as, for example,
that when dearth impends, however parched the earth may be by long continued
heat, God can promptly send rain which will remove the drought at his pleasure.
If from incessant rains, on the other hand, the seed rot in the ground, or the
crops do not come to maturity, we should pray for fair weather. If we are
alarmed by thunder, we are taught to pray to God, for as it is he who sends it
in his anger, so he can still all the troubled elements. And we are not to take
up the narrow view of this truth which irreligious men advocate, that things in
nature merely move according to the laws impressed upon them from the beginning,
while God stands by idle, but are to hold firmly that God watches over his
creatures, and that nothing can take place without his present disposal, as we
have seen,

with a respect to whom it was that he called for a declaration of God's praises
from creatures, both above and from beneath. As kings and princes are blinded by
the dazzling influence of their station, so as to think the world was made for
them, and to despise God in the pride of their hearts, he particularly calls
them to this duty; and, by mentioning them first, he reproves their ingratitude
in withholding their tribute of praise when they are under greater obligations
than others. As all men originally stand upon a level as to condition, the
higher persons have risen, and the nearer they have been brought to God, the
more sacredly are they bound to proclaim his goodness. The more intolerable is
the wickedness of kings and princes who claim exemption from the common rule,
when they ought rather to inculcate it upon others and lead the way. He could
have addressed his exhortation at once summarily to all men, as indeed he
mentions <i>peoples</i> in general terms; but by thrice specifying
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>princes</i></font><font face="Palatino">
he suggests that they are slow to discharge the duty, and need to be urged do
it. Then follows a division according to age and sex, to show that all without
exception are created for this end, and should unitedly devote their energies to
it. As to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>old
men</i></font><font face="Palatino">, the more God has lengthened out their
lives the more should they be exercised in singing his praises; but he joins
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>young

experience from continued habit, it will be inexcusable if they do not
acknowledge the great mercy of God in the vigor of their lives. In speaking of

the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;g</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gam, also</i>, is not merely expletive, but added to make the words more
emphatical, conveying the truth that even the young women who are not so
liberally educated as the male sex, being considered as born for domestic
offices, will omit their duty if they do not join with the rest of the Church in
praising God. It follows that all from the least to the greatest are bound by
this common rule.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And hath exalted the
horn</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. As we saw in the former Psalm, that
the perfections of God are to be seen more conspicuously in the Church than in
the constitution of the world at large, the Psalmist has added this sentence, as
to the Church being protected by the divine hand, and armed with a power against
all enemies which secures its safety in every danger. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
horn</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as is well known, is meant strength or
dignity. Accordingly the Psalmist means that God's blessing is apparent in his
Church and among his chosen people, inasmuch as it only flourishes and is
powerful through his strength. There is a tacit comparison implied between the
Church of God and other hostile powers, for it needs divine guardianship as
being exposed on all sides to attack. Hence the Psalmist infers that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>praise is to all the merciful
ones of God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, for they have ground given them in
the singular goodness of his condescension both for self-congratulation and
praise. In calling the children of Israel <i>a
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>people near unto
God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he reminds them of the gracious covenant
which God made with Abraham. For how came the nearness, except in the way of
God's preferring an unknown despised stranger to all nations? Nor are we to seek
the cause of the distinction elsewhere than in the mere love of God. Though all
the world equally belongs to God, he graciously discovered himself to the
children of Israel, and brought them near to him, strangers as they were from
God, even as are the whole race of Adam. Hence the words of Moses
&#8212;</font><br></div>

government of the world, here he speaks of his benefits to the Church
exclusively. In the next Psalm mention is only made of the power of God in

just said, that the exhortation now given is addressed only to God's people; for
the singular goodness which is particularly extended to them affords more ample
matter of praise. The probable conjecture is, that the Psalm was composed at the
time when the people were begun to rejoice, or after they had returned to their
native country from the Babylonish captivity. We will see from the context that
a promise is given of recovery from their ruined condition. The object, I think,
of the Psalmist, is to encourage them to expect the full and complete
deliverance, some prelude of which had been suddenly and unexpectedly given in
the permission to return. As the Church was not fully restored at once, but was
with difficulty and only after a long period brought to a state of vigor,
comfort such as this was much needed. The Spirit of God would also furnish a
remedy for evils which were afterwards to break out; for the Church had scarcely
begun to respire when it was again harassed with various evils, and oppressed by
the cruel tyranny of Antiochus, which was followed up by a dreadful dispersion.
The Psalmist had good reason therefore for animating the godly to look forward
for the full accomplishment of the mercy of God, that they might be persuaded of
divine protection until such time as the Messiah should arise who would gather
all Israel. He calls this </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a new
song</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as we have noticed elsewhere, to
distinguish it from those with which the saints commonly and daily praised God,
for praise is their continued exercise. It follows that he speaks of some rare
and unusual benefit, demanding signal and particular thanksgiving. And I am
disposed to think that whoever may have been the author of the Psalm, he alludes
to that passage in Isaiah,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
42:10,) "Sing<i> </i>unto the Lord a new song," when he speaks of the future
restoration of the Church, and the eternal kingdom of Christ. In the second
clause of the verse there is a promise implied. For though he proceeds to exhort
the Lord's people to sing God's praises together, he hints along with this that
the Church would coalesce again into one body, so as to celebrate God's praises
in the solemn assembly. We<i> </i>know that so scattered were the Israelites,
that the sacred songs ceased to be sung, as elsewhere they complain of being
called upon to sing &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"How shall we sing the

again.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

</i>insists upon the same point, that the Lord's people should rest firmly
persuaded that their family had not been chosen out in vain from the rest of the
world, but that God would be mindful of his covenant, and not allow the mercies
which he had extended to them to fail or become extinct. Although they had been
temporarily deprived of the inheritance of the land of Canaan, which was the
pledge of their adoption, the Psalmist calls God their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Maker, and king of the sons of
Zion,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to remind them that when adopted
to a pre-eminency above other nations, this was a species of new creation. So in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;194506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
45:6, the Israelites are called "the<i> </i>work of God's hands," not merely
because they were like other men created by him, but because he had formed them
anew, and distinguished them with a new honor, that, of being separated front
the whole human race. The name king has a wider signification, intimating that
as this people was at first formed by God, so it was with the view of their
being ever governed by his power. The musical instruments he mentions were
peculiar to this infancy of the Church, nor should we foolishly imitate a
practice which was intended only for God's ancient people. But the Psalmist
confirms what has been already mentioned, that their religious assemblies which
had been for a time interrupted would soon be restored, and they would call upon
the name of the Lord in the due order of his
worship.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For God hath taken pleasure

<i>ratsah </i>here it means <i>free favor, </i>the Psalmist saying that it was
entirely of his good pleasure that God had chosen this people to himself. From
this source flows what is added in the second clause, that God would give a new
glory of deliverance to the afflicted. In the Hebrew
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ywn[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>anavim, </i>means <i>poor and afflicted ones, </i>but the term came
afterwards to be applied to <i>merciful persons, </i>as bodily afflictions have
a tendency to subdue pride, while abundance begets cruelty. The Psalmist
accordingly mitigates the sadness of present evils by administering seasonable
consolation, that God's people, when oppressed by troubles, might look forward
with hope to the glorious deliverance which was yet unseen. The sum of the
passage is &#8212; that God, who had fixed his love upon his chosen people,
could not possibly abandon them to such miseries as they now suffered
under.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall

jubilee, and the high praises of God, he shows still more clearly from the
effects which it would produce, that he does not speak of a common benefit of
God; for had not the deliverance of the people been of a remarkable kind, there
would have been no occasion for such joy<i>, </i>and even triumph. And by these
expressions he intimates that the people would not be brought back from exile to
be immediately dispersed again, but to flourish in the enjoyment of every
species of blessing. He on this account makes mention of <i>couches,
</i>teaching them to expect daily rest under the divine protection. He declares
that they would be furnished with arms and power, not only to ward off enemies,
but to put them to flight on every side, so as to reduce to subjection kings and
nations which formerly ruled over them. By<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>swords of a

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To execute

and after their return from it, this might seem to be altogether incredible. Nor
did it take place before the advent of Christ; for though the Machabaei and
their posterity reduced the neighboring nations to subjection, this was but a
faint prelude and earnest to direct the thoughts of the Lord's people to what
was approaching. But as Haggai prophesied that the glory of the second Temple
would be greater than of the first, so here there is promised a more prosperous
state than had ever existed.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;370209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Haggai
2:9.) Reduced as the Jews were in numbers, and low as was the state of things
among them, the Psalmist announces to all nations which opposed and troubled
them, that they would have the ascendancy. As they were yet tributary, and dwelt
at Jerusalem only by sufferance, they were called to exercise faith in a promise
which, to the judgment of sense, might appear visionary, and to raise their
thoughts to the infinite power of God, which triumphs over all worldly
obstacles. The vengeance spoken of is such as the Israelites would take, not
under the influence of private resentment, but by commandment of God; and this
we mention that none may infer that they are allowed to take vengeance for
personal injuries.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The next verse, where mention
is made of</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
kings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nobles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>is an amplification; for had he only spoken of peoples and nations, this
might have been restricted to the common people and men of low condition. Here
is something much greater &#8212; that kings and others of noble rank would be
dragged to punishment in chains. But it is to be remembered, as I have just
hinted, that but a small part of this splendid prospect was realized until
Christ appeared; for any small increase of prosperity which the people enjoyed
under the Machabaei was not worthy of any consideration, except in so far as by
this help God sustained the drooping spirits of the people up to Christ's
advent. Here the prediction of Jacob is to be noticed &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"the scepter shall not
depart from Judah, until Shiloh come."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014910&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
49:10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Machabaei sprung from another tribe. We must,
infer, therefore, that the regular order was then interrupted, and that to make
the prosperous state of the people to have been based upon their victories, is
building a castle in the air. And God would appear designedly to have removed
the government from the tribe of Judah, lest this success should intoxicate the
minds of his people; for most of them, through pride in these signal victories,
overlooked the true and substantial deliverance. As the Psalmist treats here of
the perfection of the prosperity of the people, it follows that he refers to the
Messiah, that their expectation and desire of him might never cease either in
their prosperity or adversity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To perform the
judgment,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>etc. He qualifies what he had
said in the previous verses, in which he might have appeared to arm the Lord's
people for deeds of warlike cruelty. At first sight it might appear strange,
that they who were called the merciful ones of God, should be sent out with
drawn swords to commit slaughter, and pour out human blood; for what evidence
was here of mercy? But when God himself is the author of the vengeance taken, it
is just judgment, not cruelty. When mention is made of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgment
written</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the Psalmist reminds the Jews
that they were called to liberty by command of God &#8212; to that liberty which
had been unjustly wrested from them by' foreigners and tyrants, and that they
could not be blamed for executing judgment written. Any exposition of the
passage is faulty which does not proceed upon this as being the Psalmist's
design, that he would have the Jews to consider the divine mandate, not to
proceed under the influence of private resentment, and to throw a rein over
passion; saying upon the matter, that God's children may not execute vengeance
but when called to it, there being an end of all moderation when men yield
themselves up to the impulse of their own spirits. Another question might arise
here by way of objection. Christ is said to have come<i> </i>without crying or
lifting up his voice, that he might not break the bruised reed,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401220&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
12:20,) and he inculcates the same character upon his followers. The answer is
obvious, that Christ is also armed with an iron scepter, by which to bruise the
rebellious, and is elsewhere described as stained with blood, as slaying his
enemies on every side, and not being wearied with the slaughter of them.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;236302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
63:2.) Nor is it surprising, considering the obstinacy which universally
prevails in the world, that the mercy which is treated with such indignity
should be converted into severity. Now the doctrine laid down in the passage
admits of being rightly applied to our practice, in this way, that what is here
said of the two-edged sword, applies more especially to the Jews, and not
properly to us, who have not a power of this kind permitted; except, indeed,
that rulers and magistrates are vested by God with the sword to punish all
manner of violence; but this is something peculiar to their
office.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fe296</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As to the Church collective, the sword
now put into our hand is of another kind, that of the word and spirit, that we
may slay for a sacrifice to God those who formerly were enemies, or again
deliver them over to everlasting destruction unless they repent.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490617&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
6:17.) For what Isaiah predicted of Christ extends to all who are his
members<i>, &#8212; </i></font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">If believers quietly confine themselves within these
limits of their calling, they will find that the promise of vengeance upon their
enemies has not been given in vain. For when God calls us, as I have said above,
to judgment written, he puts a restraint both upon our spirits and actions, so
as that we must not attempt what he has not commanded. When it is said, in the
close of the verse, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this
honor is to all the merciful ones of God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>he not only exhorts to the practice of piety, but gives us a support for our
encouragement, lest we should think that we might be losers by exercising mercy
and patience, as most men give vent to fury and rage, under the idea that the
only way to defend their life is by showing the savageness of wolves. Although
God's people, therefore, have nothing of the strength of the giant, and will not
move a finger without divine permission, 'and have a calm spirit, the Psalmist
declares, that they have an honorable and splendid issue out of all their
troubles.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Praise God in his

commends the spiritual worship of God, which consists in sacrifices of praise.
By the <i>sanctuary </i>there is little doubt that heaven is here meant, as is
often the case elsewhere. The second clause is exegetical, for the same thing is
repeated. But for sanctuary we read
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[yqr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rekia, </i>that is, <i>the expanse of heaven, </i>to which is added the
epithet of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>power</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>because there we have a proof of the matchless power of God, so that we
cannot look to the heavens without being lost in admiration. As to the
interpretation which some give &#8212; Praise God, ye angels who inhabit the
heavens, and ye men who dwell under the firmament, it is forced and unnatural;
for the Psalmist, in order to awaken men who grow languid in God's praises, bids
them lift their eyes towards the heavenly sanctuary. That the majesty of God may
be duly reverenced, the Psalmist represents him as presiding on his throne in
the heavens; and he enlarges upon the same truth in the second verse,
celebrating his power and his greatness, which he had brought under our notice
in the heavens, which are a mirror in which they may be seen. If we would have
our minds kindled, then, to engage in this religious service, let us meditate
upon his power and greatness, which will speedily dispel all such insensibility.
Though our minds can never take in this immensity, the mere taste of it will
deeply affect us. And God will not reject such praises as we offer according to
our capacity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Praise him with sound of
trumpet.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I do not insist upon the words
in the Hebrew signifying the musical instruments; only let the reader remember
that sundry different kinds are here mentioned, which were in use under the
legal economy, the more forcibly to teach the children of God that they cannot
apply themselves too diligently to the praises of God &#8212; as if he would
enjoin them strenuously to bring to this service all their powers, and devote
themselves wholly to it. Nor was it without reason that God under the law
enjoined this multiplicity of songs, that he might lead men away from those vain
and corrupt pleasures to which they are excessively addicted, to a holy and
profitable joy. Our corrupt nature indulges in extraordinary liberties, many
devising methods of gratification which are preposterous, while their highest
satisfaction lies in suppressing all thoughts of God. This perverse disposition
could only be corrected in the way of God's retaining a weak and ignorant people
under many restraints, and constant exercises. The Psalmist, therefore, in
exhorting believers to pour forth all their joy in the praises of God,
enumerates, one upon another, all the musical instruments which were then in
use, and reminds them that they ought all to be consecrated to the worship of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whatever breathes,

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hm&ccedil;n</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
neshamah, </i>means <i>breath, </i>or <i>blowing, </i>and whatever is animate,
or breathes, the words may be extended to every kind of living creatures, as we
have seen in the preceding psalms that the declaration of God's praises is
assigned even to things wanting intelligence. But as men exclusively are often
meant under the name of "flesh," so we may very well suppose that the words have
reference here to men, who, although they have vital breath in common with the
brute creation, obtain by way of distinction the name of breathing, as of living
creatures. I am led to think this for the following reason: As yet the Psalmist
has addressed himself in his exhortations to the people who were conversant with
the ceremonies under the law, now he turns to men in general, tacitly intimating
that a time was coming when the same songs, which were then only heard in Judea,
would resound in every quarter of the globe. And in this prediction we have been
joined in the same symphony with the Jews, that we may worship God with constant
sacrifices of praise, until being gathered into the kingdom of heaven, we sing
with elect angels an eternal hallelujah.</font><br></div>

"<i>All the precepts of everything, i.e., </i>all precepts concerning all

states, that he had most diligently applied his mind to the consideration of all
God's commandments, the circumstances and occasions on which they were given,

they are all equally just and holy, whatsoever is contrary to them he regarded

The allusion, according to some, is to an exhausted or thirsty traveler in hot
countries, who gasps and pants for the cooling breeze, or the refreshing
fountain. According to others this is a metaphor, taken from an exhausted animal
in the chase, which runs open-mouthed, to take in the cooling air, the heart
beating high, and the muscular force being nearly expended through fatigue. In
either view the language is extremely expressive, showing how intensely the
Psalmist longed for the refreshment and delight which an acquaintance with the
word of God affords. And if the "opening of God's words," mentioned in the
preceding verse, means the expounding of them, David here points out his eager

The Hebrews divided the natural day into three portions--morning, noon, and

engaged in prayer.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;195517&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
55:17.) They also divided the night into three parts, called "watches,"
consisting of four hours each, and commencing at our six o'clock in the evening.

been made by other ancient nations, as appears from the references made to it by
Homer and the early Greek writers. The Greeks and Romans, however, in improving
their military discipline, afterwards divided the night into four watches, each
consisting of three hours; and when the Jews fell under the dominion of the
latter people, they adopted from them this division of the night. Hence we read
of "the fourth watch of the night" in

Before leaving this divine poem, to the close of which we halve now arrived,
there are a few remarks which may be suggested upon a review of the whole. In
the first place, it is worthy of observation, that its alphabetical structure
has been so completely preserved, that not one of the initial letters in it has
been lost. notwithstanding its length and great antiquity, being older by many
ages than any of the celebrated writings of Greece and Rome. In the second
place, the wonderful perfection and yet connection of its various parts is also
deserving of attention. Wherever we begin we seem to be at the commencement, and
wherever we stop the sense is complete; and yet the poem does not consist of
detached sentences, but is a whole consisting of many parts, all of which seem
necessary to its perfection. In the third place, the numerous apparent
repetitions which occur in it ought not to excite the prejudice of the reader.
Although the frequent recurrence of the same words may not have an effect
altogether agreeable upon fastidious ears, yet these words are so connected with
others, as to bring out new meanings and to suggest new trains of thought. Hence
the intelligent and pious student, instead of finding the sentences
tautological, will discover new sentiments welling out to preserve his attention
and to keep alive the flame of devotion. Walford, after observing that some
readers may think this poem singularly marked by frequent repetitions, adds
&#8212; "It is not my intention to write an essay on this theme; and I shall
therefore briefly say, that the implicitly of ancient writings is one of their
greatest charms. If the repetitions of Psalm 119 create in it a blemish, it is
one which the royal author of it shares in common with the most illustrious poet
of Pagan antiquity; and that if simplicity and repetition are to be objected
against David's Ode,<i> </i>the author of the Iliad and the Odyssey will hardly
escape condemnation." In fine, the attentive reader must have observed the
striking manner in which this composition exhibits the workings of genuine
godliness in the regenerated soul. "I know of no part of the Holy Scriptures,"
remarks that eminent man, Jonathan Edwards, "where the nature and evidences of
true and sincere godliness are so fully and largely insisted on and delineated
as in Psalm 119. The Psalmist declares his design in the first verses of the
Psalm, keeps his eye on it all along, and pursues it to the end. The excellency
of holiness is represented as the immediate object of a spiritual taste and
delight. God's law &#8212; that grand expression and emanation of the holiness
of God's nature and prescription of holiness to the creature &#8212; is all
along represented as the great object of the <i>love, </i>the complacence, and
the rejoicing of the gracious nature, which prizes God's commands 'above gold,
yea, the finest gold,' and to which they are 'sweeter than honey and the
honey-comb.'" <i>&#8212; Edwards on the Religious Affections, </i>part 3 section
3.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fte42</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
</font><font face="Palatino">This opinion was held by Rabbi David Kimchi; and he
asserts that the Psalms, entitled Songs of Ascents or Steps, were so entitled
because the Levites sang one of them upon each of the fifteen steps, which, says
<i>he, </i>separated the court of the women from that of the men in Solomon's
Temple. This Calvin justly characterizes as a "silly conjecture;" and such an
explanation is now generally rejected. Jebb, after stating several of the
attempted solutions of the title of these Psalms, observes<i> </i>&#8212; "On
these notions it is unnecessary to dwell, and still less upon that Jewish fable
mentioned by Rabbi David, that these Psalms were sung on ascending the fifteen
steps, which were imagined to lead from one of the outer courts of the Temple to
that of the Levites. No trace in history, or authentic tradition, can be found
of these steps, which owe their construction solely to the accommodating fancy
of the Rabbins, who, as usual, imagined facts, in order to support their
preconceived theories." &#8212;<i> Jebb's Literal Translation of the Psalms,
with Dissertations, </i>volume 2. It is an additional objection to this
Rabbinical conceit, that David, whose name several of these Psalms bear<i>
&#8212; </i>and others of which have evident reference to his time and
circumstances<i> &#8212; </i>lived in the time of the tabernacle, which had no
steps.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fte43</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The Syriac version calls them "Songs of Ascent out of Babylon;" and such is the
interpretation of several modern critics, among whom is Calmet, who has given an
able analysis of what has been written on this title in his <i>Dissertation sur
les quinze Psaumes Gradue. </i>After stating numerous explanations, and
characterizing many of them as "vaines et frivoles conjectures," he adopts it as
the most probable supposition, that they were sung during the journey of the
returning captives from Babylon to
Jerusalem.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fte44</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This is the opinion of Aben
Ezra.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fte45</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><b>
</b>While Calvin leans to this as the most probable explanation, he has before
admitted that it is only a conjecture; and after all that has been said since
his time on the subject, it is still involved in obscurity, and perhaps it is
now impossible to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion. The Psalms, however,
which bear this title, have a striking resemblance to each other, and are
different in style from the other divine Poems in this book. They are all very
short, and in several of them there is a gradation of meaning, and a degree of
point towards the dose, which may be called epigrammatic. Hence Gesenius
suggests that the title may mark a peculiar species of Hebrew composition. "The
construction of the songs" [of degrees,] says Jebb, "is<i> </i>such as to reduce
the evidently to a class. They are all short compositions, sententious,
eminently fitted for lyrical use, in the highest degree poetical, and, as Calmet
justly remarks, epigramrustic; using this term in its highest sense as
concinnate, terse, and abounding in turns expressed with the most exquisite
brevity. Two remarkable characteristics they possess, which, though found
occasionally in other Psalms, seem to enter into the very texture of these<i>

figure which the rhetoricians call.<i>Epanaphora, </i>or the repetition of the

"juniper-tree." It would appear that this shrub was remarkable for the intense
flame with which it burned, and for the length of time during which its embers
retained their heat. Several critics, however, think that the Hebrew
<i>rothem</i> means the genista or Spanish broom; and in support of this opinion
it is said that the genista is much used as fuel by the Arabs, among whom the
Psalmist describes himself as then living; and that, as Geierus asserts, it"
sparkles, burns, and crackles more vehemently than any other wood." (See
Parkhurst on

It is somewhat difficult to decide in this matter. As more than thirty different
trees are mentioned in the Bible, and as we are but imperfectly acquainted with
the natural history of these remote countries, it is no wonder though we find it
impossible to identify all these trees. It may be observed that Calvin in his
translation brings out that beautiful gradation of sense, terminating in a point
of severity, for which the Hebrew text is remarkable, but which does not appear
in our English version. Slanderous words are first compared to "arrows,"
secondly, to "arrows discharged from the bow by a strong man," and in proportion
to the strength of a man will be the force with which his weapon strikes; next
to "sharp arrows;" and lastly, to "coals of juniper," or some wood used in those
days celebrated for burning fiercely and long, (for the particle

106:6, "We have sinned <i>like as </i>our fathers,") intimating not only that
malignant slanders deeply penetrate, but that they inflame and burn for a long
time. Hence the Apostle James
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;590305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
3:5, 6) compares the tongue of slander to a fire enkindled from hell, and
inflaming the course of nature. Some interpreters think that this verse is not
to be understood as a description of calumny, but rather as the punishment which
God will inflict on the calumniator. They therefore regard it as an answer to
the question in the preceding verse, "What shall be given unto thee," etc.;
observing that calumny and falsehood being frequently represented by the images
of arrows and fire, the same images suitably express the requital which awaits
them at the hand of God &#8212; the swift and terrible retributive vengeance of
the Almighty, which will overtake all who practice falsehood and slander. See

opinion is adopted by Street, Mant, Morison, Paxton, Fry, French and Skinner.

this meaning the more clearly, uses a supplement:</font><br></div>

This is the sense in which the word is rendered in most of the ancient versions.

paroiki&gt;a mru ejmakru&gt;nqh</font><font face="Palatino">, "my sojourning is

Bishop Patrick and Dr. Hammond, following these authorities, render

mesech, </i>adverbially. But though this is a meaning which the word will bear,
yet as Calvin observes, there is little room for doubting that it is here a
proper name. The parallelism which enables us in many instances to determine the
accurate interpretation of a word in Hebrew poetry when other helps entirely
fail, decidedly favors this interpretation. The term corresponding to

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rrq</font><font face="Palatino">

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
mesech. </i>To render it otherwise is destructive of the poetical structure of
the passage. "If," says Phillips, "the adverbial sense be intended, then the

In describing those among whom he was now living as <i>haters of peace, </i>and,
in the next verse, as bent on war, the inspired writer probably still alludes to
the Arab tribes he had specified in the 5th verse, who have, from their origin
to the present hour, been eminently characterized by their hatred of peace and
propensity to war. Dr. Shaw thus writes concerning these barbarous tribes as
they are<i> </i>to be found in our own day, and their character and habits were
the same at the time when this Psalm was written: "The Arabs are naturally
thievish and treacherous; and it sometimes happens, that those very persons are
overtaken and pillaged in the morning who were entertained the night before with
all the instances of friendship and hospitality. Neither are they to be accused
for plundering strangers only, and attacking almost every person whom they find
unarmed and defenceless, but for those many implacable and hereditary
animosities which continually subsist among them: literally fulfilling the
prophecy to Hagar, that 'Ishmael should be a wild man; his hand should be

of idiocy. Comparatively few survive and perfectly recover the effects of such a
visitation. What the Psalmist means by the <i>smiting of the moon </i>is at
first sight not so obvious. Some suppose that he speaks in conformity with a
popular belief, which it is supposed prevailed in the East in his time, just as
it does in the present day, respecting the deleterious influence of the
moonbeams on the human body, although there is no ground for such a belief, the
moon no doubt getting the blame of the injury done by the cold and dampness of
the night. But the probability is, that by the striking of the moon he simply
alludes to the cold of the night, which has very baneful effects on the human
frame, particularly in such oriental countries as Palestine, where there is a

time or' the restoration of the Jews from Babylon, he says<i> &#8212;</i>"The
extraordinary play upon words already noticed might argue a later period of
composition: [than the time of David]. Still I cannot but think that the title
assigning the Psalm to him is borne out by internal evidence of a stronger kind.
The fond mention of Jerusalem, David's beloved city; the thrones of the house of
David; and the recurrence of peace, which was so emphatically promised to David,
as the blessing about to be conferred on his son Solomon, are all circumstances,
which, taken in connection, stamp this song with a character evidently belonging
to the reign of the royal Psalmist<i>.</i>"<i> &#8212; Ibid., </i>volume

rendering is the best, as fitting with the preceding word avg; and so we have

</b>According to Archbishop Seeker, this refers to severe scourging; and those
who have witnessed this cruel infliction tell us that the allusion is most
expressive, the long weals or wounds left by the scourges at each stroke being
most aptly compared either to furrows, or (as the original admits) to the ridges
between the furrows. With respect to the alleged incongruity of ploughing, and
making long furrows on the back, the Archbishop observes, "<i>Lacerare</i> <i>et
secare tercum </i>are Latin phrases, and ploughing is not much stronger, to
express a severe scourging." The language of the Psalmist may, however, without
allusion to any particular species of persecuting violence, be, as Calvin
understands it, simply a strong image of cruel oppression. "The persecutors of
Israel," says Walford, "are compared to ploughmen; because as they cut up, and

Some, as Street, Mant, Dr. Adam Clarke, French and Skinner, and Phillips,
suppose that the allusion in this verse is to the watchings which the Priests

for the first dawn of day, in order that the morning sacrifice might be offered.

Of all explanations the best is that of considering the comparison to consist
between the humbleness and simplicity of the Psalmist's mind, and that of a
little child, in whom there does not exist a sufficient consciousness to create
an ambition for any worldly object. The comparison is not with
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qnwy</font><font face="Palatino">,
a suckling; for it has a longing after the mother's breast, and, therefore, such
a comparison would not be appropriate. The same, indeed, may be said of a child
who has only just been weaned; for, in that stage, how often does it cry and
mourn after that of which it has been deprived, and the possession of which was
just before its chief pleasure? We therefore conclude, that the comparison is
intended to be with a child who has been weaned a sufficient time to have
forgotten its infantile nutriment, and who is not conscious of any particular
desires or cravings, and quietly resigns itself to its mother's care and
training. &#8212;

Lightfoot ascribes this Psalm to David, and supposes it to have been composed on
the second removal of the Ark from the house of Obededom.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;131504&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Chronicles 15:4, etc.) But the mention of David's name in the tenth verse in the
third person, and the terms there employed, militate against his being the
Author. Others ascribe it to Solomon, who, they think, wrote it about the time
of the removing of the Ark into the Temple, which he had built for it.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;140502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 5:2, etc.) Others are of opinion, that it was composed by Solomon for
the solemn services that were celebrated at the dedication of the Temple. "The
whole tenor of this Psalm," says Jebb, "is an exact epitome of the Dedication
Prayer of Solomon. (2 Chronicles 6) The topics are the same - the building the
house of the Lord - the promise to David - the inhabitation of the Almighty; -
and the concluding sentences of the Dedication, are identical with those
expressions of the Psalm in verses 8, 9, 10. There can, therefore, be little
question that this Psalm was composed by Solomon." - Jebb's Literal Translation
of the Book of Psalms, etc., volume 2. As this forms one of the "Songs of
Degrees," those who conceive that these Psalms were so called beta. use sung by
the Jews about the time of their return from Babylon, conclude that Ezra
selected this ancient song to be sung at the dedication of the second
Temple.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fte124</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The expression of going up to one's bed may be illustrated by what Dr. Shaw says

three, four, or five feet above the floor, with a balustrade in the front of it,

text is no doubt hyperbolical, as Calvin observes, being intended to express
David's great anxiety to have a house built for the worship of

is the one adopted by Calvin - the more probable and no doubt at first sight the
most obvious meaning is, that the pronoun <i>it </i>refers to the spot which
David had discovered as a suitable place on which to erect the house of God.
Walford, indeed, objects that "this cannot be intended, because the site of the
Temple was neither at Ephratah, nor in the fields of the wood, or of Jaar;" and
he gives at some length an ingenious explanation of this difficult passage,
extracted chiefly from the German writer Tilingius. This objection, it will be
perceived, is removed by one of the expositions suggested by Calvin, which
supposes that the allusion is first to a report of Ephratha being the place
where the Temple was to be built; and next to the certain information which the
people of Israel afterwards obtained that Jerusalem was the spot which God
himself had selected. Whether this however is the correct explanation of the
verse, it is not so easy to

There is a mountain called Hermon, which is the highest of the ridge of
mountains designated Anti-Lebanon, and which is situated in the northern border
of the country beyond Jordan. This, however, is not the mountain supposed to be
here intended, but another of the same name lying within the land of Canaan on
the west of the river Jordan. It is described by Buckingham as a range of hills
running for several miles east and west, and forming the southern boundary of
the plain of Esdraelon, overlooked in which Mount Tabor is situated. Maundrell,
who, in his journey from Aleppo to Jerusalem had a full view of Tabor and Hermon
at about six or seven hours' distance to the eastward, speaking of the copious
dews which fell in that part of the country, says, "We were sufficiently
instructed by experience what the Psalmist means by the dew of Hermon, our tents
being as wet with it as if it had rained all night."<i> -

Calvin gives the construction of these words as it is in the Hebrew text. But to
make them intelligible something must be supplied. As Hermon and Zion are many
miles distant from each other, it would be absurd to speak of the dews of the
former as falling on the latter, not to mention the difficulty of understanding
how the dew of one mountain can descend upon another. The translators of our
English Bible repeat the words <i>like the dew </i>before <i>which descended;
</i>and the insertion of this supplement is fully justified, as it is the most

The heathen who in ancient times worshipped the elements, imagined them to
possess the power of giving or withholding rain at pleasure, Referring to this
superstitious imagination the Prophet Jeremiah

"Are there among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? Or can the
heavens give showers? Art thou not he, O Jehovah, our God? Therefore we will
wait upon thee; for thou hast made all these things." Among the Greeks and
Romans Jupiter was armed with the thunder and the lightning; and AEolus ruled
over the winds. Here the Psalmist teaches us to restore the celestial artillery
to its rightful owner. The description probably refers to the regular rainy
season of autumn which comes on towards the end of September; and Dr. Russell's
account of the weather at Aleppo in that month may be quoted as illustrating the
particulars of the verse. "Seldom<i> </i>a night passes," says he, "without much
lightning in the north-west quarter, but not attended with thunder; and, when
this lightning appears in the west or south-west points, which is often followed
with thunder, it is a sure sign of the approaching rain. A squall of wind, and
clouds of dust, are the usual forerunners of these rains." Thus God may be said
to "make<i> </i>lightnings for the rain," inasmuch as the lightnings in the west
and south-west points are, in the East, the sure prognostics of rain; and the
squalls of wind which bring on these refreshing showers may be said to be
brought for that purpose from "God's secret places." From Dr. Russell's
representing "<i>clouds of draft,</i>"<i> </i>as "the usual forerunners of these
rains," Harmer concludes that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ya&ccedil;n</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

Jebb observes, that "the 136th Psalm is altogether peculiar in its construction,
as it has the recurrence<i> </i>of the same words, ' For everlasting is his
mercy,' at the end of every distich." He adds, that "this elaborate artifice of
construction seems characteristic of that later period which comprised the
captivity and restoration;" although he at the same time admits, that it is to
be found in Psalms of an earlier date than the Baby-lonish captivity, quoting a
passage in the account of the dedication of Solomon's Temple, which informs us,
that the whole choir of Israel united in praising God "for he is good; for his
mercy endureth for ever:"<i> </i>and observing that this expression forms
the.commencement of three other Psalms, the Psalm 106, Psalm 107, and Psalm 118.
In his remarks on the Psalm 119, after adverting to the alphabetical character
of that Psalm, he adds, "There are other artifices of construction observable in
the Psalms and Hymns composed in these later ages of the Church. For example,
that repetition of the same words and clauses, and the frequent recurrence of a
characteristic word, so frequent in the Greater Hallel, [from the Psalm 111 to
Psalm 118th, inclusive,] and in the Songs of Degrees: and in a continually
recurring burden, in each distich, as in the Song of the three Children, and
Psalm 136, which latter is unique in the Psalter. It has been the tendency of
the poetry of most countries, in the progress of time, to make its
characteristic features depend less upon the exactness of sentimental
arrangement, and more upon some external artifice, whether this be prosodial
metre, alliteration, rhyme, assonance, or the recurrence of a burthen. Now,
though the poetry of the Scriptures, because it was inspired, never declined
from the perfection of its sentimental construction, still those artificial
contrivances, practiced, indeed, in earlier times, seem to have been more
prevalent at the time of the captivity, and the time immediately following, than
heretofore. It was probably so ordained, for the purpose of assisting the
memories of the Jews, who at Babylon were excluded from the open exercise of
their religion, and from public teaching, and, therefore, required more private
helps, which could be more easily communicated orally from parents to children,
or from masters to disciples." <i>&#8212; Jebb's Translation of the Psalms,

By "Babylon" is meant, not the city, but the kingdom; and the mention of rivers,
according to the suggestion of Rosenmuller, is because the synagogues were
usually built near rivers, for the greater convenience of the Jews, who were
obliged to wash their hands before prayer. But as they had no synagogues in
Babylon, they might frequent such localities as would, be suitable sites for
places of worship, and there in the open air perform divine service. It is
conjectured by Chrysostom that the Jewish captives were not suffered at first to
dwell in any of their conquerors' towns or cities, but were dispersed all along
several rivers of the country, where they built for themselves tabernacles or
cottages.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fte179</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

Calvin, in his Commentary, makes the same supplement as the translators of our

correctness of this view is supported by the following verse, where we have,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let my tongue cleave to the roof
of my mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. The object of both
verses is to express a deep, heart-felt interest in Jerusalem; and should he
lose that interest, the Psalmist wishes that the two members of the body, by
which both instrumental and vocal music are performed, may be rendered incapable
of doing their work &#8212; that the tongue may be unable to utter, and the
right hand may forget the art of playing, or <i>its cunning. </i>"There here is
a striking and appropriate point in this which has been overlooked. It is, that
as it is customary for people in the East to swear by their possessions, so one
who has no possessions &#8212; who is poor and destitute, and has nothing of
recognised value in the world &#8212; swears by his right hand, which is his
whole stake in society, trod by the ' cunning' of which he earns his daily
bread. Hence the common Arabic proverb, (given by Burckhardt, No. 550,)
reflecting on the change of demeanour produced by improved circumstances: ' He

Here "O Jehovah" is to be understood. Though it is not in the received Hebrew
text, it was found in six copies examined by Dr. Kennicott, and in eight

add" Jehovah" after the verb for "praise." "The omission of the Divine name,"

This Psalm is entitled "a Psalm of David," and Calvin considers him to be its
author agreeably to the title; lint the mention of "the temple" in the second
verse seems to render such an opinion doubtful. If, however, we translate this
word by "mansion," which is the proper rendering of the original &#8212; "the

This Psalm has often been admired for the grandeur of its sentiments, the
elevation of its style, as well as the variety and beauty of its imagery. Bishop
Lowth, in his 29th Prelection, classes it amongst the Hebrew idyls, as next to
the 104th, in respect both to the conduct of the poem, and the beauty of the
style. "If it be excelled," says he, "(as perhaps it is) by the former in the
plan, disposition, and arrangement of the matter, it is not in the least
inferior in the dignity and elegance of its sentiments, images, and figures."
"Amongst its other excellencies," says Bishop Mant, "it is for nothing more
admirable than for the exquisite skill with which it descants on the perfections
of the Deity. The Psalmist's faith in the omnipresence and omniscience of
Jehovah is in the commencement depicted &#183; with a singular and beautiful
variety of the most lively expressions: nor,:an anything be more sublime than
that accummulation of the noblest and loftiest images, in the 7th and following
verses, commensurate with the limits of created nature, whereby the Psalmist
labors to impress upon the mind some notion of the infinity of God." If we
compare this sacred poem with any hymn of classical antiquity in honor of the
heathen deities, the immense superiority of the sentiments it contains must
convince any reasonable person that David and the Israelites, though inferior in
other respects to some other nations, surpassed them in religious knowledge. No
philosopher of ancient times ever attained to such sublime views of the
perfections and moral government of God as the Hebrew Prophets. How are we to
account for this difference but on the supposition of the divine origin of the
religion of the Hebrews? On any other supposition these Psalms are a greater
miracle than any of those recorded by
Moses.</font>	<br><font face="Palatino">Bishop Horsley refers the composition of
this Psalm to a later age than that of David. "The frequent Chaldaisms," says
he, "of the diction, argue no very high antiquity." Dr. Adam Clarke, on the same
ground, argues that it was; not written by the sweet singer of Israel, but
during or after the time of the captivity. Other critics, however, maintain that
the several Chaldaisms to be found in it afford no foundation for such an
opinion. "How any critic," says Jebb, "<i>can </i>assign this Psalm to other
than David, I cannot understand. Every line, every thought, every turn of
expression and transition is his, and his only. As for the arguments drawn from
the two Chaldaisms which occur,
(</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">y[br</font><font face="Palatino">

this is really nugatory. These Chaldaisms consist merely in the substitution of
one letter for another very like it in shape, and easily to be mistaken by a
transcriber, particularly by one who had been used to the Chaldee idiom: but the
moral arguments for David's author-ship are so strong as to overwhelm.'my such
verbal or rather <i>literal </i>criticism, were even the objections more
formidable than they actually are."<i> &#8212; Jebb's Literal Translation of the

Piscator, Campensis, Pagninus, Luther, and our English Version, read "thou
compassest." This no doubt gives the meaning, of the original, though not the
precise idea, which is noticed on the margin of our English Bible to be
"winnowest." <i>The </i>verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrz</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
zarah, </i>employed, signifies <i>to disperse, to fan, to ventilate, to winnow;
</i>and here it denotes that as men separate the corn from the chaff, so God
separates between, or investigates, the good and the bad in the daily conduct of
men. Hence the Septuagint reads
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejxicni&gt;asav</font><font face="Palatino">,
"thou hast investigated." Bishop Hare, who renders "thou dost compass," supposes
it to be a metaphor taken from hunting. "Winnowing," says Archbishop Secker,"

<div><font face="Palatino">And after observing that the foetus is gradually
formed and matured for the birth, like plants and flowers under ground, he adds
&#8212; " The process is compared to that in a piece of work wrought with a
needle, or fashioned in the loom: which, with all its beautiful variety of
color, and proportion of figure, ariseth by degrees to perfection, under the
hand of the artist, framed according to a pattern lying before him, from a rude
mass of silk, or other materials. Thus, by the power and wisdom of God, and
after a plan delineated in his book, is a shapeless mass wrought up into the
most curious texture of nerves, veins, arteries, bones, muscles, membranes, and
skin, most skilfully interwoven and connected with each other, until it becometh
a body harmoniously diversified with all the limbs and lineaments of a man, not
one of which at first appeared, any more than the figures were to be seen in the
ball of silk. But then, which is the chief thing here insisted on by the
Psalmist, whereas the human artificer must have the clearest light whereby to
accomplish his task, the divine work-master seeth in secret, and effecteth all
his wonders within the dark and narrow confines of the womb." Bishop Lowth
supposes that the full force and beauty of the metaphor in this passage will not
be understood, unless it is perceived that the Psalmist alludes to the art of
embroidery<i> </i>as consecrated by the Jews to sacred purposes, in decorating
the garments of the priests and the curtains at the entrance of the tabernacle.
"In that most perfect ode, Psalm 139," says he, "which celebrates the immensity
of the omnipresent Deity, and the wisdom of the divine artificer in forming the
human body, the author uses a metaphor derived from the most subtle art of
Phrygian workmen:</font><br></div>

wonderful mechanism of the human body, the various amplifications of the veins,
arte<i>ries, </i>fibres, and membranes; the 'indescribable texture' of the whole
fabric; may indeed feel the beauty and gracefulness of this well-adapted
metaphor, but will miss much of its force and sublimity, unless he be apprised
that the art of designing in needle-work was wholly dedicated to the use of the
sanctuary, and by a direct precept of the divine law, chiefly employed in
furnishing' a part of the sacerdotal habits, and the veils for the entrance of
the tabernacle.

and though it evidently denotes some of the serpent tribe, it is not so easy to
determine the particular species intended. In our English Bible it is translated
"adder," and as the word is derived from an Arabic verb, which signifies to coil
up, or bend back, it has been said that this act perfectly corresponds with the
nature of the adder, which in preparing to strike contracts itself into a spiral
form, and raises its horrid head from the middle of the orb; and which also
assumes the same form when it goes to sleep, coiling its body into a number of
circles, with its head in the center. &#8212; (<i>Paxton's Illustrations of
Scripture</i>, vol. i. p. 428.) But the same action is common to most serpents;

the poisonous matter which is conveyed in a small tube or canal to the end of a
fang which lies concealed at the roof of the mouth. This fang is moveable at the
pleasure of the serpent, and is protruded when it is about to strike at an
antagonist. The situation of this poison, which is in a manner behind the upper
lip, gives great propriety to the expression &#8212; 'Adders' poison is under
their lips.' The usage of the Hebrew language, renders it by no means improbable
that the fang itself is called

circumstance, as noticed by Thevenot, that artifices of this kind are literally
employed against men as well as against birds and wild beasts by some of the
Orientals. "The cunningest robbers in the world," says he, as quoted by Mant,
"are in this country. They use a certain slip, with a running noose, which they

Many commentators are strongly of opinion, that this Psalm was written as a
memorial of that very interesting scene in the life of David, recorded in 1
Samuel 24, relating to his generous treatment of Saul. Though he had an
opportunity of putting that his cruel persecutor to death in the cave of
En-gedi, yet he spared his life, only cutting off his skirt, and not suffering
his followers to touch him; and when Saul had gone out of the cave, David going
out after him, remonstrated with him from some distance in the gentlest and most
respectful language in regard to the injustice of his conduct towards him. It is
thought that the sixth verse contains so express a reference to this very
remarkable occurrence in David's history, as to leave little doubt that it was
the occasion on which the Psalm was
composed.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">Fte234</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
As</i>, here and in the preceding clause, is a supplement, very properly made by
our author; a word signifying <i>like</i>, or <i>in the stead of</i>, being
frequently understood in the Hebrew text of the
Psalms.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">Fte235</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The allusion, according to the opinion of most commentators, is to the morning
and evening sacrifices, of which see an account in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;022938&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
29:38-42. In the phraseology of the verse it. is supposed that there is a
reference to the commencing and concluding acts of the daily public worship
among the Jews. Every morning and evening the priests offered incense upon the
incense-altar which stood in the holy place, while the people prayed without.
But in the morning the incense was offered <i>before</i> the sacrifice was laid
upon the altar of burnt-offering; whereas in the evening (at the ninth hour) it
was offered after the sacrifice was laid upon the altar; and thus in the evening
the sacrifice and the incense were offered at the same time. See Lightfoot's
Temple Service, chapter 9:section 5. Dr. Adam Clarke, however, thinks that David
does not refer to any <i>sacrifice</i>; "for," says he, "he uses not
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jbz</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>zebach</i>, which is almost universally used for a <i>slaughtered</i>
<i>animal</i>,

bones to be made with the scattering of wood after it has been cleft. But it is
more probable that what the Psalmist intended to say was in substance as
follows: 'Our bones lie scattered at the edge of the grave, just as one cutting
and cleaving the earth in making a grave often throws up bones, which may be
seen scattered here and there with the earth lying at its sides.' The verse is

Samuel 24:2, that Saul and his chosen men went to seek David upon the <i>rocks

so gentle, dutiful and affecting, as for the time to melt into tenderness and
contrition the heart of Saul, and to impress the minds of all who heard
them.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">Fte241
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">If David here refers to the treatment he and
his followers met with at the hands of Saul, this exhibits in dark colors the
extreme inhumanity of that monarch. "We are not sufficiently informed," says
Walford, "respecting the cruelties which were perpetrated against David and
those who adhered to him, to enable us to point out the instances to which he
here alludes; but the murder of Abimelech, and of the priests who were with him,
furnishes a pregnant proof of the atrocities which Saul and his agents were
capable of perpetrating. (See 1 Samuel 22.) It appears from the language of this
verse that such enormities were not confined to a few cases, but must have been
numerous, to give occasion to the image which is employed to describe them." How
striking the contrast between David's treatment of Saul, and that which Saul
adopted towards him! Mr. Peters in his Dissertations on Job, gives an exposition
of this 7th verse which is ingenious, and which Archbishop Secker calls
"admirable, though not quite unexceptionable." Understanding the verse as
referring to the slaughter of the priests at Nob, just now adverted to, he
renders the words </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ypl
lwa&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">, (which Calvin translates, <i>at the
grave's mouth</i>,) <i>at the mouth</i>, that is, <i>at the command of Saul</i>.

not find David ever mentioning Saul by name in any of the Psalms. Peters,

endeavors to remove it, though, as we think, with indifferent
success.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">Fte242

Translators, however, in general concur with Calvin, and we think justly, the

reference to the great transgression, the consequences of which followed David
all his days. "As he would not fail to be reminded of it," says that writer, "by
the sorrows which had now come upon him, from Absalom's misconduct, and as his
purpose was, notwithstanding, to implore divine support and deliverance, he
deprecates God's righteous judgment, since if no man could be just with God,
certainly he, who had so greatly transgressed, could have no claim to such a
state. The consciousness of his guilt, though he had reason to believe it was
forgiven, induced him thus to abase himself before God, when he was about to
offer earnest entreaties for deliverance from dangers which threatened his
dignity and life; while he still maintained his hope, that God looked upon him
as his servant, whom he had pledged himself to
protect."</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">Fte250

<i>forever</i>; the Chaldee, <i>as they that lie down of that age</i>. The real
sense of the expression is, <i>as they who have been dead a long time</i>. The
Psalmist employs hyperbolical language in this verse; he says, the enemy hath
beaten his life to the ground, hath made him dwell in dark places, and for such
a length of time, that there remained no remembrance of him, and that he had
become like those persons who had long since been in their graves. The design of

according to this view the allusion is to the cracking of the lands of the east,
in consequence of the extreme drought of the summer months. These dry lands, as
has been noticed by travelers, have often chinks too deep for a person to see to
the bottom of. This may be observed in the Indies more than anywhere, a little
before the autumnal rains fall, and, wherever the lands are rich and hard. See

took this to be the subject of the Psalm is evident from his reading in verse
10th, "the sword of Goliah." Judging, however, from internal evidence, the
enemies referred to seem rather to be those of David and his kingdom, after he
ascended the throne. Some refer the Psalm to David's war with the Ammonites and
Syrians, recorded in 2 Samuel 10.; and it may have been composed by him when
about to encounter these hostile
powers.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">Fte257

<i>kinnor,</i> denoted <i>the lyre,</i> although from their translating it by
different words, each signifying a particular variety of that instrument, they
were uncertain as to the particular species of lyre. "The brief intimations in
Scripture are in full accordance with this statement; for it is not described as
such an instrument &#8212; large, heavy, and resting on the ground when played
&#8212; as the word 'harp' suggests to our minds; but as a light portable
instrument, which the player carried in his hand or on his arm, and might walk
or dance the while. In fact, Scripture describes the <i>kinnor</i> as being used
in such a manner and on such occasions as we know the lyre to have been by the
ancients, who indeed had not, so far as we know, any harps large and resting on
the ground like ours. We speak only of the Greeks and Romans, however, for the
Egyptians had large standing harps; from which we shall in a future note take

"The trumpets of the last Temple were probably formed after the ancient model;
and as these are represented among the spoils of that Temple on the Triumphal
Arch of Titus at Rome, we are enabled to see that they were long straight
trumpets, of a form which has always been and continues to be common... Trumpets
and horns are the only instruments concerning which any directions are given in
the law. 'In the infancy of a state,' says Burney, 'a nation has but little
leisure for cultivating music any otherwise than as it is connected with
religious rites and the military art ;' and it is thus that he accounts for the
fact, that (with the exception of Miriam's timbrel) no instruments but horns and
trumpets are noticed in the Law. And, indeed, it may be said that they are
scarcely mentioned as <i>musical</i> instruments, but as suited to and employed
for making signals, calls, and conveying instructions during the religious
solemnities, and in the field of war... It is clear, however, that trumpets and
cornets were introduced into the musical choirs in the time of David; while they
still continued to be employed in their former service. The following
particulars concerning the use of trumpets in the Temple will be useful, and are
collected chiefly from Lightfoot's 'Temple Service.' The trumpets were sounded
exclusively by the priests who stood not in the Levitical choir, but apart and
opposite to the Levites, on the other side of the altar, both parties looking
towards it&#8212;the priests on the west side, and the Levites on the east. The
trumpets did not join in the concert; but were sounded during certain regulated
pauses in the vocal and instrumental music<i>.</i>"<i>&#8212;Illustrated

a flute which consisted of a number of pipes, of unequal thickness and length,
set close or joined together, which gave harmonious sound when blown into, by
moving them successively under the lower lip. Such is the common opinion, and
there seems no ground to dispute its correctness. This instrument was the small
organ or <i>syrinx</i>, or <i>fistula Panis</i> of antiquity; its invention
having been ascribed to Pan, the great sylvan god, who was usually figured with
the instrument in his hands. According to the fable, he formed it of reeds which

"<i>tsiltelim</i>," or, "cymbals of sound," and "<i>tsiltelim</i>," or

larger size than the farmer, or made of such a shape or of such metals as to
emit a louder sound. The former are translated by French and Skinner, "the soft
cymbal." The literal translation of the Hebrew is, "cymbals of hearing," i.e.,
say these critics, "cymbals which when struck do not overpower the voices of the
singers." They translate the latter, "the loud cymbals." The ancient cymbals
were two convex or hollow plates of brass or other metal, as silver or copper,
made in the form of cups, which were held in each hand, and which being struck
against each other produced a sharp clanging. sound. Some, however, think that

it seems admitted on all hands that both cymbals and sistrums were in use among
the Jews. The sistrum was a concave plate of sonorous metal, and of an oval
configuration, crossed by bars of the same metal with reverted ends. These bars
moved freely in the holes through which they passed, and when the instrument was
shaken by the handle to which it was fixed, the reverted ends striking upon the
body of the instrument produced the sound. It had generally three or four
transverse bars. It was much used by the Egyptians in their religious services,
and actual specimens of it of an ancient date have been discovered. See volume
