PREFACE.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Commentary On Joshua was the last literary labor
of its venerable Author. When he engaged in it, his constitution, which had
never been strong, was completely worn out by excessive exertion, and almost
every line of it must have been dictated to his amanuensis during momentary
intervals of relief from severe bodily pain. On this point we possess authentic
documents which leave no room for doubt.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In a
letter dated
30</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2">th</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
November 1563, not quite six months before his death, after alluding to the
difficulty he felt in continuing his studies, while both mind and body were
exhausted by sickness, he states that he had undertaken a Commentary on Joshua,
in compliance with the wishes of his friends, but had not then been able to
advance beyond the third Chapter, though he had endeavored to be as brief as
possible.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Little more than two months after this
letter was written, on
6</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2">th</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
February 1564, he made his appearance in the pulpit for the last time; and on
10</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2">th</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
March following, the complication of diseases which too plainly indicated that
his earthly career was about to close, had become so alarming as to cause an
entry in the Register of Geneva in the following terms: &#8212; "Arrete que
chacun prie Dieu pour la sante de M. Calvin, qui est indispose depuis longtemps,
et meme en danger de mort:" &#8212; "Decreed that every one pray to God for the
health of Mr. Calvin, who has been indisposed for a long time, and even in
danger of death."</font><br><font face="Palatino">Such are the circumstances in
which this Commentary was composed, and it is impossible, in reflecting on them,
not to admire the indomitable energy which Calvin displayed in proceeding with
his task, and in meeting the remonstrance's of those who would have withdrawn
him from it, with the heroic exclamation, "Would you that the Lord, when He
comes, should find me idle!"</font><br><font face="Palatino">A Work written at
such a time, and in such a spirit, might justly claim exemption from criticism;
but it has no need of indulgence, and can well afford to be judged by its own
intrinsic merits. Viewed merely as an intellectual effort, it displays all the
excellencies which characterize the other Commentaries of its distinguished
Author: viewed in a higher and better light, it is his dying bequest to the
Church &#8212; a solemn ratification of the whole System of Doctrine which he
had so long, so earnestly, and so successfully
promulgated.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As an appropriate conclusion both
to the present Volume and the others which have preceded it, a valuable Tract,
first published in this country in 1845, has been appended. It contains a
Preface by the Rev. William Pringle, its original editor, an Essay from the
German of Professor Theoluck, and a series of Extracts from Writers often
differing widely from each other, but all concurring in a united testimony to
the greatness of Calvin's talents, or the excellence of his character. In the
present reprint, the chief change consists in the insertion of Additional
Testimonies.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The list of Calvin's Writings,
which completes the present Volume, is in accordance with that furnished by his
greatest Biographer, Henri of Berlin, and will enable the reader to comprehend
at a single glance the amazing extent of his literary
labors.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b><i>H.B.</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b><i>December

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">ARGUMENT OF THE
BOOK OF JOSHUA.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the Author of this Book, it is better to
suspend our judgment than to make random assertions. Those who think that it was
Joshua, because his name stands on the title page, rest on weak and insufficient
grounds. The name of Samuel is inscribed on a part of the Sacred History
containing a narrative of events which happened after his death; and there
cannot be a doubt that the book which immediately follows the present is called
Judges, not because it was written by them, but because it recounts their
exploits. Joshua died before the taking of Hebron and Debir, and yet an account
of it is given in the 15th chapter of the present Book. The probability is, that
a summary of events was framed by the high priest Eleazar, and furnished the
materials out of which the Book of Joshua was composed. It was a proper part of
the high priest's duty not only to give oral instruction to the people of his
own time, but to furnish posterity with a record of the goodness of God in
preserving the Church, and thus provide for the advancement of true religion.
And before the Levites became degenerate, their order included a class of
scribes or notaries who embodied in a perpetual register everything in the
history of the Church which was worthy of being recorded. Let us not hesitate.
therefore, to pass over a matter which we are unable to determine, or the
knowledge of which is not very<i> </i>necessary, while we are in no doubt as to
the essential point &#8212; that the doctrine herein contained was dictated by
the Holy Spirit for our use, and confers benefits of no ordinary kind on those
who attentively peruse it.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f1</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">Although
the people had already gained signal victories, and become the occupants of a
commodious and tolerably fertile tract of country, the Divine promise as to the
land of Canaan still remained suspended. Nay, the leading article in the
Covenant was unaccomplished, as if God, after cooping up his people in a corner,
had left his work in a shapeless and mutilated form. This Book, then, shows how,
when the intolerable impiety of the people had interrupted the course of
deliverance, God, while inflicting punishment, so tempered the severity of
justice as ultimately to perform what he had promised concerning the inheritance
of Canaan.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This suggests the very useful
reflection, that while men are cut off by death, and fail in the middle of their
career,<i> </i>the faithfulness of God never fails. On the death of Moses a sad
change seemed impending; the people were left like a body with its head lopped
off. While thus in danger of dispersion, not only did the truth of God prove
itself to be immortal, but it was shown in the person of Joshua as in a bright
mirror, that when God takes away those whom he has adorned with special gifts,
he has others in readiness to supply their place, and that though he is pleased
for a time to give excellent gifts to some, his mighty power is not tied down to
them, but he is able, as often as seems to him good, to find fit successors,
nay, to raise up from the very stones persons qualified to perform illustrious
deeds.</font><br><font face="Palatino">First, we see how, when the wandering of
forty years in the wilderness had almost effaced the remembrance of the passage
of the Red Sea, the course of deliverance was proved to have been uninterrupted
by the repetition of the same miracle in the passage of the Jordan. The renewal
of circumcision was equivalent to a re-establishment of the Covenant which had
been buried in oblivion by the carelessness of the people, or abandoned by them
from despair. Next, we see how they were conducted by the hand of God into
possession of the promised land. The taking of the first city was an earnest of
the perpetual aid which they might hope for from heaven, since the walls of
Jericho fell of their own accord, shaken merely by the sound of trumpets. The
nations, however, were not completely routed by a single battle, nor in one
short campaign, but were gradually worn out and destroyed by many laborious
contests.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here, it is to be observed, that
arduous difficulties were thrown in the way of the people when the kings entered
into a league, and came forth to meet them with united forces, because it became
necessary not only to war with single nations, but with an immense body which
threatened to overwhelm them by one great onset. Ultimately, however, all these
violent attempts had no other effect than to make the power of God more
manifest, and give brighter displays of mercy and faithfulness in the defense of
his chosen people. In fact, their uninterrupted course of success, and their
many unparalleled victories, showed the hand of God as it were visibly stretched
forth from heaven.</font><br><font face="Palatino">More especially, a signal
proof that they were warring under divine auspices was given when the sun was
checked in his course at the mere prayer of Joshua, as if the elements had been
armed for his assistance, and were waiting ready to obey him. Again, while the
delays which occurred in the progress of the war were useful trials of the
constancy of the people, we must not lose sight of another admirable use of
which Moses, to prevent them from fainting in their minds, had at an earlier
period forewarned them, viz., that God was unwilling to destroy the nations at
once, lest the country, from being converted into a kind of desert, might be
overrun by wild beasts.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But the provision which
God had thus most graciously made for their security, they wickedly perverted to
their own destruction: for having obtained what they deemed a large enough space
for commodious habitation, they turned backwards to indulge in sloth and
cowardice. This one crime brought others along with it. For after they had been
enrolled under the banners of the Lord, they treacherously and disobediently
refused to fulfil their period of service, in the very same way as deserters,
regardless of the military oath, basely quit their standards.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f2
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">The dominion of the land, which had been
divinely offered, they, with flagrant ingratitude, rejected, by taking
possession of only a part.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moreover, though they
had been ordered to purge the sacred territory of all pollutions, in order that
no profanation of the pure and legitimate worship might remain, they allowed the
impious superstitions which God abhorred to be practiced as before; and though
they also knew that the order had been partly given as a security for their own
safety, lest, through intermixture with the nations, they might be ensnared by
their impostures and insidious arts, yet, as if they had determined to court
danger, they left them to furnish the fuel of a dire
conflagration.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Their obstinate incredulity
betrays itself in their disregard of the penalty denounced against such
transgression. But they at length learned by experience that God had not
threatened in vain, that those nations whom they had wickedly
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f3
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">spared, would prove to them thorns and
stings. For they were harassed by constant incursions, pillaged by rapine, and
at length almost oppressed by tyrannical violence. In short, it was not owing to
any merit of theirs that the truth of God did not utterly fail.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f4</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">On
this point, indeed, a question may be raised: for if the promise given to
Abraham was founded on the mere good pleasure of God,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f5
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">then, be the character of the people what it
might, it is absurd to say that it could be defeated by their fault. How are we
to reconcile the two things, &#8212; that the people did not obtain the full and
complete inheritance promised to them, and that yet God was true? I answer, that
so far was the faithfulness of God
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f6
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">from being overthrown, or shaken, or in any
way impaired, that we here perceive more clearly how wonderful are His workings,
who, in unsearchable wisdom, knows how to bring light out of
darkness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It had been said to Abraham,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011518&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
15:18) To thy seed will I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great
river Euphrates. Joshua affirms that the event drew near, and was actually at
hand. But the Israelites, overcome by sloth, do not reach those boundaries; nay,
in settling down of their own accord within narrow limits, they in a manner
oppose barriers to the divine liberality. In this way the covenant of God seemed
to suffer a kind of eclipse.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And there is no
doubt that pious minds were often filled with anxiety when they saw His work cut
short. But the punishment inflicted on the people for their wickedness was so
tempered, that what might otherwise have been a grievous and perilous trial of
faith, was converted into a powerful support. The apparent failure reminded the
children of God that they were to look forward to a more excellent state, where
the divine favor would be more clearly displayed, nay, would be freed from every
obstruction, and shine forth in full splendor. Hence their thoughts were raised
to Christ, and it was made known to them that the complete felicity of the
Church depended on its Head. In arriving at this conclusion, they were assisted
by new prophecies. For the rehearsal which Joshua here makes of the ancient
covenant is applied in the Psalms (Psalms 72 and 89) to the Messiah's reign,
unto which time, the Lord had, for the purpose of rendering it more glorious,
deferred the full fruition of the promised land. The same thing was exemplified
in David, who bore a typical resemblance to Christ, and in whom it was shown
that the divine promises were only established and confirmed in the hand of a
Mediator.</font><br><font face="Palatino">No longer, therefore, does it seem
strange that the result promised, after being retarded by the wickedness of the
people, was not, fully accomplished till the state of the Church was rightly
arranged, seeing that in the person of David the image of the Mediator, on whom
the perfect the moderate foretaste which believers received of the divine favor,
must have sufficed to sustain
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f7
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">them, preparatory to the more complete
realization.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Nor, indeed, was the partition made
by Joshua and the heads of the tribes, to whom that duty was intrusted, elusory
or fallacious; but the inheritance, in possession of which God had placed them
by His own hand, was truly and distinctly divided by His orders. In this
respect, too, the sacred observance of the covenant made with Abraham was
conspicuous. Jacob, when about to die, had destined certain settlements to some
of his children. Had each tribe received its portion simply by the determination
and suffrages of men, it might have been thought that they had merely followed
the directions of the Patriarch. But when the lot, than which nothing is deemed
more fortuitous, confirmed the prophecy, the stability of the donation
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f8
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">was as clearly ratified as if God had visibly
appeared. Accordingly, after the sluggishness of the people put an end to the
war, Joshua sent back the tribes of Reuben and Gad, with the half tribe of
Manasseh, as if their period of service had
expired.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Next follows a remarkable narrative,
clearly showing how zealous the Israelites who dwelt in the land of Canaan were
to maintain the pure worship of God. For when these two tribes and half tribe
had erected a monument of fraternal alliance, the others, thinking that it was
an altar intended for sacrifice, and consequently an abomination, immediately
determine to declare war, and prepare sooner to destroy their kindred
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f9
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">than allow religion to be torn asunder by a
bastard worship. At the same time they are commended for their moderation, in
being so easily appeased on obtaining satisfaction, after a sacred zeal had
suddenly roused them to arms.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the end of the
book it is shown how anxious Joshua was to advance the glory of God,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f10</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and how diligently he endeavored to obviate the fickleness and treachery of the
people. With this view, not only the most impressive exhortations, but
protestations, were employed, and more especially the covenant was renewed in
regular form with the solemnity of an oath.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now,
after</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Here, first, we see the
steadfastness of God in watching over his people, and providing for their
safety. The sanction given to Joshua's appointment, as new leader by a renewed
commission,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f13</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
was intended to indicate the continuance of his favor, and prevent the people
from thinking themselves forsaken in consequence of the death of Moses. Joshua,
indeed, had already been chosen to rule the people; and not only invested with
the office, but also endowed with spiritual gifts. But as the most valiant,
however well provided, are apt to halt or waver when the period for action
arrives, the exhortation to Joshua to make ready forthwith for the expedition
was by no means superfluous. Still, however, the call thus formally given was
not so much on his own account, as to inspire the people with full confidence<i>
</i>in following a leader whom they saw advancing step by step in the path
divinely marked out for him.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f14</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Moses my
servant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc A twofold meaning may be
extracted &#8212; the one, since Moses is dead, the whole burden has now
devolved upon thee, take the place of him to whom thou has been appointed
successor; the other, although Moses is dead, do not desist, but go forward. I
prefer the former, as containing the inference that he should, by right of
succession, take up the office which Moses had left
vacant.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f15</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The epithet or surname of <i>servant
</i>applied to Moses, has respect to his government of the people and his
exploits; for it ought to be accommodated to actual
circumstances.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f16</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The allusion here is not to the Law but
to the leadership, which had passed to Joshua by the decease of Moses, and God
thus acknowledges his servant, not so much with the view of praising him, as of
strengthening the authority of Joshua, who had been substituted in his place.
And as the people might not have acquiesced sufficiently in a bare command, he
promises, while ordering them to pass the Jordan, to give them peaceable
possession of the whole country, and of every spot of it on which they should
plant their foot. For as nothing tends more than distrust to make us sluggish
and useless, so when God holds forth a happy issue, confidence inspires us with
rigor for any attempt.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It may be added, that he
does now begin for the first time to give them good hopes, by making a promise
of which they had not previously heard, but recalls to their remembrance<i>
</i>what Moses had formerly testified. He says, therefore, that the time had now
come for exhibiting and performing that which he had promised to Moses. Should
any one object that the same thing had been said to Abraham long before Moses
was born, nay, that the perpetual covenant deposited with Abraham included
everything which was heard by Moses four hundred years
after;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f17</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I answer, that here no notice is taken of
the ancient promise which was everywhere known and celebrated, and that Moses is
produced as a witness whose memory was more recent,<i> </i>and by whose death
the confidence<i> </i>of the people might have been<i> </i>shaken, had not God
declared that the accomplishment of all which he had said was at
hand.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the wilderness and this
Lebanon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc How the truth and
fulfillment of this promise surmounted all the obstacles interposed by the
wickedness of the people, though they did not obtain immediate possession of the
whole territory, I have explained in the Argument. For although God had unfolded
the inestimable treasures of his beneficence by constituting them lords of the
country, it did not follow that their misconduct was not to be chastised. Nay,
there behooved to be a fulfillment of the threatening which Moses had denounced,
viz., that if the nations doomed to destruction were not destroyed, they would
prove thorns and stings in their eyes and sides. But as the promise was by no
means broken or rendered void by the delay of forty years, during which they
were led wandering through the desert, so the entire possession, though long
suspended, proved the faithfulness of the decree by which it had been
adjudged.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The people had it in their power to
obtain possession of the prescribed boundaries in due time; they declined to do
so. For this they deserved to have been expelled
altogether.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f18</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But the divine indulgence granted them an
extent of territory sufficient for their commodious habitation; and although it
had been foretold that, in just punishment, the residue of the nations whom they
spared would prove pernicious to them, still, they suffered no molestation,
unless when they provoked the Divine anger by their perfidy and almost continual
defection: for as often as their affairs became prosperous, they turned aside to
wantonness. Still, owing to the wonderful goodness of God, when oppressed by the
violence of the enemy, and, as it were, thrust down to the grave, they continued
to live in death; and not only so, but every now and then deliverers arose, and,
contrary to all hope, retrieved them from
ruin.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

Sea</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>means the Mediterranean, and to it
the land of the Hittites forms the opposite boundary; in the same way Lebanon is
opposed to the Euphrates; but it must be observed that under Lebanon the desert
is comprehended, as appears from another
passage.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall not any
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc As a contest was about to be
waged with numerous and warlike enemies, it was necessary thus to inspire Joshua
with special confidence. But for this, the promise of delivering over the land
which God had given, would ever and anon have become darkened; for how vast the
enterprise to overthrow so many nations! This objection therefore is removed.
And the better to free him from all doubt, he is reminded of the victories of
Moses, by which God had made it manifest that nothing was easier for him than
utterly to discomfit any host however great and powerful. Joshua, therefore, is
ordered to behold in the assistance given to Moses the future issue of the wars
which he was to undertake under the same guidance and protection. For the series
of favors is continued without interruption to the
successor.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What follows is to the same effect,
though it is more fully expressed by the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will not fail
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Hence the Apostle,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
13:5,) when wishing to draw off believers from avarice, makes an application of
these words for the purpose of calming down all anxieties, and suppressing all
excessive fears. And in fact, the distrust which arises from anxiety kindles in
us such tumultuous feelings that on the least appearance of danger, we turmoil
and miserably torment ourselves until we feel assured that God both will be with
us and more than suffice for our protection. And, indeed, while he prescribes no
other cure for our timidity, he reminds us that we ought to be satisfied with
his present aid.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be
strong</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc An exhortation to fortitude
is added, and indeed repeated, that it may make the deeper impression. At the
same time the promise is introduced in different words, in which Joshua is
assured of his divine call, that he might have no hesitation in undertaking the
office which had been divinely committed to him, nor begin to waver midway on
being obliged to contend with obstacles. It would not have been enough for him
diligently to begirt himself at the outset without being well prepared to
persevere in the struggle.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Although it is the
property of faith to animate us to strenuous exertion, in the same way as
unbelief manifests itself by cowardice or cessation of effort, still we may
infer from this passage, that bare promises are not sufficiently energetic
without the additional stimulus of exhortation. For if Joshua, who was always
remarkable for alacrity, required to be incited to the performance of duty, how
much more necessary must it be that we who labor under so much sluggishness
should be spurred forward.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We may add, that not
once only or by one single expression are strength and constancy required of
Joshua, but he is confirmed repeatedly and in various terms, because he was to
be engaged in many and various contests. He is told to be of strong and
invincible courage. Although these two epithets make it obvious that God was
giving commandment concerning a most serious matter, still not contented with
this reduplication, he immediately after repeats the sentence, and even
amplifies it by the addition of the adverb
<i>very.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino">From this passage, therefore, let
us learn that we can never be fit for executing difficult and arduous matters
unless we exert our utmost endeavors, both because our abilities are weak, and
Satan rudely assails us, and there is nothing we are more inclined to than to
relax our efforts.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f21</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But, as many exert their strength to no
purpose in making erroneous or desultory attempts, it is added as a true source
of fortitude that Joshua shall make it his constant study to observe the Law. By
this we are taught that the only way in which we can become truly invincible is
by striving to yield a faithful obedience to God. Otherwise it were better to
lie indolent, and effeminate than to be hurried on by headlong
audacity.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moreover, God would not only have his
servant to be strong in keeping the Law, but enjoins him to contend manfully, so
as not to faint under the burden of his laborious office. But as he might become
involved in doubt as to the mode of disentangling himself in matters of
perplexity, or as to the course which he ought to adopt, he refers him to the
teaching of the Law, because by following it as a guide he will be sufficiently
fitted for all things. He says, You shall act prudently in all things, provided
you make the Law your master; although the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lk&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
means to act not only <i>prudently </i>but <i>successfully, </i>because temerity
usually pays the penalty of failure.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Be this as
it may, by submitting entirely to the teaching of the Law he is more surely
animated to hope for divine assistance. For it is of great consequence, when our
fears are excited by impending dangers, to feel assured that we have the
approbation of God in whatever we do, inasmuch as we have no other object in
view than to obey his commands. Moreover, as it would not be enough to obey God
in any kind of way,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f22</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Joshua is exhorted to practice a modesty
and sobriety which may keep him within the bounds of a simple
obedience.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Many, while possessed of right
intention, sometimes imagine themselves to be wiser than they ought, and hence
either overlook many things through carelessness, or mix up their own counsels
with the divine commands. The general prohibition, therefore, contained in the
Law, forbidding all men to add to it or detract from it, God now specially
enforces on Joshua. For if private individuals in forming their plan of life
behoove to submit themselves to God, much more necessary must this be for those
who hold rule among the people. But if this great man needed this curb of
modesty that he might not overstep his limits, how intolerable the audacity if
we, who fall so far short of him, arrogate to ourselves greater license? More
especially, however, did God prescribe the rule of his servant, in order that
those who excel in honor might know that they are as much bound to obey it as
the meanest of the people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This book of the
Law</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Assiduous meditation on the Law
is also commanded; because, whenever it is intermitted, even for a short time,
many errors readily creep in, and the memory becomes rusted, so that many, after
ceasing from the continuous study of it, engage in practical business, as if
they were mere ignorant tyros. God therefore enjoins his servant to make daily
progress, and never cease, during the whole course of his life, to profit in the
Law. Hence it follows that those who hold this study in disdain, are blinded by
intolerable arrogance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But why does he forbid
him to allow the Law to depart from his mouth rather than from his eyes? Some
interpreters understand that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is here used by synecdoche for<i> face; </i>but this is frigid. I have no
doubt that the word used is peculiarly applicable to a person who was bound to
prosecute the study in question, not only for himself individually, but for the
whole people placed under his rule. He is enjoined, therefore, to attend to the
teaching of the Law, that in accordance with the office committed to him, he may
bring forward what he has learned for the common benefit of the people. At the
same time he is ordered to make his own docility a pattern of obedience to
others. For many, by talking and discoursing, have the Law in their mouth, but
are very bad keepers of it. Both things, therefore, are commanded, that by
teaching others, he may make his own conduct and whole character conformable to
the same rule.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What follows in the second clause
of the verse shows, that, everything which profane men endeavor to accomplish in
contempt of the word of God, must ultimately fail of success, and that however
prosperous the commencement may sometimes seem to be, the issue will be
disastrous; because prosperous results can be hoped for only from the divine
favor, which is justly withheld from counsels rashly adopted, and from all
arrogance of which contempt of God himself is the usual accompaniment. Let
believers, therefore, in order that their affairs may turn out as they wish,
conciliate the divine blessing alike by diligence in learning and by fidelity in
obeying.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the end of the verse, because the
term used is ambiguous, as I have already observed, the sentence is repeated, or
a second promise is added. The latter is the view I take. For it was most
suitable, that after the promised success, Joshua should be reminded that men
never act skillfully and regularly except in so far as they allow themselves to
be ruled by the word of God. Accordingly, the prudence which believers learn
from the word of God, is opposed to the confidence of those who deem their own
sense sufficient to guide them
aright.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

simple affirmation is often made in the form of a question, and this phraseology
is of very frequent occurrence, here, however, the question is emphatic, to give
an attestation to what had previously been taught, while the Lord, by bringing
his own authority distinctly forward, relieves his servant from care and
hesitancy. He asks, Is it not I who have commanded thee? I too will be present

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Joshua
commanded</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f25
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">etc It may be doubted whether or not this
proclamation was made after the spies were sent, and of course on their return.
And certainly I think it not only probable, but I am fully convinced that it was
only after their report furnished him with the knowledge he required, that he
resolved to move his camp. It would have been preposterous haste to hurry on an
unknown path, while he considered it expedient to be informed on many points
before setting foot on a hostile territory. Nor is there anything novel in
neglecting the order of time, and afterwards interweaving what had been omitted.
The second chapter must therefore be regarded as a kind of interposed
parenthesis, explaining to the reader more fully what had happened, when Joshua
at length commanded the people to collect their
vessels.</font><br><font face="Palatino">After all necessary matters had been
ascertained, he saw it was high time to proceed, and issued a proclamation,
ordering the people to make ready for the campaign. With the utmost confidence
he declares that they will pass the Jordan after the lapse of three days: this
he never would have ventured to do, without the suggestion of the Spirit. No one
had attempted the ford, nor did there seem to be any hope that it could be
done.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f26</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There was no means of crossing either by
a bridge or by boats: and nothing could be easier for the enemy than to prevent
the passage. The only thing, therefore, that remained was for God to transport
them miraculously. This Joshua hoped for not at random, nor at his own hand, but
as a matter which had been divinely revealed. The faith of the people also was
conspicuous in the promptitude of their obedience: for, in the view of the great
difficulties which presented themselves, they never would have complied so
readily had they not cast their care upon God. It cannot be doubted that He
inspired their minds with this alacrity, in order to remove all the obstacles
which might delay the fulfillment of the
promise.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And to the
Reubenites</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc An inheritance had been
granted them beyond the Jordan, on the condition that they should continue to
perform military service with their brethren in expelling the nations of Canaan.
Joshua therefore now exhorts them to fulfil their promise, to leave their wives,
their children, and all their effects behind, to cross the Jordan, and not
desist from carrying on the war till they had placed their brethren in peaceable
possession. In urging them so to act, he employs two arguments, the one drawn
from authority and the other from equity. He therefore reminds them of the
command given them by Moses, from whose decision it was not lawful to deviate,
since it was well known to all that he uttered nothing of himself, but only what
God had dictated by his mouth. At the same time, without actually asserting,
Joshua indirectly insinuates, that they are bound, by compact, inasmuch as they
had engaged to act in this
manner.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f27</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He next moves them by motives of equity,
that there might be no inequality in the condition of those to whom the same
inheritance had been destined in common. It would be very incongruous, he says,
that your brethren should be incurring danger, or, at least, toiling in carrying
on war, and that you should be enjoying all the comforts of a peaceful
settlement.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he orders them to precede or
pass before, the meaning is, not that they were to be the first to enter into
conflict with the enemy, and in all emergencies which might befall them, were to
bear more than their own share of the burden; he only in this way urges them to
move with alacrity, as it would have been a kind of tergiversation to keep in
the rear and follow slowly in the track of others. The
expression</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, pass before your
brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>therefore, does not mean to
stand in the front of the battle, but simply to observe their ranks, and thereby
give proof of ready zeal. For it is certain that as they were arranged in four
divisions they advanced in the same order. As he calls them men of war, we may
infer, as will elsewhere more clearly appear, that the aged, and others not
robust, were permitted to remain at home in charge of the common welfare, or
altogether relieved from public duty, if in any way disabled from performing
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they
answered</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc They not only acquiesce,
but freely admit and explicitly detail the obedience which they owe. Our
obligations are duly discharged only when we perform them cheerfully, and not in
sadness, as Paul expresses it.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 9:7.) If it is objected that there is little modesty in their boast
of having been obedient to Moses whom they had often contradicted, I answer,
that though they did not always follow with becoming ardor, yet they were so
much disposed to obey, that their moderation was not only tolerable, but worthy
of the highest praise, when it is considered how proudly their fathers rebelled,
and how perversely they endeavored to shake off a yoke divinely imposed upon
them. For the persons who speak here were not those rebellious spirits of whom
God complains
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;199508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
95:8-11) that he was provoked by them, but persons who, subdued by the examples
of punishment, had learned quietly to
submit.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f28</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">Indeed, it is not so much to herald
their own virtues as to extol the authority of Joshua, when they declare that
they will regard him in the same light in which they regarded Moses. The
groundwork of their confidence is at the same time expressed in their wish or
prayer, that God may be present to assist his servant Joshua as he assisted his
servant Moses. They intimate that they will be ready to war under the auspices
of their new leader, because they are persuaded that he is armed with the power
and hope that he will be victorious by the assistance of God, as they had
learned by experience how wonderfully God assisted them by the hand of Moses. We
may infer, moreover, that they actually felt this confidence, both because they
call to mind their experiences of God's favor to animate themselves, and because
they regard Joshua as the successor of Moses in regard to prosperous
results.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The epithet
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy
God</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f29</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is not without weight, as it

also is intermediate between the confidence of faith and
prayer.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f30</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Accordingly, while they intimate that
they cherish good hope in their minds, they at the same time have recourse to
prayer, under a conviction of the arduousness of the work. Immediately after,
when they of their own accord exhort him to constancy, they show that they are
ready to follow and to imitate him in his confidence. Here, it is to be
observed, that though Joshua was a model of courage, and animated all, both by
deed and precept, he was in his turn stimulated onwards, that his own alacrity
might be more effectual in arousing that of the people.</font><br></div>

And Joshua the son of Nun sent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. The
object of the exploration now in question was different from the former one,
when Joshua was sent with other eleven to survey all the districts of the land,
and bring back information to the whole people concerning its position, nature,
fertility, and other properties, the magnitude and number of the cities, the
inhabitants, and their manners. The present object was to dispose those who
might be inclined to be sluggish, to engage with more alacrity in the campaign.
And though it appears from the first chapter of Deuteronomy,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050122&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
1:22,) that Moses, at the request of the people, sent chosen men to spy out the
land, he elsewhere relates
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;041304&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
13:4) that he did it by command from God. Those twelve, therefore, set out
divinely commissioned, and for a somewhat different purpose, viz., to make a
thorough survey of the land, and be the heralds of its excellence to stir up the
courage of the people.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now Joshua secretly sends
two persons to ascertain whether or not a free passage may be had over the
Jordan, whether the citizens of Jericho were indulging in security, or whether
they were alert and prepared to resist. In short, he sends spies on whose report
he may provide against all dangers. Wherefore a twofold question may be here
raised &#8212; Are we to approve of his prudence? or are we to condemn him for
excessive anxiety, especially as he seems to have trusted more than was right to
his own prudence, when, without consulting God, he was so careful in taking
precautions against danger? But, inasmuch as it is not expressly said that he
received a message from heaven to order the people to collect their vessels and
to publish his proclamation concerning the passage of the Jordan, although it is
perfectly obvious that he never would have thought of moving the camp unless God
had ordered it, it is also probable that in sending the spies he consulted God
as to his pleasure in the matter, or that God himself, knowing how much need
there was of this additional confirmation, had spontaneously suggested it to the
mind of his servant. Be this as it may, while Joshua commands his messengers to
spy out Jericho, he is preparing to besiege it, and accordingly is desirous to
ascertain in what direction it may be most easily and safely
approached.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They came into a
harlot's house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. Why some try to
avoid the name
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>harlot</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and interpret
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnwz</font><font face="Palatino">
as meaning <i>one who keeps an inn, </i>I see not, unless it be that they think
it disgraceful to be the guests of a courtesan, or wish to wipe off a stigma
from a woman who not only received the messengers kindly, but secured their
safety by singular courage and prudence. It is indeed a regular practice with
the Rabbins, when they would consult for the honor of their nation,
presumptuously to wrest Scripture and give a different turn by their fictions to
anything that seems not quite
reputable.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But the probability is, that while the
messengers were courting secrecy, and shunning observation and all places of
public intercourse, they came to a woman who dwelt in a retired spot. Her house
was contiguous to the wall of the city, nay, its outer side was actually
situated in the wall. From this we may infer that it was some obscure corner
remote from the public thoroughfare; just as persons of her description usually
live in narrow lanes and secret places. It cannot be supposed with any
consistency to have been a common inn which was open to all indiscriminately,
because they could not have felt at liberty to indulge in familiar intercourse,
and it must have been difficult in such circumstances to obtain
concealment.</font><br><font face="Palatino">My conclusion therefore is, that
they obtained admission privily, and immediately betook themselves to a
hiding-place. Moreover, in the fact that a woman who had gained a shameful
livelihood by prostitution was shortly after admitted into the body of the
chosen people, and became a member of the Church, we are furnished with a
striking display of divine grace which could thus penetrate into a place of
shame, and draw forth from it not only Rahab, but her father and the other
members of her family. Most assuredly while the term
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnwz</font><font face="Palatino">,
almost invariably means <i>harlot, </i>there is nothing here to oblige us to
depart from the received meaning.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it was told the
king</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. It is probable that watchmen
had been appointed to take notice of suspicious strangers, as is wont to be done
in doubtful emergencies, or during an apprehension of war. The Israelites were
nigh at hand; they had openly declared to the Edomites and Moabites that they
were seeking a settlement in the land of Canaan; they were formidable for their
number; they had already made a large conquest after slaying two neighboring
kings; and as we shall shortly perceive, their famous passage of the Red Sea had
been noised abroad. It would therefore have argued extreme supineness in such
manifest danger to allow any strangers whatever to pass freely through the city
of Jericho, situated as it was on the
frontiers.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is not wonderful, therefore, that
men who were unknown and who appeared from many circumstances to have come with
a hostile intention, were denounced to the king. At the same time, however, we
may infer that they were supernaturally blinded in not guarding their gates more
carefully; for with the use of moderate diligence the messengers after they had
once entered might easily have been detained. Nay, a search ought forthwith to
have been instituted, and thus they would to a certainty have been caught. The
citizens of Jericho were in such trepidation and so struck with judicial
amazement, that they acted in everything without method or counsel. Meanwhile
the two messengers were reduced to such extremities that they seemed on the eve
of being delivered up to punishment. The king sends for them; they are lurking
in the house; their life hangs upon the tongue of a woman, just as if it were
hanging by a thread. Some have thought that there was in this a punishment of
the distrust of Joshua, who ought to have boldly passed the Jordan, trusting to
the divine guidance. But the result would rather lead us to conclude
differently, that God by rescuing the messengers from extreme danger gave new
courage to the people; for in that manifestation of his power he plainly showed
that he was watching over their safety, and providing for their happy entrance
into the promised land.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the woman took the two
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. We may presume that before
Rahab was ordered to bring them forth the rumor of their arrival had been
spread, and that thus some little time had been given for concealing
them.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f34</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And indeed on receiving the king's
command, had not measures for concealment been well taken, there would have been
no room for denial; much less would she have dared to lie so coolly. But after
she had thus hidden her guests, as the search would have been difficult, she
comes boldly forward and escapes by a crafty
answer.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, the questions which here arise are,
first, Was treachery to her country excusable? Secondly, Could her lie be free
from fault? We know that the love of our country, which is as it were our common
mother, has been implanted in us by nature. When, therefore, Rahab knew that the
object intended was the overthrow of the city in which she had been born and
brought up, it seems a detestable act of inhumanity to give her aid and counsel
to the spies. It is a puerile evasion to say, that they were not yet avowed
enemies, inasmuch as war had not been declared; since it is plain enough that
they had conspired the destruction of her
fellow-citizens.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f35</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It was therefore only the knowledge
communicated to her mind by God which exempted her from fault, as having been
set free from the common rule. Her faith is commended by two Apostles, who at
the same time declare,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581131&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:31;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;590225&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
2:25,) that the service which she rendered to the spies was acceptable to
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is not wonderful, then, that when the
Lord condescended to transfer a foreign female to his people, and to engraft her
into the body of the Church, he separated her from a profane and accursed
nation. Therefore, although she had been bound to her countrymen up to that very
day, yet when she was adopted into the body of the Church, her new condition was
a kind of manumission from the common law by which citizens are bound toward
each other. In short, in order to pass by faith to a new people, she behooved to
renounce her countrymen. And as in this she only acquiesced in the judgment of
God, there was no criminality in abandoning
them.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f36</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">As to the falsehood, we must admit
that though it was done for a good purpose, it was not free from fault. For
those who hold what is called a dutiful
lie</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f37</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to be altogether excusable, do not
sufficiently consider how precious truth is in the sight of God. Therefore,
although our purpose, be to assist our brethren, to consult for their safety and
relieve them, it never can be lawful to lie, because that cannot be right which
is contrary to the nature of God. And God is truth. And still the act of Rahab
is not devoid of the praise of virtue, although it was not spotlessly pure. For
it often happens that while the saints study to hold the right path, they
deviate into circuitous courses.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Rebecca
(Genesis 27.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f37a</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) in procuring the blessing to her son
Jacob, follows the prediction. In obedience of this description a pious and
praiseworthy zeal is perceived. But it cannot be doubted that in substituting
her son Jacob in the place of Esau, she deviated from the path of duty. The
crafty proceeding, therefore, so far taints an act which was laudable in itself.
And yet the particular fault does not wholly deprive the deed of the merit of
holy zeal; for by the kindness of God the fault is suppressed and not taken into
account. Rahab also does wrong when she falsely declares that the messengers
were gone, and yet the principal action was agreeable to God, because the bad
mixed up with the good was not imputed. On the whole, it was the will of God
that the spies should be delivered, but he did not approve of saving their life
by falsehood.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the men
pursued</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. Their great<i>
</i>credulity shows that God had blinded them. Although Rahab had gained much by
deluding them, a new course of anxiety intervenes; for the gates being shut, the
city like a prison excluded the hope of escape. They were therefore again
aroused by a serious trial to call upon God. For seeing that this history was
written on their report, it is impossible they could have been ignorant of what
was then going on, especially as God, for the purpose of magnifying his grace,
purposely exposed them to a succession of dangers. And now when they were
informed that search was made for them, we infer from the fact of their being
still awake, that they were in anxiety and alarm. Their trepidation must have
been in no small degree increased when it was told them that their exit was
precluded.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It appears, however, that Rahab was
not at all dismayed, since she bargains with so much presence of mind, and so
calmly, for her own safety and that of her family. And in this composure and
firmness her faith, which is elsewhere commended, appears conspicuous. For on
human principles she never would have braved the fury of the king and people,
and become a suppliant to guests half dead with terror. Many, indeed, think
there is something ridiculous in the eulogium bestowed upon her both by St.
James and the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;590225&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
2:25;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581131&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:31,) when they place her in the catalogue of the faithful. But any one who
will carefully weigh all the circumstances will easily perceive that she was
endowed with a lively faith.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><i>First, </i>If
the tree is known by its fruits, we here see no ordinary effects, which are just
so many evidences of faith. <i>Secondly, </i>A principle of piety must have
given origin to her conviction that the neighboring nations were already in a
manner vanquished and laid prostrate, since terror sent from above had filled
all minds with dismay. It is true that in profane writers also we meet with
similar expressions, which God has extorted from them that he might assert his
power to rule and turn the hearts of men in whatever way he pleases. But while
these writers prate like parrots, Rahab declaring in sincerity of heart that God
has destined the land for the children of Israel, because all the inhabitants
have fainted away before them, claims for him a supreme rule over the hearts of
men, a rule which the pride of the world
denies.</font><br><font face="Palatino">For although the experience of all times
has shown that more armies have fallen or been routed by sudden and un-looked
for terror than by the force and prowess of the enemy, the impression of this
truth has forthwith vanished away, and hence conquerors have always extolled
their own valor, and on any prosperous result gloried in their own exertions and
talents for war. They have felt, I admit, that daring and courage are
occasionally bestowed or withheld by some extraneous cause, and accordingly men
confess that in war fortune does much or even reigns supreme. Hence their common
proverb with regard to panic terrors, and their vows made as well to Pavor
<i>(Dread) </i>as to Jupiter
Stator.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f38</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But it never became a serious and
deep-seated impression in their minds, that every man is brave according as God
has inspired him with present courage, or cowardly according as he has
suppressed his daring. Rahab, however, recognizes the operation of a divine hand
in striking the nations of Canaan with dismay, and thus making them as it were
by anticipation pronounce their own doom; and she infers that the terror which
the children of Israel have inspired is a presage of victory, because they fight
under God as their Leader.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the fact, that
while the courage of all had thus melted away, they however prepared to resist
with the obstinacy of despair; we see that when the wicked are broken and
crushed by the hand of God, they are not so subdued as to receive the yoke, but
in their terror and anxiety become incapable of being tamed. Here, too, we have
to observe how in a common fear believers differ from unbelievers, and how the
faith of Rahab displays itself. She herself was afraid like any other of the
people; but when she reflects that she has to do with God, she concludes that
her only remedy is to eschew evil by yielding humbly and placidly, as resistance
would be altogether unavailing. But what is the course taken by all the wretched
inhabitants of the country? Although terror-struck, so far is their perverseness
from being overcome that they stimulate each other to the
conflict.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For we have heard
how</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. She mentions, as the special
cause of consternation, that the wide-spread rumor of miracles, hitherto without
example, had impressed it on the minds of all that God was warring for the
Israelites. For it was impossible to doubt that the way through the Red Sea had
been miraculously opened up, as the water would never have changed its nature
and become piled up in solid heaps, had not God, the author of nature, so
ordered. The transmutation of the element, therefore, plainly showed that God
was on the side of the people, to whom he had given a dry passage through the
depths of the sea.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The signal victories also
gained over Og and Bashan, were justly regarded as testimonies of the divine
favor towards the Israelites. This latter conclusion, indeed, rested only on
conjecture, whereas the passage of the sea was a full and irrefragable proof, as
much so as if God had stretched forth his hand from heaven. All minds,
therefore, were seized with a conviction that in the expedition of the
Israelitish people God was principal
leader;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f39</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> hence their terror and consternation. At
the same time, it is probable that they were deceived by some vain imagination
that the God of Israel had proved superior in the contest to the gods of Egypt;
just as the poets feign that every god has taken<i> </i>some nation or other
under his protection, and wars with others, and that thus conflicts take place
among the gods themselves while they are protecting their
favorites.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But the faith of Rahab takes a higher
flight, while to the God of Israel alone she ascribes supreme power and
eternity. These are the true attributes of Jehovah. She does not dream,
according to the vulgar notion, that some one, out of a crowd of deities, is
giving his assistance to the Israelites, but she acknowledges<i> </i>that He
whose favor they were known to possess is the true and only God. We see, then,
how in a case where all received the same intelligence,<i> </i>she, in the
application of it, went far beyond her
countrymen.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord your God, he is
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. Here the image of Rahab's
faith appears, as if reflected in a mirror, when casting down all idols she
ascribes the government of heaven and earth to the God of Israel alone. For it
is perfectly clear that when heaven and earth are declared subject to the God of
Israel, there is a repudiation of all the pagan fictions by which the majesty,
and power, and glory of God are portioned out among different deities; and hence
we see that it is not without cause that two Apostles have honored Rahab's
conduct with the title of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>This is sneered at by some proud and disdainful men, but I wish they would
consider what it is to distinguish the one true God from all fictitious deities,
and at the same time so to extol his power as to declare that the whole world is
governed at his pleasure. Rahab does not speak hesitatingly, but declares, in
absolute terms, that whatever power exists resides in the God of Israel alone,
that he commands all the elements, that he orders all things above and below,
and determines human affairs. Still I deny not that her faith was not fully
developed, nay, I readily admit, that it was only a germ of piety which, as yet,
would have been insufficient for her eternal salvation. We must hold,
nevertheless, that however feeble and slender the knowledge of God which the
woman possessed may have been, still in surrendering herself to his power, she
gives a proof of her election, and that from that seed a faith was germinating
which afterwards attained its full
growth.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now, therefore, I pray you,
swear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. It is another manifestation
of faith that she places the sons of Abraham in sure possession of the land of
Canaan, founding on no other argument than her having heard that it was divinely
promised to them. For she did not suppose that God was favoring lawless
intruders who were forcing their way into the territories of others with unjust
violence and uncurbed licentiousness, but rather concluded that they were coming
into the land of Canaan, because God had assigned them the dominion of it. It
cannot be believed that when they sought a passage from the Edomites and others,
they said nothing as to whither they were going. Nay, those nations were
acquainted with the promise which was made to Abraham, and the memory of which
had been again renewed by the rejection of
Esau.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moreover, in the language of Rahab, we
behold that characteristic property of faith described by the author of the
Epistle to the Hebrews, when he calls it a vision, or sight of things not
appearing.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:1) Rahab is dwelling with her people in a fortified city: and yet she commits
her life to her terrified guests, just as if they had already gained possession
of the land, and had full power to save or destroy as they pleased. This
voluntary surrender was, in fact, the very same as embracing the promise of God,
and casting herself on his protection. She, moreover, exacts an oath, because
often, in the storming of cities, the heat and tumult of the struggle shook off
the remembrance of duty. In the same way she mentions the kindness she had shown
to them, that gratitude might stimulate them the more to perform their promise.
For although the obligation of the oath ought of itself to have been effectual,
it would have been doubly base and inhumane not to show gratitude to a hostess
to whom they owed deliverance. Rahab shows the kindliness of her disposition, in
her anxiety about her parents and kindred. This is, indeed, natural; but many
are so devoted to themselves, that children hesitate not to ransom their own
lives by the death of their parents, instead of exerting courage and zeal to
save them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Our life for
yours</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. They imprecate death upon
themselves, if they do not faithfully make it their business to save Rahab. For
the interpretation adopted by some, We will pledge our lives, seems far-fetched,
or too restricted, since their intention was simply to bind themselves before
God. They constitute themselves, therefore, a kind of expiatory victims, if any
evil befalls Rahab through their negligence. The expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for
yours</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>ought, doubtless, to be extended
to the parents, brothers, and sisters. They therefore render their own lives
liable in such a sense, that blood may be required of them, if the family of
Rahab do not remain safe. And herein consists the sanctity of an oath, that
though its violation may escape with impunity, so far as men are concerned, yet
God having been interposed as a witness, will take account of the perfidy. In
Hebrew, to do mercy and truth, is equivalent to performing the office of
humanity faithfully, sincerely, and firmly.</font><br><font face="Palatino">A
condition, however, is inserted, &#8212; provided Rahab do not divulge what they
have said. This was inserted, not on account of distrust, as is usually
expounded, but only to put Rahab more upon her guard, on her own account. The
warning, therefore, was given in good faith, and flowed from pure good will: for
there was a danger that Rahab might betray herself by a disclosure. In one word,
they show how important it is that the matter should remain, as it were, buried,
lest the woman, by inconsiderately talking of the compact, might expose herself
to capital punishment. In this they show that they were sincerely anxious for
her safety, since they thus early caution her against doing anything which might
put it out of their power to render her a service. In further distinctly
stipulating, that no one should go out of the house, or otherwise they should be
held blameless, we may draw the important inference, that in making oaths
soberness should be carefully attended to, that we may not profane the name of
God by making futile promises on any
subject.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The advice of Rahab, to turn aside into
the mountain, and there remain quiet for three days, shows that there is no
repugnance between faith and the precautions which provide against manifest
dangers. There is no doubt that the messengers crept off to the mountain in
great fear, and yet that confidence which they had conceived, from the
remarkable interference of God in their behalf, directed their steps, and did
not allow them to lose their presence of
mind.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Some have raised the question, whether,
seeing it is criminal to overleap walls, it could be lawful to get out of the
city by a window? But it ought to be observed, <i>first, </i>that the walls of
cities were not everywhere sacred, because every city had not a Romulus, who
could make the overleaping a pretext for slaying his
brother;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f40</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and <i>secondly, </i>That law, as Cicero
reminds us, was to be tempered by equity, inasmuch as he who should climb a wall
for the purpose of repelling an enemy, would be more deserving of reward than
punishment. The end of the law is to make the citizens secure by the protection
of the walls. He, therefore, who should climb over the walls, neither from
contempt nor petulance, nor fraud, nor in a tumultuous manner, but under the
pressure of necessity, could not justly on that account be charged with a
capital offence. Should it be objected that the thing was of bad example, I
admit it; but when the object is to rescue one's life from injury, violence, or
robbery, provided it be done without offence or harm to any one, necessity
excuses it. It cannot be charged upon Paul as a crime, that when in danger of
his life at Damascus, he was let down by a basket, seeing he was divinely
permitted to escape, without tumult, from the violence and cruelty of wicked
men.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

And they said unto Joshua</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. This
passage shows that Joshua was not mistaken in selecting his spies; for their
language proves them to have been right-hearted men possessed of rare integrity.
Others, perhaps, not recovered from the terror into which they had once been
thrown, would have disturbed the whole camp, but these, while they reflect on
the wonderful kindness of God, displayed in their escape from danger, and the
happy issue of their expedition, exhort Joshua and the people to go boldly
forward. And although the mere promise of possessing the land ought to have been
sufficient, yet the Lord is so very indulgent to their weakness, that, for the
sake of removing all doubt, he confirms what he had promised by experience. That
the Lord had not spoken in vain, was proved by the consternation of the nations,
when it began already to put them to flight., and to drive them out, as if
hornets had been sent in upon them. For they argue in the same way as Rahab had
done, that the land was given to them, as the inhabitants had almost fainted
away from fear. I have therefore used the illative particle <i>for</i>, though
the literal meaning is, <i>and also. </i>But it is sufficiently plain, that in
the other way there is a confirmation of what they had said. And, indeed, the
courage of all melted away, as if they felt themselves routed by the hand of
God.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joshua rose
early</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc We must remember, as I
formerly explained, that Joshua did not move his camp till the day after the
spies had returned, but that after hearing their report, he gave orders by the
prefects that they should collect their vessels, as three days after they were
to cross the Jordan.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f42</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> His rising in the morning, therefore,
does not refer simply to their return, but rather to the issuing of his
proclamation. When the three days were completed, the prefects were again sent
through the camp to acquaint the people with the mode of passage. Although these
things are mentioned separately, it is easy to take up the thread of the
narrative. But before it was publicly intimated, by what means he was to open a
way for the people, the multitude spread out on the bank of the river were
exposed to some degree of confusion.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is true,
there were fords by which the Jordan could be passed. But the waters were then
swollen, and had overflowed, so that they might easily prevent even men
altogether without baggage from passing. There was therefore no hope, that women
and children, with the animals, and the rest of the baggage, could be
transported to the further bank. That, in such apparently desperate
circumstances, they calmly wait the issue, though doubtful, and to them
incomprehensible, is an example of faithful obedience, proving how unlike they
were to their fathers, who, on the slightest occasions, gave way to turbulence,
and inveighed against the Lord and against Moses. This change was not produced
without the special agency of the Holy
Spirit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass after
three days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc That is, three days
after their departure had been intimated. For they did not halt at the bank
longer than one night. But as the period of three days had previously been fixed
for crossing, and they had no hope of being able to accomplish it, Joshua now
exhorts them to pay no more regard to obstacles and difficulties, and to attend
to the power of God. For although the form of the miracle is not yet explained,
yet when the ark of the covenant is brought forward like a banner to guide the
way, it was natural to infer that the Lord was preparing something unusual. And
while they are kept in suspense, their faith is again proved by a serious trial;
for it was an example of rare virtue to give implicit obedience to the command,
and thus follow the ark, while they were obviously uninformed as to the result.
This, indeed, is the special characteristic of faith, not to inquire curiously
what the Lord is to do, nor to dispute subtlety as to how that which he declares
can possibly be done, but to cast all our anxious cares upon his providence, and
knowing that his power, on which we may rest, is boundless, to raise our
thoughts above the world, and embrace by faith that which we cannot comprehend
by reason.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet there shall be a
space</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc </i>As the younger Levites, whose
province it was to carry<i> </i>the ark,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;040415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
4:15) were strictly forbidden to touch it, or even to look at it, when
uncovered, it is not wonderful that the common people were not allowed to
approach within a considerable distance of it. The dignity of the ark,
therefore, is declared, when the people are ordered to attest their veneration
by leaving a long interval between themselves and it. And we know what happened
to Uzzah, (2 Samuel 6) when seeing it shaken by restive oxen, he with
inconsiderate zeal put forth his hand to support it. For although God invites us
familiarly to himself, yet faithful trust so far from begetting security and
boldness, is, on the contrary, always coupled with fear. In this way the ark of
the covenant was, indeed, a strong and pleasant pledge of the divine favor, but,
at the same time, had an awful majesty, well fitted to subdue carnal pride. This
humility and modesty, moreover, had the effect of exercising their faith by
preventing them from confining the grace of God within too narrow limits, and
reminding them, that though they were far distant from the ark, the divine power
was ever near.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the end of the verse it is
shown how necessary it was for them to be divinely guided by an unknown way;
that anxiety and fear might keep them under the protection of the
ark.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joshua
said</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Some unwonted manifestation of
divine power in bringing assistance behooved to be held forth, lest the
backwardness arising from hesitancy might produce delay; and yet, in order that
the Israelites might depend on the mere counsel of God, Joshua does not yet
plainly point out the special nature of the miracle, unless, indeed, we choose
to read what follows shortly after, as forming part of one context. Herein lies
the true test of faith, to lean so on the counsel of God, as not to keep
inquiring too anxiously concerning the mode of action or the event. As the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;dq</font><font face="Palatino">
means sometimes to <i>prepare, </i>and sometimes to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sanctify</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and either meaning is not inappropriate, I thought it best to leave a free
choice. For faith prepares us to perceive the operation of God; and in those
times, when God manifested himself to men more nearly, they consecrated
themselves by a solemn rite; thus we see how Moses, on the promulgation of the
Law, sanctified the people as God had commanded. The view taken by some
expositors, that the people were thus commanded to purge themselves from
defilement's, merely in order that nothing might impede the passage of the
Jordan, seems to be too confined.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joshua spoke unto the
priests</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc It is probable that the
priests were informed why God wished the ark to precede, that they might be more
ready to execute the command, for the whole people are immediately after made
acquainted with the intended division of the waters. As the prefects had
formerly published in the camp, that the people were to follow the ark of the
covenant, the priests could not possibly be ignorant as to the office which they
were to perform. For it had been distinctly declared that they were to be
leaders or standard-bearers. But when all were in readiness, Joshua publicly
unfolded the divine message which he had received. For it would have been
incongruous to make the divine favor more clearly manifest to the common people
than to them. It is added, however, immediately after, that the people were made
acquainted with the miracle.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I conclude,
therefore, that after the priests had for some time been kept in suspense, along
with the multitude, the Lord, on ascertaining the obedience of all, publicly
declared what he was to do. First, then, it is related that the priests were
enjoined by Joshua to bear the ark before the people; and secondly, lest any one
might think that he was making the attempt at random, or at his own hand,
mention is at the same time made of the promise with which he had been furnished
as a means of ensuring his command. But although it is not then distinctly said
that the course of the Jordan would be interrupted, yet, from the language which
Joshua used to the people, we may infer that the Lord spoke more in detail, and
explained more distinctly what he had determined to do. For Joshua did not
mention anything which he had not previously learned from the mouth of God
himself. Nay, before he makes any mention of the matter at all, he tells them to
hear the words of the Lord, and thus premises that he has the authority of God
for what he is about to say.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hereby you shall
know</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc He makes the power of the
miracle extend further than to the entrance of the land, and deservedly; for
merely to open up a passage into a hostile territory, from which there was
afterwards no retreat, would have been nothing else than exposure to death. For
either entangled among straits, and in an unknown region, they would easily have
been destroyed, or they would have perished, worn out by hunger and the absolute
want of all things. Joshua therefore declares before hand, that when God would
restore the river to its course, it would just be as if he were stretching forth
his hand to rout all the inhabitants of the land; and that the manifestation of
his power given in the passage of the Jordan, would be a sure presage of the
victory which they would obtain over all the
nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He says, Hence shall you know that the
Lord is present with you; to what end? Not only to plant your feet in the land
of Canaan, but also to give you full possession of it. For surely when mention
is made of the overthrow of the nations, an ultimate, free, and peaceful
possession is implied. Therefore, as the Lord by dividing the river clearly
showed that his power resided with the Israelites, so the people must on their
part have conceived hopes of perpetual assistance, as much as if they had
already seen their enemies worsted and lying prostrate before
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">For God does not abandon the work of his
hands midway, leaving it maimed and unfinished.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
138:8) When he leads his people unto the promised inheritance, he makes a dry
passage for them by cutting off the course of the Jordan. How perverse then
would it have been for the Israelites to stop short at that momentary act,
instead of feeling confident in all time to come, until quiet possession of the
land were actually obtained! Let us learn then from this example, prudently to
combine the different acts of divine goodness relating to our final salvation,
so that a happy commencement may cherish and keep alive in our minds the hope of
an equally happy termination.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When Joshua says
that the people will know the presence of God from the miracle, he indirectly
upbraids them with their distrust, as the mere promise of God ought to have
sufficed for a full assurance, and our faith, unless founded solely on this
promise, must be continually wavering. But although faith ought properly to
recline on the truth of God alone, it does not follow that experimental
knowledge may not act as a secondary support to its weakness, and give
subsidiary aid to its confirmation. For that which God promises to us in word he
seals by act, and as often as he exhibits to us manifestations of his grace and
might, he intends them to be so many confirmations of what he has spoken, and so
many helps tending to suppress all our
doubts.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold the ark of the
covenant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc First he says that the ark
of God will go before; and secondly, he explains for what purpose, namely, that
Jordan may retire from its place, trembling, so to speak, at the presence of the
Lord, as is said in the Psalms. (Psalm 114.) The narrative introduced concerning
the twelve men is parenthetical, as it only briefly alludes to what it will
afterwards deliver more fully and clearly. At present let us merely understand,
that while the ark went before, God displayed his power in guiding the people.
And in this way there was a confirmation of the sanctity of the worship
appointed by the Law, when the Israelites perceived that it was no empty symbol
of his presence that God had deposited with them. For Jordan was compelled to
yield obedience to God just as if it had beheld his
majesty.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Let us however remember, that the only
reason which induced the Lord to display his grace in the ark was because he had
placed the tables of his covenant within it. Moreover, as the thing could not be
easily credited, Joshua directs the mind of the people to the contemplation of
the divine power, which surmounts all difficulties. The title of Ruler of the
whole earth here applied to God is not insignificant, but extols his power above
all the elements of nature, in order that the Israelites, considering how seas
and rivers are subject to his dominion, might have no doubt that the waters,
though naturally liquid, would become stable in obedience to his
word.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Joshua

proceeding boldly beyond the bed into the water itself, was deserving of no mean
praise, since they might have been afraid of being instantly drowned. For what
could they expect on putting in their feet, but immediately to find a deep pool
in which they would be engulfed? In not being afraid on reaching the stream, and
in continuing to move firmly forward to the appointed place, they gave a
specimen of rare alacrity, founded on
confidence.</font><br><font face="Palatino">To the general danger was added the
special one, that the Jordan had then overflowed its banks, as it is wont to do
at the commencement of every summer. As the plain was covered, it was impossible
to observe the line of the banks or the ford, and the slime spread far and wide,
increased their fear and
anxiety.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f43</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> God was pleased that his people, and
especially the priests, should contend with these obstacles, in order that the
victory of their faith and constancy might be more illustrious. At the same
time, the difficulty thus presented tended to magnify the glory of the miracle
when the waters, which had overflowed their banks, retired at the divine
command, and were gathered together into a solid heap. First, Joshua explains
the nature of the miracle for the purpose of removing doubt, and preventing
profane men from denying the divine interposition by a subtle searching for
other causes. It is not, indeed, impossible that the flowing of the water might
have been restrained for a short time, and that some portion of the channel
might thus have appeared dry, or that the course might have changed and taken
some other direction. But it was certainly neither a natural nor fortuitous
event, when the waters stood gathered up into a heap. It is therefore said that
the waters which previously flowed from the higher ground, seeking in their
descent a continuous outlet, stood still.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There
cannot be a doubt that this wonderful sight must have been received with
feelings of fear, leading the Israelites more distinctly to acknowledge that
they were saved in the midst of death. For what was that collected heap but a
grave in which the whole multitude would have been buried, had the waters
resumed their naturally liquid
state?</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f44</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Had they walked upon the waters their
faith might have served them as a kind of bridge. But now, while mountains of
water hung over their heads, it is just as if they had found an open and level
path beneath them. The locality is marked out as situated between two
cities,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f45</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that the remembrance of it might never be
lost; and, in like manner, God ordered stones to be set up as a perpetual

And it came to pass</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc<i> </i>The
brief and obscure allusion previously made with regard to the twelve men he now
explains more at length. He had said that they were chosen by the order of God,
one each from his own tribe; but breaking off his discourse, he had not
mentioned for what purpose. He now says, that by command of
Joshua</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f46
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">they took up twelve stones and placed them in
Gilgal, that a well marked memorial might exist among posterity. Moreover, as he
only relates what was done after the passage of the people, what is interposed
should be interpreted as in the pluperfect
tense.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f47</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is also very obvious that the copula
is used instead of the rational
particle.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f48</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The substance is, that before the priests
moved their foot from the middle of the river where they stood, the stones at
their feet were taken and placed in Gilgal, to be perpetual witnesses of the
miracle, and that Joshua thus faithfully executed what God had commanded.
Joshua, therefore, called the men whom he had previously chosen, but not without
the command of God, that through it he might have a stronger attestation to his
authority. For had Joshua raised up a trophy of that kind of his own accord, the
piety which dictated it might indeed have been laudable, but the admonition
founded only on the will of man might perhaps have been despised. But now when
God himself raises the sign, it is impious to pass it carelessly by. He
intimates, accordingly, that it was a monument deserving of the greatest
attention when he introduces the children asking, what mean these
stones?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then you shall answer
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Although the stones themselves
cannot speak, yet the monument furnished the parents with materials for
speaking, and for making the kindness of God known to their children. And here
zealous endeavors to propagate piety are required of the
aged,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f49</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and they are enjoined to exert themselves
in instructing their children. For it was the will of God that this doctrine
should be handed down through every age; that those who were not then born being
afterwards instructed by their parents might become witnesses to it from
hearing, though they had not seen it with their
eyes.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The stones were placed according to the
number of the tribes, that each might be incited to gratitude by its own symbol.
It is true that two tribes and a half tribe who had obtained their inheritance
beyond the Jordan, had not, when considered apart from the others, any occasion
for making that passage. But as the land of Canaan was possessed by the others
for the common good of the whole race of Abraham, so it behooved those who were
all engaged in the same or a common cause not to be separated from each other.
And although as yet mention had been made only of twelve men, it is obvious from
a short clause, that the divine command had been declared to the whole people;
for it is said that the children of Israel obeyed the words of Joshua. Nay, it
is even probable that deputies were elected by suffrage to carry the stones in
the name of the whole people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joshua set up twelve
stones</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Apparently there was no use
of stones under the water, and it may therefore seem to have been absurd to bury
stones at a depth. The others which were placed in Gilgal being publicly
visible, furnished occasion for inquiry; but stones hidden from the eyes of men
at the bottom of the water could have no effect in inciting their minds. I admit
that a monument altogether buried in silence would have been
useless.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f50</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But when they talked among themselves of
the evidence of the passage left there, the hearing even of what they did not
see, strongly tended to confirm their faith. The ark of the covenant was shut up
in the sanctuary and covered by a veil placed over against it, and yet its
hidden splendor was not without benefit, when they learned from the Law that the
covenant of God was deposited in it. It might also happen, that when the river
was low, the tops of the heap would sometimes appear. But what I have already
said is more probable, that though Joshua buried the stones in the middle of the
stream, he did a useful act by establishing a testimony in presence of the
people, which would afterwards become the subject of general
conversation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Joshua

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the priests which
bare</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc If we are ordered to halt
while others are hastening, we know how easily a feeling of irksomeness is
produced, because we seem to be occupying an inferior position. The priests,
therefore, are justly praised for their patience in calmly remaining alone at
their post, while the whole people were swiftly hurrying on to the further bank.
For they might have begun to feel doubtful lest the heaps of water which were
suspended over their heads might suddenly melt away and engulf them. They
therefore evinced their piety no less by remaining there than by venturing to
proceed into the opposing current. Thus, in the first place, they displayed
their ready obedience, and in the second their constancy, making it manifest
that they had not obeyed from mere impulse. For their firmness of purpose, which
is praised, must have had its origin in a living principle. It was a proof of
modesty that they attempted nothing rashly, but regulated their whole procedure
as it were in strict conformity to the word of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Although it is probable that Joshua was
instructed by a new message from heaven as to what was necessary to be done, he
is, however, said to have followed what Moses had commanded. By this I
understand that Moses had carefully enjoined him to hang on the lips of God,
that he was thoroughly obedient to the injunction, and accordingly was always
observant of what was pleasing to God. In short, the command of Moses here
mentioned was general, but God gave special injunctions to Joshua as each
circumstance arose.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the children of
Reuben</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc He makes mention of the
expedition of the two tribes and half tribe, as they did not set out to engage
in warfare on their own private account, but to assist their brethren, by whose
valor their own possession had been obtained in seizing the land of Canaan.
Moses had laid them under this obligation, and they had bound themselves by oath
that they would accompany the rest of the people till all should have obtained a
quiet settlement.</font><br><font face="Palatino">They again made the same
promise when the camp was about to be moved as we saw in Joshua 1. But from the
narrative here we gather that only a part was selected, for the number amounts
only to forty thousand, that is, a third, or about a third of the number
ascertained by the census taken shortly before. Now, as they are everywhere said
to have performed their promise, it may be probably conjectured that it was not
the intention of Moses strictly to insist that all who had assented should leave
their wives and children, and do military service in the land of Canaan till it
was wholly subdued. And certainly it would have been harsh and cruel to leave an
unwarlike multitude unprotected in the midst of many hostile nations. Nor would
the remains of the enemy, assisted by neighboring nations, have long failed to
take advantage of such an opportunity to avenge themselves by massacring the
women and children. It was necessary, therefore, in a country not yet
sufficiently pacified, permanently to retain a force sufficient to prevent
incursions. Moses was not of so stern a nature as not to consult for the
helpless. Nay, his prudence and equity would never have allowed him to leave a
territory lately seized by arms unoccupied by a body of
troops.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We may add, that such an immense
concourse would have impeded rather than assisted the acquisition of the land of
Canaan. All which Moses required, therefore, was simply that the Reubenites and
Gadites should not, while their brethren were engaged in carrying on the war,
remain indolently at home and eat their food at ease without giving any
assistance to those to whom they were indebted for having obtained the
inheritance. And the good faith of the forty thousand was approved by their not
declining the burdens, toils, and perils of warfare, while the remainder of
their own tribes were enjoying quiet. They might readily have alleged that they
were as well entitled as the others to exemption, but in proceeding with
alacrity after the levy was made, to obey the orders given them, without envying
the immunity given to their brethren, they show that they were voluntarily and
heartily disposed to do their duty. At the same time, it is not doubtful that by
accepting the flower of their tribes, the handle for complaint and quarrel was
cut off. For it could not justly have been maintained that not even the aged and
worn out, or the young and feeble, were to be spared. Some, perhaps, may be
inclined to conjecture that the army was raised not by choice but by lot, though
it rather seems to me that all who were most robust and best able to bear
fatigue were enrolled.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On that day the Lord
magnified</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc<i> </i>It was not indeed
the principal end of the miracle to proclaim Joshua's pre-eminence in power and
authority, but as it greatly concerned the public interest, that the government
of Joshua should be firmly established, it is justly set down as an additional
instance of the divine favor, that he was, so to speak, adorned with sacred
insignia to render him venerable in the eyes of the people, and prevent any one
from presuming to despise him. For a promiscuous multitude, not ruled by a head,
breaks up and falls away of its own accord. The Lord, therefore, to provide for
the safety of his people, distinguished Joshua by a special mark declaratory of
his vocation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">From this passage we may learn
that God specially recommends to us all those through whose hands he displays
his excellent working, and requires us to give them due honor and reverence.
When it is said that the people feared Joshua as they had feared Moses, should
any one object that the statement is refuted by the many sedition's and tumults
which they stirred up against him, not only wantonly but furiously, it is easy
to answer, that it does not apply to the whole period from their departure out
of Egypt, but only refers to that when subdued by plagues and softened down,
they began to be duly obedient to Moses. For what is now described is a tranquil
government, as if they had laid aside their ancient perverseness, more
especially when the turbulent parents were dead and a better race had succeeded.
Accordingly, we do not read that there was any difficulty in ruling and turning
them. I now only briefly advert to what I have already explained. For when
Joshua at the outset exhorted them to obedience, they said that they would be
obedient as they had been to
Moses.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Command the priests</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Here it is
shown more clearly how meekly and calmly the priests yielded implicit obedience
to the divine command, for they did not move a foot until Joshua ordered the
signal to retire. But as it was an instance of rare virtue to be thus modest and
obedient, so the fatherly kindness of God is conspicuous in this, that he
condescended to direct and govern almost every step in their progress by his own
voice, lest any perplexity might occur to retard
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Next follows a more conspicuous
confirmation of the miracle; for as soon as they climbed the opposite bank, the
Jordan began again to flow as usual. Had it not returned to its former state,
and indeed, suddenly, many would have imagined the cause of the change to be
hidden but fortuitous. But when God displays his power and favor at minute
intervals of time all doubt is removed. The moment the feet of the priests were
made wet the Jordan retired; now on their departure he recovers his free course,
and that at the very instant when they reached the bank. For the term <i>dry
</i>here means that part which was not covered by the
overflow.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

dumb,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Why the day on which they
entered the land, and first encamped in it, is marked, we shall see in next
chapter. But the name of Gilgal is given to the first station by anticipation,
for this new name was afterwards given to it by Joshua on the renewal of
circumcision; its etymology will be explained in its own place. Moreover, the
thing here principally treated of is the monument of twelve stones; for though
it was formerly mentioned, a kind of solemn dedication is now related, namely,
that Joshua not only erected a mound, but called the attention of the people to
its use in enabling fathers to keep the memory of the divine goodness alive
among their children. From his introducing the children asking, What mean these
stones? we infer that they were arranged so as to attract the notice of
spectators. For had they been heaped together at random without any order, it
would never have come into the mind of posterity to inquire concerning their
meaning. There must therefore have been something so remarkable in their
position as not to allow the sight to be
overlooked.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moreover, because the covenant by
which God had adopted the race of Abraham was firm in an uninterrupted
succession for a thousand generations, the benefit which God had bestowed on the
deceased fathers is, on account of the unity of the body, transferred in common
to their children who were born long after. And the continuation must have more
strongly awakened their attention, inasmuch as posterity were in this way
reminded that what had long ago been given to their ancestors belonged to them
also. The answer of the parents would have been coldly listened to had the
divine favor been confined to a single day. But when the sons' sons hear that
the waters of Jordan were dried up many ages before they were born, they
acknowledge themselves to be the very people towards whom that wonderful act of
divine favor had been manifested. The same account is to be given of the drying
up of the Red Sea, though the event was not very ancient. It is certain that of
those who had come out of Egypt, Caleb and Joshua were the only survivors, and
yet he addresses the whole people as if they had been eye-witnesses of the
miracle. God dried up the Red Sea before our face; in other words, it was done
in virtue of the adoption which passed without interruption from the fathers to
the children. Moreover, it was worth while to call the passage of the Red Sea to
remembrance, not only that the similarity of the miracle might cause belief, but
that on hearing the story of the Jordan, that former miracle might be at the
same time renewed, although no visible symbol of it was present to the
eye.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That all people of the earth
might know</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc He states that God had
put forth that manifestation of his power that it might not only be proclaimed
among his own people, but that the form of it might spread far and wide among
the nations. For although it pleased him that his praise should dwell in Zion,
it pleased him also that his works should so far be made known to strangers that
they might be forced to confess that he is the true God, and compelled
unwillingly to fear him whom they had willingly contemned, as it is said in the
song of Moses,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053231&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:31) "Our enemies are judges." For he means that unbelievers, whether they
will or not, have this confession extorted from them by a knowledge of the works
of God. But as it did not at all profit them to know how great the might of God
was, Joshua distinguishes them from the Israelites, to whom he attributes a
special knowledge, namely, that which begets serious fear of God. That the
nations may know, he says; but that thou may fear thy God. Therefore while
unbelievers extinguish the light by their darkness, let us learn from
considering the works of God to advance in his fear. He says <i>all days</i>,
because the favor here spoken of was diffused over several
generations.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass
when</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc The recognition of the fearful
power of God had such an effect upon them that they were astonished and fainted
with terror, but it did not incline their minds to seek a remedy for the evil.
Their heart was melted inasmuch as destitute of counsel and strength they did
not bestir themselves, but in regard to contumacy they remained as hard-hearted
as before. We have already seen elsewhere how unbelievers, when smitten with
fear, cease not to wrestle with God, and even when they fall, continue fiercely
to assail heaven. Hence the dread which ought to have urged them to caution had
no other effect than to hurry them on headlong. They were, however, terrified
from above for the sake of the people, that victory might be more easily
obtained, and the Israelites might be emboldened when they saw they had to do
with an enemy already broken and stricken with dismay. Thus God spared their
weakness, as if he had opened up the way by removing obstacles, because they had
already proved themselves to be otherwise more sluggish and cowardly than was
meet. The substance then is, that before the conflict commenced, the enemy were
already routed by the terror which the fame of the miracle had
inspired.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>At that time the Lord
said</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc It seems very strange and
almost monstrous, that circumcision<i> </i>had so long been laid aside,
especially as it became those who were receiving daily admonitions to be more
than usually careful to cultivate the exercises of piety. It was the symbol of
the adoption to which they owed their freedom. And it is certain that when they
were reduced to extremity and groaning under tyranny, they always circumcised
their children. We know also how sternly God threatened to be an avenger against
any one who should allow the eighth day to pass. Had the observance been
neglected in Egypt their carelessness might have admitted of excuse, as at that
time the covenant of God appeared to have become in a manner obsolete. But now
when the divine faithfulness in establishing the covenant is once more
refulgent, what excuse could there be for not testifying on their part that they
are the people of God</font><br><font face="Palatino">The apology which
commentators offer is altogether frivolous. I admit that they were constantly
under arms, and always uncertain when they would require to move. But I hold it
erroneous to infer from this that they had not a day's leisure, and that it
would have been cruel to circumcise tender infants when the camp must shortly
after have been moved. Nothing ought to have weighed so much with them as to
produce a contemptuous disregard of what had been said to Abraham,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011714&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
17:14) The soul that is not circumcised shall be cut off from the people. But if
there was risk of life in the circumcision, the best and only method was to
trust to the paternal providence of God, who certainly would not have allowed
his own precept to become fatal to infants. In short, the omission from a fear
of danger, could not originate in any other cause than distrust. But even had it
been certain that infants would be brought into danger, God ought nevertheless
to have been obeyed, inasmuch as the seal of the covenant by which they were
received into the Church was more precious than a hundred lives. Nor would Moses
have suffered such cowardly procedure had he not been influenced by some
different motive. Moreover, though the point is doubtful, I presume that they
did not desist from circumcising their children, the very first day after their
departure, but only after they had been obliged to retrace their steps through
their own perverseness. And in this way both the defection and the punishment
are accurately expressed, For it is not said that circumcision was resumed,
because the constant change of place during their wanderings made it previously
impossible, but because forty years behooved to elapse until those wicked
apostates who had cut themselves off from the promised inheritance were
consumed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Attention should be paid to the reason
here given, namely, that the children of Israel wandered through the desert till
the whole of the generation which had refused to follow God was extinct; from
this we may, in my opinion, infer, that the use of circumcision ceased during
the whole of that period as a sign of malediction or rejection. It is true,
indeed, that the penalty was inflicted on the innocent, but it was expedient
that the fathers should be chastised in their person, as if God were repudiating
them for the time to come. When they saw that their offspring differed in no
respect from profane persons and strangers, they had a plain demonstration of
what they themselves deserved.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here, however, an
inconsistency seems to arise in respect, <i>first, </i>that while they were
condemned, their offspring were immediately received into favor; and
<i>secondly, </i>that to themselves also was left a hope of pardon; and more
especially, that they were not deprived of the other sacraments of which they
could not be partakers, except on the ground of their being separated from
profane nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Lord, I admit, in rejecting
them, declares at the same time that he will be propitious to their children,
but to behold in their offspring a sign of repudiation till they themselves all
perished, was salutary chastisement. For God withdrew the pledge of his favor
only for a time, and kept it, as it were, locked up until their death. This
punishment, therefore, was not properly inflicted on the children who were
afterwards born, but had the same effect as a suspension, just as if God were
making it manifest that he had put off circumcision for a time lest it should be
profaned, but was waiting for an opportunity of renewing
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Should any one object that it was absurd to
celebrate the Passover in uncircumcision, I admit that it was so according to
the usual order. For none were admitted to the Passover and the sacrifices save
those who were initiated into the worship of God; just as in the present day the
ordinance of the Supper is common only to those who have been admitted into the
Church by baptism. But the Lord might choose for a time to alter the ordinary
rule, and allow those from whom he had taken away circumcision to be partakers
of other sacred rites. Thus the people were excommunicated in one matter, and
yet, in the meanwhile, furnished with fit aids to prevent them from falling into
despair; just as if a father, offended with his son, were to raise his fist,
apparently to drive him away, and were at the same time to detain him by his
other hand, &#8212; were to frighten him by threats and blows, and yet be
unwilling to part with him. This seems to me to have been the reason why God,
while depriving the people of the special pledge of adoption, was, however,
unwilling to deprive them of other
ordinances.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Should it be objected that there is
a distinct assertion that none were circumcised on the way after they had set
out, I answer, that, with a view to brevity, all things are not stated exactly,
and yet that it may be gathered from the context that none remained
uncircumcised but those who were born after the sedition. For it is said that
their sons, whom God substituted for them, were circumcised by Joshua. From this
it appears that a new people were then created to supply the place of perverse
rebels. It was, moreover, a sad and severe trial that God did not choose to have
the people circumcised till they were hemmed in by enemies on every side. It
would, certainly, have been safer and more convenient to perform the rite before
crossing the Jordan, in the land of Bashan, which had been reduced to peace by
the overthrow of the inhabitants. The Lord waits till they are shut up in the
midst of enemies, and exposed to their lust and violence, as if he were
purposely exposing them to death; since all weakened by their wound must have
given way at once, and been slaughtered almost without resistance. For if in
similar circumstances (Genesis 34) two sons of Jacob, were able to force their
way into the town of Sichem and plunder it, after slaying its citizens, how much
more easy would it have been for the neighboring nations to attack the
Israelites while thus wounded, and make a general massacre of
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This was, therefore, as I have said, a
very harsh trial, and hence the readiness with which it was submitted to is
deserving of the greater praise. The place itself, however, appears to have been
purposely selected by the divine wisdom, that they might be more disposed to
obey. Had the same command been given on the other side of the Jordan, there was
reason to fear that they might be cast into despondency, and from the delay thus
interposed might again decline to enter the land. But now, when they had been
brought into possession under happy auspices, as if by the hand of God, and
conceived from the removal of this one obstacle a sure hope of warring with
success, it is not wonderful if they obey more willingly than they might have
done if they had not been so singularly strengthened. The very sight of the
promised land must have furnished additional incentives, when they understood
that they were again consecrated to God, in order that their uncircumcision
might not pollute the holy land.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto
Joshua</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc The disgrace of Egypt is
expounded by some as meaning that the want of circumcision rendered them similar
to the Egyptians, in other words, profane and marked with a stigma; as if it had
been said that they were again made the peculiar property of God when they were
anew stamped with this mark, to distinguish them from the nations that were
unclean. Others understand it actively, as meaning that they would no longer be
scorned by the Egyptians, as if God had deceived them. This I have no hesitation
in rejecting as too far fetched. Others understand that they would no longer lie
under the false imputation of worshipping the gods of that nation. I rather
understand the meaning to be, that they were freed from an invidious charge, by
which they were otherwise overborne. It was disreputable to have shaken off the
yoke and revolted from the king under whose government they lived. Moreover, as
they gave out that God was the avenger of unjust tyranny, it was easy to upbraid
them with using the name of God as a mere color for their conduct. They might,
therefore, have been regarded as deserters, had not the disgrace been wiped off
by the appeal to circumcision, by which the divine election was sealed in their
flesh before they went down into Egypt. It was accordingly made plain by the
renewal of the ancient covenant that they were not rebels against legitimate
authority, nor had rashly gone off at their own hand, but that their liberty was
restored by God, who had long ago taken them under his special
protection.</font><br><font face="Palatino">From the removal of disgrace the
place obtained its name. For those who think that the prepuce cut off was called
Gilgal, because it was a kind of circle, abandon the literal meaning, and have
recourse to a very unnecessary fiction; while it is perfectly obvious that the
place was called <i>Rolling Off, </i>because God there rolled off from his
people the disgrace which unjustly attached to them. The interpretation of
<i>liberty, </i>adopted by Josephus, is vain and ridiculous, and makes it
apparent that he was as ignorant of the Hebrew tongue as of
jurisprudence.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Joshua

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the children of Israel. kept
the Passover</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Here it is stated that
the Passover was celebrated on the regular day, although there are some who
think that the words used imply that the practice was unusual. They hence infer
that, like circumcision, it had been interrupted for a period of forty years, as
it would have been absurd for persons uncircumcised to take part in a sacred
feast. To confirm this view, they observe that we do not read of the Passover
having been observed after the beginning of the second year. But it is not
probable that that which God had lately ordered to be perpetual,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021242&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
12:42) was suddenly cast aside. For it had been said to them, It is a night to
be observed by the children of Israel in all their generations. How
inconsistent, then, would it have been had this practice, which was to be
observed throughout all ages, become obsolete in the course of two years! And
again, how heartless it would have been to bury the memory of a recent favor
within so short a period!</font><br><font face="Palatino">But it is said that
the want of circumcision must have kept back a large proportion, that the
mystery might not be profaned; for at its institution it had been declared, No
uncircumcised person shall eat of it. To this I have already answered, that it
was an extraordinary privilege; as the children of Israel were freed from the
law.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f53</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For it is certain that they continued to
use sacrifices, and to observe the other parts of legal worship, although this
was unlawful, unless something of the form prescribed by the law had been
remitted by divine authority. It is certain that unclean persons were prohibited
from entering the court of the tabernacle, and yet the children of Israel, while
uncircumcised, offered sacrifices there, thus doing what was equivalent to the
slaying of the Passover. They were therefore permitted, by sufferance, to do
that which it was not lawful to do according to the rule of the
law.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The mention made by Moses of the second
celebration of the Passover (Numbers 9) is for a different purpose, namely, for
the purpose of indirectly censuring the carelessness and sluggishness of the
people, who would not have observed the sacred anniversary at the end of the
first year if they had not been reminded of it. For although God had proclaimed
that they should through all ages annually renew the memory of their
deliverance, yet they had grown so oblivious before the end of the year, that
they had become remiss in the discharge of the duty. It is not without cause
they are urged by a new intimation, as they were not sufficiently attentive of
their own accord. That passage, therefore, does not prove that the use of the
Passover was afterwards interrupted; on the contrary, it may, with some
probability, be inferred from it that it was annually observed; as the Lord,
towards the end of the year, anticipates the observance, telling them to make
careful provision for it in future, and never deviate from the command which had
been given them.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f54</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they did eat of the old
corn</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Whether they then began first
to eat wheaten bread is not very clear. For they had dwelt in a country that was
not uncultivated, and was tolerably fertile. At least in the territories of the
two kings there was enough of corn to supply the inhabitants. It does not seem
reasonable to suppose that the children of Israel allowed the corn which they
found there to rot and perish by mere waste. And I have no doubt that they ate
the flesh which remained over of the sacrifices. It is quite possible,
therefore, that they did not wholly abstain from wheaten bread, and yet did not
abandon their accustomed food. For a country which was assigned to a tenth part
could not have furnished food sufficient for the whole multitude, as there
cannot be a doubt that a just estimate was made when Moses settled in it only
two tribes and a half tribe. As yet, therefore, the twelve tribes had not found
sufficient food, more especially as the country had been devastated by war, and
the Israelites, who were not in safety to leave the camp, could not devote their
attention to agriculture. The manna was thus necessary to feed them until a more
abundant supply was obtained. This took place in the land of Canaan, and then,
accordingly, they returned to common food. But why they deferred it till that
day is not known, unless it be that after their wound was cured, some days
behooved to be spent in collecting corn, while religion did not permit them to
bake bread lest they should break the Sabbath. But although that rest was
sacred, we gather from the circumstances that they made haste, as the flour must
have been previously prepared, seeing they could not grind it and bake it in a
single day.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Be this as it may, the Lord
furnished them with provision as long as their want required to be supplied. The
failure of the manna on a sudden, and at the very moment, must have furnished an
additional attestation to the kindness of God, inasmuch as it was thence
apparent that the manna was a temporary resource, which had descended not so
much from the clouds as from a paternal providence. It is moreover plain, that
this is to be understood of the produce of the former year, and it is needless
to raise any question in regard to it; for it would have implied too much
precipitation to rush upon the produce of the present year when not yet properly
matured, and a whole month would scarcely have sufficed to collect enough for
the supply of so great a multitude. I cannot see why expounders should give
themselves so much trouble with so clear a
matter.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass when
Joshua</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc </i>Here we have the narrative
of a remarkable vision, by which Joshua was greatly encouraged and emboldened.
For though he was strenuously discharging his office, the application of an
additional stimulus was not without its use. The angel, however, did not appear
solely on his private account, but for the confirmation of the whole people:
nay, the Lord looked further forward, that he might furnish posterity with
stronger proofs of a kindness which was never duly considered. For although they
boasted in lofty terms of having been planted by the hand of God in a holy land,
they were scarcely induced by all the miracles to acknowledge in good earnest
that they were placed there as God's vassals. This vision, therefore, must have
been beneficial to all ages, by leaving no doubt as to the divine kindness
bestowed. Its being said that he lifted his eyes, tends to confirm the certainty
of the vision, lest any one might suppose that his eyesight had merely been
dazzled by some evanescent phantom.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
spectacle, when first presented, must have inspired fear; for it is probable
that Joshua was then alone, whether he had withdrawn from public view to engage
in prayer, or for the purpose of reconnoitering the city. I am rather inclined
to think it was the latter, and that he had gone aside to examine where the city
ought to be attacked, lest the difficulty might deter others. It appears certain
that he was without attendants, as he alone perceives the vision; and there can
be no doubt that he was prepared to fight had he fallen in with an enemy. But he
puts his question as if addressing a man, because it is only from the answer he
learns that it is an angel. This doubt gives more credibility to the vision,
while he is gradually led from the view of the man whom he addresses to the
recognition of an angel. The words, at the same time, imply that it was not an
ordinary angel, but one of special excellence. For he calls himself captain of
the Lord's host, a term which may be understood to comprehend not merely his
chosen people, but angels also.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The former view,
however, is the more correct, as God does not produce anything of an unwonted
nature, but constitutes that which we previously read that he performed to
Moses. And we know that Moses himself preferred this favor to all others; and
justly, for God there manifested his own glory in an open and familiar manner.
Accordingly, he is indiscriminately called an angel, and distinguished by the
title of the eternal God. Of this fact Paul is a competent witness, who
distinctly declares that it was Christ.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:4.) And Moses himself embraced God as present in the person of
the Mediator. For when God declares, after the making of the calf, (Exodus
33:2-3</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f54a</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) that he would no longer be the Leader
of the people, he at the same time promises that he will give one of his angels,
but only one, as it were taken out of the general body of the angelic
host.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f55</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This Moses earnestly deprecates,
obviously because he could have no hope that God would be propitious if the
Mediator were removed. It was thus a special pledge of the divine favor that the
Captain and Head of the Church, to whom Moses had been accustomed, was now
present to assist. And indeed the divine adoption could not be ratified in any
other way than in the hand of the
Mediator.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he said, Nay; but as
captain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Although the denial applies
equally to both parts of the question, namely, that he was neither an Israelite
nor a Canaanite, and was thus equivalent to a denial of his being a mortal man,
yet it seems to be more properly applicable to the second, or to that part of
the question in which Joshua asked if he were one of the enemy. This, however,
is a matter of little moment; the essential thing is to understand that he had
come to preside over the chosen people whom he honorably styles the Lord's host.
In his representing himself as different from God, a personal distinction is
denoted, but unity of essence is not
destroyed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We have said that in the books of
Moses the name of
Jehovah</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f56</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is often attributed to the presiding
Angel, who was undoubtedly the only-begotten Son of God. He is indeed very God,
and yet in the person of Mediator by dispensation, he is inferior to God. I
willingly receive what ancient writers teach on this subject, &#8212; that when
Christ anciently appeared in human form, it was a prelude to the mystery which
was afterwards exhibited when God was manifested in the flesh. We must beware,
however, of imagining that Christ at that time became incarnate, since,
<i>first, </i>we nowhere read that God sent his Son in the flesh before the
fullness of the times; and, <i>secondly, </i>Christ, in so far as he was a man,
behooved to be the Son of David. But as is said in Ezekiel, (Ezekiel 1) it was
only a likeness of man. Whether it was a substantial body or an outward form, it
is needless to discuss, as it seems wrong to insist on any particular view of
the subject.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f57</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">The only remaining question is, how
the Captain of the Lord's host can speak of having <i>now </i>come, seeing he
had not deserted the people committed to his trust, and had lately given a
matchless display of his presence in the passage of the Jordan. But according to
the common usage of Scripture, God is said to come to us when we are actually
made sensible of his assistance, which seems remote when not manifested by
experience. It is therefore just as if he were offering his assistance in the
combats which were about to be waged, and promising by his arrival that the war
would have a happy issue. It cannot be inferred with certainty from the worship
which he offered, whether Joshua paid divine honor to Christ distinctly
recognized as such; but by asking, What command does my Lord give to his
servant? he attributes to him a power and authority which belong to God
alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Loose thy shoe from off thy
foot</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc<i> </i>To give additional
sanctity to the vision, the great Angel requires as a sign of reverence and fear
that Joshua put off his shoes. Moses relates,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;020305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
3:5) that the same command was given to him on Mount Sinai, and for no other
reason than that the Lord there manifested his glory. For one place cannot have
a greater sanctity than another, except God deigns specially to make it so. Thus
Jacob exclaims, (Genesis
28:17</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f57a</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) that the place where he had known God
more nearly is the house of God, a dreadful place, and the gate of heaven. Here,
therefore, when God orders his holy servant to take off his shoes, he by this
ceremony attests the reality of his presence, and adds more weight to the
vision; not that nakedness of feet is of itself of any value in the worship of
God, but because the weakness of men requires to be aided by helps of this kind,
that they may the better excite and prepare themselves for veneration. Moreover,
as God by his presence sanctifies the places in which he appears, I think it
probable that the expression, holy ground, is in part commendatory of the
excellence of the land of Canaan, which God had chosen for his own habitation
and the seat of his pure worship. Hence in various passages it is called "his
rest."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;199511&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
95:11, and Psalm
132:14</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f57b</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) In the end of the verse Joshua is
praised for his obedience, that posterity might learn by his example to
cultivate pure piety in that land. There seems thus to be a kind of tacit
comparison or antithesis, by which the land of Canaan is extolled above all
other countries.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now Jericho was straitly shut
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Jericho is said to be shut up,
because the gates were not opened: as in<b> </b>time of war cities are guarded
with more than usual care. It is added, by way of emphasis, that they were
sealed, or locked up,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f59</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as if it were said that the inhabitants
were attentive in watching, so as not to be taken by surprise. Hence, as it
could not be taken by stratagem, the only hope of taking it was by open force.
This tends to display the goodness of God to the children of Israel, who would
have been worn out by a long and difficult siege, had not a substitute been
early provided from heaven. Meanwhile there was a danger, lest being forced into
a corner, they might be consumed by want and famine, as there was no means of
obtaining food and provender in a hostile region. The Lord, therefore, that they
might not sit down despondently before one city, assisted them by an
extraordinary<i> </i>miracle, and opened up an entrance to them by throwing down
the walls, that they might thereafter have the greater confidence in attacking
other cities.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We now see the connection between
the two first verses, in the one of which it is said, that Jericho was shut up,
and the children of Israel thus prevented from approaching it, while in the
other God promises that he will take it for them. He makes this promise with the
view of preventing them from tormenting themselves with anxious thoughts. In one
word, God, by this easy victory at the outset, provides against their giving way
to despondency in<b> </b>future. We, at the same time, perceive the stupidity of
the inhabitants, who place their walls and gates as obstacles to the divine
omnipotence; as if it were more difficult to break up or dissolve a few bars and
beams than to dry up the Jordan.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And you shall compass the
city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc The promise was, indeed, fit
and sufficient of itself to give hope of victory, but the method of acting was
so strange, as almost to destroy its credibility. God orders them to make one
circuit round the city daily until the seventh day, on which they are told to go
round it seven times, sounding trumpets, and shouting. The whole looked like
nothing else than child's play, and yet was no improper test, for trying their
faith, as it proved their acquiescence in the divine message, even when they saw
in the act itself nothing but mere disappointment. With the same intention, the
Lord often, for a time, conceals<i> </i>his own might under weakness, and seems
to sport with mere trifles, that his weakness may at length appear stronger than
all might, and his folly superior to all
wisdom.</font><br><font face="Palatino">While the Israelites thus abandon their
own reason, and depend implicitly on his words, they gain much more by trifling
than they could have done by making a forcible assault, and shaking the walls by
numbers of the most powerful engines. Only it behooved them to play the fool for
short time, and not display too much acuteness in making anxious and subtle
inquiries concerning the event: for that would have been, in a manner, to
obstruct the course of the divine omnipotence. Meanwhile, though the circulatory
movement round the walls might have excited derision, it was afterwards known,
by its prosperous result, that God commands nothing in
vain.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There was another subject of care and
doubt, which might have crept into their minds. Should the inhabitants of the
city suddenly sally forth, the army would, without difficulty, be put to the
rout, while, in long straggling lines, it was proceeding round the city, without
any regular arrangement that might have enabled it to repel a hostile assault.
But here, also, whatever anxiety they might have felt, they behooved to cast it
upon God; for sacred is the security which reclines on his providence. There was
an additional trial of their faith, in the repetition of the circuit of the city
during seven days. For what could seem less congruous than to fatigue themselves
with six unavailing circuits? Then, of what use was their
silence,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f60</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> unless to betray their timidity, and
tempt the enemy to come out and attack besiegers who seemed not to have spirit
enough to meet them? But as profane men often, by rash intermeddling fervor,
throw everything into confusion, the only part which God here assigns to his
people, is to remain calm and silent, that thus they may the better accustom
themselves simply to execute his commands.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here,
too, it is worthy of remark, that the instruments, given to the priests to blow
with, are not the silver trumpets deposited in the sanctuary, but merely rams'
horns. The sound of the sacred trumpets would certainly have inspired more
confidence, but a better proof of obedience was given, when they were contented
with the vulgar symbol. Moreover, their movements were so arranged, that the
greater number, by which is understood the armed, went before the ark, while
those who usually accompanied the baggage followed. It was their part to take
care that the rear did not fall into confusion. As the term <i>congregating,
</i>applied to them, was obscure, I have rendered it by the corresponding term
usually employed by the
Latins.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f61</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some think that the tribe of Dan was thus
employed, but this is uncertain, as they were not then arranged in the manner
usual on other expeditions.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass on the
seventh day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Here, also, God seemed,
by leading the people so often round the city, not only to keep the matter in
suspense, but purposely to sport with the miseries of the people, who were
fatiguing themselves to no purpose. For why does he not order them suddenly to
attack the city? Why does he keep them in their former silence, even to
weariness, and not open their mouths to shout? But the happy fruit of this
endurance teaches us, that there is nothing better than to leave the decisive
moments and opportunities of acting at his disposal, and not, by our haste,
anticipate his providence, in which, if we acquiesce not, we obstruct the course
of his agency. Therefore, while the priests were sounding, God ordered a
corresponding shout to be raised by the people, that in this way he might prove
that he is not pleased with any impetuosity which men manifest at their own
hands, but above all things requires a regulated zeal, of which the only rule is
not to move either tongue, or feet, or hands, till he order. Here, the rams'
horns undoubtedly represented his
authority.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the city shall be
accursed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Although God had
determined not only to enrich his people with spoil and plunder, but also to
settle them in cities which they had not built, yet there was a peculiarity in
the case of the first city; for it was right that it should be consecrated as a
kind of first fruits. Accordingly, he claims the buildings, as well as all the
moveable property, as his own, and prohibits the application of any part of it
to private uses. It may have been an irksome and grievous task for the people
voluntarily to pull down houses in which they might have commodiously dwelt, and
to destroy articles which might have been important for use. But as they had not
been required to fight, it behooved them to refrain, without grudging, from
touching the prey, and willingly yield up the rewards of the victory to God, as
it was solely by his nod that the walls of the city had fallen, and the courage
of the citizens had fallen along with them. God was contented with this pledge
of gratitude, provided the people thereby quickly learned that everything they
called their own was the gift of his free liberality. For with equal right all
the other cities might have been doomed to destruction, had not God granted them
to his people for habitations.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As to the Hebrew
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">srj</font><font face="Palatino">,
I will now only briefly repeat from other passages. When it refers to sacred
oblations, it becomes, in respect of men, equivalent to <i>abolitions, </i>since
things devoted in this manner are renounced by them as completely as if they
were annihilated. The equivalent Greek term is
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajna&gt;qhma</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>or
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajna&gt;qema</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>meaning <i>set apart, </i>or as it is properly expressed in French,
<i>interdicted. </i>Hence the exhortation to beware of what was under anathema,
inasmuch as that which had been set apart for God alone had perished, in so far
as men were concerned. It is used in a different sense in the following verse,
where caution is given not to place the camp of Israel in anathema. Here its
simple meaning is, excision, perdition, or death. Moreover, God destined vessels
made of metals for the use of the sanctuary; all other things he ordered to be
consumed by fire, or destroyed in other
manners.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Joshua

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So the people
shouted</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Here the people are praised
for obedience, and the faithfulness of God is, at the same time, celebrated.
They testified their fidelity by shouting, because they were persuaded, that
what God had commanded would not be in vain, and he, in not allowing them to
lose their labor, vindicated the truth of what he had said. Another virtue of
not inferior value was displayed by the people, in despising unlawful gain, and
cheerfully suffering the loss of all the plunder. For there cannot be a doubt,
that in the minds of many the thought must have risen, For what end does God
please to destroy all the wealth? Why does he envy us that which he has given
into our hand? Why does he not rather gladden us by furnishing us with the
materials of thanksgiving? Dismissing these considerations, which might have
interfered with their duty, it was a proof of rare and excellent self-denial,
voluntarily to cast away the spoils which were in their hands, and the wealth of
a whole city.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The indiscriminate and promiscuous
slaughter, making no distinction of age or sex, but including alike women and
children, the aged and decrepit, might seem an inhuman massacre, had it not been
executed by the command of God. But as he, in whose hands are life and death,
had justly doomed those nations to destruction, this puts an end to all
discussion. We may add, that they had been borne with for four hundred years,
until their iniquity was complete. Who will now presume to complain of excessive
rigor, after God had so long delayed to execute judgment? If any one object that
children, at least, were still free from fault, it is easy to answer, that they
perished justly, as the race was accursed and reprobated. Here then it ought
always to be remembered, that it would have been barbarous and atrocious cruelty
had the Israelites gratified their own lust and rage, in slaughtering mothers
and their children, but that they are justly praised for their active piety and
holy zeal, in executing the command of God, who was pleased in this way to purge
the land of Canaan of the foul and loathsome defilement's by which it had long
been polluted.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f62</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But Joshua had said unto the two
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc The good faith of Joshua in
keeping promises, and his general integrity, are apparent in the anxious care
here taken. But as the whole city had been placed under anathema, a question
might be raised as to this exception of one family. No mortal man was at liberty
to make any change on the decision of God. Still as it was only by the
suggestion of the Spirit that Rahab had bargained for her impunity, I conclude
that Joshua, in preserving her, did only what was considerate and
prudent.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We may add, that the messengers were
not yet under any contrary obligation, as the complete destruction of the city
had not been declared. It is true, they had heard in general, that all those
nations were to be destroyed, but they were still at liberty to make a compact
with a single woman, who had voluntarily abandoned her countrymen. But we shall
afterwards meet with a far easier solution, namely, that while the Israelites,
by the divine command, exhorted all whom they attacked, to surrender, by holding
out the hope of pardon, the blinded nations obstinately refused the peace thus
offered, because God had decreed to destroy all of them. But while all, in
general, were hardened to their destruction, it follows that Rahab was exempted
by special privilege, and might escape in safety, while the others perished.
Joshua, therefore, judged wisely, that a woman who had voluntarily gone over to
the Church, was rescued thus early, not without the special grace of God. The
case of the father and the whole family is, indeed, different, but seeing they
all spontaneously abjure their former state, they confirm the stipulation which
Rahab had made for their safety, by the promptitude of their
obedience.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moreover, let us learn from the
example of Joshua, that we do not sufficiently attest our probity, by refraining
from violating our promise intentionally and of set purpose, unless we also
diligently exert ourselves to secure its performance. He not only allows Rahab
to be delivered by her guests, but is careful to guard against her sustaining
any injury in the first tumult; and to make the messengers more diligent in
performing their office, he reminds them that they had promised with the
intervention of an oath.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the young men that were spies
went in</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc God, doubtless, wished
those to be safe, whose minds he thus inclined to embrace deliverance. Had it
been otherwise, they would have rejected it not less proudly, and with no less
scorn than the two sons-in-law of Lot. But a still better provision is made for
them, when, by being placed without the camp, they receive a strict injunction
to abandon their former course of
life.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f63</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For had they been immediately admitted
and allowed to mix indiscriminately with the people, the thought of their
impurity might never, perhaps, have occurred to them, and they might thus have
continued to indulge in it. Now when they are placed apart, that they may not,
by their infection, taint the flock, they are impressed with a feeling of shame,
which may urge them to serious conversion.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It
cannot be meant that they were thus set apart for safety, lest any one in the
crowd might have risen up violently against them: for they would have been
received by all with the greatest favor and gladness, whereas they might have
been attacked in a solitary place more easily, and even with impunity. Their
impurity, therefore, was brought visibly before them, that they might not while
polluted come rashly forward into the holy meeting, but rather might be
accustomed by this rudimentary training to change their mode of life. For it is
added shortly after, that they dwelt in the midst of the people; in other words,
having been purged from their defilement's, they began to be regarded in the
very same light as if they had originally belonged to the race of Abraham. In
short, the meaning is, that after they had made a confession of their previous
impurity, they were admitted indiscriminately along with others. By this
admission, Rahab gained one of the noblest fruits of her
faith.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joshua adjured
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc This adjuration, then, was not
merely to have effect for one day, but to warn posterity through all ages that
that city had been taken only by divine power. He wished, therefore, that the
ruins and devastation should exist for ever as a kind of trophy; because the
rebuilding of it would have been equivalent to an erasure effacing the miracle.
In order, therefore, that the desolate appearance of the place might keep the
remembrance of the divine power and favor alive among posterity, Joshua
pronounces a heavy curse upon any one who should again build the ruined city.
From this passage we gather that the natural torpidity of men requires the aid
of stimulants to prevent them from burying the divine favors in oblivion; and
hence this spectacle, wherein the divine agency was made conspicuous to the
people, was a kind of indirect censure of their
ingratitude.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The substance of the imprecation
is, that if any one ever attempt to rebuild Jericho he may be made sensible by
the unpropitious and mournful result that he had done a cursed and abominable
work. For to lay the foundations in his first-born, were just as if he were to
cast forth his son to perish, crushed and buried beneath the mass of stones; and
to set up the gates in his younger son, is the same thing as to plan an edifice
which could not be erected without causing the death of a son. Thus he who
should dare to make the insane attempt is condemned in his own offspring. Nor
did Joshua utter this curse at his own suggestion; he was only the herald of
celestial vengeance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This makes it the more
monstrous that among the people of God a man should have been found, whom that

challenge God in this matter; but the Sacred History at the same time testifies,
that the denunciation which God had pronounced by the mouth of Joshua did not
fail of its effect; for Hiel founded the new Jericho in Abiram his first-born,
and set up its gates in his younger son Segub, and thus learned in the
destruction of his offspring what it is to attempt anything against the will and
in opposition to the command of
God.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the children of Israel
committed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Reference is made to the
crime, and indeed the secret crime, of one individual, whose guilt is
transferred to the whole people; and not only so, but punishment is at the same
time executed against several who were innocent. But it seems very unaccountable
that a whole people should be condemned for a private and hidden crime of which
they had no knowledge. I answer, that it is not new for the sin of one member to
be visited on the whole body. Should we be unable to discover the reason, it
ought to be more than enough for us that transgression is imputed to the
children of Israel, while the guilt is confined to one individual. But as it
very often happens that those who are not wicked foster the sins of their
brethren by conniving at them, a part of the blame is justly laid upon all those
who by disguising become implicated in it as partners. For this reason Paul,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460504&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 5:4-6) upbraids all the Corinthians with the private enormity of one
individual, and inveighs against their pride in presuming to glory while such a
stigma attached to them. But here it is easy to object that all were ignorant of
the theft, and that therefore there is no room for the maxim, that he who allows
a crime to be committed when he can prevent it is its perpetrator. I certainly
admit it not to be clear why a private crime is imputed to the whole people,
unless it be that they had not previously been sufficiently careful to punish
misdeeds, and that possibly owing to this, the person actually guilty in the
present instance had sinned with greater boldness. It is well known that weeds
creep in stealthily, grow apace and produce noxious fruits, if not speedily torn
up. The reason, however, why God charges a whole people with a secret theft is
deeper and more abstruse. He wished by an extraordinary manifestation to remind
posterity that they might all be criminated by the act of an individual, and
thus induce them to give more diligent heed to the prevention of
crimes.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Nothing, therefore, is better than to
keep our minds in suspense until the books are opened, when the divine judgments
which are now obscured by our darkness will be made perfectly clear. Let it
suffice us that the whole people were infected by a private stain; for so it has
been declared by the Supreme Judge, before whom it becomes us to stand dumb, as
having one day to appear at his tribunal. The stock from which Achan was
descended is narrated for the sake of increasing, and, as it were, propagating
the ignominy; just as if it were said, that he was the disgrace of his family
and all his race. For the writer of the history goes up as far as the tribe of
Judah. By this we are taught that when any one connected with us behaves himself
basely and wickedly, a stigma is in a manner impressed upon us in his person
that we may be humbled &#8212; not that it can be just to insult over all the
kindred of a wicked man, but <i>first, </i>that all kindred may be more careful
in applying mutual correction to each other, and <i>secondly, </i>that they may
be led to recognize that either their connivance or their own faults are
punished.</font><br><font face="Palatino">A greater occasion of scandal, fitted
to produce general alarm, was offered by the fact of the crime having been
detected in the tribe of Judah, which was the flower and glory of the whole
nation. It was certainly owing to the admirable counsel of God, that a
pre-eminence which fostered the hope of future dominion resided in that tribe.
But when near the very outset this honor was foully stained by the act of an
individual, the circumstance might have occasioned no small disturbance to weak
minds. The severe punishment, however, wiped away the scandal which might
otherwise have existed; and hence we gather that when occasion has been given to
the wicked to blaspheme, the Church has no fitter means of removing the
opprobrium than that of visiting offences with exemplary
punishment.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And Joshua sent men from Jericho</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc To
examine the site of the city and reconnoiter all its approaches was an act of
prudence, that they might not, by hurrying on at random through unknown places,
fall into an ambuscade. But when it would be necessary shortly after to advance
with all the forces, to send forward a small band with the view of taking the
city, seems to betray a want of military skill. Hence it would not have been
strange that two or three thousand men, on a sudden sally were panic-struck and
turned their backs. And it was certainly expedient for the whole body that
twenty or thirty thousand should have spread in all directions in foraging
parties. We may add, that even the act of slaying, though no resistance were
offered, was of itself sufficient to wear out a small body of troops. Therefore,
when the three thousand or thereabouts were repulsed, it was only a just
recompense for their confidence and sloth. The Holy Spirit, however, declares
that fewness of numbers was not the cause of the discomfiture, and ought not to
bear the blame of it. The true cause was the secret counsel of God, who meant to
show a sign of his anger, but allowed the number to be small in order that the
loss might be less serious. And it was certainly a rare display of mercy to
chastise the people gently and without any great overthrow, with the view of
arousing them to seek an instant remedy for the evil. Perhaps, too, the
inhabitants of Ai would not have dared to make an attack upon the Israelites had
they advanced against the city in full force. The Lord therefore opened a way
for his judgment, and yet modified it so as only to detect the hidden crime
under which the people might otherwise have been consumed as by a lingering
disease.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But although there is nothing wonderful
in the defeat of the Israelites, who fought on disadvantageous terms on lower
ground, it was, however, perfectly obvious that they were vanquished by fear and
the failure of their courage before they came to close quarters; for by turning
their backs they gave up the higher ground and retired to the slope of a valley.
The enemy, on the other hand, showed how thoroughly they despised them by the
confidence and boldness with which they ventured to pursue the fugitives at full
speed in the direction of their camp. In the camp itself, such was the
trepidation that all hearts melted. I admit, indeed, that there was cause for
fear when, after having gained so many victories as it were in sport, they saw
themselves so disgracefully defeated. In unwonted circumstances we are more
easily disturbed. But it was a terror from heaven which dismayed them more than
the death of thirty men and the flight of three
thousand.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joshua rent his
clothes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Although it was easy to
throw the blame of the overthrow or disgrace which had been sustained on others,
and it was by no means becoming in a courageous leader to be so much cast down
by the loss of thirty men, especially when by increasing his force a
hundred-fold it would not have been difficult to drive back the enemy now weary
with their exertions, it was not, however, without cause that Joshua felt the
deepest sorrow, and gave way to feelings bordering on despair. The thought that
the events of war are doubtful &#8212; a thought which sustains and reanimates
the defeated &#8212; could not be entertained by him, because God had promised
that they would always be victorious. Therefore when the success did not
correspond to his hopes, the only conclusion he could draw was, that they had
fought unsuccessfully merely because they had been deprived of the promised
assistance of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, both he and the
elders not only gave themselves up to sorrow and sadness, but engage in solemn
mourning, as used in the most calamitous circumstances, by tearing their
garments and throwing dust on their heads. That mode of expressing grief was
used also by the heathen, but was specially appropriate in the pious worshippers
of God in suppliantly deprecating his wrath. The rending of the garments and
other accompanying acts contained a profession of repentance, as may also be
inferred from the annexed prayer, which, however, is of a mixed nature, dictated
partly by faith and the pure spirit of piety, and partly by excessive
perturbation. In turning straightway to God and acknowledging that in his hand,
by which the wound was inflicted, the cure was prepared, they are influenced by
faith; but their excessive grief is evidently carried beyond all proper bounds.
Hence the freedom with which they expostulate, and hence the preposterous wish,
Would God we had remained in the
desert!</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f66</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">It is not a new thing, however, for
pious minds, when they aspire to seek God with holy zeal, to obscure the light
of faith by the vehemence and impetuosity of their affections. And in this way
all prayers would be vitiated did not the Lord in his boundless indulgence
pardon them, and wiping away all their stains receive them as if they were pure.
And yet while in thus freely expostulating, they cast their cares upon God,
though this blunt simplicity needs pardon, it is far more acceptable than the
feigned modesty of hypocrites, who, while carefully restraining themselves to
prevent any confident expression from escaping their lips, inwardly swell and
almost burst with contumacy.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Joshua oversteps
the bounds of moderation when he challenges God for having brought the people
out of the desert; but he proceeds to much greater intemperance when, in
opposition to the divine promise and decree, he utters the turbulent wish, Would
that we had never come out of the desert! That was to abrogate the divine
covenant altogether. But as his object was to maintain and assert the divine
glory, the vehemence which otherwise might have justly provoked God was
excused.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We are hence taught that saints, while
they aim at the right mark, often stumble and fall, and that this sometimes
happens even in their prayers, in which purity of faith and affections framed to
obedience ought to be especially manifested. That Joshua felt particularly
concerned for the divine glory, is apparent from the next verse, where he
undertakes the maintenance of it, which had been in a manner assigned to him.
What shall I say, he asks, when it will be objected that the people turned their
backs? And he justly complains that he is left without an answer, as God had
made him the witness and herald of his favor, whence there was ground to hope
for an uninterrupted series of victories. Accordingly, after having in the
loftiest terms extolled the divine omnipotence in fulfillment of the office
committed to him, it had now become necessary for him, from the adverse course
of events, to remain ignominiously silent. We thus see that nothing vexes him
more than the disgrace brought upon his calling. He is not concerned for his own
reputation, but fears lest the truth of God might be endangered in the eyes of
the world.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f67</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In short, as it was only by the order of
God that he had brought the people into the land of Canaan, he now in adversity
calls upon him as author and avenger, just as if he had said, Since thou has
brought me into these straits, and I am in danger of seeming to be a deceiver,
it is for thee to interfere and supply me with the means of
defense.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the Canaanites and all
the inhabitants</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc He mentions another
ground of fear. All the neighboring nations, who, either subdued by calamities
or terrified by miracles, were quiet, will now resume their confidence and make
a sudden attack upon the people. It was indeed probable, that as the divine
power had crushed their spirit and filled them with dismay, they would come
boldly forward to battle as soon as they knew that God had become hostile to the
Israelites. He therefore appeals to God in regard to the future danger,
entreating him to make speedy provision against it, as the occasion would be
seized by the Canaanites, who, though hitherto benumbed with terror, will now
assume the aggressive, and easily succeed in destroying a panic-struck
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is manifest, however, from the last
clause, that he is not merely thinking of the safety of the people, but is
concerned above all for the honor of the divine name, that it may remain
inviolable, and not be trampled under foot by the petulance of the wicked, as it
would be if the people were ejected from the inheritance so often promised. We
know the language which God himself employed, as recorded in the song of Moses,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053226&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:26, 27)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"I would scatter them
into corners, I would make the remembrance of them cease among men; were it not
that I feared the wrath (pride) of the enemy, lest their adversaries should
behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the
Lord has not done all this."</font><br><font face="Palatino">The very thing,
then, which God declares that he was, humanly speaking, afraid of, Joshua wishes
now to be timelessly prevented; otherwise the enemy, elated by the defeat of the
people, will grow insolent and boast of triumphing over God
himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Joshua

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto
Joshua</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc God does not reprimand
Joshua absolutely for lying prostrate on the ground and lamenting the overthrow
of the people, since the true method of obtaining pardon from God was to fall
down suppliantly before him; but for giving himself up to excessive sorrow. The
censure, however, ought to be referred to the future rather than to the past;
for he tells him to put an end to his wailing, just as if he had said, that he
had already lain too long prostrate, and that all sloth must now be abandoned,
as there was need of a different remedy. But he first shows the cause of the
evil, and then prescribes the mode of removing it. He therefore informs him that
the issue of the battle was disastrous, because he was offended with the
wickedness of the people, and had cast off their
defense.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We formerly explained why the
punishment of a private sacrilege is transferred to all; because although they
were not held guilty in their own judgment or that of others, yet the judgment
of God, which involved them in the same condemnation, had hidden reasons into
which, though it may perhaps be lawful to inquire soberly, it is not lawful to
search with prying curiosity. At the same time we have a rare example of
clemency in the fact, that while the condemnation verbally extends to all,
punishment is inflicted only on a single family actually polluted by the crime.
What follows tends to show how enormous the crime was, and accordingly the
particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;g</font><font face="Palatino">
is not repeated without emphasis; as they might otherwise have extenuated its
atrocity. Hence, when it is said that they have <i>also </i>transgressed the
covenant, the meaning is, that they had not sinned slightly. The name of
covenant is applied to the prohibition which, as we saw, had been given; because
a mutual stipulation had been made, assigning the spoils of the whole land to
the Israelites, provided He received the first fruits. Here, then, he does not
allude to the general covenant, but complains that he was defrauded of what had
been specially set apart; and he accordingly adds immediately after, by way of
explanation, that they had taken of the devoted thing, and that not without
sacrilege, inasmuch as they had stolen that which he claimed as his own. The
term <i>lying </i>is here used, as in many other passages, for frustrating a
hope entertained, or for deceiving. The last thing mentioned, though many might
at first sight think it trivial, is set down, not without good cause, as the
crowning act of guilt, namely, that they had deposited the forbidden thing among
their vessels. Persons who are otherwise not wholly wicked are sometimes tempted
by a love of gain; but in the act of hiding the thing, and laying it up among
other goods, a more obstinate perseverance in evil doing is implied, as the
party shows himself to be untouched by any feelings of compunction. In the last
part of the 12th verse, the term anathema is used in a different sense for
execration; because it was on account of the stolen gold that the children of
Israel were cursed, and almost devoted to
destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Up, sanctify the
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Although the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;dq</font><font face="Palatino">
has a more extensive meaning, yet as the subject in question is the expiation of
the people, I have no doubt that it prescribes a formal rite of sanctification.
Those, therefore, who interpret it generally as equivalent to <i>prepare, </i>do
not, in my judgment, give it its full force. Nay, as they were now to be in a
manner brought into the divine presence, there was need of purification that
they might not come while unclean. It is also to be observed in regard to the
method of sanctifying, that Joshua intimates to the people a legal purgation.
But though the ceremony might be in itself of little consequence, it had a
powerful tendency to arouse a rude people. The external offering must have
turned their thoughts to spiritual cleanness, while their abstinence from things
otherwise lawful reminded them of the very high and unblemished purity which was
required. And they are forewarned of what is to take place, in order that each
may be more careful in examining himself. Nay, the Lord proceeds step by step,
as if he meant to give intervals for repentance; for it is impossible to imagine
any other reason for descending from tribe to family, and coming at length to
the single individual.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In all this we see the
monstrous stupor of Achan. Overcome perhaps by shame, he doubles his impudence,
and putting on a bold front, hesitates not to insult his Maker. For why, when he
sees himself discovered, does he not voluntarily come forward and confess the
crime, instead of persisting in his effrontery till he is dragged forward
against his will? But such is the just recompense of those who allow themselves
to be blinded by the devil. Then when first by the taking of his tribe and next
by that of his family, he plainly perceived that he was urged and held fast by
the hand of God, why does he not then at least spring forward, and by a
voluntary surrender deprecate punishment? It appears, then, that after he had
hardened himself in his wickedness, his mind and all his senses were charmed by
the devil.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Though God does not bring all guilty
actions to light at the very moment, nor always employ the casting of lots for
this purpose, he has taught us by this example that there is nothing so hidden
as not to be revealed in its own time. The form of disclosure will, indeed, be
different; but let every one reflect, for himself, that things which escape the
knowledge of the whole world are not concealed from God, and that to make them
public depends only on his pleasure. For though a sin may seem as it were to
have fallen asleep, it is however awake before the door, and will beset the
miserable man till it overtake and crush
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Joshua

me.	<b>19. </b>Tunc dixit Josue ad Achan, Fili mi, da nunc gloriam Jehovae Deo

it.	<b>21. </b>Vidi inter spolia pallium, Babylonicum bonum, et ducentos siclos

brought them unto the valley of Achor.	<b>24. </b>Tollensque igitur Josue Achan

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joshua said unto
Achan</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Although only by lot, which
seems to fall out fortuitously, Achan is completely caught; yet, as God has
declared that he will point out the guilty party, as if with the finger, Joshua
interrogates without having any doubt, and when the discovery is made, urges
Achan to confess it. It is probable, indeed, that this was the usual form of
adjuration, as we read in John's Gospel,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430924&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
9:24) that the scribes and priests used the same words in adjuring the blind man
whose sight our Savior had restored, to answer concerning the miracle. But there
was a special reason why Joshua exhorted Achan to give God the glory, because by
denying or equivocating he might have impaired the credit of the decision. The
matter had already been determined by lot. Joshua, therefore, simply orders him
to subscribe to the divine sentence, and not aggravate the crime by vain
denials.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He calls him son, neither ironically
nor hypocritically, but truly and sincerely declares that he felt like a father
toward him whom he had already doomed to death. By this example, judges are
taught that, while they punish crimes, they ought so to temper their severity as
not to lay aside the feelings of humanity, and, on the other hand, that they
ought to be merciful without being reckless and remiss; that, in short, they
ought to be as parents to those they condemn, without substituting undue
mildness for the sternness of justice. Many by fawning kindness throw wretched
criminals off their guard, pretending that they mean to pardon them, and then,
after a confession has been extracted, suddenly hand them over to the
executioner, while they were flattering themselves with the hope of impunity.
But Joshua, satisfied with having cited the criminal before the tribunal of God,
does not at all flatter him with a vain hope of pardon, and is thus more at
liberty to pronounce the sentence which God has
dictated.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Achan answered
Joshua</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc As he was now struck with
astonishment, he neither employs subterfuge, nor palliates the crime, nor
endeavors to give any coloring to it, but rather ingeniously details the whole
matter. Thus the sacred name of God was more effectual in extorting a confession
than any tortures could have been. Nor was the simplicity he thus displayed a
sure indication of repentance; being, as it were, overcome with terror, he
openly divulged what he would willingly have concealed. And it is no new thing
for the wicked, after they have endeavored for some time to escape, and have
even grown hardened in vice, to become voluntary witnesses against themselves,
not properly of their own accord, but because God drags them against their will,
and, in a manner, drives them headlong. The open answer here given will condemn
the hypocrisy of many who obscure the clear light by their subterfuges. The
expression is emphatic &#8212; thus and thus did I; meaning that each part of
the transaction was explained distinctly and in order. Nor does he only
acknowledge the deed, but by renouncing all defense, and throwing aside all
pretext, he condemns himself in regard to its atrocity. I have sinned, he says;
this he would not have said had he not been conscious of sacrilege, and hence it
appears that he did not pretend mistake or want of
thought.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So Joshua sent
messengers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Although it is not
singular for messengers to prove their obedience by running and making haste,
yet the haste which is here mentioned, shows how intent all were to have the
work of expiation performed as speedily as possible, as they had been filled
with the greatest anxiety in consequence of the stern denunciation &#8212; I
will not be with you until you are purged of the anathema. They therefore ran
swiftly, not merely to execute the commands of Joshua, but much more to appease
the Lord. The things carried off by stealth, when placed before their eyes, were
more than sufficient to explain the cause of the disgrace and overthrow which
had befallen them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It had been said that they
had turned their backs on the enemy, because, being polluted with the accursed
thing, they were deprived of the wonted assistance of God; it is now easy to
infer from the sight of the stolen articles, that the Lord had deservedly become
hostile to them. At the same time, they were reminded how much importance God
attached to the delivery of the first-fruits of the whole land of Canaan in an
untainted state, in order that his liberality might never perish from their
memory. They also learned that while the knowledge of God penetrates to the most
hidden recesses, it is in vain to employ concealment's for the purpose of
eluding his judgment.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f69</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joshua, and all Israel
with him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Achan is led without the
camp for two reasons; first, that it might not be tainted and polluted by the
execution, (as God always required that some trace of humanity should remain,
even in the infliction of legitimate punishments,) and secondly, that no
defilement might remain among the people. It was customary to inflict punishment
without the camp, that the people might have a greater abhorrence at the
shedding of blood: but now, a rotten member is cut off from the body, and the
camp is purified from pollution. We see that the example became memorable, as it
gave its name to the spot.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If any one is
disturbed and offended by the severity of the punishment, he must always be
brought back to this point, that though our reason dissent from the judgments of
God, we must check our presumption by the curb of a pious modesty and soberness,
and not disapprove whatever does not please us. It seems harsh, nay, barbarous
and inhuman, that young children, without fault, should be hurried off to cruel
execution, to be stoned and burned. That dumb animals should be treated in the
same manner is not so strange, as they were created for the sake of men, and
thus deservedly follow the fate of their owners. Everything, therefore, which
Achan possessed perished with him as an accessory, but still it seems a cruel
vengeance to stone and burn children for the crime of their father; and here God
publicly inflicts punishment on children for the sake of their parents, contrary
to what he declares by Ezekiel. But how it is that he destroys no one who is
innocent, and visits the sins of fathers upon children, I briefly explained when
speaking of the common destruction of the city of Jericho, and the promiscuous
slaughter of all ages. The infants and children who then perished by the sword
we bewail as unworthily slain, as they had no apparent fault; but if we consider
how much more deeply divine knowledge penetrates than human intellect can
possibly do, we will rather acquiesce in his decree, than hurry ourselves to a
precipice by giving way to presumption and extravagant pride. It was certainly
not owing to reckless hatred that the sons of Achan were pitilessly slain. Not
only were they the creatures of God's hand, but circumcision, the infallible
symbol of adoption, was engraved on their flesh; and yet he adjudges them to
death. What here remains for us, but to acknowledge our weakness and submit to
his incomprehensible counsel? It may be that death proved to them a medicine;
but if they were reprobate, then condemnation could not be
premature.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f70</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">It may be added, that the life which
God has given he may take away as often as pleases him, not more by disease than
by any other mode. A wild beast seizes an infant and tears it to pieces; a
serpent destroys another by its venomous bite; one falls into the water, another
into the fire, a third is overlain by a nurse, a fourth is crushed by a falling
stone; nay, some are not even permitted to open their eyes on the light. It is
certain that none of all these deaths happens except by the will of God. But who
will presume to call his procedure in this respect in question? Were any man so
insane as to do so, what would it avail? We must hold, indeed, that none perish
by his command but those whom he had doomed to death. From the enumeration of
Achan's oxen, asses, and sheep, we gather that he was sufficiently rich, and
that therefore it was not poverty that urged him to the crime. It must therefore
be regarded as a proof of his insatiable cupidity, that he coveted stolen
articles, not for use but for luxury.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joshua
said</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc The invective seems
excessively harsh; as if it had been his intention to drive the wretched man to
frantic madness, when he ought rather to have exhorted him to patience. I have
no doubt that he spoke thus for the sake of the people, in order to furnish a
useful example to all, and my conclusion, therefore, is, that he did not wish to
overwhelm Achan with despair, but only to show in his person how grievous a
crime it is to disturb the Church of God. It may be, however, that the haughty
Achan complained that his satisfaction, by which he thought that he had
sufficiently discharged himself, was not
accepted,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f71</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and that Joshua inveighed thus bitterly
against him with the view of correcting or breaking his contumacy. The question
seems to imply that he was expostulating, and when he appeals to God as judge,
he seems to be silencing an obstinate man. The throwing of stones by the whole
people was a general sign of detestation, by which they declared that they had
no share in the crime which they thus avenged, and that they held it in
abhorrence. The heap of stones was intended partly as a memorial to posterity,
and partly to prevent any one from imprudently gathering particles of gold or
silver on the spot, if it had remained unoccupied. For although the Lord had
previously ordered that the gold of Jericho should be offered to him, he would
not allow his sanctuary to be polluted by the proceeds of
theft.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto
Joshua</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc It was of great consequence
to Joshua, as well as the people, to inspire new courage, that they might
prepare with confidence to assault the city of Ai, from which they had lately
been repulsed with loss and greater disgrace. God, therefore, to inspire them
with intrepidity on this expedition, promises that he will give them the city.
With the same view he enjoins them to fight by stratagem more than open war, to
entice the enemy out, and to select a secret place for an ambuscade which might
take them by surprise. A few thousands might without any difficulty have been
overthrown by an immense host attacking the city suddenly and unexpectedly. But
as we formerly saw that the hearts of all had melted away, God consulted for
their weakness by laying no greater burden upon them than they were able to
bear, until they had recovered from their excessive panic, and could execute his
commands with alacrity.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is true, indeed, that
he now used their own exertion, partly that they might not always keep looking
for miracles, and so give themselves up to laziness, and partly that in
different and unequal modes of acting they might nevertheless recognize that his
power is the same. But care must be taken not to omit the special reason,
namely, that not having yet recovered from their terror, they could scarcely
have been induced to engage in an open conflict, had they not seen stratagem
employed as a subsidiary aid. The first place, however, is due to the promise,
Fear not, for I have delivered it into thy hands: for although it is verbally
directed to Joshua, it belongs in common to the whole people, as it was most
necessary that all to a man should be freed from anxiety and furnished with new
confidence. The order to burn the city like Jericho, appears to be a concession
to the popular feeling, the vengeance thus taken serving to wipe out the
remembrance of their disgrace. At the same time that they may engage in the
expedition more willingly, the spoils are left to them as the reward of
victory.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Joshua went that
night</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc It is not probable that all
were called out from the camp, but the army was composed of those who were more
accustomed to war. That it was sufficiently numerous appears from the fact, that
five thousand were withdrawn from it for ambuscade. At first thirty-five
thousand appear to be enumerated, but it is clear from the context that the
number was not so great. I am rather inclined to conjecture that thirty thousand
were led out for open fight, and that five thousand were specially set apart for
an ambuscade. Joshua hastens to execute the task assigned to him, commencing his
march in the morning, and in this haste we see how effectual the promise had
proved. Had not the mind of all been freed from fear he never could have found
them so prompt to obey.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Apparently, indeed,
little prudence is shown in sending so large a body to proceed by hidden paths
to a place suitable for ambuscade. For with whatever silence and composure they
might proceed, the mere movement of their feet must have caused a considerable
noise. Should any one say that there was nobody to meet them, as all the
inhabitants of the district had deserted the fields and taken refuge in the
city, we will find it mentioned shortly after, that before the Israelites came
near to the city their arrival was known by the king of Ai; and this could
scarcely have been without scouts. But granting that they met no one in the
fields, it was certainly a difficult matter to pass by, to select a suitable
place during night for an ambuscade, and to take possession of it without giving
some indication of their presence. With regard to the procedure of Joshua,
though he might see that the business could be accomplished by a smaller force,
he seems to have been compelled by the recent trepidation of the people to be
very careful not to engage them in any enterprise of danger. For had only a few
of the army been dispatched they would perhaps have declined a part by which
they were to be particularly exposed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Lord
meanwhile displays the greatest indulgence to his people in delivering up an
enemy that was to be so easily conquered. His wonderful favor especially appears
in blinding all of them, so that they have no suspicion of the ambuscade. I have
no doubt that when it is said they knew not of it, the writer of the history
means to draw attention to the rare and extraordinary kindness of God in so
covering, as it were, with the shadow of his hand, first, the thirty thousand
who accompanied Joshua, and then the five thousand, that they all escaped the
notice of the enemy. When mention is now made of five thousand, I do not
understand it to mean that Joshua furnished a new ambuscade, as if the number,
already excessive, were not sufficient, but that the writer now merely shows how
the thirty-five thousand whom Joshua had armed were distributed. For to what end
would so small a reinforcement have been given to so great a multitude? Besides,
the place where they are ordered to halt is the same as that which had been
previously pointed out; this could not apply to two separate bodies of
troops.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joshua and all Israel
made as if they were beaten</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc This is
another stratagem. By pretending flight they draw off the enemy to a distance,
leaving them no retreat afterwards into the city, which was in flames before
they suspected that any disaster was to be apprehended in their rear. Hence,
while the king of Ai pursues the Israelites as vanquished, the part of the army
which lay hid towards Bethel had sufficient time to take the city, and make it
too late for the inhabitants to perceive that they were utterly undone. For
after they had been already repulsed, and were everywhere slaughtered, they were
overwhelmed with despair on beholding the flames of the city, and so completely
surrounded that not an individual could
escape.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The question here asked by some, as to
whether it is lawful to overcome an enemy by wiles and stratagem, originates in
gross ignorance. First, it is certain that wars are carried on not merely by
striking blows; for those are considered the best commanders who accomplish more
by art and counsel than by mere violence; and secondly, the longer any one has
served so as to acquire experience, the better soldier he makes. If war, then,
is lawful, it is beyond all controversy that the usual methods of conquering may
be lawfully employed, provided always that there be no violation of faith once
pledged either by truce or in any other
way.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And there was not a man left in
Ai</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc It will be clear from the
context that some were taken in the city and slain, and therefore we must hold
that the sally was not by all universally, and that the old men and women and
many others unfit for war, did not rush forth into the fields; the meaning
simply is, that no garrison was left to defend the city. The same thing is said
of Bethel, and hence we may easily conjecture that Bethel, as it was a small
unimportant town, belonged to another power. The inhabitants, however, from
being unable to defend their own city, abandoned it, and offered their whole
force to the king of Ai, to whom they were perhaps tributaries. It is uncertain
whether they went to the king of Ai before the arrival of the Israelites, to
unite their forces with his in the contest, but the probability is, that as they
were unable to resist they had come by agreement into a fortified and more
populous city. They thought that they could not, possibly be safe unless they
were preserved under the shadow of a neighboring city superior to their
own.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto
Joshua</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc This passage shows, that
owing either to the strong fortifications of the city, or the valor of its
inhabitants, or the trepidation of the Israelites, the victory was difficult,
since God promises that he himself would take it by the lifting up of a spear.
Had success been beyond doubt, the symbol would have been superfluous; their
minds must therefore have been anxious and perplexed, since the Lord, to prevent
them from fainting, raises up a banner of confidence in the hand of Joshua. It
is true, indeed, that shortly after a different motive for raising the spear is
mentioned, when it is said, that in this way a signal was given to the
ambuscade, which accordingly rushed forth. But if it really was so used as a
signal, it will scarcely do to regard the spear as a manifestation of the
victorious power of God dispelling all doubt. Still, however, as it is not
expressly said that the spear was the cause which brought forth the soldiers who
had been placed in ambuscade, the truth may be that they came forth of their own
accord, either because it was the suitable time, or because the shouting and
noise made them aware that the battle had actually commenced. For it is scarcely
possible to believe that the spear was seen by them, when we consider the long
space which intervened, and more especially that Joshua was standing in a
valley. Moreover, if we hold that the lifting up of the spear, though intended
for a different purpose, had also the effect of inspiring them with additional
courage, there will be no absurdity in it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This
much ought to be regarded as certain, <i>first, </i>that by this solemn badge
they were rendered more certain of the happy issue of the battle; and
<i>secondly, </i>that Joshua had no other intention than to incite his troops
according to the command of God. For it is at last added, that Joshua did not
draw back his hand until the city was taken, the enemy everywhere destroyed, and
the war itself terminated. Hence it appears that he exhibited it in the middle
of the conflict as an ensign of triumph, that the Israelites might have no doubt
of success. For although he ordered them to engage and use their arms bravely,
he at the same time distinctly declared that they had already
conquered.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The course of the battle is rendered
somewhat obscure by the same thing being told twice, but the substance is
sufficiently plain. The children of Israel retreated feigning fear, and the
battle had not actually commenced before the inhabitants of Ai were precluded
from returning and defending their city. After the two armies had come to close
quarters, the ambuscade arose and made such haste that the flames of the
conflagration were rising from the city when the enemy turned their backs. From
this we may infer that the city was in the possession of the Israelites, but
that the chief slaughter took place when those who were in the city came forth
to take part in the battle, because the inhabitants, hemmed in on all sides,
found resistance and flight equally unavailing. They were thus seized with
despair, and, huddled together in a narrow space, were everywhere cut
down.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The statement, that the slaughter did not
take place in the city before those who had feigned flight returned, I
understand to mean, that the whole troops uniting their forces rushed in, seized
the prey, and slew all who might have been left. If any one objects that the
city was burnt while the battle was going on, I answer, that the fire was indeed
applied so as to let both armies know that the city was in possession of the
Israelites, but it was not actually destroyed by fire. It was not practicable in
a moment of time to seize and carry off the booty, nay, to bring the vessels and
a large part of the property without the walls; and it would have been absurd
voluntarily to destroy spoils which God had granted. We see, then, that the
first fire was not kindled for the purpose of destroying the whole city, but was
merely a partial conflagration giving intimation of its capture, and that the
Israelites entered at the open gates without bloodshed or a struggle. This is
confirmed shortly after, when the burning is ascribed to Joshua himself, not
only because it was burnt under his command, but because he was careful, after
returning from the battle, to see that it was utterly destroyed; as it is
immediately added that he made it a heap of stones in order that it might be a
perpetual desolation.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f72</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And so it was that all that fell
that day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc The meaning is not that
all the slain were inhabitants of Ai, but that all who dwelt in it were slain,
that not one escaped. It has already been seen that the inhabitants of Bethel
were mingled along with them; and as no mention of that city is afterwards made,
it may be conjectured with some probability that they had abandoned their own
town, which was little fortified, and betaken themselves for greater safety to
one which they hoped could be easily defended. The words, therefore, simply
mean, that all who had come out of the city and all who were found in it were
slain to a man. If any are rather disposed to think that this number of those
whose slaughter took place within the walls is confined to the aged, the sick,
the women and the children, I will not dispute the matter. Still, if we consider
that only a small town was conjoined with a city of no great extent or
population, it is more probable that the number comprehends those also who fell
in battle.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For Joshua drew not his hand
back</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc As by raising the spear he
gave sign and pledge of hope as it were from heaven, he did not cease to keep
the minds of his followers fixed upon it until they were masters of the city. By
thus persevering he sufficiently proved how far removed he was from ambition;
how free from doing anything in the way of vain ostentation. For it was just as
if he had resigned the office of leader, and transferred the whole praise of the
victory to God. How intrepid a warrior he was is plain from other passages. He
might now, too, have willingly discharged his military functions, and thus done
what was far better fitted to promote his reputation and glory. But as if his
hand had been fastened to the spear, he exhorts the soldiers to look to God
alone, to whom he resigns the success of the battle. By thus standing aloof he
profited more than if he had in all directions, and by his own hand, struck down
heaps of the enemy: at the same time his remaining at ease was more praiseworthy
than any degree of agility could have
been.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the king of Ai he
hanged</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Though he seems to have
treated the king with great severity in order to satisfy the hatred of the
people, I cannot doubt that he studied faithfully to execute the divine
judgment. Conquerors, indeed, are wont to spare captive kings, because their
rank seems to carry something venerable along with it, but the condition of
kings was different among those nations in which God wished particularly to show
how greatly he detested the wickedness which he had so long tolerated. For while
all were doomed to destruction, the divine vengeance justly displayed itself
with greater sternness and severity on the leaders, with whom the cause of
destruction originated.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We may add, that the
ignominious punishment inflicted on the king rendered it still less necessary to
deal leniently with the common people, and thus prevented the Israelites from
indulging an unseasonable mercy, which might have made them more sluggish or
careless in executing the work of universal
extermination.</font><br><font face="Palatino">God purposely delivered the king
alive into the hand of Joshua, that his punishment might be more marked and thus
better adapted for an example. Had he fallen in the conflict promiscuously with
others, he would have been exempted from this special mark of infamy; but now
even after his death, the divine vengeance pursues his corpse. Nay, after being
hung, he is thrown forth at the gate of the city where he had sat on his throne
in judgment, and a monument is erected for the purpose of perpetuating his
ignominy to posterity. His burial, however, is mentioned to let us know that
nothing was done through tumultuous impetuosity, as Joshua carefully observed
what Moses had prescribed in the Law,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;052123&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
21:23) namely, that those hung on gibbets should be taken down before sunset, as
a spectacle of the kind was held in abomination. And, certainly, while it is
humane to bury the dead under ground, it is inhumanly cruel to cast them forth
to be torn by wild beasts or birds. Therefore, that the people might not be
accustomed to barbarity, God allowed criminals to be hung, provided they did not
hang unburied for more than one day. And that the people might be more attentive
to this duty, which otherwise might readily have been neglected, Moses declares
that every one who hangs on a tree is accursed; as if he had said, that the
earth is contaminated by that kind of death, if the offensive object be not
immediately taken away.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Joshua

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Joshua built an
altar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc God had been pleased that
this should be the first extraordinary sacrifice offered to him in the land of
Canaan, that thus the people might attest their gratitude, and the land begin to
be consecrated in regular form. It was not possible for the people to do it
before freely and on their own soil, till they had obtained possession of some
vacant region.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f73</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now, God had at the same time given them
two commands &#8212; <i>first, </i>that they should erect an altar on Mount
Ebal; and <i>secondly, </i>that they should set up two stones plastered over
with lime, on which they should write the Law, in order that every passer by
might be able to see it and read it. We now read that both were faithfully
performed. A third command related to the recitation of blessings and cursings:
this, too, Joshua performed with no less
care.</font><br><font face="Palatino">To begin with the altar, &#8212; it is
said, that according to the divine command, it was formed of unhewn stones. For
entire stones on which the masons' iron has not been employed, are called rough
and unworked.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f74</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This is specially said in Deuteronomy 27,
of the altar, of which mention is now made. But the same thing had before been
said in general of all others. Some expounders, in searching for the reason,
needlessly have recourse to allegory, and allege that the hand and industry of
men are forbidden, because the moment we introduce any devices of our own, the
worship of God is vitiated. This is indeed truly and wisely said, but it is out
of place, as the divine intention simply was to prohibit the perpetuity of
altars. For we know, that in order to sacrifice duly, it was enjoined that all
should have one common altar, in order both to cherish mutual agreement, and to
obviate all sources of corruption from the introduction of an adventitious
superstition; in short, in order that religion might remain one and simple, as a
variety of altars would soon have led to discord, thereby distracting the people
and putting sincere piety to flight.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Then it was
not left to the choice of the people to select a place, but God uniformly in the
books of Moses claims this for himself. He therefore confines the exercises of
piety to that place where he may have put the remembrance of his name. Moreover,
as the divine will was not immediately manifested, nor the place designated,
that worship might not in the mean time cease, it was permitted to build an
altar where the ark should happen to be stationed, but an altar formed only of a
rude pile of stones, or of turf, that it might be only
temporary.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Let the reader observe that an option
was given to the people to make it of rough stones, that its form might not
attract veneration, or of earth, which would crumble away of its own accord. In
one word, this arrangement tended to give a pre-eminence to the perpetual altar,
after God made choice of Mount Zion for its locality. Hence it is said in the
Psalm, I was glad because our feet will stand in thy courts, O Jerusalem!
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19C201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
122:1, 2) What other translators render
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peace
offerings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>I have, not without cause,
rendered by <i>sacrifices of prosperity, </i>because they were offered up either
to solicit successful results, or to render thanks; and the Hebrew term is not
unsuitable, as the reader will find more fully explained in my commentaries on
the books of Moses.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>32.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he wrote there upon the
stones</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc A different rule is
applicable to the stones here mentioned, on which God wished that a memorial of
his Law should always appear, in order that, a kind of barrier might be
interposed to protect the pure religion against the superstitions of Egypt. They
were therefore covered with lime, that they might be more conspicuous, and the
writing upon them more distinct. I willingly subscribe to the opinion of those
who understand by the repeated Law a written form, or what is commonly called a
copy or duplicate. I cannot, however, believe that the whole volume was traced
upon it; for no stones however large could suffice to contain all the details. I
therefore think that by the term Law only its substance and
sanctions</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f75</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> are denoted. This made it palpable even
to strangers entering the land what God was worshipped in it, and all excuse for
error was taken away, when the Law was not treasured up in a book, but made
manifest to the eyes of all. In short, though the priests should have been dumb,
the stones themselves spoke clearly.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>33.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And all Israel, and their
elders</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc The third instance of
obedience was the placing all the tribes on Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal to
stand in six rows each over against each other. For they were so arranged that
six stood on Mount Ebal, and an equal number on the opposite Mount Gerizim. The
intervening space was occupied by the Levites with the ark of the covenant, that
the Lord might be surrounded on all sides by his own people. It is said that
Joshua stood that he might first bless the people, as it was the purpose of God
to allure the people to himself by sweetness and winning condescension. For
although Moses, to rebuke the obstinacy of the people, makes mention of curses
only, it is certain that these were in a manner accidental, because the genuine
method was to employ blessings as a means of gaining over to obedience those who
might otherwise have proved refractory. But when humane invitation proved
unavailing, curses were added as a new resource and
remedy.</font><br><font face="Palatino">God had promised ample rewards to his
servants who should obey the Law. On the other hand, curses were denounced in
order to deter transgressors. Each is now forced to subscribe his own
condemnation, while an amen is responded to every single sentence. For in this
way they not only hear themselves condemned by the mouth of God, but as if they
had been heralds sent by him, they denounce the punishment which may await
themselves. A similar promulgation was made in the plain of Moab beyond the
Jordan, but now they are bound more solemnly, and acknowledge on what condition
they are to dwell in the land of Canaan. It added no little weight to the whole,
that the children also were admitted as witnesses.</font><br></div>

the kings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. As the arrival of the
people was well known to these kings from the very first, it is certain that
their minds were intoxicated from above with security or lethargy, so that they
did not forthwith league together to oppose them. It implied excessive stupor
not to provide for themselves till they were violently roused to exertion by the
overthrow of two
cities.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

of voluntary surrender to send no aid to their neighbors, nay, to have no army
ready, which might make a powerful impression for their defense. But in this way
God spared the weakness of his people, to whom the combined forces of so many
nations would have caused no small fear.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is
certain, then, that by the sloth and torpor of their enemies, the Israelites
were rendered more expeditious. For an interval was, in the meanwhile, given
them to compose themselves, and thus those whom the mere name of enemies might
have alarmed, prepare leisurely to encounter

unassailable power of God. A report of the taking of Jericho had reached them.
Had it been overthrown by the counsel, or the acting, or the prowess, or the
engines of men? Nay, the walls had fallen of their own accord. With what
confidence then can they league to take up arms against
heaven?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when the inhabitants of
Gibeon heard</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc. </i>The inhabitants of
Gibeon alone rejecting the proposal to make war have recourse to fraud, and
endeavor to obtain peace by pretending to live at a great distance. To make such
an attempt, was very odious to their neighbors, because it was, in a manner, to
make a schism among them, to open a door to the Israelites, and weaken the
strength of their allies. And though blame is justly due to the foolish
credulity of Joshua and the rulers, who were under no obligation to bargain
rashly in regard to a matter not properly investigated, <i>yet </i>the Lord, who
is wont to bring light out of darkness, turned it to the advantage of his
people; for it procured them an interval of relaxation, while they halted in a
tranquil district.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Gibeonites, indeed,
judged rightly and prudently, when they resolved to bear anything sooner than
provoke God more against them, by a vain resistance. But the employment of fraud
and illicit arts, to <i>circumvent </i>those whose favor and protection they
desired to enjoy, was no less absurd and ridiculous than at variance with reason
and equity. For what could be the stability of a league which was founded in
nothing but gross fraud? They pretend that they are foreigners who had come from
a far distant country. Joshua, therefore, is bargaining with mere masks, and
contracts no obligation except in accordance with their words. Hence the craft
by which they insinuated themselves ought not to have availed them. Still, as a
great degree of integrity yet existed among men, they deemed it enough to obtain
an oath even extorted by fraud, feeling fully persuaded, that the people of
Israel would not violate it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The expression,
that they too acted cunningly, is erroneously supposed by some to contain an
allusion to the stratagem which Joshua had employed in deceiving the citizens of
Ai no less inaccurately do others make it refer to the time of Jacob, whose
sons, Simeon and Levi,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f79</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> had treacherously destroyed the
Sichemites. (Genesis 34) The antithesis is merely between the hostile
preparations of the kings and the secret wiles with which the Gibeonites
accosted Joshua. Accordingly, after it is stated, that some had leagued with the
intention of trying the result of open war, the trick of the Gibeonites is
subjoined, and hence the meaning is, that Joshua had to do not only with
professed enemies, who had gathered themselves together to battle, but with the
crafty dissimulation of one nation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is asked,
however, why the Gibeonites labored so anxiously in a matter which was not at
all necessary? For we shall see elsewhere that the Israelites were ordered to
offer peace to all, that <i>they </i>might thereafter have a just and legitimate
cause for declaring war. But as it was everywhere rumored, that they were
seeking a permanent settlement in the land of Canaan, (which they could not
obtain except by expelling the inhabitants,) the Gibeonites conclude that there
is no means of binding them to mercy except by imposing upon them in some way or
other; as they would never have spontaneously and knowingly allowed the land
which they had invaded to be occupied by others. Nay, as it was known that they
had been commanded to destroy all, they had no alternative left but to have
recourse to fraud, as all hope of obtaining safety was otherwise taken away. And
for this reason they shortly after ask pardon for a fraud wrung from them by
necessity.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here, however, a question arises; as
the Israelites object that they are not at liberty to make any paction with the
nations of Canaan, but are bound to exterminate them utterly. There is certainly
a discrepancy between the two things &#8212; to exhort to submission, and at the
same time refuse to admit suppliants and volunteers. But although God required
that the laws of war should be observed according to use and wont, and that,
therefore, peace should be offered on condition of submitting, he merely wished
to try the minds of those nations, that they might bring destruction upon
themselves by their own obstinacy. At the same time, it was intimated to the
Israelitish people, that they must destroy them; and hence the conclusion
necessarily followed, that those who dwelt in the land of Canaan could not be
tolerated, and that it was unlawful to make a covenant with
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We shall afterwards find both things
distinctly expressed, viz., that all persisted in carrying on war, because it
had been the divine intention that their hearts should be hardened, and that
they should perish. It was, therefore, a legitimate inference that those who
were doomed to death could not be preserved. If any one object that the
Gibeonites, who voluntarily applied for peace, were therefore exceptions, I
answer, that the Israelites were not at present considering that formal custom
which produced no result, but are merely attending to the promise and the
command of God. Hence it is, that they allow no hope to remain, because they had
been simply and precisely commanded to purge the land by putting <i>every
</i>individual to death, and to succeed to the place of those they had
slain.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they went to
Joshua</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. I have said that in strict
law, a covenant of this description was null and void. For when they obtain
their prayer, what is stipulated but just that they should be kept safe,
provided they come from a distant and remote region of the globe? And the
oftener they reiterate the same falsehood, the more do they annul a compact
elicited by fraud, since its true meaning only amounts to this, that the
Israelites will offer no molestation to a foreign people, living at a remote
distance. This is shown to be more especially the meaning, from the fact, that
the Israelites expressly exclude all the inhabitants of the land of Canaan. They
could not, therefore, gain anything by the fraud. Nor are they more assisted by
making a fallacious pretext of the name of God, and thus throwing a kind of mist
over the mind of Joshua. They pretend that they had come in the name of God; as
if they were professing to give glory to God, even the God of Israel; inasmuch
as there is a tacit rejection of the superstitions to which they had been
accustomed. For if it is true, that they had come, moved by the faith of the
miracles which had been performed in Egypt, they concede supreme power to the
God of Israel, though to them a God
unknown.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the men took of their
victuals</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc. </i>Some commentators here
have recourse to the insipid fictions that they ate the bread, to ascertain from
the taste whether it were stale from age, or that they confirmed the covenant by
a feast. The words rather, in my opinion, are an indirect censure of their
excessive credulity in having, on slight grounds acquiesced in a fabulous
narrative, and in having attended merely to the bread, without considering that
the fiction was devoid of color. And, certainly, had not their senses been
blunted, many things would have instantly occurred to refute the
Gibeonites.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

therefore a sign of gross <i>carelessness, </i>when a priest was ready to seek
an answer from God, by means of Urim and Thummim, to decide rashly in an obscure
case, as if they had no means of obtaining advice. Their rashness was the less
excusable, from being combined with such supine neglect of the grace of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Joshua

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to
pass</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. The chastisement of their
levity by the discovery of the fraud, three days after, must, by the swiftness
of the punishment, have made them more sensible of the shame and disgrace. For
it was thus known, that through sloth and lethargy, they had very stupidly
fallen into error from not having taken the trouble to inquire into a matter
almost placed before their eyes. Their marching quietly through that region,
entering cities without trouble, and finding free means of sustenance, was owing
to the paternal indulgence of <i>God, </i>who not only pardons their fault, but
causes that which might justly have been injurious to turn out to their good.
Here it is related that the children of Israel did not act in a hostile manner
in that region, because the Gibeonites had received a promise of safety
confirmed by an oath.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now two questions arise<i>
&#8212; first, </i>Whether the children of Israel, who had no intention whatever
to pledge their faith to impostors, had contracted any obligation? and,
<i>secondly, </i>Whether it was not in the option of the people to rescind a
promise which their leaders had foolishly and erroneously made? In regard to the
general position, the obligation of an oath ought to be held in the greatest
sacredness, so that we may not, under the pretext of error, resile from
pactions, even from those in which we have been deceived, since the sacred name
of God is more precious than the wealth of a whole
world.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f81</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence though a man may have sworn with
little consideration, no loss or expense will free him from performance. I have
no doubt, that in this sense David says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191504&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
15:4,) that the true worshippers of God, if they have sworn to their hurt,
change not, because they will bear loss sooner than expose the name of God to
contempt, by retracting their promises.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I
conclude, therefore, that if a private interest only is to be affected,
everything which we may have promised by oath must be performed. And it is
apparent from the words, that the Israelites were afraid lest they should expose
the name of their God to disgrace among the nations of Canaan. For I think there
is an emphasis in the expression &#8212; because they had sworn by the God of
Israel. But a special reason left the Israelites at liberty to recede from the
deceitful compact; for they had not only given up their own right, but
improperly departed from the command of God, with which it was not lawful to
interfere in the smallest iota. It was not in their power either to spare the
vanquished or enact laws of surrender, whereas they now transact as if the
business had been committed to them. We see, accordingly, that they twice
profaned the name of God, while, under pretence of the oath, they persevered in
defending what they had foolishly promised.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In
the deference which the common people pay to their leaders, by abstaining from
all violence to the Gibeonites, we behold the integrity of the age. Elsewhere it
would have readily occurred to elude the promise by asserting that a whole
people were not bound by the agreement of a few individuals, as the Romans did,
in repudiating the Caudine peace, to which only the consuls, legates, and
tribunes had sworn without the orders of the senate and people. The more praise,
therefore, is due to that rude simplicity in which the religious obligation
prevailed more than the too subtle arguments which the greater part of men in
the present day approve and applaud. The people are indeed indignant that their
leaders had taken more upon them than they were entitled to do, but their
moderation does not allow them to proceed beyond murmur and
noise.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f82</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This we will do to
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. Although, according to
agreement, they give the Gibeonites their lives, <i>they </i>ratify the whole
covenant only in part. For while the Gibeonites were entitled to be made
perfectly secure, they are deprived of liberty, which is dearer than life. From
this we infer that Joshua and the others had, as in a case of doubt and
perplexity, devised a kind of middle course, so as not to make the oath
altogether void. The principal object of this device was to appease the
multitude: at the same time, while they were indignant at having been imposed
upon by the Gibeonites, they punished the fraud, and did not allow impunity to
increase their derision. It was a harsh condition, in this arrangement, that the
Gibeonites were not only doomed to servile labors but withdrawn from their
homes, to lead a vagrant and wandering life. The <i>office </i>of scullions
imposed on them was no less mean than laborious, but the worst, of all was to
hew wood and draw water, wherever God should be pleased to station the
ark.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joshua called for
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc. </i>As he was to deliver a sad
and severe sentence, he premises that the resolution involves no injustice,
because nothing would be more unbecoming than to allow tricks and wiles to be
profitable to those who employ them. He therefore first expostulates with them
for having warded off danger by falsehood, and then immediately pronounces them
cursed. By this I understand that he throws the blame of their servitude upon
themselves, because they bear nothing worse than they have deserved by their
guile or perfidy; as if he had said that the ground of the condemnation which he
pronounces is in themselves. It is hard, indeed, that no end is assigned to the
labors to which they are doomed, for this is implied in the words, Slaves shall
never cease from among you: but he declares that no injustice is done them, as
they were cursed of their own accord, or by their own fault. They, indeed,
extenuate the offense, by alleging the necessity which compelled them, and yet
they decline not the punishment, which they acknowledge to be justly inflicted.
It may indeed be, that overcome with fear, they refused nothing, nay, calmly and
flatteringly</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f83</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">acquiesced
in the terms imposed on them. For what could they gain by disputing? I have no
doubt, however, that as they were conscious of having done wrong, and had no

pass</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc He had formerly briefly
glanced at, but now more fully details the conspiracy of the kings, who dwelt
both in the mountains and in the plain. For after mentioning that they were
struck with fear, and leagued together to make common war, he had broken off
abruptly, and proceeded to speak of the Gibeonites. But what he had previously
said of the kings in general, he now applies only to one individual; not because
Adoni-zedek alone was afraid, but because he stirred up all the others, and was
the principal originator and leader in carrying on the war against the
Israelites. This is sufficiently expressed by the plural number of the verb; for
it is said, When Adoni-zedek had heard &#8212; they feared greatly. From this it
appears that they were all of the same mind, but that while some of them held
back from fear, he who possessed greater authority, and was nearer the danger,
invited the four others to
arms.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f86</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">In the beginning of the chapter it is
again told, how the five kings formed an alliance to meet the Israelites, and
ward off the overthrow with which they were all threatened. But as the
Gibeonites had meanwhile surrendered, they first turned their arms against them,
both that by inflicting punishment upon them, as the betrayers of their country,
they might make them an example to all their neighbors, and that by striking
terror into those vanquished enemies, they might also inspire their own soldiers
with confidence. They resolve, therefore, to attack the Gibeonites who, by their
embassy, had made a disruption and opened a passage to the Israelites. They had,
indeed, a fair pretext for war, in resolving to punish the effeminacy of those
who had chosen to give their sanction to strangers, about to lay the whole
country waste, rather than faithfully defend their neighbors. And the Gibeonites
experienced how useless their crafty counsel must have been, had they not been
saved in pity by the Israelites. Meanwhile the Lord allowed them to be involved
in danger, in order that, being twice freed, they might more willingly and
meekly submit to the yoke.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the men of Gibeon sent
unto Joshua</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc The course of the
narrative is inverted; for the Gibeonites certainly did not wait till they were
besieged, but on seeing an army levied and prepared, and having no doubt that
they would have to sustain the first onset, as they had incurred general hatred,
they anticipate the attack, and hasten to have recourse to the protection of
Joshua.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f87</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> To desert those to whom life had been
given, would have been at once unlawful, unjust, and inhumane. Nay, as their
surrender had been consequent on the agreement, they were entitled to be
defended against violence and injury. With justice, therefore, they implore the
Israelites, under whose protection they were; and there is no hesitation on the
part of Joshua, who judges it to be his duty to defend those whose submission he
had agreed to accept. They had deceived him, it is true, but after the fraud had
been detected, and they had confessed it, interposing some palliating
circumstances, they had obtained pardon.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Equity
and a sense of duty thus did not allow the Israelites to abandon the Gibeonites
to their fate. Still, Joshua is entitled to praise for his promptitude in
complying with the request, and sending assistance without delay. He is said to
have marched during the whole night, and thus could not have proceeded with
greater haste had the safety of the whole people been at stake. Had the same
sincerity always been evinced by profane nations, they would rather have
assisted their allies in due time than avenged their disasters after they had
suffered them. The term <i>suddenly </i>ought not, however, to be confined to a
single day, as if Joshua had accomplished three days' journey in a single night,
and made his appearance among the Gibeonites next morning. All that is meant to
be expressed is his great speed, and his not delaying his departure till next
day.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f88</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">Though the Israelites moved their camp
from Ai or that neighborhood, it was the third day before they entered the
confines of the Gibeonites. Granting that they then proceeded slowly in order of
battle, Joshua was still at some distance when application is made to him to
assist the Gibeonites. We have seen that Gilgal was the first station after
crossing the Jordan, and therefore more remote than Jericho. If any one deems it
absurd, that after receiving the submission of several cities, he should have
turned backwards, and left an empty district, the recovery of which from the
enemy might again cost new labor, I answer, there was no ground to fear that the
enemy would come forward to occupy it, and engage in an expedition attended with
great danger and difficulty. It is probable that when a body of troops was
selected to attack Jericho, the women, children, and all others unfit for war
remained in that quiet corner, where they might have the protection of those of
the Reubenites, Gadites, and half tribe of Manasseh, who had been left on the
opposite bank of the Jordan. For to what end would they have carried with them
into their battles children and women heavy with child, or nursing babes at
their breasts? How, during the incursions of the enemy, could food be found for
such a multitude, or water sufficient to supply all their flocks and herds? I
conclude, therefore, that Joshua and his soldiers returned to their tents that
they might refresh themselves for a little with their wives and children, and
there deposit the spoils with which they had been
enriched.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>.
And the Lord discomfited them,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>etc It is
uncertain whether the Lord anticipated the movement, and armed Joshua by his
oracle, drawing him forth from Gilgal before he had taken any step, or whether
he only confirmed him after he had made his preparations for setting out. It
seems to me more likely that Joshua did not rush forth as soon as he was asked
without consulting God, but at length, after being informed of his will, took up
arms boldly and speedily. As he had lately been chastised for excessive
facility, it is at least a probable conjecture that in this case of difficulty,
he attempted nothing except in so far as he had a divine command. The Lord,
therefore, had respect to the wretched Gibeonites when he did not allow them to
remain destitute without the assistance of his
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Joshua is made confident of victory in
order that he may succor them; for God stimulates us more powerfully to the
performance of duty by promising than by ordering. That which is here promised
to one belongs to all, but for the sake of honoring Joshua, it is specially
deposited with him that he may afterwards be the bearer of it to his army. For
God does not speak from heaven indiscriminately to all sorts of persons, but
confers the honor only on excellent servants and chosen
prophets.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is moreover worthy of notice that
Joshua did not abuse the divine promise by making it an excuse for sluggishness,
but felt the more vehemently inflamed after he was assured of a happy issue.
Many, while they ostentatiously express their faith, become lazy and slothful
from perverse security. Joshua hears that victory is in his hand, and that he
may gain it, runs swiftly to battle. For he knew that the happy issue was
revealed, not for the purpose of slackening his pace or making him more remiss,
but of making him exert himself with greater zeal. Hence it was that he took the
enemy by surprise.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord discomfited
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc In the first slaughter the
Lord exerted his own might, but used the swords of the people. Hence we infer
that whenever he works by men, nothing is detracted from his glory, but whatever
is done redounds to him alone. For when he employs the co-operation of men, he
does not call in allies as a subsidiary force, or borrow anything from them; but
as he is able to accomplish whatever he pleases by a mere nod, he uses men also
as instruments to show that they are ruled by his hand and will. Meanwhile it is
said with truth in either way, that the enemy were routed and crushed by God, or
by the Israelites, inasmuch as God crushed them by the instrumentality of the
Israelites.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the second slaughter the hand of
God appeared more clearly, when the enemy were destroyed by hail. And it is
distinctly stated that more were destroyed by hail than were slain by the sword,
that there might be no doubt of the victory having been obtained from heaven.
Hence again it is gathered that this was not common hail, such as is wont to
fall during storms. For, in the first place, more would have been wounded or
scattered and dispersed than suddenly destroyed; and secondly, had not God
darted it directly, part would have fallen on the heads of the Israelites. Now,
when the one army is attacked separately, and the other, kept free from injury,
comes forward as it were to join auxiliary troops, it becomes perfectly clear
that God is fighting from heaven. To the same effect it is said that God threw
down great stones of hail from heaven: for the meaning is that they fell with
extraordinary force, and were far above the ordinary size. If at any time, in
common battles, a storm has suddenly arisen, and has proved useful to one of the
parties, God has seemed to give that party a token of his favor and hence the
line, Dearly beloved of heaven is he on whose side the elements are
enlisted.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f89</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Here we have the account of a more
distinguished miracle, in which the omnipotence of God was openly
displayed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then spoke Joshua to the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Such is the literal reading,
but some expound it as meaning <i>before </i>Jehovah: for to speak to God, who,
as piety dictates, is to be suppliantly petitioned, seems to be little in
accordance with the modesty of faith, and it is immediately subjoined that
Joshua addressed his words to the sun. I have no doubt that by the former clause
prayer or vow is denoted, and that the latter is an expression of confidence
after he was heard: for to command the sun to stand if he had not previously
obtained permission, would have been presumptuous and arrogant. He first, then,
consults God and asks: having forthwith obtained an answer, he boldly commands
the sun to do what he knows is pleasing to
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And such is the power and privilege of the
faith which Christ inspires,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401720&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
17:20;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;421706&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
17:6) that mountains and seas are removed at its command. The more the godly
feel their own emptiness, the more liberally does God transfer his power to
them, and when faith is annexed to the word, he in it demonstrates his own
power. In short, faith borrows the confidence of command from the word on which
it is founded. Thus Elias, by the command of God, shut and opened the heaven,
and brought down fire from it; thus Christ furnished his disciples with heavenly
power to make the elements subject to
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Caution, however, must be used, lest any
one may at his own hand presume to give forth rash commands. Joshua did not
attempt to delay and check the course of the sun before he was well instructed
as to the purpose of God. And although, when he is said to have spoken with God,
the words do not sufficiently express the modesty and submission which become
the servant of God in giving utterance to his prayers, let it suffice us briefly
to understand as implied, that Joshua besought God to grant what he desired, and
on obtaining his request, became the free and magnanimous herald of an
incredible miracle unlike any that had previously taken place. He never would
have ventured in the presence of all to command the sun so confidently, if he
had not been thoroughly conscious of his vocation. Had it been otherwise, he
would have exposed himself to a base and shameful affront. When, without
hesitation, he opens his mouth and tells the sun and the moon to deviate from
the perpetual law of nature, it is just as if he had adjured them by the
boundless power of God with which he was invested. Here, too, the Lord gives a
bright display of his singular favor toward his Church. As in kindness to the
human race he divides the day from the night by the daily course of the sun, and
constantly whirls the immense orb with indefatigable swiftness, so he was
pleased that it should halt for a short time till the enemies of Israel were
destroyed.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the sun stood

stood in Gibeon, is no less unseasonably raised by some than unskillfully
explained by others.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f91</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For Joshua did not subtlety place the sun
in any particular point, making it necessary to feign that the battle was fought
at the summer solstice, but as it was turning towards the district of Ajalon as
far as the eye could discern, Joshua bids it stay and rest there, in other
words, remain above what is called the horizon. In short, the sun, which was
already declining to the west, is kept from
setting.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f92</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">I do not give myself any great anxiety
as to the number of the hours; because it is enough for me that the day was
continued through the whole night. Were histories of that period extant, they
would doubtless celebrate this great miracle; lest its credibility, however,
should be questioned, the writer of this book mentions that an account of it was
given elsewhere, though the work which he quotes has been lost, and expounders
are not well agreed as to the term Jazar. Those who think Moses is meant, insist
on referring the example which is here given to general predictions. As Moses
applies this name to the chosen people, it is more congruous to hold that
commentaries on the events in their history are meant. I, for my part,
understand by it either God or Israel, rather than the author of a
history.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

the shadow of the sun was carried back over ten degrees on which it had gone
down. It is not, therefore, absolutely denied that anything similar had ever
been conceded to any other person, but the miracle is extolled as singular. The
rendering of the word

f96</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for shortly after the end of the battle
is added, and the punishment inflicted on the kings, which was subsequent to the
battle. We are then told of the encampment in Makkedah, and at last, in the end
of the chapter, the return to Gilgal, which was introduced at the beginning
without regard to the order of time, is repeated. Hence the narrative of the
flight and concealment of the kings is connected with the former transactions.
For having been informed during the heat of the battle that they were hiding in
a cave, Joshua, fearing that if he were to set about capturing them, the others
might escape, prudently contented himself with ordering the mouth of the cave to
be blocked up with large stones, and setting sentinels over them, that being
thus shut up, as it were in prison, they might at a fit time be brought forth
and put to death. Hence, too, it appears that the army of the enemy was very
large, because although the Israelites pressed closely upon them in their
flight, and the sun himself gave an additional period for slaying them, it was
impossible, notwithstanding, to prevent numbers of them from escaping into
fortified cities. The divine assistance afforded to the Israelites was, however,
sufficiently attested by the fact that they continued till they were wearied
slaying at will all whom they met, and then returned safe. For the expression,
that no one dared to move the tongue, implies that the Israelites gained a
bloodless victory,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

completely routed, Joshua is now free, and, as it were, at leisure, to inflict
punishment on the kings. In considering this, the divine command must always be
kept in view. But for this it would argue boundless arrogance and barbarous
atrocity to trample on the necks of kings, and hang up their dead bodies on
gibbets. It is certain that they had lately been raised by divine agency to a
sacred dignity, and placed on a royal throne. It would therefore have been
contrary to the feelings of humanity to exult in their ignominy, had not God so
ordered it. But as such was his pleasure, it behooves us to acquiesce in his
decision, without presuming to inquire why he was so
severe.</font><br><font face="Palatino">At the same time, we must recollect, as
I formerly hinted, first, that all from the least even to the greatest were
deserving of death, because their iniquity had reached the highest pitch, and
the kings, as more criminal than the others, deserved severer punishment; and
secondly, that it was expedient to give an example of inexorable rigor in the
person of the kings, whom the people, from a perverse affectation of clemency,
might have been too much disposed to pardon. It was the will of God that all
should be destroyed, and he had imposed the execution of this sentence on his
people. Had he not stimulated them strongly to the performance of it, they might
have found specious pretexts for giving pardon. But a mercy which impairs the
authority of God at the will of man, is
detestable.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

the nations who were in the land of Canaan before you. Beware, therefore, of
provoking the wrath of your God by their perverse doings. In one word, that God
might be worshipped with greater sanctity, he ordered the land to be purged of
all pollutions, and as the inhabitants had been excessively wicked, he willed
that his curse should rest upon them in a new and unwonted
manner.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joshua said unto them, Fear
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc </i>Joshua now triumphs in the
persons of the five kings over all the others who remained. For he exhorts his
own people to confidence, just as if those who still stood unsubdued were
actually prostrate under their feet. Hence we gather, that by the trampling down
of a few, the whole people were so elated, that they looked down with contempt
on all the others, as if they were already overthrown. And, certainly, we have
here a brighter display of the divine power, which could thus inspire confidence
for the future.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is to be observed, however,
that the kings were hung up, not for the purpose of exercising greater severity
upon them, but merely by way of ignominy, as they were already slain. It was
expedient that this memorable act of divine vengeance should be openly displayed
in the view of all. Perhaps, also, it was the divine purpose to infuriate the
other nations by despair, and drive them to madness, that they might bring down
swifter destruction on themselves, whetting the wrath of the Israelites by their
obstinacy. The same ignominy is inflicted on the king of Makkedah, though he had
not led out his forces, and a similar destruction is executed on the whole
people, who had kept quiet within their
walls.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

made some hostile attempt, but the special reason was, that God had passed the

evening, I have elsewhere explained. Moreover, this whole history holds up to us
as in a mirror, how, when the Lord is seated on his tribunal, all worldly
splendor vanishes before him, and the glory of those who seemed to excel is
turned by his judgment into the greatest
disgrace.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Joshua

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Joshua.
passed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc We have now a description of
the taking of the cities, out of which the army of the enemy had been raised;
and herein God displayed his power no less wonderfully than in the open field,
especially when the rapidity is considered. For although those who had fled
hither in trepidation might have produced some degree of panic, still, when the
fear was allayed, they might be useful for
defense.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f100</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The garrison had been increased by their
numbers. When, therefore, in a short period of time, Joshua takes all the
cities, and gains possession of the smaller towns, the presence of God was
conspicuously manifested in a success no less incredible than unexpected. For
had they, when attacked, only shut their gates, as Joshua had not brought either
ladders by which he might scale the walls, or engines by which he might throw
them down, each siege might have been attended with considerable fatigue and
delay. Therefore, when he takes one the following day, and another the very day
after attacking it, these continued, easy, and rapid victories, are evidently
beyond human agency.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Not without cause, then, in
the end of the chapter, is the goodness of God expressly celebrated, as it had
been made manifest that he was fighting for Israel, when Joshua at once took and
vanquished so many kings, with their territories. Indeed, he could never, even
in a course of inspection, have passed so quickly from city to city, had not a
passage been divinely opened by the removal of obstacles. The miracle was
increased when the king of Geser, who had come to the help of others, doubtless
with full confidence in the result, was suddenly put to rout, almost without an
effort, and did not even delay the advance of the Israelites. Those who were
slain in the cities represent, as in a mirror, those whose punishment the
Almighty holds suspended, while he actually takes vengeance on others. For
though they plume themselves on the reprieve thus afforded them, their condition
is worse than if they were immediately dragged to
death.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f101</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It looks as if it would have been a dire
calamity to fall in the field of battle; and making their escape, they seek
safety within their walls. But what awaited them there was much more dreadful.
Their wives and their children are butchered in their sight, and their own death
is more ignominious than if they had perished sword in hand. Hence there is no
reason to envy the reprobate the short time which the Lord sometimes grants
them, because when they have begun to promise themselves safety, sudden
destruction will come upon them. (1 Thessalonians
5:3.)</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f101a</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Meanwhile, let us learn not to abuse
the patience of God when he defers to execute his judgment, and, instead of
indulging in self-complacency when we seem to have been delivered from any
danger, or when means of escape from it present themselves, let us reflect on
the words of Jeremiah,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;242402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
24:2) that while the basket of early
figs</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f102
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">had at least some savor, the other was so
sour that they could not be eaten.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>40.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So Joshua smote all the
country</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Here the divine authority
is again interposed in order completely to acquit Joshua of any charge of
cruelty. Had he proceeded of his own accord to commit an indiscriminate massacre
of women and children, no excuse could have exculpated him from the guilt of
detestable cruelty, cruelty surpassing anything of which we read as having been
perpetrated by savage tribes scarcely raised above the level of the brutes. But
that at which all would otherwise be justly horrified, it becomes them to
embrace with reverence, as proceeding from God. Clemency is justly praised as
one of the principal virtues; but it is the clemency of those who moderate their
wrath when they have been injured, and when they would have been justified, as
individuals, in shedding blood. But as God had destined the swords of his people
for the slaughter of the Amorites, Joshua could do nothing else than obey his
command.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By this fact, then, not only are all
mouths stopped, but all minds also are restrained from presuming to pass
censure. When any one hears it said that Joshua slew all who came in his way
without distinction, although they threw down their arms and suppliantly begged
for mercy, the calmest minds are aroused by the bare and simple statement, but
when it is added, that so God had commanded, there is no more ground for obloquy
against him, than there is against those who pronounce sentence on criminals.
Though, in our judgment at least, the children and many of the women also were
without blame, let us remember that the judgment-seat of heaven is not subject
to our laws. Nay, rather when we see how the green plants are thus burned, let
us, who are dry wood, fear a heavier judgment for ourselves. And certainly, any
man who will thoroughly examine himself, will find that he is deserving of a
hundred deaths. Why, then, should not the Lord perceive just ground for one
death in any infant which has only passed from its mother's womb? In vain shall
we murmur or make noisy complaint, that he has doomed the whole offspring of an
accursed race to the same destruction; the potter will nevertheless have
absolute power over his own vessels, or rather over his own
clay.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f103</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">The last
verse</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

that the fixed station of the whole people was in Gilgal; and that the soldiers
who had gone out to war, returned thither, both that they might rest from their
fatigues, and place their booty in safety. It would not have been proper to
allow them to be more widely scattered till the casting of the lot had shown
where each was to have his permanent abode.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass when
Jabin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc In this new league also we
have a bright manifestation of the more than paternal care of God, in warding
off dangers from his people, and also in assisting their weakness by kindness
and indulgence. Had Jabin, with the confederates of whom mention is now made,
openly declared himself the ally of the neighboring kings, a much more
formidable war would have broken out against the Israelites, and greater
solicitude and anxiety must have seized their minds. It would, indeed, have been
easy for the Lord, as well to put all their forces at once to the rout, as to
dissipate all fear and dread of them. He was unwilling, however, to press beyond
measure his own people, who were otherwise feeble, lest the excessive numbers of
the enemy should strike them with terror, and drive them to despair. He
therefore kept the many nations, whose interest it was to have rushed hastily to
arms, in a state of lethargy and amazement, until the chosen people had been
animated by signal victories, to carry on the wars which still remained. They
pillage and devastate a large territory, and leave it destitute of inhabitants
and stript of resources. None of the neighboring powers, who were afterwards to
act on the offensive, makes the least movement. The Israelites revisit their
wives and children in safety. When they had gathered courage, and were ready for
a new war, suddenly a very large army appears, composed of different nations,
who had hitherto, by remaining quiet, furnished opportunity for victory. Their
coming thus forward at a later period, was the same as if they had entered into
a truce. Thus God not only fought for his chosen people, but by dividing the
enemy, increased their strength manifold.</font><br><font face="Palatino">How
formidable must the onset have been, had not the Israelites been gradually
trained to confidence in battle, and at the same time experienced the manifest
assistance of God? First, their numbers are compared to the sand of the sea, and
then they have horses and chariots. As the Israelites were altogether destitute
of cavalry, it is strange that they were not terrified at this array. Therefore
they were gradually brought forward till they were able to bear it. For, in
their former battles, he had only exercised them by a kind of pleasing
preludes.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f105</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It may be added, that the Lord had, by
several victories, ever and anon borne testimony to his power, that they might
not think more lightly of it than was meet. Had all their enemies been routed at
once, they might, indeed, have magnificently celebrated the praises of God, but
they might also have easily lost the remembrance of them. It was necessary,
therefore, that repeated proofs distinct and apart from each other, should be
held forth to their view, lest they might attribute one victory to a stroke of
fortune.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And the Lord said unto, Joshua</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc The
greater the labor and difficulty of destroying an army, so numerous and so well
equipped, the more necessary was it to inspire them with new confidence. The
Lord, therefore, appears to his servant Joshua, and promises the same success as
he had previously given him on several occasions. It is to be carefully
observed, that as often as he reiterates his promises men are reminded of their
forgetfulness, or their sloth, or their fickleness. For unless new nourishment
is every now and then given to faith, they forthwith faint and fall
away.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f106</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And yet such is our perverse
fastidiousness, that to hear the same thing twice is usually felt to be irksome.
Wherefore let us learn, as often as we are called to engage in new contests, to
recall the remembrance of the divine promises, which may correct our languor, or
rouse us from our sloth. And especially let us make an application of that which
is here said in general, to our daily practice; as the Lord now intimates, that
that which he had declared concerning all nations would be specially sure and
stable on the present occasion.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We infer from
the account of the time employed, that these kings had marched a considerable
distance, in order to attack Joshua and the people in Gilgal. For immediately
after the divine intimation, mention is made of the expedition used by
Joshua.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f107</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He is promised the victory on the
following day. Hence they were not far distant. And the lake of Merom, where
they had pitched their camp, is contiguous to the Jordan, and much nearer to
Gilgal than Gennesaret, from which district some of the enemy had
come.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f108</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is said that this lake diminishes or
increases according to the freezing of the snow on the mountains, or to its
melting. Moreover, the command given to Joshua and the people, to cut the legs
or thighs of the horses, and to burn the chariots, was undoubtedly intended to
prevent them from adopting those more studied modes of warfare which were in use
among profane nations. It was indeed necessary that they should serve as
soldiers, and fight strenuously with the enemy, but still they were to depend
only on the Lord, to consider themselves strong only in his might, and to
recline on him alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This could scarcely have
been the case, if they had been provided with cavalry, and an array of chariots.
For we know how such showy equipment dazzles the eye, and intoxicates the mind
with overweening confidence. Moreover, a law had been enacted,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051716&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
17:16) that their kings were not to provide themselves with horses and chariots,
obviously because they would have been extremely apt to ascribe to their own
military discipline that which God claimed for himself. Hence the common saying,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;192007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
20:7)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Some trust in chariots
and some in horses,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">but we will
remember the name of the Lord our God."</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God wished to deprive them of all stimulants to
audacity, in order that they might live quietly contented with their own limits,
and not unjustly attack their neighbors. And experience showed, that when a bad
ambition had impelled their kings to buy horses, they engaged in wars not less
rashly than unsuccessfully. It was necessary, therefore, to render the horses
useless for war, by cutting their sinews, and to destroy the chariots, in order
that the Israelites might not become accustomed to the practices of the
heathen.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>

inferred from this, that the slaughter continued as far as Sidon, which was far
distant from the lake of Merom. Sidon is called great, from its celebrity as a
commercial emporium and the great number of its inhabitants. There is no
comparison instituted between it and a minor town of same name. The Hebrew noun
Mozerephoth, which some retain without change as a proper name, we have
preferred to translate "the boiling of the waters," because it is probable that
there were thermal springs there, which boiled. Moreover, as the panic which
hurried them away into such a scattered flight, plainly shows that they were
driven headlong by the secret terror of the Lord. So it is certain that the
Israelites who dared to follow the fugitives through so many dangers were
carried to a higher pitch of valor than human by celestial
agency.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Praise is bestowed on Joshua as well for
his abstinence as for his prompt obedience. Nor would he have submitted so
willingly to the loss of so many horses and chariots, had not the fear of God
overawed him. For such is our ingenuity in devising pretexts, it would have been
plausible to allege, that though he could not fit them for military use, still
their value was by no means to be despised. But he thought that he had no right
to take anything into consideration but the pleasure of God. Then, as he had
succeeded by his own good conduct, in making the people willing and obedient,
he, as an individual, justly received the praise of what had been performed
generally by all.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>

began to plunder and lay waste the country, and to take and demolish the towns.
From its being said that the cities which remained entire were not burned, it
may be inferred with some probability, that some were taken by force and
assault, and so razed. Hazor, alone, after the siege was over, and the heat of
the struggle had cooled, was destroyed by fire, because it had held forth the
torch which enkindled the war. But in accordance with the explanation already
given, it is repeatedly and more clearly stated in this passage, that Joshua did
not give loose reins to his passion, when he slew all from the least to the
greatest. For there is now a distinct statement of what had not yet been
expressed, namely, that Joshua faithfully performed his part, by fulfilling
everything which the Lord had enjoined by Moses. It is just as if he had placed
his hands at the disposal of God, when he destroyed those nations according to
his command. And so ought we to hold that, though the whole world should condemn
us, it is sufficient to free us from all blame, that we have the authority of
God.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

to let us know that the work which God had begun he continued to carry on
without interruption. But it is a mistake to suppose: as some do, that by the
name Israel a certain mountain is meant. For it will be plain, from the end of
the chapter,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;061121&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joshua
11:21) that the term is applied indiscriminately to the mountainous part of
Israel and Judah. There is therefore an enlarge in the enumeration, because the
mountains of the ten tribes are tacitly compared with the mountains of Judah.
Accordingly, an antithesis is to be understood. In the other mountain
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;061117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joshua

destitute of trees, just as a head is rendered smooth by baldness. As the point
is uncertain, and of little importance, the reader is at liberty to make his
choice.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Joshua made war a long

time, and, as it were, with the swiftness of running, seized possession of five
kingdoms; in the others the case was different, not from hesitation, or
weariness, or sloth, but because the Lord exercised his people variously, that
he might give a brighter display of his manifold grace, which usually loses its
value in our eyes, if it is exhibited only in one and the same way. Therefore,
as the divine power had formerly been signally manifested by incredible facility
of accomplishment, when the enemy were routed in an instant, so a lingering
warfare now furnished numerous proofs of heavenly
aid.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f111</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Nor did this happen suddenly and
unexpectedly; for God had foretold by Moses that so it would be, lest, if the
land were at once converted into a desert, the wild beasts might gain the
ascendancy.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050722&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
7:22) In short, we here perceive, as in a mirror, that whatever the Lord had
promised by Moses was accomplished in reality, and by no dubious event. But
while we recognize the certainty of the promises of God, we ought also to
meditate on the favor confirmed towards his chosen people, in that he acted as
the provident head of a family, not neglecting or omitting anything which tended
to their advantage.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There was not a city that
made peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc This sentence appears,
at first sight, contradictory to what is everywhere said in the books of Moses,
that the Israelites were not to enter into any league with those nations, or
make any terms of peace with them, but, on the contrary, to destroy them
utterly, and wipe out their race and name.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;022332&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
23:32;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
7:2)</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f112</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Seeing the nations were thus excluded
from the means of making any paction, and would in vain have made any proposals
for peace, it seems absurd to ascribe the destruction, which they had not even
the means of deprecating, to their
obstinacy.</font><br><font face="Palatino">For, let us suppose that they had
sent ambassadors before them with olive branches in their hands, and had been
intent on pacific measures, Joshua would at once have answered that he could not
lawfully enter into any negotiation, as the Lord had forbidden it. Wherefore,
had they made a hundred attempts to avoid war, they must, nevertheless, have
perished. Why, then, are they blamed for not having sought peace, as if they had
not been driven by necessity to right, after they saw they had to do with an
implacable people? But if it was not free to them to act otherwise, it is unjust
to lay any blame upon them when they acted under compulsion in opposing the fury
of their enemy.</font><br><font face="Palatino">To this objection, I answer,
that the Israelites, though they were forbidden to show them any mercy, were met
in a hostile manner, in order that the war might be just. And it was wonderfully
arranged by the secret providence of God, that, being doomed to destruction,
they should voluntarily offer themselves to it, and by provoking the Israelites
be the cause of their own ruin. The Lord, therefore, besides ordering that
pardon should be denied them, also incited them to blind fury, that no room
might be left for mercy. And it behooved the people not to be too wise or prying
in this matter. For while the Lord, on the one hand, interdicted them from
entering into any covenant, and, on the other, was unwilling that they should
take hostile measures without being provoked, a too anxious discussion of the
procedure might have greatly unsettled their minds. Hence the only way of
freeing themselves from perplexity was to lay their care on the bosom of God.
And he in his incomprehensible wisdom provided that when the time for action
arrived, his people should not be impeded in their course by any obstacle. Thus
the kings beyond the Jordan, as they had been the first to take up arms, justly
suffered the punishment of their temerity. For the Israelites did not assail
them with hostile arms until they had been provoked. In the same way, also, the
citizens of Jericho, by having shut their gates, were the first to declare war.
The case is the same with the others, who, by their obstinacy, furnished the
Israelites with a ground for prosecuting the
war.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It now appears how perfectly consistent the
two things are. The Lord commanded Moses to destroy the nations whom he had
doomed to destruction; and he accordingly opened a way for his own decree when
he hardened the reprobate. In the first place, then, stands the will of God,
which must be regarded as the principal cause. For seeing their iniquity had
reached its height, he determined to destroy them. This was the origin of the
command given to Moses, a command, however, which would have failed of its
effect had not the chosen people been armed to execute the divine judgment, by
the perverseness and obstinacy of those who were to be destroyed. God hardens
them for this very end, that they may shut themselves out from
mercy.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f113</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence that hardness is called his work,
because it secures the accomplishment of his design. Should any attempt be made
to darken so clear a matter by those who imagine that God only looks down from
heaven to see what men will be pleased to do, and who cannot bear to think that
the hearts of men are curbed by his secret agency, what else do they display
than their own presumption? They only allow God a permissive power, and in this
way make his counsel dependent on the pleasure of men. But what says the Spirit?
That the hardening is from God, who thus precipitates those whom he means to
destroy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And at that time came
Joshua</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc Of the sons of Anak we have
spoken elsewhere. They were a race of giants, with the account of whose mighty
stature the spies so terrified the people, that they refused to proceed into the
land of Canaan. Therefore, seeing they were objects of so much dread, it was of
importance that they should be put out of the way, and the people made more
alert by their good hopes of success. It would have been exceedingly
injurious</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f114</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to keep objects which filled them with
alarm and anxiety always present before their minds, inasmuch as fear obscured
the glory ascribed to God for former victories, and overthrew their faith, while
they reflected that the most difficult of all their contests still awaited them.
Therefore, not without cause is it mentioned among the other instances of divine
aid, that by purging the land of such monsters, it was rendered a fit habitation
for the people. The less credible it seemed that they could be warred against
with success, the more illustriously was the divine power
displayed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>

being true that Joshua had actually acquired the whole land, yet he is truly
said to have obtained it as God had declared to Moses, the latter clause
restricting the meaning of the general sentence. For it had been expressly added
that the conquest which God had promised would be made gradually, lest it should
afterwards become necessary to war with the ferocious wild beasts of the woods,
if they pressed forward into a desert waste. Therefore, we are at liberty to
say, that though the Lord had not yet placed his people in possession of the
promised land, yet he had virtually performed what he had agreed to do, inasmuch
as he gave a commodious habitation, and one which was sufficient for the present
time. And the words used imply that other district, which had not yet come into
their full and actual possession, are included; for it is said that that which
they had acquired was distributed according to families. And, in short, we
afterwards see in the division that the lands were divided into lots which were
not actually subdued by the people till Joshua was dead, nay, till many ages
after.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

Now Joshua was old</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
etc</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f122</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Since we have seen above that the land
was pacified by the subjugation of thirty-one kings, it is probable that some
cessation now took place for the purpose of resting from their fatigues, lest
the people should be worn out by continual service. Nor could that justly be
blamed, provided they rested only for a time and continued always intent on the
goal set before them. But lest that intermission which was given for the purpose
of recruiting new vigor might prove an occasion of sloth, the Lord employs a new
stimulus to urge them to proceed. For he orders the whole inheritance to be
divided into tribes, and the whole line of the Mediterranean coast which was
possessed by the enemy to be put into the lot. A division of this kind might
indeed seem absurd and ludicrous, nay, a complete mockery, seeing they were
dealing among themselves with the property of others just as if it had been
their own. But the Lord so appointed for the best of reasons. <i>First, </i>they
might have cast away the hope of the promise and been contented with their
present state. Nay, although after the lot was cast they had security in full
for all that God had promised, they by their own cowardice, as far as in them
lay, destroyed the credit of his words. Nor was it owing to any merit of theirs
that his veracity did not lie curtailed and mutilated. The allocation by lot
must therefore have been to them an earnest of certain possession so as to keep
them always in readiness for it. <i>Secondly, </i>Those who happened to have
their portion assigned in an enemy's country, inasmuch as they were living in
the meanwhile as strangers on precarious hospitality beyond their own
inheritance, must have acted like a kind of task-masters spurring on the others.
And it surely implied excessive stupor to neglect and abandon what had been
divinely assigned to them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We now see to what
intent the whole land behooved to be divided by lot, and the seat of each tribe
allocated. It was also necessary that this should be done while Joshua was
alive, because after his death the Israelites would have been less inclined to
obedience, for none of his successors possessed authority sufficient for the
execution of so difficult a task. Moreover, as God had already by the mouth of
Moses commanded it to be done, had he not performed the business thus committed
to him, the whole work might have gone to wreck when the lawful minister was
removed. Although the exact time is not stated, still it is probable that as
there was no hope that while Joshua continued alive the people would again take
up arms with the view of giving a wider extent to their boundaries, he then only
attempted to divide the land, as if he were proclaiming and promising, by a
solemn attestation, that the distribution would certainly be carried into
effect, because the truth of God could not fail in consequence of the death of
any
man.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
This is the land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc The ancient
boundaries long ago fixed by God, are recalled to remembrance, in order that
Joshua. and the people may feel fully persuaded that the covenant made with
Abraham would be fulfilled in every part. Wherefore they are enjoined to make it
their study to acquire the parts still remaining to be possessed. The inference
will be appropriate if we make a practical application of this perseverance to
that which is required of us, viz., to forget the things which are behind, and
reach forth unto those that are before, and press toward the mark for the prize
of our high calling. (Philippians
3:14.)</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f122a</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For it would be of no use to run in the
race without endeavoring to reach the goal.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
boundary commenced with a river separating Egypt toward the sea from the Holy
Land, and most probably the river Nile, as we interpret it according to the
received opinion, or a small stream which flowed past the town of Rhinocornea,
believed by many to be Raphia or
Raphane.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f123
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">It is indeed beyond dispute that the
inheritance of the people commencing in that quarter was contiguous to Egypt.
But although I have followed the opinion of the majority of expositors, that the
boundaries were not extended further than to the less cultivated and in a manner
desert land, lest greater proximity might have been injurious by leading to too
close familiarity with the Egyptians, I by no means repudiate a different
opinion.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The third verse raises a question.
After it is said that the territories towards the sea-coast were five, a sixth
is added, namely, that of the Avites. Some think that it is not counted among
the five because it was an insignificant province. But I would have my readers
to consider whether there may not be an indirect antithesis between a free
people, their own masters, and five territories ruled by sovereigns. Hence the
Avites being in different circumstances are mentioned separately, the plural
number being used for the sake of distinction. In the enumeration of the
sovereignties they are not arranged in the order of their dignity or opulence,
but the first place is given to Aza because of its nearness to Egypt, and the
same remark applies to Ashdod and the
others.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Septuagint translators, according to
their usual custom, employ the Greek

8:26,) Luke speaks of "Gaza which is desert," it appears that a city of the same
name was erected near it, but on a different site. Ashdod is the same as that
which the Greeks called Azotus. The whole of this tract, which is either on the
sea-coast or verging towards it, extends as far as Sidon. And there are some who
think that the Phoenicians were once masters both of Gaza and Azotus. How far
Lebanon extends is sufficiently
known.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

All the inhabitants of the hill country</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

those regions, not to defer the partition, but trust to the promise of God,
because it would detract injuriously from his honor if there were any doubt as
to the event. It is accordingly said: Only do what is thy duty in the
distribution of the land; nor let that which the enemy still hold securely be
exempted from the lot; for it will be my care to fulfil what I have promised.
Hence let us learn in undertaking any business, so to depend on the lips of God
as that no doubt can delay us. It is not ours, indeed, to fabricate vain hopes
for ourselves; but when our confidence is founded on the Lord, let us only obey
his commands, and there is no reason to fear that the event will disappoint
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He afterwards assigns the land of Canaan to
nine tribes and a half tribe, because the portion of the Reubenites, Gadites,
and half tribe of Manasseh had already been assigned beyond the Jordan. Though
there is a seeming tautology in the words, Which Moses gave them, as Moses gave
them, there is nothing superfluous, because in the second clause the donation is
confirmed; as if God were ordering that which was done to be ratified, or
saying, in other words, As Moses gave them that land, so let them remain
tranquil in the possession of
it.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

necessary, lest the Levites might allege that they were unjustly disinherited,
and thus excite great commotions in regard to their right. He therefore reminds
them that Moses was the author of this distinction, and, at the same time, shows
that they have no reason to complain of having been in any way defrauded,
because an excellent compensation was given them. For although the sacrifices
were not equally divided among the Levites, their subsistence was sufficiently
provided for by all the first-fruits and the tithes. Moreover, as God allures
them by hire to undertake the charge of sacred things, so he exhorts the people
in their turn to be faithful in paying the sacred oblations by declaring that
their sacrifices are the maintenance of the

with sufficient clearness he now follows more fully in detail, not only that the
reading might incite the people to gratitude, seeing the divine goodness
recorded in public documents, and, as it were, constantly before their eyes, but
also that each might enjoy his inheritance without molestation and quarrel. For
we know how ingenious human cupidity is in devising pretexts for litigation, so
that no one can possess his right in safety unless a plain and perspicuous
definition of his right make it impossible to call it in question. That country
had been given without casting lots. It was therefore open to others to object
that the just proportion had not been kept, and that the inequality behooved to
be corrected. Therefore, that no unseasonable dispute might ever disturb the
public peace, the boundaries are everywhere fixed by the authority of God, and
disputes of every kind are removed by setting up landmarks. God does not by one
single expression merely adjudge the whole kingdom of Sihon to the tribe of
Reuben, but he traces their extreme limit from Aroer to the banks of the Arnon,
and thus, making an entire circuit, contracts or widens their territory so as
not to leave the possession of a single acre ambiguous. Moreover, how useful
this exact delineation was may be learned from profane history, where we
everywhere meet, not only with invidious but pernicious disputes among neighbors
as to their boundaries.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We may add that the care
which the Lord condescended to take in providing for his people, and in
cherishing mutual peace among them, demonstrates his truly paternal love, since
he omitted nothing that might conduce to their tranquillity. And, indeed, had
not provision been thus early made, they might have been consumed by intestine
quarrels.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

if I do not labor anxiously in describing the situation of towns, and am not
even curious in regard to names. Nay, I will readily allow those names which it

and so far altered as to give them a Latin
form.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f131</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">It is worthy of notice, that when the
land of the Midianites is referred to, the princes who ruled over it are called
Satraps of Sihon, to let us know that they shared in the same overthrow, because
they had involved themselves in an unjust war, and belonged to the government of
Sihon, an avowed enemy. And to make it still more clear that they perished
justly, it is told that among the slain was Balaam, by whose tongue they had
attempted to wound the Israelites more grievously than by a thousand
swords;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

slaughter they found the hostile banner, by which they had declared themselves

interpret that Jordan was a boundary to them according to its

observation made above applies also to the tribe of Gad, namely, that their
legitimate boundaries were carefully defined in order to prevent disputes as to
their possession. Meanwhile God is extolled for his liberality in having
expelled nations of great celebrity, and substituted them in their stead. This
is expressed more clearly in regard to the half tribe of Manasseh, when sixty
cities are enumerated as included in their inheritance. Hence, too, it is
manifest that Moses was not munificent through mistake, because it was well
known to God how many cities he was giving them out of his boundless liberality.
In a short clause the tribe of Levi is again excluded, that the Levites might
not be able at some future period to pretend that the grant which the
Reubenites, Gadites, and half tribe of Manasseh had obtained without the casting
of lots, belonged in common to them also; for they are expressly forbidden to
share with their brethren. This made it easy for them to interpret shrewdly for
their advantage, that they were entitled to share with others. Here, however, it
is not the sacrifices, as a little before, but God Himself that is said to be
their inheritance; if they are not satisfied with it, they only convict
themselves of excessive pride and insufferable
fastidiousness.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And these are the
countries</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc He now proceeds to the
land of Canaan, from which nine tribes and a half were to obtain their lots. And
he will immediately break off the thread of the narrative, as we shall see. Yet
the transition is seasonably made from that region whose situation was
different, to let the reader know that the discourse was to be concerning the
land of Canaan, which was to be divided by lot. We have said that Joshua and
Eleazar not only divided what the Israelites had already acquired, but trusting
in the promise of God, confidently included whatever he had promised to his
people, just as if they had been in actual possession of it. We shall see,
indeed, that the division was not all at once made complete, but when the first
lot turned up in favor of Judah, the turns of the others were left in
hope.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here a difficult question arises. How can
it be said that the distribution of the land was made by Joshua, Eleazar, and
the princes, if lots were cast? For the lot is not regulated by the opinion or
the will or the authority of man. Should any one answer, that they took charge
and prevented any fraud from being committed, the difficulty is not removed,
nay, this evasion will be refuted from the context. It is to be known,
therefore, that they were not selected simply to divide the land by lot, but
also afterwards to enlarge or restrict the boundaries of the tribes by giving to
each its due proportion. That this business could not be accomplished by a naked
lot is very apparent. For while, according to human ideas, nothing is more
fortuitous than the result of a lot, it was not known whether God might choose
to place the half tribe of Manasseh where the tribe of Judah obtained its
settlement, or whether Zebulun might not occupy the place of Ephraim. Therefore
they were not at liberty at the outset to proceed farther than to divide the
land into ten districts or provinces. In this way, however, the space belonging
to each would remain indefinite. For had an option been given to each, some
would have chosen to fix themselves in the center, others would have preferred a
quiet locality, while others would have been guided in their choice by the
fertility of the soil, or the climate and beauty of the scenery. But the lot
placed the tribe of Judah, as it were, at the head, while it sent that of
Zebulun away to the seashore, placed the tribe of Benjamin adjacent to that of
Judah, and removed that of Ephraim to a greater distance. In short, the effect
of the lot was that ten divisions fell out from Egypt towards Syria, and from
the north quarter to the Mediterranean Sea, making some neighbors to the
Egyptians, and giving to others maritime positions, to others hilly districts,
to others intervening valleys.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This being
understood, the office remaining for the rulers of the people was to trace out
the boundaries on all sides in accordance with the rules of equity. It remained,
therefore, for them to calculate how many thousand souls there were in every
tribe, and to assign more or less space to each, according to the greatness or
the smallness of their numbers. For in conformity to the divine command, a due
proportion was to be observed, and a larger or narrower district was to be
assigned, according as the census which was taken had ascertained the numbers to
be. (Numbers 26) To the judgment of the princes was it in like manner left to
shape the territories, regulating the length and breadth as circumstances might
require. It is necessary also to bear in mind what is said in Numbers 26, that
the ten who are here called heads of families were appointed to execute this
office, not by the suffrages of men, but by the voice of God. Thus each tribe
had its own overseers to prevent either fraud or violence from being committed.
Then it would have been impious to have any suspicion of those who had been
nominated by God. Such is the manner in which Joshua may be said to have
distributed the land, though it was portioned out by
lot.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They gave no part unto the
Levites</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc It is here repeated for the
third time with regard to the Levites, that they were not included in the
number, so as to have the portion of a tribe assigned to them; but it is
mentioned for a different purpose, for it is immediately after added, that the
sons of Joseph were divided into two tribes, and were thus privileged to obtain
a double portion. Thus had Jacob prophesied, (Genesis 49) or rather, like an
arbiter appointed by God, he had in this matter preferred the sons of Joseph to
the others. God therefore assumed the Levites to himself as a peculiar
inheritance, and in their stead substituted one of the two families of
Joseph.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Then the children of Judah came</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc
Here the account which had been begun as to the partition of the land is broken
off to make way for the insertion of a narrative, namely, that Caleb requested
Mount Hebron to be given to him as he had been promised by Moses. This happened
a long time before the people had ceased from making war, and it became
necessary to cast lots. It is stated to be the fifth year since their entrance
into the land, and he does not ask for a locality to be given up to him which
was already subdued and cleared of the enemy, but in the midst of the noise and
heat of warfare, he asks to be permitted to acquire it by routing and slaying
its giants. He only seeks to provide, that when his valor has subdued the
giants, he is not to be defrauded of the reward of his labor. The method of so
providing, is to prevent its being included in the common lot of a tribe.
Accordingly, he does not put forth the claim by himself alone, but the members
of his tribe, the sons of Judah also concur with him, because the effect of
conferring this extraordinary benefit on one family was so far to make an
addition to all. Hence though Caleb alone speaks, all the tribe whose interest
it was that his request should be granted were
present.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I am not clear why the surname of
Kenite was given to Caleb. He is so called also in Numbers 32. I am not unaware
of the conjecture of some expositors, that he was so surnamed from Kenas,
because either he himself or some one of his ancestors dwelt among the Kenites.
But I see no solid foundation for this. What if he gained this title by some
illustrious deed, just as victors sometimes assume a surname from the nations
they have subdued? As the promise had not been inserted into any public record,
and Joshua was the only witness now surviving, he makes his application to him.
And it is probable that when the ten spies made mention of the names of the
Anakim, with the view of terrifying the people, Caleb, to refute their
dishonesty, answered with truth, that when he beheld them on Mount Hebron, they
were so far from being terrible, that he would attack them at his own hand,
provided that on their expulsion he should succeed to their lands; and that on
these conditions Moses ceded to him a habitation in that locality which he
should have acquired by his own
prowess.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Forty years old was
I</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc He seems to talk of his own virtue in
rather loftier terms than becomes a pious and modest man. But let us remember
that, seeing the thing was in itself invidious and liable to many objections, it
stood in need of special commendation as a means of suppressing envy. He
therefore mentions that he had acted in good faith in bringing back an account
of what he had learned concerning the land. For the expression, "As it was in my
heart," evidently denotes sincerity, the heart being thus opposed to deceitful
words. It is a ridiculous fiction to imagine that he had said it in his heart,
because from fear of being killed by his companions he had not ventured to
mention anything of the kind by the way. Nothing more is meant than simply this,
that he acted honestly according to the command given him, without gloss or
dissimulation. He enlarges on the merit of his integrity, because though he was
opposed by all his colleagues, with the exception of Joshua, he did not yield to
their malice, nor was dispirited by their iniquitous conspiracy, but steadfastly
pursued his purpose. The words taken in their most literal sense are, I filled
or fulfilled to go after thy God; but the obvious meaning is, that he was not
seduced from a faithful discharge of his duty by the wicked machination of ten
men, however difficult it was to resist them, because he followed God with
inflexible perseverance, feeling perfectly assured that God was the author of
the expedition, from which those perfidious men were endeavoring to draw off the
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Let us learn from this passage, first,
that unless the last part corresponds to the first, good beginnings vanish away;
secondly, that constancy is deserving of praise only when we follow
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses swear on that
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Here, then, is one fruit of the
embassy honestly and faithfully performed &#8212; to gain possession of an
inheritance of which the whole people is deprived. For although long life is
justly accounted one of the mercies of God, the end proposed by it is here
added, viz., that Caleb may obtain the inheritance which is denied to others.
This was no ordinary privilege. He next extols the faithfulness of God in having
prolonged his life, and not only so, but supplied vigor and strength, so that
though he was now above eighty years of age, he was not a whit feebler than when
in the flower of his youth. Others, too, had a green old age, but they were few
in number, and then in their case there was not added to the even tenor of their
days a manly vigor, remaining wholly unimpaired up to their eighty-fifth year.
For he lays claim not only to the skill and valor of a leader, but also to the
physical strength of a soldier.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He next adds the
other offices and actions of his life. For to go out and in is equivalent in
Hebrew to the observance and execution of all parts of our duty. And this Caleb
confirms by fact, when he demands it as his task to assail and expel the giants.
He is not, however, elated by stolid pride to a confident assurance of victory,
but hopes for a prosperous event from the assistance of God. There seems,
indeed, to be an incongruous expression of doubt in the word Perhaps, as if he
were begirding himself fortuitously for the
fight.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f135</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Those expositors who think that he is
distrusting himself from a feeling of modesty and considering his own weakness,
say something to the point, but do not say the whole. They certainly omit what
is of principal import, viz., that this Perhaps refers to the common feelings
which men would entertain on taking a view of the actual state of
matters.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The first thing necessary is duly to
consider what his design is. Had he asked the gift of a mountain, which he could
have seized without any great exertion, it would have been more difficult to
obtain it. But now when the difficulty of the task is plainly set forth, he
gains the favor of Joshua and the princes, because in assenting to his prayer,
they grant him nothing but the certainty of an arduous, doubtful, and perilous
contest. Knowing, then, that the children of Israel trembled and were in terror
at the very name of the giants, he speaks according to their opinion as of a
matter attended with doubt and uncertainty. As regards himself, the words
clearly demonstrate how far he was from viewing that which had been said to him
with a dubious or vacillating mind. I shall drive them out, he says, as the Lord
has declared. Shall we say that when he utters the declaration of God, he is in
doubt whether or not God will do what he promised? It is quite plain that he
only reminded them how dangerous the business was, in order that he might the
more easily obtain their assent. Although it is not uncommon in Hebrew to employ
this term to denote difficulty merely, without meaning to imply that the mind is
agitated by distrust or disquietude. How very difficult it was to drive out the
giants from that
fastness,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F136</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
may be inferred from the fact that the death of Joshua took place before Caleb
ventured to attack them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joshua blessed
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc He prayed thus earnestly to show the
delight he felt. For it was expedient by way of example to extol his valor, by
which others might be incited to surmount all their fears. For it was just as if
he had gained an eminence from which he could look down upon the giants. The
blessing of Caleb, therefore, includes in it praise which may have the effect of
an exhortation to the people. In the end of the chapter it is said, that the
name of Hebron was Ciriath-Arba, (Kirjath-Arba.) Here it is to be observed, that
it is not the mountain itself that is meant, but the principal city, of which
there is frequent mention in Scripture. It is said to have received the surname
from a giant famous for his stature. And this refutes the imagination of those
expositors who insist that it was so called from having been the burial-place of
four patriarchs &#8212; Adam, Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is plain that Caleb, in making the
request, had not been looking to present ease or private advantage, since he
does not aspire to the place that had been given him till many years after.
Wherefore it was no less the interest of the whole people than of one private
family, that that which as yet depended on the incomprehensible grace of God,
and was treasured up merely in hope, should be bestowed as a special favor. A
grant which could not take effect without a wonderful manifestation of divine
agency could scarcely be invidious.</font><br><font face="Palatino">A question,
however, arises. Since Hebron not only became the portion of the Levites, but
was one of the cities of refuge, how could the grant stand good? If we say that
Caleb was contented with other towns, and resigned his right to the Levites, it
is obvious that the difficulty is not solved, because Caleb is distinctly
appointed owner of that city. But if we reflect that the right of dwelling in
the cities was all that was granted to the Levites, there will be no
inconsistency. Meanwhile, no small praise is due to the moderation of Caleb,
who, in a locality made his own by extraordinary privilege, did not refuse an
hospitable reception to the
Levites.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

be very exact in delineating the site of places, and in discussing names, partly

f138</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> nay, perhaps the greater part of readers
would toil and perplex themselves without receiving any benefit. With regard to
the subject in hand, it is to be observed, that the lot of the tribe of Judah
not only falls on elevated ground, the very elevation of the territory,
indicating the dignity of the future kingdom, but a similar presage is given by
its being the first lot that turns up. What had already been obtained by arms,
they begin to divide. The names of the ten tribes are cast into the urn. Judah
is preferred to all the others. Who does not see that it is raised to the
highest rank, in order that the prophecy of Jacob may be fulfilled? Then within
the limits here laid down, it is well known that there were rich pastures, and
vineyards celebrated for their productiveness and the excellence of their wines.
In this way, while the lot corresponds with the prophecy of Jacob, it is
perfectly clear that it did not so happen by chance; the holy patriarch had only
uttered what was dictated by the Spirit.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If any
are better skilled in places, a more minute investigation will be pleasant and
useful to them. But lest those who are less informed feel it irksome to read
unknown names, let them consider that they have obtained knowledge of no small
value, provided they bear in mind the facts to which I have briefly and
summarily adverted &#8212; that the tribe of Judah was placed on elevated
ground, that it might be more conspicuous than the others, until the scepter
should arise from it &#8212; and that a region of fruitful vineyards and rich
pastures was assigned to his posterity &#8212; and, finally, all this was done,
in order that the whole people might recognize that there was nothing of the
nature of chance in the turning up of a lot, which had been foretold three
centuries before. Besides, it is easy for the unlearned to infer from the long
circuit described, that the territory thus allocated to one tribe was of great
extent.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f139</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For although some diminution afterwards
took place, its dominions always continued to be the
largest.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is necessary, however, to bear in
mind what I formerly observed, that nothing else was determined by the lot than
that the boundary of the children of Judah was to be contiguous to the land of
Edom and the children of Sin, and that their boundary, in another direction, was
to be the river of Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea &#8212; that those who had
been selected to divide the country proceeded according to the best of their
judgment, in proportioning the quantity of territory allotted to the number of
their people, without extending their boundaries any farther &#8212; and that
they followed the same method in other cases, as vicinity or other circumstances
demanded.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Any error into which they fell, did
not at all affect the general validity of their decision. For as they were not
ashamed partly to recall any partition that might have been made without
sufficient consideration, so the people in their turn, while they acknowledged
that they had acted in the matter with the strictest good faith and honesty,
submitted the more willingly to whatever they determined. Thus, notwithstanding
any particular error, their general arrangements received full
effect.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It will be worth while to make one
remark on the city Jebus, whose name was afterwards Jerusalem. Although it had
been already chosen, by the secret counsel of God, for his sanctuary, and the
seat of the future kingdom, it however continued in the possession of the enemy
down to the time of David. In this long exclusion from the place on which the
sanctity, excellence, and glory of the rest of the land were founded, there was
a clear manifestation of the divine curse inflicted to punish the people for
their sluggishness: since it was virtually the same as if the land had been
deprived of its principal dignity and ornament. But on the other hand, the
wonderful goodness of God was conspicuous in this, that the Jebusites who, from
the long respite which had been given them, seemed to have struck their roots
most deeply, were at length torn up, and driven forth from their secure
position.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And unto Caleb the son of
Jephunneh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc Were we to judge from the
actual state of matters, it would seem ridiculous repeatedly to celebrate an
imaginary grant from which Caleb received no benefit while Joshua was alive. But
herein due praise is given both to the truth of God, and to the faith of his
saint in resting on his promise. Therefore, although sneering men, and the
inhabitants of the place itself, if the rumor had reached them, might have
derided the vain solicitude of Caleb, and the empty liberality of Joshua, the
contempt thus expressed would only have proved them to be presumptuous scoffers.
God at length evinced the firmness of his decree by the result, and Caleb,
though he saw himself unable to obtain access to the mountain, testified that he
was contented with the mere promise of God, the true exercise of faith,
consisting in a willingness to remain without the fruition of things which have
been promised till the period actually arrive. Moreover, this passage, and
others similar to it, teach us that the giants who are usually called Enakim,
were so named after their original progenitor, Enac, and that the word is hence
of Gentile origin. The time when Caleb routed the sons of Enac we shall see in a
short time. This passage also shows us that Caleb, when he brought forward the
name of Moses, did not make a mere pretence, or utter anything that was not
strictly true; for it is now plainly declared, that Moses had so appointed, in
conformity with the command of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Joshua

<div align="center"><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here we have a narrative of what plainly appears from
the book of Joshua to have taken place subsequent to the death of Joshua; but
lest a question might have been raised by the novelty of the procedure, in
giving a fertile and well watered field as the patrimony of a woman, the writer
of the book thought proper to insert a history of that which afterwards
happened, in order that no ambiguity might remain in regard to the lot of the
tribe of Judah. First, Caleb is said, after he had taken the city of Hebron, to
have attacked Debir or Ciriath-sepher, and to have declared, that the person who
should be the first to enter it, would be his son-in-law. And it appears, that
when he held out this rare prize to his fellow-soldiers for taking the city, no
small achievement was required. This confirms what formerly seemed to be the
case, that it was a dangerous and difficult task which had been assigned him,
when he obtained his conditional grant. Accordingly, with the view of urging the
bravest to exert themselves, he promises his daughter in marriage as a reward to
the valor of the man who should first scale the
wall.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is afterwards added that Othniel who
was his nephew by a brother, gained the prize by his valor. I know not how it
has crept into the common translation that he was a younger brother of Caleb;
for nothing in the least degree plausible can be said in defense of the blunder.
Hence some expositors perplex themselves very unnecessarily in endeavoring to
explain how Othniel could have married his niece, since such marriage was
forbidden by the law. It is easy to see that he was not the uncle, but the
cousin of his wife.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But here another question
arises, How did Caleb presume to bargain concerning his daughter until he was
made acquainted with her
inclinations?</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f140</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Although it is the office of parents to
settle their daughters in life, they are not permitted to exercise tyrannical
power and assign them to whatever husbands they think fit without consulting
them. For while all contracts ought to be voluntary, freedom ought to prevail
especially in marriage that no one may pledge his faith against his will. But
Caleb was probably influenced by the belief that his daughter would willingly
give her consent, as she could not modestly reject such honorable
terms;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f141</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for the husband to be given her was no
common man, but one who should excel all others in warlike prowess. It is quite
possible, however, that Caleb in the heat of battle inconsiderately promised
what it was not in his power to perform. It seems to me, however, that according
to common law, the agreement implied the daughter's consent, and was only to
take effect if it was
obtained.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f142</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> God certainly heard the prayer of Caleb,
when he gave him a son-in-law exactly to his mind. For had the free choice been
given him, there was none whom he would have
preferred.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And it came to pass as she came unto him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>etc Although we may conjecture that the damsel Acsa was of excellent morals
and well brought up, as marriage with her had been held forth as the special
reward</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f143</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of victory, yet perverse cupidity on her
part is here disclosed. She knew that by the divine law women were specially
excluded from hereditary lands, but she nevertheless covets the possession of
them, and stimulates her husband by unjust expostulation. In this way ambitious
and covetous wives cease not to molest their husbands until they force them to
forget shame, modesty, and equity. For although the avarice of men also is
insatiable, yet women are apt to be much more precipitate. The more carefully
ought husbands to be on their guard against being set as it were on flame by the
blast of such importunate
counsels.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f144</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">But a greater degree of intemperance
is displayed when she acquires additional boldness from the facility of her
husband and the indulgence of her father. Not contented with the field given to
her, she demands for herself a well-watered district. And thus it is when a
person has once overleaped the bounds of rectitude and honesty, the fault is
forthwith followed up by impudence. Moreover, her father in refusing her nothing
gives proof of his singular affection for her. But it does not therefore follow
that the wicked thirst of gain which blinds the mind and perverts right judgment
is the less hateful. In regard to Acsa's dismounting from the ass, some
interpreters ascribe it to dissimulation and craft, as if she were pretending
inability to retain her seat from grief. In this way her dismounting or falling
off is made an indication of criminality and defective character. It is more
simple, however, to suppose that she placed herself at her father's feet with
the view of accosting him as a suppliant. Be this as it may, by her craft and
flattery she gained his consent, and in so far diminished the portion of her
brothers.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is the
inheritance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc He had formerly,
indeed, traced out the boundaries of the children of Judah; but it is now shown
for a different reason how large and fertile the territory was which the Lord in
his great liberality had bestowed upon them. One hundred and thirteen cities
with their towns and villages are enumerated. The number attests not only the
populousness, but also the fertility of the country. And there cannot be a doubt
that by the divine blessing a new degree of fertility was imparted to it. The
goodness of God was, however, manifested in the very nature of the land selected
for his people, a land abounding in all kinds of advantages. If we attend to the
number of souls in the tribe, we shall find that one half of the country would
have been amply sufficient for their habitation. For when eight hundred were
allocated in each of the cities, the remainder had the towns and the villages.
It is no doubt true that a portion was afterwards withdrawn and given to the
tribe of Simeon. For in this was accomplished the dispersion of which Jacob had
prophesied,</font><br></div>

for the people, nor is it set down with that view; for had they exerted
themselves to the full measure of their strength, and failed of success, the
dishonor would have fallen on God himself, who had promised that he would
continue with them as their leader until he should give them full and free
possession of the land, and that he would send hornets to drive out the
inhabitants. Therefore, it was owing entirely to their own sluggishness that
they did not make themselves masters of the city of Jerusalem. This they were
not able to do; but their own torpor, their neglect of the divine command from a
love of ease, were the real obstacles.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This
passage is deserving of notice: we ought to learn from it to make vigorous trial
of our strength in attempting to accomplish the commands of God, and not to omit
any opportunity, lest while we are idly resting the door may be shut. A moderate
delay might have been free from blame; but a long period of effeminate ease in a
manner rejected the blessing which God was ready to
bestow.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the lot of the children
of Joseph fell</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc The sacred writer
first states what the lot was which fell to the two children of Joseph, and then
describes the lot of Ephraim. It is strange, however, that when the half of the
tribe of Manasseh had already been settled beyond the Jordan, more words are
employed in describing the remaining half than in describing the whole of the
inheritance of the tribe of Ephraim, though the latter was the more populous,
and justly claimed for itself a larger territory. But the longer detail given
concerning the posterity of Manasseh is owing to particular circumstances.
First, the writer repeats how a settlement had been given them without lot in
the country of Basan. Secondly, he mentions the ratification by Joshua of the
command which Moses had given by divine authority in regard to the daughters of
Selophead. Seeing, then, there was no doubt in regard to the boundaries of
Ephraim, and there was no danger of dispute, their allocation is only briefly
glanced at.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But here a new question arises. When
the right of primogeniture had passed from Manasseh to Ephraim, how did the
posterity of that tribe which had precedence in rank obtain their cities among
the children of Manasseh? For theirs seems in this way to have been the inferior
condition. My explanation is this, When the portion of Manasseh was too
extensive in proportion to the amount of population, a calculation was made, and
certain cities were deducted to complete the just share of the tribe of Ephraim;
not that they were mixed up with the children of Manasseh, to hold their
dwellings among them by a precarious
tenure,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f147</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but their boundaries were merely
extended in the direction of the Manassites whom a narrower possession might
suffice.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the end of the chapter, Ephraim is
severely censured for his effeminacy in not having expelled the Canaanites from
Gezer. For had they proceeded in a manly and hearty manner to make good their
right to the land which had fallen to them by lot, the victory was in their
hands. There would have been no temerity in the attempt, since the decision of
the lot was as valid as if the Lord himself had stretched forth his hand from
heaven. But their disgraceful sloth is more clearly expressed and their
culpability greatly heightened by the fact, that they made tributaries of those
with whom it was not lawful to enter into any kind of arrangement. Seeing, then,
God had distinctly forbidden his people to transact business of any kind with
those nations, and least of all to enter into pactions with them, stipulating
for their pardon and safety, the Ephraimites sinned much more grievously in
exacting tribute than if they had tolerated them without
paction.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

<div align="center"><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The historian returns to the tribe of Manasseh with
the view of confirming what we formerly saw with regard to the daughters of
Selophead. For though it was a novelty for females to succeed indiscriminately
with males, yet as five of them had survived their father, they proved it to be
equitable that they should be admitted to a portion, lest while he was innocent
he should lie under the reproach of having died childless. God had replied to
Moses by his oracle, that in regard to succession they should be counted as one
head. They now demand that the decision thus given by the mouth of the Lord
shall be carried into effect. As to the name of first-born, still given to
Manasseh, it must be understood so as not to be at variance with the prophecy of
Jacob; or rather his primogeniture is here in a manner buried, and his dignity
restricted to the past. Here, however, it is to be observed, that men are so
tenacious and so much devoted to their own interests, that it seldom occurs to
them to give others their due. The daughters of Selophead had obtained a portion
by a heavenly decree; nor had any one dared to utter a word against it; and yet
if they had remained silent no regard would have been paid to them. Therefore,
lest the delay should prove injurious to them, they apply to Joshua and Eleazar,
and insist that they shall not be deprived of their legitimate succession. No
delay is interposed by Joshua to prevent their immediately obtaining what is
just, nor is there any murmuring on the part of the people. Hence we infer, that
all were disposed to act equitably; but every one is occupied with his own
interest, and too apt carelessly to overlook that of
others.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And there fell ten portions
to Manasseh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc The children of
Manasseh are in this passage classed under seven stems. Machir, the first-born,
is placed apart; the other six follow. Here the question arises, How was the
inheritance divided into ten parts? Some expositors cunningly disguise the
difficulty;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f149</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> others, because they are unable to solve
it, indulge in the merest trifling. It is certainly very absurd that four
portions should be given to five daughters; and it is not a whit more congruous
that their share should be doubled because their father was the first-born. It
is beyond all controversy, that Gilead, son of Machir, and great-grandfather of
the females of whom we are now speaking, chose his settlement in mount Gilead
and Bashan. Therefore, seeing he had already obtained an inheritance by
privilege without lot, he ought not to have obtained one by lot in the land of
Canaan, unless perhaps he settled only a part of his family beyond the Jordan.
For Hepher was one of his sons, but not the only one; and likewise the offspring
of five other brothers might be distinguished into several heads according to
the number of which the allocation by lot might be made. For it is not known in
what degree families whose portion fell in the land of Canaan were taken. And
all we read here is, that ten lots were east among the sons of Manasseh in
addition to the country which they had formerly acquired for themselves beyond
the Jordan. It is thus vain to dispute concerning the number, which cannot be
ascertained with certainty from the present narrative, because the first thing
necessary to be known is the exact number of families to whom the division was
common. Nay, it is not impossible that the daughters of Selophead obtained their
patrimony there. They are said, indeed, to have dwelt among the brethren of
their father; but the place is not given. Be this as it may, I have no doubt
that mutual equity was observed, and that after provision was made for others,
the land which had been submitted to lot was distributed among ten families
whose names are here omitted.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Joshua

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Manasseh had in
Issachar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc How they were so mingled
as to possess some cities in the lot of Asher and Issachar, while the tribe of
Ephraim dwelt between their limits, it is not easy to divine, unless, perhaps,
it was perceived that a more commodious habitation would not be liable to many
complaints,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f150</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> or, perhaps, after the whole country had
become more certainly known, some change was made on principles of equity in the
former partition. This, therefore, seems to have been a new acquisition after it
was discovered that the children of Manasseh might occupy a wider extent without
loss to others. Nor was the habitation given to them a subjugated one, which
they might immediately enjoy, but it was an inheritance treasured up in hope,
and founded more upon heavenly promise than on actual possession. And yet their
not gaining possession of those cities is attributed to their fault, because the
lot assigning it to them was an indubitable pledge of victory. The reason,
therefore, why they could not expel the inhabitants was, because they were not
fully persuaded in their minds that God is true, and stifled his agency by their
own sluggishness. But another crime still less pardonable was committed when,
having it in their power easily to destroy all, they not only were slothful in
executing the command of God, but, induced by filthy
lucre,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f151</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> they preserved those alive whom God had
doomed to destruction. For persons, on whom we impose tribute, we in a manner
take under our faith and protection. God had appointed them the ministers of his
vengeance, and he supplies them with strength to execute it: they not only
delay, but deprive themselves of the liberty of acting rightly. It is not
strange, therefore, that God severely punished this perverse heartlessness, by
making those nations whom they had pardoned in the face of a clear prohibition,
to become like thorns to pierce their eyes and pricks to gall their
sides.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here, again, a question arises, How were
cities granted to them in the tribe of Asher and Issachar, when the portions of
both were as yet unknown? Here, therefore, that which had not yet taken place is
related by way of anticipation. Be this as it may, we gather that from ignorance
of the localities, single portions were not divided so exactly as not to make it
necessary afterwards to correct what had been more or less
decided.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f152</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And we must hold in general, with regard
both to the tribe of Ephraim and the others, that many of the cities which they
gained were of no account because of the devastation. I doubt not that many
ruins here lie buried. On the other hand, we must conclude that in fertile
spots, or spots possessed of other advantages, where petty villages only
existed, their famous cities were founded. It is certain that Sichem was of
sufficient importance to hold both a name and rank, and yet there is no mention
of it here. The same is the case with Samaria, which, as is well known, belonged
to the same tribe of Ephraim when it was the metropolis of the kingdom of
Israel. It is plain, therefore, that each tribe possessed several cities, which
are here passed over in silence.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the children of Joseph spoke
unto Joshua</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Although they clothe
their complaint with some color of excuse, yet they dishonestly disguise the
fact, that more was comprehended in one lot than was proper for one tribe. I
know not, however, whether or not the lot was cast indefinitely for the sons of
Joseph: it certainly does not seem congruous that it should be so. Joshua and
the other dividers were not unaware that Ephraim and Manasseh formed two heads,
or two stems: and it has repeatedly been said before that the land was divided
into ten tribes, which number was not accurate, unless the tribe of Manasseh was
considered distinct from that of Ephraim. It is certain, therefore, that they
had not fallen into such a gross blunder as to throw the two names into one lot.
Now, to conceal two tribes under the name of Joseph, in order to defraud them of
half their right, would have been intolerable injustice. We may add, that the
domain of each was distinctly explained and described by its proper
boundaries.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f153</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">We are therefore led to conclude,
that when the lots were cast for the two tribes, the admirable counsel of God
arranged that the brothers, who had a common father, should be contiguous and
neighbors to each other. It is unworthy in them, therefore, to complain and
plead that only one inheritance had been given to them, because Joshua had
neither such heartlessness nor so much malice as to defraud them of a clear
right either through thoughtlessness or envy.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f154</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But herein lay the falsehood of their complaint concerning narrow boundaries,
that they counted all that was yet to be acquired by warlike prowess as nothing;
as if the lot had assigned portions to the other tribes only in subjugated
territory. Joshua, accordingly, in a single sentence, refutes and disposes of
their plea, and retorts upon them a charge by which they were trying to throw
obloquy upon him. If your resources and your numbers are so great, why, he asks,
do you not make an inroad on the enemy, whose country has been given to you? Nor
will the event disappoint you, if, trusting to the promise of God, you boldly
proceed to the inheritance which he has bestowed upon you. We see how, although
proper provision had been made for them, they were so blinded by sloth as to
complain that they were straitened for room, because they were unwilling to move
their finger to seek the full possession of their inheritance. Wherefore, this
passage teaches us, that if at any time we think less is performed for us than
is due, we ought carefully to shake off all delays, and not rashly throw upon
others the blame which is inherent in
ourselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the children of Joseph
said</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc It is too apparent that they
were thinking only of themselves, because they quibble as much as they can, in
order to avoid following the suggestion of Joshua, than which, however, nothing
was more reasonable. They object, that the mountain is rugged and little better
than a desert, and therefore, though it were added to them, they would derive
very little benefit from it. In regard to the plain, which was cultivated and
fertile, they object that they are shut out and debarred from it because of the
formidable array of the enemy. Accordingly, they make mention of their iron
chariots, as if they had not already learned by experience that the Lord was
able, without any difficulty, to trample down both horses and chariots. Joshua,
however, by a simple and right-hearted answer, administers due castigation, as
well to their avarice as their effeminacy and torpor. If the forest, as it now
stands, is not sufficiently productive, cut down the trees and convert it into
good fields; provided you are not sparing of your labor, you will have no reason
to be dissatisfied with your habitation. Iron chariots, moreover, cannot prevent
the Lord from performing what he has promised to you. The inheritance is yours;
do only your part by entering with due confidence on the possession of
it.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the whole congregation of
the children of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc Here we have
a narrative of the celebrated convention held in Shiloh, where it was
deliberated, as to the casting of the remaining lots. For although with pious
zeal they had attempted the casting of lots, yet the proceeding had been
interrupted, as if victory behooved to precede the distribution which depended
solely on the mouth of God. They assemble, therefore, in Shiloh to determine
what was necessary to be done in future. And there is no doubt that Joshua
summoned this meeting in order to raise them from their lethargy. For they do
not come forward spontaneously with any proposal, but he begins with upbraiding
them with having been sluggish and remiss in entering on the inheritance which
God had bestowed upon them. It is easy to infer from his speech that they had
shown great alacrity at the outset, but that there had been no
perseverance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And yet that obedience, which
shortly after grew languid, was honored with the approbation of the Holy Spirit.
It is to be observed that the people are blamed, not for neglecting to proceed
to the lot, but for not occupying the inheritance divinely offered to them. And,
certainly, as the distribution by lot was a sign of confidence, so each district
which fell out to each was a sure and faithful pledge of future possession; for
the Lord was by no means deluding them in assigning to each his
portion.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hpd</font><font face="Palatino">,
which I have translated "to cease," signifies also to be remiss or feeble. He
charges them, therefore, with base heartlessness, in that while the full time
for routing the enemy had arrived, they by their delays retard and suspend the
effect of the divine goodness. For had they been contented with the bare lot,
and faithfully embraced the results which it gave, they would doubtless have
been prompt and expeditious in carrying on the war, nay, would have hastened
like conquerors to a triumph.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The ark is said to
have been stationed at
Shiloh,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f155</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> not only that the consultation might be
graver and more sacred, as held in the presence of God, but because it was a
completely subjugated place, and safe from all external violence and injury. For
it behooved to be their special care to prevent its exposure to sudden assault.
No doubt the hand of God would have been stretched to ward off attacks of the
enemy from any quarter; still, however, though God dwelt among them, they were
to be regarded as its guardians and
attendants.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But although a station for the ark
was then chosen, it was not a perpetual abode, but only a temporary lodging. For
it was not left to the will or suffrages of the people to fix the seat where God
should dwell, but they behooved to wait for the period so often referred to in
the Law, when he was to establish the memorial of his name elsewhere. This was
at length accomplished when Mount Zion was set apart for the Temple. For this
reason it is said in the Psalm,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Our feet shall stand
within thy gates, O
Jerusalem."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1" color="Maroon">&lt;19C202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
122:2)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These words intimate that up to that time the ark was
pilgrimating. At last the ruin and devastation of Shiloh showed that no rank or
dignity can screen those who corrupt the blessings of God from his vengeance. Up
to the death of Eli, God allowed his sacred name to be worshipped there; but
when all religion was polluted by the impiety of the priests, and almost
abolished by the ingratitude of the people, that spot became to posterity a
signal monument of punishment. Accordingly, Jeremiah tells the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, who were proudly boasting of their Temple, to turn their eyes to that
example. Speaking in the name of the Lord, he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Go you now unto my place
which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it
for the wickedness of my people Israel."

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Give out from among you three
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Caleb and Joshua had already
surveyed those regions, and the people had learned much by inquiry: Joshua,
however, wishes the land to be divided as if according to actual
survey</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f156</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and orders three surveyors to be
appointed for each of the seven tribes, in order that by the mouth of two or
three persons every dispute may be settled. But nothing seems more incongruous
than to send twenty-one men, who were not only to pass directly through a
hostile country, but to trace it through all its various windings and turnings,
so as not to leave a single corner unexamined, to calculate, its length and
breadth, and even make due allowance for its inequalities. Every person whom
they happened to meet must readily have suspected who they were, and for what
reason they had been employed on this expedition. In short, no free return lay
open for them except through a thousand deaths. Assuredly they would not have
encountered so much danger from blind and irrational impulse, nor would Joshua
have exposed them to such manifest danger had they not been aware that all those
nations, struck with terror from heaven, desired nothing so much as peace. For
although they hated the children of Israel, still, having been subdued by so
many overthrows, they did not dare to move a finger against them, and thus the
surveyors proceeded in safety as through a peaceful territory, under the pretext
either of trading, or at least of making a harmless
visit.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f157</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is also possible that they arranged
themselves in different parties, and thus made the journey more secretly. It is
certain, indeed, that there was only one source from which they could have
derived all this courage and confidence, from trusting under the shadow of the
wings of the Almighty, and thus having no fear of blind and stupid men. Hence
the praise here bestowed on their ready will. For had they not been persuaded
that the hands of those nations were tied up by supernal power, they would have
had a just and honest cause for
refusing.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

And the men went and passed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc Here
not only is praise bestowed on the ready obedience by which their virtue shone
forth conspicuous, but the Lord gives a signal manifestation of his favor by
deigning to bestow remarkable success on pious Joshua and the zeal of the
people. Had they crept along by subterranean burrows, they could scarcely have
escaped innumerable dangers, but now, when they are taking notes of the cities
and their sites, of the fields, the varying features of the districts, and all
the coasts, and without meeting with any adverse occurrence, return in safety to
their countrymen, who can doubt that their life had been kept safe among a
thousand deaths by a wonderful exertion of divine power? It is accordingly said
emphatically, that they returned to celebrate the grace of God, which is just
equivalent to saying that they were brought back by the hand of God. This made
the people proceed more willingly to the casting of lots. For their minds would
not yet have been well purged of fastidiousness had they not perceived in that
journey a signal display of divine favor, promising them that the final issue
would be according to their wish. Joshua is hence said to have divided according
to the inheritance of each, as if he were sending them to enter on a quiet
possession, though the effect depended on the divine presence, because it ought
to have been enough for them that the whole business was carried on by the
authority of God, who never deceives his people, even when he seems to sport
with them. In what sense the ark of the covenant is called God, or the face of
God, I have already explained in many
passages.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Joshua

<div><font face="Palatino">In the lot of Benjamin nothing occurs particularly
deserving of notice, unless that a small tribe takes precedence of the others. I
admit, indeed, that its limits were narrowed in proportion to the fewness of its
numbers, because it obtained only twenty-six cities; but still an honor was
bestowed upon it in the mere circumstance of its receiving its inheritance
before more distinguished tribes. We may add, that in this way they were
conjoined and made neighbors to the
other</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f159</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> children of Joseph, with whom their
relationship was more immediate. For they were placed in the middle between the
children of Ephraim and Manasseh on the one side, and those of Judah on the
other. They had also the distinguished honor of including Jerusalem in their
inheritance, though they afterwards granted it by a kind of precarious tenure to
the children of Judah for a royal
residence.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f160</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">It is strange, however, that having
obtained such a quiet locality, they did not live on peaceful and friendly terms

<div align="center"><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Next followed the lot of the tribe of Simeon, not as
a mark of honor, but rather as a mark of disgrace. Jacob had declared with
regard to Simeon and Levi, "I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in
Israel."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
49:7) The punishment of Levi, indeed, was not only mitigated, but converted into
an excellent dignity, inasmuch as his posterity were placed on a kind of
watch-towers to keep the people in the paths of piety. In regard to Simeon, the
dispersion of which Jacob prophesied, manifestly took place when certain cities
within the territory of Judah were assigned to his posterity for their
inheritance. For although they were not sent off to great distances, yet they
dwelt dispersed, and as strangers in a land properly belonging to another.
Therefore, on account of the slaughter which they had perpetrated with no less
perfidy than cruelty, they were placed separately in different abodes. In this
way the guilt of the father was visited upon his children, and the Lord ratified
in fact that sentence which he had dictated to his servant. The truth of the lot
also was clearly proven.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the circumstance of
a certain portion being withdrawn from the family of Judah, we again perceive
that though the dividers had carefully endeavored to observe equity, they had
fallen into error, which they were not ashamed to correct as soon as it was
discovered. And though they were guided by the Spirit, there is nothing strange
in their having been partially mistaken, because God sometimes leaves his
servants destitute of the spirit of judgment, and suffers them to act like men
on different occasions, that they may not plume themselves too much on their
clear-sightedness. We may add that the people were punished for their
carelessness and confident haste, because they ought at the outset to have
ascertained more accurately how much land could be properly assigned to each.
This they neglected to do. Through their unskillful procedure, the children of
Judah had received a disproportion accumulation of territory, and equity
required that they should relinquish a part. It would also have been better for
themselves to have their limits fixed with certainty at once than to be
subjected to a galling spoliation afterwards. Add that each tribe had indulged
the vain hope that its members would dwell far and wide, as if the land had been
of unlimited
extent.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Out of the portion of the children of Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>etc The praise of moderation is due to the tribe of Judah for not contending
that the abstraction of any part of the inheritance already assigned to them was
unjust. They might easily have obtruded the name of God, and asserted that it
was only by his authority they had obtained that settlement. But as it is
decided by the common consent of all the tribes that more has been given to them
than they can possess without loss and injury to the others, they immediately
desist from all pretext for disputing the matter. And it is certain that if they
had alleged the authority of God, it would have been falsely and wickedly,
inasmuch as though their lot had been determined by him in regard to its
situation, an error had taken place with regard to its extent, their limits
having been fixed by human judgment wider than they ought. Therefore,
acknowledging that it would have been wrong to give them what would occasion
loss to others, they willingly resign it, and give a welcome reception to their
brethren, who must otherwise have remained without inheritance, nay, submit to
go shares with them in that which they supposed they had acquired beyond
controversy.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Joshua

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the third lot came
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc In the lot of Zebulun there is a
clear fulfillment of the prophecy of Jacob, which had foretold that they would
dwell on the sea-coast. An old man, an exile who could not set a foot on his own
land,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f162</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> assigned a maritime district to the
posterity of his son Zebulun. What could be more extravagant? But now, when the
lot assigns them a maritime region, no clearer confirmation of his decision
could be desired. It was just as if God were twice thundering from heaven. The
tribe of Zebulun, therefore, do not occupy the shore of their own accord or by
human suffrage, but a divine arrangement fixes their habitation contiguous to
the sea. Thus, although men erred, still the light was always seen shining
brightly in the darkness. Jacob goes farther, and makes a clear distinction
between Zebulun and Issachar. The former tribe will travel far and wide,
carrying on trade and commerce; the latter remaining in his tents, will
cultivate ease and a sedentary life.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014913&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
49:13-15) Hence it is probable that the sea-coast where Zebulun settled, was
provided with harbors and well adapted for the various forms of commercial
intercourse,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f163</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> whereas the children of Issachar were
contented with their own produce, and consumed the fruits which they had raised
by their own labor and culture at home.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Those
who are thought to be well acquainted with these countries, affirm that the land
of the tribe of Asher was fertile in
corn.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f164</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This is in complete accordance both with
the letter and the spirit of Jacob's prophecy.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014920&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
49:20) From the fact that only a small number of cities are designated by name,
we may infer that there were then many ruined cities which were not taken into
account, and from the other fact that the people dwelt commodiously, we may also
infer that they built many cities, with which it is plain from other passages
that the land was adorned. And it is certainly apparent that only a summary of
the division is briefly glanced at, and that thus many things were omitted which
no religious feeling forbids us to investigate, provided we do not indulge in an
excessive curiosity leading to no beneficial result. There cannot be a doubt
that those to whom twenty or even only seventeen cities are attributed, had more
extensive territories. Therefore, all we have here is a compendious description
of the division as it was taken from the general and confused notes of the
surveyors.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The next lot mentioned is that of
Naphtali, and it seems to correspond with the disposition and manners of that
tribe. For Jacob had testified, Naphtali is a hind let loose; he gave goodly
words. For this reason they seem to have been contiguous on one side to the
children of Judah, and to have been surrounded on other sides by the enclosures
of their brethren.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f165</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Indeed, in its being said that the tribe
of Dan took Lesen, there seems to be a tacit comparison, because the children of
Naphtali did not employ arms to force their way into their inheritance, but kept
themselves quietly in a subdued territory, and thus enjoyed safety and
tranquillity under the faith, and, as it were, protection of Judah and the other
tribes. The capture of Lesen by the children of Dan, in accordance with the
divine grant which they had received of it, did not take place till after the
death of Joshua. But the fact which is more fully detailed in the book of Judges
is here mentioned in passing, because praise was due to them for their boldness
and activity in thus embracing the right which God had bestowed upon them, and
so trusting in him as to go down bravely and defeat the
enemy.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Joshua

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When they had made an end of
dividing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc We have here, at length,
an account of the gratitude of the people towards Joshua. For although the
partition of the land of Canaan, among the posterity of Abraham, behooved to be
equitable, yet Joshua, by his excellent virtues, deserved some honorary reward.
Nor could any complain that a single individual was enriched at their expense.
For, first, in the delay there was a striking proof of the moderation of this
holy servant of God. He does not give any heed to his own interest till the
commonweal has been secured. How seldom do we find any who, after they have
given one or two specimens of valor, do not forthwith make haste to the prey?
Not so Joshua, who thinks not of himself till the land has been divided. In the
reward itself also the same temperance and frugality are conspicuous. The city
he asks to be given to himself and his family was a mere heap of stones, either
because it had been demolished and converted into a heap of ruins, or because no
city had yet been built upon it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is
conjectured with probability, that with the view of making the grant as little
invidious as possible, the city he requested was of no great value. If any one
thinks it strange that he did not give his labor gratuitously, let him reflect
that Joshua liberally obeyed the divine call, and had no mercenary feelings in
undergoing so many labors, dangers, and troubles; but having spontaneously
performed his duty, he behooved not to repudiate a memorial of the favor of God,
unless he wished by perverse contempt to suppress his glory. For the grant voted
to him was nothing else than a simple testimonial of the divine power, which had
been manifested through his hand. Truly no ambition can be detected here,
inasmuch as he desires nothing for himself, and does not rashly act from a
feeling of covetousness, but seeks in the popular consent a confirmation of the
honor which God had already bestowed upon him. To have been silent in such a
case, would have been more indicative of heartlessness than of modesty. The
statement in the concluding verse of the chapter, that Joshua and Eleazar made
an end of dividing the land, points to the perpetuity of the boundaries, which
had been fixed, and warns the children of Israel against moving in any way to
unsettle an inviolable decree.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord also spoke unto
Joshua</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc In the fact of its not
having occurred to their own minds, to designate the cities of refuge, till they
were again reminded of it, their sluggishness appears to be indirectly censured.
The divine command to that effect had been given beyond the Jordan. When the
reason for it remained always equally valid, why do they wait? Why do they not
give full effect to that which they had rightly begun? We may add, how important
it was that there should be places of refuge for the innocent, in order that the
land might not be polluted with blood. For if that remedy had not been provided,
the kindred of those who had been killed would have doubled the evil, by
proceeding without discrimination to avenge their death. It certainly did not
become the people to be idle in guarding the land from stain and
taint.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f166</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence we perceive how tardy men are, not
only to perform their duty, but to provide for their own safety, unless the Lord
frequently urge them, and prick them forward by the stimulus of exhortation. But
that they sinned only from thoughtlessness, is apparent from this, that they are
forthwith ready to obey, neither procrastinating nor creating obstacles or
delays to a necessary matter, by disputing the propriety of
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The nature of the asylum afforded by the
cities of refuge has been already explained. It gave no impunity to voluntary
murder, but if any one, by mistake, had slain a man, with whom he was not at
enmity, he found a safe refuge by fleeing to one of these cities destined for
that purpose. Thus God assisted the unfortunate, and prevented their suffering
the punishment of an atrocious deed, when they had not been guilty of it.
Meanwhile respect was so far paid to the feelings of the brethren and kindred of
the deceased, that their sorrow was not increased by the constant presence of
the persons who had caused their bereavement. Lastly, the people were accustomed
to detest murder, since homicide, even when not culpable, was followed by exile
from country and home, till the death of the high priest. For that temporary
exile clearly showed how precious human blood is in the sight of God. Thus the
law was just, equitable, and useful, as well in a public as in a private point
of view.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f167</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But it is to be briefly observed, that
everything is not here mentioned in order. For one who had accidentally killed a
man might have remained in safety, by sisting himself before the court to plead
his cause, and obtaining an acquittal, after due and thorough investigation, as
we explained more fully in the books of Moses, when treating of this
matter.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they appointed
Kedesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc The Hebrew word Kedesh here
used, signifies also to fit and consecrate. Accordingly, I interpret, that
cities were selected according as common use
required.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f168</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence it is inferred that matters were
well arranged so as to make private yield to public interest. Moreover, we shall
see in the next chapter, that Ciriath-Arbah, which was afterwards called Hebron,
was transferred to the Levites, though it had formerly been the property of
Caleb. Hence appeared the rare, nay, the incomparable moderation of this aged
saint, who readily gave up to others both the city and suburbs, which he had
justly claimed as his right, the moment the lot showed that this was pleasing to
God. It was necessary to advert briefly to this change, because the Lord was
pleased that asylums should be found only in the Levitical cities, that their
innocence might be defended with greater fidelity and
authority.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then came near the
heads</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc Here we have at a later
period a narrative of what ought to have preceded. For no cities of refuge were
appointed before they had been assigned to the Levites. To this may be added
what was formerly said, that Joshua and Eleazar had made an end of dividing the
land. Now, the land was not truly divided till the habitation of the Levites was
fixed. We must understand, therefore, that when the lot was cast in the name of
the ten tribes, a reservation was made of cities in the land of Canaan for the
habitation of the Levites. Beyond the Jordan their portion had already been
assigned to them. But as the Levites come forward and request a ratification of
the divine grant, it is probable that they were neglected till they pleaded
their own cause. For so it is apt to happen, every one being so attentive in
looking after his own affairs that even brethren are forgotten. It was certainly
disgraceful to the people that they required to be pulled by the ear, and put in
mind of what the Lord had clearly ordered respecting the Levites. But had they
not demanded a domicile for themselves, there was a risk of their being left to
lie in the open air; although, at the same time, we are permitted to infer that
the people erred more from carelessness and forgetfulness than from any
intention to deceive, as they make no delay as soon as they are admonished; nay,
they are praised for their obedience in that they did what was just and right
according to the word of the Lord.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the lot came out for the
families</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Here is first described
the number of cities of which we shall have to speak by and bye. Secondly, it is
distinctly said that the lot fell out to the children of Aaron in the tribe of
Judah. This did not happen fortuitously, because God in his admirable counsel
placed them in that locality where he had determined to choose a temple for
himself. Thirdly, the narrative proceeds to give the exact names of the cities,
of which the first mentioned is Hebron, of which Caleb, with great equanimity,
allowed himself to be deprived. Should any one object that the first city of all
that ought to have been given them was Jerusalem, where they were to have their
future station, it is easy to answer, that moderate sized cities were delivered
to them as their condition required. Moreover, Jerusalem was not then
subjugated, as it continued under the power of the Jebusites. In short, it would
have been absurd to assign a royal seat to priests. And their religion and faith
was the better proved by this, that they migrated of their own accord from their
native soil to devote their attention to sacred things. For no priest performed
the office without becoming a stranger. Their weakness, however, was so far
indulged by giving them a grant of neighboring cities, that they might not have
the fatigue of a long journey in going to perform their function. Moreover, the
giving of thirteen cities for a habitation to one family, and that not very
numerous, confirms what I have elsewhere said, that the other tribes possessed
very many cities,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the families of the children
of Kohath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc Why it was necessary that
the Levites should be dispersed among the different tribes, the reader may see
in my Commentaries on the Books of Moses. This dispersion had, indeed, been
imposed on their progenitor as a punishment for the cruelty and perfidy of which
he had been guilty toward the children of Shechem, but the disgrace of it had
been converted into the highest honor by their appointment as a kind of
guardians in every district to retain the people in the pure worship of God. It
is true, they were everywhere strangers; but still it was with the very high
dignity of acting as stewards for God, and preventing their countrymen from
revolting from piety. This is the reason for stating so carefully how many
cities they obtained from each tribe; they were everywhere to keep watch, and
preserve the purity of sacred rites
unimpaired.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>41.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All the cities of the
Levites</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc This passage more
especially shows what I have already more than once adverted to, that the
boundaries of the other tribes were not so confined as not to comprehend a far
larger number of cities than is actually mentioned. It is perfectly well known
that Levi was the least numerous of all the tribes. With what equity, then,
could it have been allowed to expand itself over four times the space allowed to
the tribe of Zebulun, which, though more populous, is mentioned as only
possessing twelve cities. Only sixteen are enumerated as belonging to the tribe
of Issachar, nineteen to the tribe of Naphtali, and twenty-two to the tribe of
Asher. It would surely have been an unequal division to give the greater number
of cities for habitation to the smaller population. Hence we infer, that not
only the villages which are here set down as accessories of the cities were fit
for habitation, but that other cities also, of which no mention is made, were
included. In short, the extent of the lot of Levi makes it perfectly obvious how
large and ample the territories of the other tribes must have
been.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>43.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord gave unto
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc Should any one raise a
question as to this rest, the answer is easy. The nations of Canaan were so
completely overcome with fear, that they thought they could not better consult
their interest than by servility flattering the Israelites, and purchasing peace
from them on any
terms.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f170</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Plainly, therefore, the country was
subdued and rendered peaceful for habitation, since no one gave any annoyance,
or dared to entertain any hostile intentions, since there were no threats, no
snares, no violence, no conspiracies.</font><br><font face="Palatino">A second
point, however, raises some
doubt,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f171</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> namely, how the children of Israel can
be said to have been settled in the possession of the land promised to them, and
to have become masters of it, in such a sense that in regard to the enjoyment of
it, not one syllable of the promises of God had failed. For we have already seen
that many of the enemy were intermingled with them. The divine intention was,
that not one of the enemy should be permitted to remain; on the other hand, the
Israelites do not drive out many, but admit them as neighbors, as if the
inheritance had been common to them; they even make pactions with them. How then
can these two things be reconciled, that God, as he had promised, gave
possession of the land to the people, and yet they were excluded from some
portion by the power or obstinate resistance of the
enemy?</font><br><font face="Palatino">In order to remove this appearance of
contradiction, it is necessary to distinguish between the certain, clear, and
steadfast faithfulness of God in keeping his promises, and between the
effeminacy and sluggishness of the people, in consequence of which the benefit
of the divine goodness in a manner slipped through their hands. Whatever war the
people undertook, in whatever direction they moved their standards, victory was
prepared; nor was there any other delay or obstacle to their exterminating all
their enemies than their own voluntary torpor. Wherefore, although they did not
rout them all so as to make their possession clear, yet the truth of God came
visibly forth, and was realized, inasmuch as they might have obtained what was
remaining without any difficulty, had they been pleased to avail themselves of
the victories offered to them. The whole comes to this, that it was owing
entirely to their own cowardice that they did not enjoy the divine goodness in
all its fullness and integrity. This will be still clearer from the following
chapter.</font><br></div>

them,	<b>7. </b>Dimidiae autem tribui Manasse dederat Moses in Basan: alteri

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Joshua called the
Reubenites</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc Here is related the
discharge of the two tribes and half-tribe, who had followed the rest of the
people, not that they might acquire anything for themselves, but that, as they
had already obtained dwellings and lands without lot, they might carry on war in
common with their brethren, until they also should have a quiet inheritance.
Now, as they had been faithful companions and helpers to their brethren, Joshua
declares that they were entitled to their discharge, and thus sends them back to
their homes released and free. It is asked, however, how he can consider them to
have performed their due measure of military service, while the enemy were still
in possession of part of the land, of which the sole possession was to be the
proper termination of the
war?</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f172</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But if we bear in mind what I lately
said, the knot will be loosed. Had the Israelites followed the invitation of
God, and seconded his agency, nay, when he was stretching out his hand to them,
had they not basely drawn
back,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f173</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the remaining part of the war would have
been finished with no danger and little trouble. From their own sloth,
therefore, they refused what God was ready to bestow. And thus it happened that
the agreement by which the two tribes and half-tribe had bound themselves,
ceased to be binding. For the only obligation they had undertaken was to
accompany the ten tribes, and contend for their inheritance as strenuously as if
their condition had been exactly the same. Now, when they have perseveringly
performed their part as faithful allies, and the ten tribes contented with their
present fortune, not only do not demand, but rather tacitly repudiate their
assistance, a free return to their homes is justly allowed them. They, indeed,
deserve praise for their patient endurance, in not allowing weariness of the
service to make them request their discharge, but in waiting quietly till Joshua
of his own accord sends for
them.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f174</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
But take diligent heed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc He thus
releases and frees them from temporary service, that he may bind them for ever
to the authority of the one true God. He therefore permits them to return home,
but on the condition that wherever they may be they are to be the soldiers of
God; and he at the same time prescribes the mode, namely, the observance of his
Law. But since such is the vanity and inconstancy of the human mind, that
religion easily fades away from the heart, while carelessness and contempt creep
in, he requires of them zeal and diligence in executing the Law. He calls it the
Law of Moses, that they may not be carried to and fro by airy speculations, but
remain fixed in the doctrine which they had learned from the faithful servant of
God. He touches also on the end and sum of the Law, love to God, and adherence
to him, because outward worship would otherwise be of little value. He confirms
the same thing by other words, by which sincerity is denoted, namely, serving
the Lord with their whole heart and
soul.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Return with much
riches</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc As it was formerly seen that the
greater part of the two tribes were left in their territories beyond the Jordan,
when the others passed over to carry on the war, it was fair that, as they had
lived in case with their families, or been only occupied with domestic concerns,
they should be contented with their own livelihood and the produce of their own
labor. And they certainly could not, without dishonesty, have demanded that any
part of the booty and spoil should be distributed among them, when they had
taken no share in all the toil and the danger. Joshua, however, does not insist
on the strictly legal view, but exhorts the soldiers to deal liberally with
their countrymen, by sharing the prey with them. Here some one may unseasonably
raise the question, Whether or not the booty was common? For Joshua does not
decide absolutely that it is their duty to do as he enjoins; he admonishes them
that, after they have been enriched by the divine blessing, it would betray a
want of proper feeling not to be liberal and kind towards their brethren,
especially as it was not their fault that they did not take part in the same
expedition. Moreover, when he bids them divide, he does not demand an equal
partition, such as that which is usual among partners and equals, but only to
bestow something that may suffice to remove all cause of envy and
hatred.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when they came unto the
borders</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc The history here is
particularly deserving of notice, when the two tribes and half-tribe, intending
to erect a memorial of common faith and fraternal concord, allowed themselves
from inconsiderate zeal to adopt a method which was justly suspected by their
brethren. The ten tribes, thinking that the worship of God was violated with
impious audacity and temerity, were inflamed with holy wrath, and took up arms
to use them against their own blood; nor were they appeased till they had
received full satisfaction. The motive for erecting the altar was right in
itself. For the object of the children of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, was to
testify that though they were separated from their brethren by the intervening
stream, they were, however, united with them in religion, and cherished a mutual
agreement in the doctrine of the Law. Nothing was farther from their intention
than to innovate in any respect in the worship of God. But they sinned not
lightly in attempting a novelty, without paying any regard to the high priest,
or consulting their brethren, and in a form which was very liable to be
misconstrued.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We know how strictly the Law
prohibited two altars,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;022024&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
20:24) for the Lord wished to be worshipped in one place only. Therefore, when
on the very first blush of the case, all were at once led to think that they
were building a second altar, who would not have judged them guilty of sacrilege
in framing a ritual of a degenerate description, at variance with the Law of
God? Seeing, then, that the work might be deemed vicious, they ought, at least,
in so great and so serious a matter, to have made their brethren sharers in
their counsel; more especially were they in the wrong in neglecting to consult
the high priest, from whose lips the divine will was to be ascertained. They
were, therefore, deserving of blame, because, as if they had been alone in the
world, they considered not what offence might arise from the novelty of the
example. Wherefore, let us learn to attempt nothing rashly, even should it be
free from blame, and let us always give due heed to the admonition of St. Paul,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460612&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 6:12;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461023&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

but to what is expedient; more especially let us sedulously beware of disturbing
pious minds</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f176</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by the introduction of any kind of
novelty.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the children of Israel heard
say</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc There is no doubt that they
were inflamed with holy zeal, nor ought their vehemence to seem excessive in
taking up arms to destroy their countrymen on account of a pile of stones. For
they truly and wisely judged that the lawful sanctuary of God was polluted and
his worship profaned, that sacred things were violated, pious concord destroyed,
and a door opened for the license of superstitious practices, if in two places
victims were offered to God, who had for these reasons so solemnly bound the
whole people to a single altar. Not rashly, therefore, do the ten tribes, on
hearing of a profane altar, detest its sacrilegious
audacity.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here, then, we have an illustrious
display of piety, teaching us that if we see the pure worship of God corrupted,
we must be strenuous, to the utmost of our ability, in vindicating it. The
sword, indeed, has not been committed to the hands of all; but every one must,
according to his call and office, study manfully and firmly to maintain the
purity of religion against all corruption's. More especially deserving of the
highest praise was the zeal of the half-tribe of Manasseh, who, setting aside
all regard to the flesh, did not spare their own family. I admit, however, that
this zeal, though pious, was not free from turbulent impetuosity, inasmuch as
they hasten to declare war before they inquired concerning the mind of their
brethren, and properly ascertained the state of the case. War, I admit, was
declared only under conditions; for they send ambassadors to bring back word
after they had carefully investigated the matter, and they move not a finger in
the way of inflicting punishment till they are certified of the existence of the
crime. Excuse, therefore, may be made for the fervor of their passion, while
they prepare for battle in the event of any defection being
discovered.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

known that this second altar was opposed to the one only altar of God, they
begin with upbraiding them, and that in a very harsh and severe manner. They
thus assume it as confessed, that the two tribes had built the altar with a view
of offering sacrifices upon it. In this they are mistaken, as it was destined
for a different use and purpose. Moreover, had the idea which they had conceived
been correct, all the expostulation which they employ would have been just; for
it was a clear case of criminal revolt to make any change in the Law of God, who
values obedience more than all sacrifices,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;091522&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is the iniquity of Peor too
little for us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> etc They represent the
crime as more heinous, from their perverse obstinacy in not ceasing ever and
anon to provoke the Lord by their abominations. They bring forward one signal
example of recent occurrence. While they were encircling the sanctuary of God
from the four cardinal points, like good watchmen of God, and when they had
received the form of due worship, and were habituated to it by constant
exercise, they had allowed themselves, through the seductive allurements of
harlots, to be polluted by foul superstitions, and had worshipped Baal-Peor. As
the whole people were implicated in this crime, the ten ambassadors do not
hesitate to admit, that they were partners in the guilt. They therefore ask, Is
not the iniquity which we contracted in the matter of Baal-Peor sufficient? They
add, that they were not yet purified from it, just as if they had said, that the
remembrance of it was not yet entirely buried, or that the vengeance of God was
not yet extinguished; and hence they infer, that the two tribes and the half
tribe, while with impious contumacy they turn aside from God, and shake off his
yoke, not only consult ill for themselves, but are calling down similar
destruction on the whole people, because God will avenge the insult offered him
to a wider extent. This they confirm by the example of Achan, who, though he was
alone when he secretly stole of the accursed thing, did not alone undergo the
punishment of his sacrilege, but also dragged others along with him, as it was
seen that some fell in the line of battle, while all were shamefully put to
flight, because pollution attached to the
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino">They reason from the less to the
greater. If the anger of God burnt against many for the clandestine misdeed of
one man, much less would he allow the people to escape if they connived at
manifest idolatry. A middle view, however, is inserted, that if the two tribes
and half tribe built up an altar, and if their condition was worse from not
dwelling in the land of Canaan, let them rather come and obtain a settlement
also in the land of Canaan, but let them not provoke God by a wicked
rivalship.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

by some turgid impetus, since, even at their own loss and expense, they are
willing kindly to offer partnership to those who had demanded a settlement and
domicile for themselves
elsewhere.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Joshua

on the definition. For the children of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, explain that
they had a different intention, and thus exculpate themselves from the charge,
inasmuch as the nature of the proceeding was quite different from what the
others supposed. In not making a
disturbance,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f179</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> nor picking a quarrel for the injustice
done, to them they give an example of rare modesty, which is held forth for our
imitation; so that if at any time anything we have rightly done happen to be
unjustly and falsely blamed by those not acquainted with its nature, we may deem
it sufficient to refute the censure only so far as may be necessary for clearing
ourselves. Moreover, that the more credit may be given to them, and that they
may the better attest their integrity, they, by a solemn protest, put far from
them the wickedness of which they were suspected. For there is force and meaning
in the reduplication, The Lord God of gods, the Lord God of gods, by which they
with vehemence affirm, how faithfully they desire to persevere in the doctrine
of the Law, and how greatly they abhor all contrary superstitions. But as their
intention was not patent to men, and every one explained it variously, according
to his own sense, they appeal to the judgment of God, and offer to submit to
punishment if he decide that they had attempted anything wickedly. And to prove
that they are not like hypocrites who, with abandoned wickedness, appeal to God
a hundred times as judge even when they are convicted in their own minds, they
not only bring forward conscience, but at the same time declare, that the whole
people will be witness; as if they had said, that it will be made palpable by
the fact itself, that they never had any intention of devising any new form of
worship; and they rightly explain, how the altar would have been unlawful,
namely, if they had built it for the purpose of offering sacrifice. For the Law
did not condemn the mere raising of heaps of stones, but only enjoined that
sacrifices should be offered in one place, for the purpose of retaining the
people in one faith, lest religion should be rent asunder, lest license should
be given to human presumption, and thus every man might turn aside to follow his
own fictions. We thus see how an explanation of the nature of the deed removes
the detestation which the ten tribes had conceived of
it.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f180</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">It is not strictly correct, though
appropriate enough, for the rudeness of sense, to place our God above all gods.
For it is impossible to compare him with others, seeing that no others actually
exist. Hence, in order to avoid the apparent absurdity, some interpreters
substitute <i>angels </i>for <i>gods; </i>this meaning holds in some cases,
though not in all. It ought not, however, to seem harsh when he who is the one
sole supreme being is called the God of gods, inasmuch as he has no equal,
standing forth conspicuous above all other height, and so, by his glory,
obscuring and annihilating all names of deity which are celebrated in the world.
Hence this mode of speaking ought to be viewed with reference to the common
sense of the vulgar.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore we
said</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc The gross impiety of which
they had been accused was now well refuted; and yet they seem not to have been
in every respect free from blame, because the Law forbids the erection of any
kind of statues. It is easy, however, to excuse this by saying, that no kind of
statues are condemned except those which are intended to represent God. To erect
a heap of stones as a trophy, or in testimony of a miracle, or a memorial of
some signal favor of God, the Law has nowhere prohibited.

defiled themselves by profane innovation. But the only thing displeasing to God
was to see the minds of men drawn hither and thither, so as to worship him in a
gross and earthly manner. The children of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh do all that
is required for their exculpation, when they declare that they would use the
altar only as a bond of brotherly union; and add a sufficient reason, namely,
the danger there was, lest, after a long course of time, the ten tribes might
exclude the others as strangers, because they did not inhabit the same land. For
as the country beyond the Jordan was not at first comprehended in the covenant,
a difference of habitation might ultimately prove a cause of dissension. They
therefore consult timelessly for their posterity, that they may be able by means
of the altar as a kind of public document to defend their right, that they may
mutually recognize each other, and unite in common in serving one
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b>

rightly temper their zeal, when, instead of harshly insisting and urging the
prejudice which they had conceived, they blandly and willingly admit the excuse.
Many persons, if once offended and exasperated by any matter, cannot be appeased
by any defense, and always find something maliciously and unjustly to carp at,
rather than seem to yield to reason. The example here is worthy of observation.
It teaches us that if at any time we conceive offence in regard to a matter not
sufficiently known, we must beware of obstinacy, and be ready instantly to take
an equitable view. Moreover, when the children of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh are
found free from crime, Phinehas and the ambassadors ascribe it to the grace of
God. For by the words, We know that Jehovah is in the midst of us, they intimate
that God was propitious to them, and had taken care of their
safety.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This is to be carefully observed; for we
are able to infer from it that we never revolt from God, or fall off to impiety
unless he abandon us, and give us up when thus abandoned to a reprobate mind.
All idolatry, therefore, shows that God has previously been alienated, and is
about to punish us by inflicting judicial blindness. Meanwhile, we must hold
that we persevere in piety only in so far as God is present to sustain us by his
hand, and confirm us in perseverance by the agency of his Spirit. Phinehas and
the ambassadors speak as if they had been delivered by the children of Reuben,
Gad, and Manasseh, because there was no longer any ground to fear the divine
vengeance, when all suspicion of criminality had been removed. At last similar
equity and humanity are displayed by the whole people, when accepting the

<div align="center"><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here we have a narrative of the solemn protestation
which Joshua used towards the time of his death, that he might leave the pure
worship of God surviving him. But although the peace and quiet which the
Israelites obtained among the nations of Canaan is described as an excellent
blessing from God, it is necessary to keep in mind what I formerly taught, that
it was owing to their cowardice that they dwelt among their enemies, whom it
would not have been difficult to rout and destroy. But thanks are justly
rendered to God for his goodness in pardoning their
ingratitude.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The pious solicitude of Joshua is
here also set forth, for the imitation of all who are in authority. For as the
father of a family will not be considered sufficiently provident if he thinks of
his children only till the end of his own life, and does not extend his care
farther, studying as much as in him lies to do them good even when he is dead;
so good magistrates and rulers ought carefully to provide that the well arranged
condition of affairs as they leave them, be confirmed and prolonged to a distant
period. For this reason Peter writes, (2 Peter
1:15)</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f182a</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that he will endeavor after he has
departed out of the world to keep the Church in remembrance of his admonitions,
and able to derive benefit from them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">From its
being said that he invited all Israel, and its being immediately after added
that he invited their elders, and heads, and judges, and prefects, I understand
the meaning to be that all were indeed permitted to come, but that the summons
was addressed specially to the heads and prefects. And thus the last clause
appears to me to be explanatory of the former. And, indeed, it is not at all
credible that the whole people were invited; for no such meeting could possibly
take place. The sense, therefore, in which the people were invited was simply
this, that the elders, judges, and others were commanded to come, and might
bring as many persons as were disposed to come along with
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The speech of Joshua, as quoted, is
double; but it appears to me that the historian first, as is often done, gives a
brief summary of the whole speech, and then follows it out more in detail,
introducing the particulars which he had
omitted.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f183</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In the one which is first given, Joshua
briefly animates the people, and exhorts them to sure confidence in the
continued and unwearying grace of God. For, seeing they had experienced that God
is true in all things, they could have no doubt for the future, that they might
safely hope for the same success in vanquishing and destroying the enemy. The
partition also by which he had distributed the remainder of the land, he set
before them as an earnest or pledge of their undoubted fruition, because it was
not at random but by the order of God he had marked out the seat, and fixed the
boundaries of each tribe.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be you therefore very
courageous</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc He now shows them the
mode of conquering, &#8212; not to indulge gross security, as too often happens,
as a substitute for genuine confidence. He affirms that God will be propitious
to them, and promises that whatever they attempt will turn out prosperously,
provided they are steadfast in obeying the Law. However confidently hypocrites
may contemn and deride God, they would wish, however, to have him astricted to
them; nay, they often, with no small pomposity, boast of his promises. But true
faith, while it reclines upon God, keeps those who possess it in his fear. In
short, those who would find God must seek him sincerely, and if we desire to be
regarded by him, we must beware of turning our backs upon him. The expression,
Be you very courageous, as has elsewhere been said, denotes serious study,
because in the great weakness of our nature no man will set about the thorough
observance of the Law, if he does not exert himself above his strength.
Attention ought also to be paid to the definition of true obedience which is
here repeated from Moses,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050532&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
5:32) and said to consist in not turning either to the right hand or the
left.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That you come not among these
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc He distinctly admonishes
them that it will be impossible rightly to discharge their duty if they be not
carefully on their guard against all sources of corruption. This it was very
necessary to enforce upon them. For they were surrounded on all sides by the
snares of Satan, and we know how great their proneness to superstition was, or
rather how headlong their eagerness for it. First, then, he warns them that
intimate intercourse with the nations may involve them in fellowship in crime;
for the term <i>mingling </i>used in this passage is equivalent to what is
termed by St. Paul, <i>being yoked.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470614&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 6:14) In short, he first removes the incitements or allurements to
idolatry, and then declares his detestation of idolatry itself. It is to be
observed, however, that he does not expressly mention either bending of the
knee, or sacrifices, or other rites, but designates all perverse modes of
worship by the terms <i>naming </i>them and <i>swearing </i>by them. Whence we
infer that God is defrauded of his honor when ever any particle, however small,
of all the things which he claims for himself is transferred to idols. He
accordingly concludes that they are to adhere to God alone; in other words, they
are to be bound to him out and
out.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
For the Lord has driven out from before you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>etc He intimates that so long as they do not themselves change, there will
certainly be no change on the part of God. Therefore he asserts that, provided
they conciliate the favor of God, they shall have an uninterrupted course of
victory. At length he again exhorts them, as they value their life and safety,
to be careful in maintaining love to God. From this source all true obedience
springs; for if we do not cling to him with free and ardent affection, we shall
study in vain to frame our lives in accordance with the external form of the
Law.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Joshua

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Else if you do in any wise go
back</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc According to the usual method
observed in the Law, he adds threatening, in order that if they are not
sufficiently allured by the divine goodness, they may be aroused by fear to the
performance of their duty. It is, indeed, disgraceful for men, when God
graciously condescends to invite them, not at once to run forward and meet the
invitation by prompt and alert obedience; but such is the lethargy of the flesh,
that it always requires to be stimulated by threats. Joshua, therefore, adopts
the usual method of the Law, while he reminds the Israelites of the terrors of
the Lord, provided they do not of their own accord embrace his offered favor.
Moreover, it is not once only that, he sets before them the denunciation that
the nations of Canaan will be scourges to their sides and thorns in their eyes
if they become familiar with them. <i>First, </i>inasmuch as God had consecrated
the land to himself, he wished it to be purged of all impurities; and
<i>secondly, </i>inasmuch as he saw how prone the people were to be corrupted by
bad example, he wished also to provide a remedy for this evil. Then, while on
the one hand the people counted it as nothing that the land should be
contaminated by impious superstitions, and that idols should be worshipped in it
instead of the true God, and on the other hand, eagerly contracted contagion
from their vices, it was only a just punishment of this gross contempt that they
should experience molestation and hostility from those whom they had
improperly</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"> f184
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">spared.</font><br><font face="Palatino">That
the threatening which both Moses and Joshua thus denounced were openly
accomplished, is but too plain from the Book of Judges. And yet this
promulgation of the divine vengeance was not altogether useless; for after
Joshua was dead, they became courageous enough to engage in war. Their ardor,
however, proved
evanescent,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f185</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and they shortly after were initiated in
nefarious Gentile rites. Hence, we perceive in the human mind an intemperate
longing for perverse worship, a longing which no curbs are able to
restrain.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is now proper to consider how far
this doctrine is applicable to us. It is true a special command was given to the
ancient people to destroy the nations of Canaan, and keep aloof from all profane
defilement's. To us, in the present day, no certain region marks out our precise
boundaries; nor are we armed with the sword to slay all the ungodly; we have
only to beware of allowing ourselves to become involved in fellowship with
wickedness, by not keeping at a sufficient distance from it. For it is almost
impossible, if we mingle with it, spontaneously to avoid receiving some spot or
blemish. But this point having been elsewhere expounded, I now merely advert to
it in passing.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And, behold, this day I am
going</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc As it has been appointed unto
all men once to die,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580927&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
9:27) Joshua says that in regard to himself the common end of all is at hand,
inasmuch as he, too, was born mortal. These expressions are evidently adapted to
console the people, and prevent them from feeling immoderate grief at the
bereavement when he should be taken from them. For there cannot be a doubt that
his loss filled the people with the deepest regret, when they saw themselves
reduced, as it were, to a mutilated trunk, by being deprived of their head. He
therefore admonishes them, that since the race of life is ended by having
reached the goal, they were not to ask that his condition should be different
from that of the whole human race. Meanwhile he does not intimate that the form
of dying is the same in all, because the believers of heavenly doctrine are
distinguished from unbelievers by an incorruptible seed, not allowing them in
like manner to perish, but only adverts to that which is common, namely,
departure from the world after the course of life is ended. The substance of his
whole address amounts to this, that as God had proved himself true by his favors
and the fulfillment of his promises, so his threatening would not be empty or
vain, and he would certainly avenge the profanation of his worship by their
final destruction.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

explains more fully what he before related more briefly. For it would not have
been suitable to bring out the people twice to a strange place for the same
cause. Therefore by the repetition the course of the narrative is continued. And
he now states what he had not formerly observed, that they were all standing
before the Lord, an expression which designates the more sacred dignity and
solemnity of the meeting. I have accordingly introduced the expletive particle
<i>Therefore, </i>to indicate that the narrative which had been begun now
proceeds. For there cannot be a doubt that Joshua, in a regular and solemn
manner, invoked the name of Jehovah, and, as in his presence, addressed the
people, so that each might consider for himself that God was presiding over all
the things which were done, and that they were not there engaged in a private
business, but confirming a sacred and inviolable compact with God himself. We
may add, as is shortly afterwards observed, that there was his sanctuary. Hence
it is probable that the ark of the covenant was conveyed thither, not with the
view of changing its place, but that in so serious an action they might sist
themselves before the earthly tribunal of
God.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

God had anticipated any application on their part, so that they could not boast
of any peculiar excellence or merit. For God had bound them to himself by a
closer tie, having, while they were no better than others, gathered them
together to be his peculiar people, from no respect to anything but his mere
good pleasure. Moreover, to make it clearly appear that there was nothing in
which they could glory, he leads them back to their origin, and reminds them how
their fathers had dwelt in Chaldea, worshipping idols in common with others, and
differing in nothing from the great body of their countrymen. Hence it is
inferred that Abraham, when he was plunged in idolatry, was raised up, as it
were, from the lowest deep.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Jews, indeed, to

f190</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But if we attend to the words of the
inspired writer, we shall see that he is no more exempted from the guilt of the
popular idolatry than Terah and Nachor. For why is it said that the fathers of
the people served strange gods, and that Abraham was rescued from the country,
but just to show how the free mercy of God was displayed in their very origin?
Had Abraham been unlike the rest of his countrymen, his own piety would
distinguish him. The opposite, however, is expressly mentioned to show that he
had no peculiar excellence of his own which could diminish the grace bestowed
upon him, and that therefore his posterity behooved to acknowledge that when he
was lost, he was raised up from death unto
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It seems almost an incredible and
monstrous thing, that while Noah was yet alive, idolatry had not only spread
everywhere over the world, but even penetrated into the family of Shem, in which
at least, a purer religion ought to have flourished. How insane and indomitable
human infatuation is in this respect, is proved by the fact that the holy
Patriarch, on whom the divine blessing had been specially bestowed, was unable
to curb his posterity, and prevent them from abandoning the true God, and
prostituting themselves to
superstition.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I took your father
Abraham</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc This expression gives
additional confirmation to what I lately showed, that Abraham did not emerge
from profound ignorance and the abyss of error by his own virtue, but was drawn
out by the hand of God. For it is not said that he sought God of his own accord,
but that he was taken by God and transported elsewhere. Joshua then enlarges on
the divine kindness in miraculously preserving Abraham safe during his long
pilgrimage. What follows, however, begets some doubt, namely, that God
multiplied the seed of Abraham, and yet gave him only Isaac, because no mention
is made of any but him. But this comparison illustrates the singular grace of
God towards them in that, while the offspring of Abraham was otherwise numerous,
their ancestor alone held the place of lawful heir. In the same sense it is
immediately added, that while Esau and Jacob were brothers and twins, one of the
two was retained and the other passed over. We see, therefore, why as well in
the case of Ishmael and his brother as in that of Esau, he loudly extols the
divine mercy and goodness towards Jacob, just as if he were saying, that his
race did not excel others in any respect except in that of being specially
selected by God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But Jacob and his children
went down</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc After mentioning the
rejection of Esau, he proceeds to state how Jacob went down into Egypt, and
though he confines himself to a single expression, it is one which indicates the
large and exuberant and clear manifestation of the paternal favor of God. It
cannot be doubted, that although the sacred historian does not speak in lofty
terms of each miracle performed, Joshua gave the people such a summary
exposition of their deliverance as might suffice. First, he points to the
miracles performed in Egypt; next, he celebrates the passage of the Red Sea,
where God gave them the aid of his inestimable power; and thirdly, he reminds
them of the period during which they wandered in the
desert.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I brought you into the
land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc He at length begins to
discourse of the victories which opened a way for the occupation of their
settlements. For although the country beyond the Jordan had not been promised as
part of the inheritance, yet, as God, by his decree, joined it to the land of
Canaan as a cumulative expression of his bounty, Joshua, not without cause,
connects it with the other in commending the divine liberality towards the
people, and declares, not merely that trusting to divine aid, they had proved
superior in arms and strength, but had also been protected from the fatal snares
which Balak had laid for them. For although the impostor Balaam was not able to
effect anything by his curses and imprecations, it was, however, very<i>
</i>profitable to observe the admirable power of God displayed in defeating his
malice. For it was just as if he had come to close quarters, and warred with
everything that could injure them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The more
firmly to persuade them that they had overcome not merely by the guidance of
God, but solely by his power, he repeats what we read in the books of Moses,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050720&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
7:20) that hornets were sent to rout the enemy without human hand. This was a
more striking miracle than if they had been routed, put to flight, and scattered
in any other way. For those who, contrary to expectation, gain a victory without
any difficulty, although they confess that the prosperous issue of the war is
the gift of God, immediately allow themselves to become blinded by pride, and
transfer the praise to their own wisdom, activity, and valor. But when the thing
is effected by hornets, the divine agency is indubitably asserted. Accordingly,
the conclusion is, that the people did not acquire the land by their own sword
or bow, a conclusion repeated in the 44th Psalm, and apparently borrowed from
the passage here. Lastly, after reminding them that they ate the fruits provided
by other men's labors, he exhorts them to love God as his beneficence
deserves.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Joshua

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if it seem evil unto
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc It seems here as if Joshua were
paying little regard to what becomes an honest and right-hearted leader. If the
people had forsaken God and gone after idols, it was his duty to inflict
punishment on their impious and abominable revolt. But now, by giving them the
option to serve God or not, just as they choose, he loosens the reins, and gives
them license to rush audaciously into sin. What follows is still more absurd,
when he tells them that they cannot serve the Lord, as if he were actually
desirous of set purpose to impel them to shake off the yoke. But there is no
doubt that his tongue was guided by the inspiration of the Spirit, in stirring
up and disclosing their feelings. For when the Lord brings men under his
authority, they are usually willing enough to profess zeal for piety, though
they instantly fall away from it. Thus they build without a foundation. This
happens because they neither distrust their own weakness so much as they ought,
nor consider how difficult it is to bind themselves wholly to the Lord. There is
need, therefore, of serious examination, lest we be carried aloft by some giddy
movement, and so fail of success in our very first
attempts.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f194</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> With this design, Joshua, by way of
probation, emancipates the Jews, making them, as it were, their own masters, and
free to choose what God they are willing to serve, not with the view of
withdrawing them from the true religion, as they were already too much inclined
to do, but to prevent them from making inconsiderate promises, which they would
shortly after violate. For the real object of Joshua was, as we shall see, to
renew and confirm the covenant which had already been made with God. Not without
cause, therefore, does he give them freedom of choice, that they may not
afterwards pretend to have been under compulsion, when they bound themselves by
their own consent. Meanwhile, to impress them with a feeling of shame, he
declares that he and his house will persevere in the worship of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the people answered and
said</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Here we see he had no reason
to repent of the option given, when the people, not swearing in the words of
another, nor obsequiously submitting to extraneous dictation, declare that it
would be an impious thing to revolt from God. And thus it tends, in no small
degree, to confirm the covenant, when the people voluntarily lay the law upon
themselves. The substance of the answer is, that since the Lord has, by a
wonderful redemption, purchased them for himself as a peculiar people, has
constantly lent them his aid, and shown that he is among them as their God, it
would be detestable ingratitude to reject him and revolt to other
gods.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joshua said unto the
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Here Joshua seems to act
altogether absurdly in crushing the prompt and alert zeal of the people, by
suggesting ground of alarm. For to what end does he insist that they cannot
serve the Lord, unless it be to make them, from a sense of their utter
powerlessness, to give themselves up to despair, and thus necessarily become
estranged from the fear of God. It was necessary, however, to employ this harsh
mode of obtestation, in order to rouse a sluggish people, rendered more
lethargic by security. And we see that the expedient did not fail to obtain, at
least, a momentary success. For they neither despond nor become more slothful,
but, surmounting the obstacle, answer intrepidly that they will be constant in
the performance of duty.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In short, Joshua does
not deter them from serving God, but only explains how refractory and
disobedient they are, in order that they may learn to change their temper. So
Moses, in his song, (Deuteronomy 32) when he seems to make a divorce between God
and the people, does nothing else than prick and whet them, that they may hasten
to change for the better. Joshua, indeed, argues absolutely from the nature of
God; but what he specially aims at is the perverse behavior and untamed
obstinacy of the people. He declares that Jehovah is a holy and a jealous God.
This, certainly, should not by any means prevent men from worshipping him; but
it follows from it that impure, wicked, and profane despisers, who have no
religion, provoke his anger, and can have no intercourse with him, for they will
feel him to be implacable. And when it is said that he will not spare their
wickedness, no general rule is laid down, but the discourse is directed, as
often elsewhere, against their disobedient temper. It does not refer to faults
in general, or to special faults, but is confined to gross denial of God, as the
next verse demonstrates. The people, accordingly, answer the more
readily,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f195</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that they will serve the
Lord.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joshua said unto the
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc We now understand what the
object was at which Joshua had hitherto aimed. It was not to terrify the people
and make them fall away from their religion, but to make the obligation more
sacred by their having of their own accord chosen his government, and betaken
themselves to his guidance, that they might live under his protection. They
acknowledge, therefore, that their own conscience will accuse them, and hold
them guilty of perfidy, if they prove
unfaithful.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f196</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But although they were not insincere in
declaring that they would be witnesses to their own condemnation, still how
easily the remembrance of this promise faded away, is obvious from the Book of
Judges. For when the more aged among them had died, they quickly turned aside to
various superstitions. By this example we are taught how multifarious are the
fallacies which occupy the senses of men, and how tortuous the recesses in which
they hide their hypocrisy and folly, while they deceive themselves by vain
confidence.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f197</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now, therefore, put away the
strange gods</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc How can it be that
those who were lately such stern avengers of superstition, have themselves given
admission to idols? Yet the words expressly enjoin that they are to put away
strange gods from the midst of them. If we interpret that their own houses were
still polluted by idols, we may see, as in a bright mirror, how complacently the
greater part of mankind can indulge in vices which they prosecute with
inexorable severity in others. But, as I do not think it probable that they
dared, after the execution of Achan, to pollute themselves with manifest
sacrilege, I am inclined to think that reference is made not to their practice
but to their inclinations, and that they are told to put all ideas of false gods
far away from them. For he had previously exhorted them in this same chapter to
take away the gods whom their fathers had served beyond the river and in Egypt.
But nobody will suppose that the idols of Chaldea were treasured up in their
repositories, or that they had brought impure deities with them from Egypt, to
be a cause of hostility between God and themselves. The meaning, therefore,
simply is, that they are to renounce all idols, and clear themselves of all
profanity, in order that they may purely worship God
alone.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So Joshua made a
covenant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc This passage demonstrates
the end for which the meeting had been called, namely, to bind the people more
completely and more solemnly to God, by the renewal of the covenant. Therefore,
in this agreement, Joshua acted as if he had been appointed on the part of God
to receive in his name the homage and obedience promised by the people. It is
accordingly added, exegetically, in the second clause, that he set before them
precept and judgment. For the meaning is corrupted and wrested by some
expositors, who explain it is referring to some new speech of Joshua, whereas it
ought properly to be understood of the Law of Moses, as if it had been said that
Joshua made no other paction than that they should remain steadfast in observing
the Law, and that no other heads of the covenant were brought forward; they were
only confirmed in that doctrine which they had formerly embraced and professed.
In the same way, Malachi, to<b> </b>keep them under the yoke of God, demands
nothing more than that they should remember the Law of Moses.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
4:4)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joshua wrote these
words</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc Understand that authentic
volume which was kept near the ark of the covenant, as if it contained public
records deposited for perpetual remembrance. And there is no doubt that when the
Law was read, the promulgation of this covenant was also added. But as it often
happens, that that which is written remains concealed in unopened
books,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f201</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> another aid is given to the memory, one
which should always be exposed to the eye, namely, the stone under the ark, near
the sanctuary. Not that the perpetual station of the ark was there, but because
it had been placed there, in order that they might appear in the presence of
God. Therefore, as often as they came into his presence, the testimony or
memorial of the covenant which had been struck was in their view, that they
might be the better kept in the faith.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Joshua's
expression, that the stone heard the words, is indeed hyperbolical, but is not
inapt to express the efficacy and power of the divine word, as if it had been
said that it pierces inanimate rocks and stones; so that if men are deaf, their
condemnation is echoed in all the elements. <i>To lie </i>is here used, as it
frequently is elsewhere, for acting cunningly and deceitfully, for frustrating
and violating a promise that has been given. Who would not suppose that a
covenant so well established would be firm and sacred to posterity for many
ages? But all that Joshua gained by his very great anxiety was to secure its
rigorous observance for a few years.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass after these
things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc The honor of sepulture was a
mark of reverence, which of itself bore testimony to the affectionate regard of
the people. But neither this reverence nor affection was deeply rooted. The
title by which Joshua is distinguished after his death, when he is called the
servant of the Lord, took away all excuse from those miserable and abandoned men
who shortly after spurned the Lord, who had worked wonders among them.
Accordingly, attention is indirectly drawn to their inconstancy, when it is said
that they served the Lord while Joshua survived, and till the more aged had died
out. For there is a tacit antithesis, implying lapse and alienation, when they
were suddenly seized with a forgetfulness of the Divine favors. It is not
strange, therefore, if, in the present day also, when God furnishes any of his
servants with distinguished and excellent gifts, their authority protects and
preserves the order and state of the Church; but when they are dead, sad havoc
instantly commences, and hidden impiety breaks forth with unbridled
license.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">
f202</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>32.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the bones of
Joseph</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc The time when the bones of
Joseph were buried is not mentioned; but it is easy to infer that the Israelites
had performed this duty after they obtained a peaceful habitation in the city of
Shechem. For although he had not designated a particular place for a sepulchre,
they thought it a mark of respect to deposit his bones in the field which Jacob
had purchased. It may be, however, that this is expressed as a censure on the
sluggishness of the people, to which it was owing, that Joseph could not be
buried with Abraham, that locality being still in the power of the enemy.
Stephen (Acts 7) mentions the bones of the twelve patriarchs, and it is not
impossible that the other tribes, from feelings of emulation, gathered together
the ashes of their progenitors. It is there said that the field was purchased by
Abraham; but obviously an error in the name has crept in. With regard to
sepulture, we must hold in general, that the very frequent mention of it in
Scripture is owing to its being a symbol of the future
Resurrection.</font><br></div>

prudently.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>9	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Have

thou

Joshua commanded the prefects of the people, saying,

through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Make ready

possess.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>12	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
to the Reubenites, and Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh, spoke Joshua,
saying,

the word which Moses, the servant of Jehovah, commanded you, saying, Jehovah
your God has rendered you quiet, and has given you this
land:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>14	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Your
wives, your little ones, and your flocks will remain in the land which Moses has
given you beyond the Jordan; but you, as many of you as are men of war, will
pass over armed before your brethren, and assist
them,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>15	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Until
Jehovah shall have given rest to your brethren as to you; and they, too, possess
the land which Jehovah your God give to them; and then shall you return to the

gave you beyond Jordan toward the rising of the
sun.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>16	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Then
they answered Joshua, saying, All things which thou has commanded us will we do,
and to all places to which thou shall send us, will we
go.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>17	</b></font><font face="Palatino">As

with thee as he was with
Moses.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>18	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Whoever
he shall be that shall rebel against thy mouth, and shall not acquiesce in thy

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>1	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Now,
Joshua, the son of Nun, had sent from Sittim two men as spies secretly, saying:
Go, examine the land and Jericho. They accordingly set out and entered the house
of a woman, a harlot, whose name was Rahab, and slept
there.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>2	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
it was told to the king of Jericho, Behold, men of the children of Israel have
come hither to-night to spy out the
land.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>3	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Then
the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring out the men who have gone in to
thee, who have come to thy house; for they have come to spy out the whole
land.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>4	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Now
the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. Then she says, The men, indeed,
came to me, but I knew not whence they
were.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>5	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
it was when the gate was shut in the darkness that the men went out, and I know
not whither they went. Follow them quickly, for you shall apprehend
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>6	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Now
she had caused them to go up upon the roof, and had hidden them under stalks of
flax, arranged by her on the
roof.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>7	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
the men pursued them by the way of the Jordan, even to the fords; they,
moreover, shut the gate as soon as those who pursued them went
out.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>8	</b></font><font face="Palatino">But
before they were asleep, she herself went up on the roof to
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>9	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
she says to the men, I know that Jehovah has given you the land, inasmuch as
your terror has fallen upon us, and all the inhabitants of the land have melted
at your
presence.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>10	</b></font><font face="Palatino">For
we heard how the Lord dried up the waters of the sea of Suph (the Red Sea) from
before you when you went out from Egypt; and what things you did to the two
kings of the Amorite, who were beyond Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you
slew.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>11	</b></font><font face="Palatino">We
heard, and our heart was melted, neither had we any more spirit before you. For
Jehovah your God is God in heaven above and on the earth
beneath.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>12	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Now
therefore swear unto me, I pray, by Jehovah, (for I have dealt mercifully with
you,) that you will also deal mercifully with the house of my father, and give
me a true
sign,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>13	</b></font><font face="Palatino">That
you will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brothers, and my sisters,
and all who are theirs, and will rescue our souls from
death.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>14	</b></font><font face="Palatino">The
men said unto her, Our life for you unto death; only you will not betray this
our conversation; then it will be that when Jehovah shall have delivered the
land to us, we will deal truly and mercifully with
you.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>15	</b></font><font face="Palatino">She
therefore let them down through the window by a rope; for her house was in the
building of the wall, and she herself dwelt on the
wall.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>16	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
she said to them, Hasten to the mountain, lest perchance those who are pursuing
fall in with you, and keep lurking there for three days, till those who are
pursuing return, and afterwards you will go on your
way.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>17	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Then
the men said to her, We shall be blameless from this your oath by which you have
bound
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>18	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Behold,
when we shall enter the land, you will bind this line of purple thread in the
window by which you have let us down; moreover, you will assemble in the house
with you, your father, and your mother, and all the family of your
father.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>19	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
it shall be that whoever shall go outside beyond the doors of the house, his
blood shall be upon his head, but we shall be blameless; and whoever shall be
with you, his blood shall be upon our head, if a hand be laid upon
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>20	</b></font><font face="Palatino">But
if you shall betray this our conversation, we shall be free from the oath by
which you have bound
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>21	</b></font><font face="Palatino">She
answered, As you have spoken, so be it. Then she sent them away, and they
departed; and she bound the scarlet thread in the
window.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>22	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Having
set out, they came to the mountain, and remained there three days, till the
return of those who had pursued, who searched over the whole way, and did not
find
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>23	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Those

and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and related to him whatever things had
happened to
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>24	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
they said to Joshua, Jehovah has delivered the whole land into our hands. For

you have not passed by that way yesterday or the day before
yesterday.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>5	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Now

Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass
before the people. They accordingly bare the ark of the covenant, and walked
before the
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>7	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Now
Jehovah had said to Joshua, To-day will I begin to magnify thee in the eyes of
all Israel, that they may know that in the same way as I was with Moses will I
be with
thee.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>8	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Thou,

When you shall have gone in as far as the extremity (outer edge) of the water of
the Jordan, you shall stand in the
Jordan.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>9	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of
Jehovah your
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>10	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Joshua
likewise said, Hereby shall you know that there is a living God in the midst of
you, and that he will thoroughly drive out before you the Canaanite, the
Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite,
and the
Jebusite.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>11	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Behold
the ark of the covenant of the ruler of the whole earth will pass before you
through the

when the soles of the feet of the priests bearing the ark of Jehovah, the ruler

the Jordan will be cut off, and the waters flowing from above shall stand in one
heap.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>14	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
it was that when the people set out to cross the Jordan, the priests who bore
the ark of the covenant were before the
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>15	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
after those who bare the ark came even to the Jordan, and the feet of the

Jordan was full beyond all its banks the whole time of
harvest,)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>16	</b></font><font face="Palatino">The
waters which descended from above stood, and rose up into one heap very far,
from the city Adam which is at the side of Sarthan, and those which descended to
the sea of the desert, the sea of salt, were consumed, were cut off: and the
people crossed over against
Jericho.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>17	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood unencumbered

it was after the whole people made an end of passing the Jordan; because Jehovah
had spoken to Joshua,

for you from the people twelve men, one man from each
tribe;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>3	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
command them, saying, Take for you hence out of the midst of the Jordan, from

you shall carry with you, and deposit in the place where you shall remain this
night.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>4	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Then
Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed out of the children of
Israel, one from each

Joshua said to them, Pass before the ark of Jehovah your God through the midst

according to the number of the tribes of the children of
Israel.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>6	</b></font><font face="Palatino">That
it may be among you, <i>(Hebrew, </i>in the midst of you,) when your children
shall to-morrow ask their fathers, What are those stones beside
you?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>7	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Then
you may answer them, When the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark
of the covenant of Jehovah, when, I say, it was crossing the Jordan, and the
waters of the Jordan were cut off, then were those stones made to be a memorial
to the children of Israel for
ever.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>8	</b></font><font face="Palatino">The
children of Israel accordingly did as Joshua had commanded, and took up twelve
stones out of the middle of the Jordan, as Jehovah had spoken to Joshua,
according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and they
brought them with them to the place where they passed the night, and laid them
down
there.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>9	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Joshua
also erected twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan under the station of the
feet of the priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant, and they have
remained there even to this
day.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>10	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
the priests, bearing the ark, kept standing in the midst of the Jordan, till all
the speech which Jehovah had commanded Joshua to speak to the people was
finished; exactly as Moses had commanded Joshua himself: but the people made
haste in
passing.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>11	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
when the whole people had made an end of passing, the ark of Jehovah passed, and
the priests in presence of the
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>12	</b></font><font face="Palatino">The
children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh also
passed over armed before the children of Israel; in like manner as Moses had
spoken to
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>13	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Forty
thousand armed men passed over in presence of Jehovah to battle to the plains of
Jericho.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>14	</b></font><font face="Palatino">On
that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the eyes of all Israel, and they feared him
just as they had feared Moses all the days of his
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>15	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
Jehovah spoke unto Joshua,
saying,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>16	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Command
the priests bearing the ark of the testimony to ascend from the
Jordan.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>17	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
Joshua commanded the priests, saying, Ascend from the
Jordan.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>18	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Moreover,
when the priests, bearing the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, had ascended from
the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the feet of the priests were
transferred to the dry land, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place,
and they flowed as yesterday and the day before yesterday above all its
banks.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>19	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Now
the people ascended from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and
encamped in Gilgal in the east district of
Jericho.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>20	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
the twelve stones which they had brought out of the Jordan, Joshua placed in
Gilgal.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>21	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
he spoke to the children of Israel, saying, When your sons shall to-morrow ask
their sons, saying, What mean those
stones?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>22	</b></font><font face="Palatino">You
shall explain to your sons, saying, Israel passed through the dry land across
that
Jordan:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>23	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Since
Jehovah your God dried the waters of Jordan from before your face until you
passed over; in like manner as Jehovah your God did to the Red Sea, which he
dried up from before our face till we passed
over;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>24	</b></font><font face="Palatino">That
all the nations of the earth may recognize the hand of Jehovah, how mighty he
is; that you may, during all days, fear Jehovah your God.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">CHAPTER
5</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>1	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
it was when all the Amorite kings who were beyond the Jordan, on the west, and
all the Canaanitish kings who were near the sea, had heard that Jehovah had
dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel till they
passed over, their heart was melted, and there was no longer any spirit in them
before the children of
Israel.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>2	</b></font><font face="Palatino">At
that time Jehovah said to Joshua, Make for thee sharp knives, and again
circumcise the children of Israel the second
time.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>3	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
Joshua made himself sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel on the
hill of
foreskins.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>4	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Now
this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them. The whole people who had come
out from Egypt, all the males, men of war, had died in the desert on the way
after they had come out from
Egypt.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>5	</b></font><font face="Palatino">For
the whole people who came out had been circumcised, but the whole people who had
been born in the desert on the way, after they had come out from Egypt, they had
not
circumcised.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>6	</b></font><font face="Palatino">For
the children of Israel walked through the desert till the extinction of the
whole race of the men of war, who had come out from Egypt, who had not listened
to the voice of Jehovah, to whom Jehovah had sworn that he would not show the
land of which he had sworn to their fathers that he would give them &#8212; a
land flowing with milk and
honey.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>7	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Their
sons accordingly whom he substituted in their place, Joshua circumcised, because
they were uncircumcised; for they had not circumcised them by the
way.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>8	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
when the whole people were circumcised, they remained in their place in the camp
till they were
healed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>9	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Jehovah
said to Joshua, This day have I rolled off the reproach of Egypt from you. And
he called the name of that place Gilgal even to this
day.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>10	</b></font><font face="Palatino">The
children of Israel therefore encamped in Gilgal, and they kept the Passover on
the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of
Jericho.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>11	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
they ate unfermented bread of the produce of the land, the day after the
Passover, and cake on the very same
day.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>12	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
the manna ceased the day after they ate of the corn of the country, nor had the
children of Israel manna any longer, but they ate of the fruit of the land of
Canaan that
year.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>13	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
it happened when Joshua was at Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked,
and behold a man stood over against him, in whose hand was a drawn sword, and
Joshua went to him, and said to him, Art thou on our side? or art thou on our
enemies'
side?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>14	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
he said, Nay, but I am prince of the army of Jehovah: I have now come. And
Joshua fell on his face to the ground, and worshipped, and said to him, What
says my Lord to his
servant?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>15	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
the prince of the army of the Lord said to Joshua, Loose thy shoe from thy feet:
for the place on which thou stands is holiness. And Joshua did
so.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">CHAPTER

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>1	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
Jericho was closed, and was shut up because of the children of Israel, nor could
any one go out or come
in.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>2	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
Jehovah said to Joshua, Behold, I have delivered into thy hand Jericho, and its
king, and its men of
valor.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>3	</b></font><font face="Palatino">You
shall therefore compass the city, all the men of war, going round it once: thus
shall thou do six
days.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>4	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Moreover,
seven priests shall bear seven rams' horns before the ark: But on the seventh
day you shall compass the city seven times, and let the priests themselves sound
with the
trumpets.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>5	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
when they shall have prolonged the sound with the ram's horn, as soon as you
shall have heard the sound of the trumpet, the whole people will shout with a
great shout, and the wall of the city will fall to pieces (under itself): and
the people will go up every one from his own
place.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>6	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Accordingly
Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of

of the ark of
Jehovah.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>7	</b></font><font face="Palatino">He
said also to the people, Pass over, and go round the city, and let every man
armed go before the ark of the

it was after Joshua spoke to the people, seven priests bore seven trumpets of
rams' horns, and passing over before the ark of Jehovah sounded with the
trumpets. And the ark of the covenant of Jehovah followed
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>9	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
every man armed went before the priests sounding with the trumpets; and he who
brought up the rear followed the ark while going and sounding with the
trumpets.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>10	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
Joshua had commanded the people, saying, You shall not shout, neither will you
let your voice be heard, neither will a word proceed from your mouth, until the
day when I shall have said to you, Shout: then shall you
shout.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>11	</b></font><font face="Palatino">The

to the camp; and they remained
there.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>12	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Joshua
rose again in the morning, and the priests bore the ark of
Jehovah.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>13	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
seven priests bearing seven trumpets of ram's horn preceded the ark of Jehovah
in going; and they sounded with the trumpets. But he that was armed preceded
them, and he who brought up the rear followed the ark of Jehovah in going, and
in sounding with the
trumpets.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>14	</b></font><font face="Palatino">They
accordingly compassed the city on the second day another time, and returned to
the camp; thus did they six
days.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>15	</b></font><font face="Palatino">But
when the seventh day arrived, they rose up as soon as it was dawn, and they went
round the city after the same manner seven times; only on that day they went
round the city seven
times.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>16	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
on the seventh time when the priests sounded with the trumpets, Joshua said to
the people, Shout, Jehovah has delivered you the
city.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>17	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
the city will be anathema (set apart) to Jehovah, it and whatever things are in
it; only Rahab, the harlot, shall live, she and all who shall be at home with
her; because she concealed the messengers whom we
sent.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>18	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Nevertheless,
beware you of the anathema, lest perhaps you touch something of the anathema,
and take away of the anathema, and make the camp of Israel anathema, and trouble
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>19	</b></font><font face="Palatino">But
all the silver and gold, and the iron and brazen vessels, will be holiness to
Jehovah; they will go into Jehovah's
treasury.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>20	</b></font><font face="Palatino">The
people accordingly shouted after they sounded with the trumpets. For when the
people had heard the noise of the trumpets, they shouted with a very great
shout, and the wall fell down, and the people went up, every one from his place,
and they took
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>21	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
they destroyed all things which were in the city, from the man even to the
woman, from the boy even to the old man, to the ox, and the sheep, and the ass,
by the edge of the
sword.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>22	</b></font><font face="Palatino">But
to the two men who had explored the land Joshua said, Go into the house of the
woman, the harlot, and thence lead out her and whatever she has, as you have
sworn to
her.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>23	</b></font><font face="Palatino">The
spies, therefore, having gone in, led out Rahab, and her father, and her mother,
and her brothers, and whatever she had, and led out her whole kindred, and
placed them without the camp of
Israel.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>24	</b></font><font face="Palatino">But
they consumed the city with fire, and every thing therein; only the gold and
silver, the brazen and iron vessels, they placed in the treasury of the house of
Jehovah.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>25	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Therefore
Rahab the harlot, and the house of her father, and whatever she had, Joshua
caused to live; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel even to this day, because
she had concealed the messengers whom Joshua had sent to spy out
Jericho.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>26	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
Joshua made an adjuration at that time, saying, Cursed before Jehovah be the man
who shall rise to build that city Jericho. In his first-born shall he found it,
and in his younger son shall he set up its
gates.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>27	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And

the children of Israel transgressed with transgression (grievously) in the
anathema, inasmuch as Achan, son of Charmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the

against the children of
Israel.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>2	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Moreover,
Joshua sent men from Jericho against Hai, which was near Bethaven to the east of
Bethel, and he spoke with them, saying, Go up and explore the land. The men

Hai.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>3	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And

they smote about thirty-six men of them, and pursued them from the gate even to

Joshua rent his clothes, and fell on his face to the ground before the ark of

Jehovah said to Joshua, Arise. Why is it that thou thus falls upon thy

taken.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>17	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Then
he put in the kindreds of Judah, and took the kindred of Zera; then he put in

tent, and the silver

Bethel and Hai, on the west of Hai. But Joshua remained that night in the midst
of the
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>10	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Afterwards
Joshua rose up very early, and reviewed the people, and went up, he and the

Hai.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>11	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
all the men of war who were with him, went up and drew near, and came opposite
to the city, and encamped on the north of Hai. And there was a valley between
them and
Hai.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>12	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
he brought besides about five thousand men, whom he placed in ambush between
Bethel and Hai, on the west of the

the people approached nearer to the whole camp which was on the north of the

proceeded that night into the midst of the

when the king of Hai saw, the men of the city hastened, and rose up early, and
came out to meet Israel in battle, he and all his people, at the appointed time
before the plains; but he knew not that there was an ambuscade for him behind
the
city.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>15	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
they routed Joshua and all Israel before them, who fled by the way of the

the whole people who were in the city mustered to pursue them. And they pursued
Joshua, and were drawn away from the
city.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>17	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Nor
did any one remain of Bethel and Hai who did not go out after Israel; and they
left the city open, and pursued
Israel.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>18	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
Jehovah said to Joshua, Lift up the spear which is in thy hand against Hai, for
I will give it into thy hand. And Joshua lifted up the spear which was in his
hand against the
city.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>19	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Then

also took the king of Hai alive, and placed him before
Joshua.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>24	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
when the men of Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Hai in

the edge of the
sword.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>25	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And

Joshua did not draw back his hand which he had raised to the spear, until he
slew all the inhabitants of
Hai.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>27	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Only
the animals and the spoils of that city the children of Israel took to
themselves for booty, according to the word of Jehovah, which Joshua had
commanded
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>28	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Joshua
therefore burnt Hai, and made it an eternal heap, a devastation even to this
day.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>29	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
he hung the king of Hai on a gibbet even until the time of evening; and when the
sun had gone down, Joshua commanded, and they took down his corpse from the
gibbet, and cast it forth at the entrance of the gate of the city, and placed
over it a great heap of stones, even to this
day.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>30	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Then

they sacrificed victims of
prosperity.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>32	</b></font><font face="Palatino">He

the children of Israel did not smite them, because the princes of the

they answered Joshua and said, When it was distinctly told (by telling it was

give you the land, and utterly destroy all the dwellers of the land from before
you, we feared greatly for our lives from before you, and did that
thing.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>25	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And

he did to them thus, and delivered them in the hand of the children of Israel,
and they did not slay
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>27	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
Joshua, on that day, appointed them to be hewers of wood and drawers of water

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>1	</b></font><font face="Palatino">When
Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem had heard that Joshua had taken Hai and destroyed
it, (that as he had done to Jericho and its king, so had he done to Hai and its
king,) and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were
among
them;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>2	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Then
they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a large city, (citizenship or
territory,) as one of the Royal cities, inasmuch as. it was greater than Hai,
and all its men
brave.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>3	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Therefore
Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piram king of
Jarmuth, and to Japhiam king of Lachis, and to Debir king of Eglon,
saying,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>4	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Come
up to me, and bring reinforcements to me, that we may smite Gibeon who has made
peace with Joshua, and the children of
Israel.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>5	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Accordingly,
the five Amorite kings, &#8212; the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the
king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachis, the king of Eglon, they and all their
armies assembled, and went up and encamped near Gibeon, and fought against
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>6	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Therefore
the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp in Gilgal, saying, Do not keep back
thy hands from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and assist us,
for all the Amorite kings, dwelling in the mountain, have assembled against
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>7	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Joshua
therefore came up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, all the
men of
might.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>8	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
Jehovah said to Joshua, Be not afraid of them; for I have delivered them into
thy hand, nor shall any one of them stand in thy
presence.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>9	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
Joshua came upon them suddenly; for during the whole night he went up from
Gilgal</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>10	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
Jehovah crushed them before Israel, and smote them with a great overthrow in
Gibeon, and pursued them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them
even to Azecah, and even to
Malzeda.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>11	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
when they were fleeing from the face of Israel, and were on the descent of
Beth-horon, Jehovah sent down upon them great stones from heaven even to Azecah,
and they died; more died by the hailstones than those whom the children of
Israel slew with the
sword.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>12	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Then
Joshua spoke to Jehovah on the day on which Jehovah delivered up the Amorite
before the children of Israel. And he said in the eyes of Israel, Sun, wait in
Gibeon, and Moon, in the valley of
Ajalon.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>13	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
the sun waited, and the moon stood until the people avenged themselves on their
enemies. Has this not been written in the book of Jasar? <i>(or, </i>of right.)
The sun therefore stood in the midst of heaven, and did not hasten to set for
about one entire
day.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>14	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
there was no day like that before it or after it, on which Jehovah hearkened to
the voice of a man; for Jehovah was fighting for
Israel.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>15	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp in
Gilgal.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>16	</b></font><font face="Palatino">But
the kings themselves had fled, and hid themselves in a cave in
Malzeda.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>17	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
it was told to Joshua in these words, The five kings have been found hidden in a
cave in
Malzeda.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>18	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Then
Joshua said, Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men near it to
guard
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>19	</b></font><font face="Palatino">But
do you follow after your enemies, and cut off their tail, <i>(or, </i>rear,) and
allow them not to enter their cities; for Jehovah your God has delivered them
into your
hand.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>20	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of smiting them with a
very great overthrow till they were consumed, and the survivors who had escaped
had entered into fortified
cities,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>21	</b></font><font face="Palatino">The
whole people returned to the camp to Joshua in Malzeda in peace; no one moved
his tongue against the children of
Israel.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>22	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Then
said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring me those five kings from the
cave.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>23	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
they did so, namely, they brought to him those five kings from the cave, the
king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachis,
the king of
Eglon.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>24	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
when they had brought out those five kings to Joshua, Joshua called all the men
of Israel, and he said to the leaders of the men of war who had accompanied him
Come near, put your feet upon the necks of those kings. And they came near and
put their feet upon their
necks.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>25	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Then
Joshua said to them, Fear not and dread not, be strong and of good courage; for
Jehovah will do thus to all your enemies against whom you
fight.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>26	</b></font><font face="Palatino">After
this Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hung them on five gibbets; and they
were suspended on the gibbets till
evening.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>27	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Moreover,
at the time when the sun goes down, Joshua commanded, and they took them down
from the gibbets, and cast them into the cave in which they had hid themselves,
and they placed great stones at the mouth of the cave until this
day.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>28	</b></font><font face="Palatino">But
Joshua on that day took Malzeda, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and
slew their king along with them, and left no soul which was in it surviving; and
did to the king Malzeda as he had done to the king of
Jericho.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>29	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Thereafter,
Joshua, and all Israel with him, passed over from Malzeda to Libna, and besieged
Libna.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>30	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
Jehovah delivered it also, and its king, into the hand of Israel, and smote it
with the edge of the sword, and did not leave surviving a single soul which was
in it; and did to its king in like manner as he had done to the king of
Jericho.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>31	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Joshua
afterwards passed, and all Israel with him, from Libna to Lachis, and encamped
near it, and besieged
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>32	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
Jehovah gave Lachis into the hand of Israel, and he took it on the second day,
and struck it with the edge of the sword, and every soul which was in it,
exactly as he had done to
Libna.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>33	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
Horam king of Gezer, went up to give assistance to Lachis, and Joshua smote him
and his people, so that he did not leave a
survivor.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>34	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Joshua,
moreover, and all Israel with him, passed from Lachis to Eglon, and they
encamped against it, and besieged
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>35	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
they took it on that day and smote it with the edge of the sword; and every soul
which was there Joshua slew on that day exactly as he had done to
Lachis.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>36	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Joshua
thereafter went up, and all Israel with him, from Eglon to Hebron, and besieged
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>37	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and its king, and all its
towns, and he did not leave surviving a single soul which was in it, exactly as
he had done to Eglon. He accordingly destroyed it, and every soul which was in
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>38	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Afterwards
Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and besieged
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>39	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and its king and all its
towns, and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and slew every soul which
was there; he did not leave a survivor; as he had done to Hebron, so he did to
Debir and its king, as he had done to Libna and its
king.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>40	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
thus Joshua smote all the land of the mountain, and the south, and the plain,
and the slopes, and all their kings; he did not leave a survivor; he slew every
soul, as Jehovah the God of Israel had
commanded.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>41	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Wherefore,
Joshua smote from Cades-Barne even to Asa, and the whole land of Gosen even to
Gibeon.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>42	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And
all those kings and their land Joshua took at the same time, for Jehovah the God
of Israel was fighting for
Israel.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>43	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Thence
Joshua, and all Israel with him, returned to the camp in

we have thought to build for us an altar, to turn away from going after Jehovah;
if to sacrifice upon it burnt-offerings and sacrifice; and if to make upon it
sacrifices of prosperity, let Jehovah himself
inquire:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>24	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And

the God of
Israel?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>25	</b></font><font face="Palatino">For
Jehovah has put the Jordan as a boundary between us and you, you children of
Reuben and children of Gad; you have no portion in Jehovah; and your children
will make our children desist from fearing
Jehovah.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>26	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And

that it may be a witness betwixt us and you, and between our generations after
us, that we may diligently serve Jehovah before him in our burnt-offerings, and
our sacrifices, and our offerings of prosperity; and lest your children may
to-morrow say to our children, You have no part in
Jehovah.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>28	</b></font><font face="Palatino">We
said therefore, And it shall be, if they say to us or to our generations
to-morrow, then shall we say, You see the likeness of an altar to Jehovah, which
our fathers made, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice, but to be a witness
between us and
you.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>29	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Far

sacrifice, beyond the altar of Jehovah our God, which is before his
tabernacle.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>30	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Moreover,
when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, and the heads of
the thousands of Israel who were with him, had heard the words which the

spoken, it was pleasing in their
eyes.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>31	</b></font><font face="Palatino">And

Jehovah; then you have freed the children of Israel from the hand of
Jehovah.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>32	</b></font><font face="Palatino">Therefore

2:25. The authorship, however, is so uncertain that there is scarcely a writer
of eminence from the period of the history itself down to the time of Ezra, for
whom the honor has not been claimed. Among others may be mentioned Phinchas,
Samuel, and Isaiah. The obvious inference is, that the question of authorship is
one of those destined only to be agitated but never satisfactorily determined.
The opinion above stated by Calvin is perhaps as plausible as any other, though
he scarcely appreciates the claims which may be urged in favor of Joshua
himself. It is, of course, impossible to attribute to him either the narrative
of his own death, or the references to one or two events which happened
subsequent to it. Such anachronisms, if they may be so called, only prove what
has never been denied, that some insertions or interpolations have been made in
the original work. But as the account of the death of Moses in the last book of
the Pentateuch is not allowed to cast any doubt on the claim of Moses to have
been the true author, it is not easy to see why similar insertions should be
supposed to have any stronger effect in regard to the claim of Joshua. In
addition to the evidence furnished by those passages in which the writer speaks
as an eye-witness, and an actor in the events recorded, those who attribute the
Book of Joshua find a strong argument in the position which Joshua occupied. He
was not only the divinely appointed successor, but the ardent admirer and
diligent imitator of Moses. It is reasonable to suppose, that while imitating
him in the general principles of his government, he forgot to imitate him in the
use of his pen, or that he was not as careful as Moses had been to draw up a
written narrative of the wonderful events which the Lord performed by his hand?
The important fact that Joshua did <i>write</i> is distinctly stated in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1" color="Maroon">&lt;062426&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joshua
24:26; and though the writing there referred to seems to have been confined to
the narrative of a special event, analogy goes far to justify the inference,
that what he did on this occasion was in accordance with his usual practice, and
that the record which we now possess of his eventful life, is, in substance at
least, the production of his pen. &#8212;

it may be proper to mention that the Book of Joshua extends over a period,
estimated by Josephus at twenty-five, and by other Jewish chronologists at
twenty-seven, though others attempt to reduce it to only seventeen years, and
that its contents are naturally divided into three great sections, &#8212; the
<i>first</i> extending from Joshua 1-7 inclusive, and giving a continuous
narrative of Joshua's conquests; the <i>second</i> from Joshua 13-23 inclusive,
consisting chiefly of a description more or less detailed of the division of the
country among the different tribes; and the <i>third</i> occupying the remainder
of the book, Joshua 24, principally with an account of the great convention of
the tribes held at Shechem, on Joshua's summons, and of the interesting and

Book, and is usually translated <i>and</i>, or, as in our English version,
<i>now</i>, evidently connects it with some previous writing, and seems to
vindicate the place which it holds in the Canon as a continuation of the Book of
Deuteronomy. In the first verse, Calvin's Latin version omits the epithets,
"Servant of the Lord," and "Moses' minister," applied respectively to Joshua and
Moses. The Hebrew contains both, but the former is omitted by the ordinary text
of the Septuagint, though placed among its various readings. &#8212;

</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Calvin's language here is not very clear, and
seems to convey an erroneous impression. The <i>desert</i> or <i>wilderness</i>,
instead of being comprehended under Lebanon, is obviously contrasted with it,
and forms the south, while Lebanon forms the north frontier. We have thus three
great natural boundaries &#8212; Lebanon on the north, the desert of Sin on the
south, and the Mediterranean on the west. The eastern boundary occasions more
difficulty. According to some, the Euphrates is expressly mentioned as this
boundary, and an attempt is made to reconcile the vast difference between the
actual possession of the Israelites, even in the most prosperous period of their
history, and the tract of country thus bounded, by having recourse to the
explanation of St. Augustine, who, in his Commentary on Joshua 21, gives it as
his opinion that the country extending eastward beyond the proper limits of
Canaan was intended to be given not so much for possession as for tribute. This
view receives some confirmation from the extensive conquests which were made by
David and Solomon. According to other expositors, the Euphrates is intended to
be taken in connection with Lebanon so as to form, by one of its windings or
branches, part of the north boundary, while the east boundary is left
indefinite, or rather, was so well defined by the Jordan that it did not require
to be separately mentioned. In this general uncertainty, there is much practical
wisdom in Calvin's suggestion in his Argument, that the indefiniteness of the
boundaries assigned to the promised land, contrasted with its actual limits,
tended to elevate the minds of Old Testament believers, and carry them beyond
the present to a period when, under a new and more glorious dispensation, the
promise would be completely fulfilled. &#8212;

thus: "Ainsi la prudence et sagesse que les fideles apprennent de la parole de
Dieu, est opposee a l'assurance de ceux auxquels il semble bien qu'ils se
gouvernent assez discretement et sagement, quand ils besongnent selon leur
propre sens;" "Thus the prudence and wisdom which believers learn from the word

</font></sup><font face="Palatino">It is almost impossible to doubt that the
view here taken is correct, and in confirmation of it, it may be observed, that
it receives more countenance from the original than appears either from Calvin's
or our verse by "Then," as if meaning, "At that precise time;" whereas the
Hebrew is simply the copulative
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">,

It implies, indeed that the order issued to the prefects by Joshua was given
<i>subsequently</i> to the gracious and encouraging message which he had
received, but not that it was given <i>immediately</i> or at that particular
instant, and it thus leaves it open for us to infer, that a period of less or
greater length intervened during which the spies were sent on their mission, and
the proceedings detailed in the second chapter took place. The sacred writer in
thus omitting to follow the order of time in his narrative, has only adopted a
method which is often convenient in itself, and which has been repeatedly
followed by the most celebrated historians, both of ancient and modern times,
and nothing can be more absurd than the inference attempted to be drawn chiefly
by some German Rationalists, from this and a few similar apparent anachronisms,
that the Book of Joshua is not so much a continuous history as a patchwork of
distinct or even contradictory narratives by different writers. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1" color="Maroon">ft26
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">This must be taken with some qualification,
since, according to the view taken by Calvin himself, the river must, before
this, have been forded by the spies, both in going and returning; and it is also
obvious, from the direction which their pursuers took, in endeavoring to
overtake them, that what are called "the fords," must have been understood to be
practicable, even during the season of overflow. Still a spot or two where an
individual might manage to cross was altogether unavailable for such a body as
the Israelites, and therefore Calvin's subsequent statement cannot be disputed,
that if they were to cross at all, human agency was unavailing, and the only
thing which remained was for God himself to transport them miraculously. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1" color="Maroon">ft27
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">The agreement made with Moses was very
explicit. As recorded in the thirty-second chapter of Numbers, he distinctly
stipulates that they shall "go armed before the Lord to war," "armed over Jordan
before the Lord, until he has driven out his enemies from before him, and the
land be subdued before the Lord;" and they answer, "As the Lord has said unto
thy servants so will we do: we will pass over armed before the Lord, into the
land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may
be ours." &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1" color="Maroon">ft28
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">The objection taken to the modesty of the
answer seems to be founded on a misinterpretation of its true meaning. For the
original, literally interpreted, does not contain any assertion that they had
obeyed Moses in all things, as implied both in Calvin's Latin and in our English
version, but simply means, that "in everything," or, "according to everything,"
(</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lkk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kekol</i>,) in which they had hearkened to Moses they would hearken to him:
in other words, that they would hold his authority to be in every respect equal
to that of Moses. This meaning is retained by the Septuagint, which renders
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Kata&lt; pa&gt;nta o[sa

<i>Ed.</i></font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1" color="Maroon">ft29

</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Calvin's "miserat," "had sent," is in

transactions with which the first chapter concludes actually took place, but is
not justifed either by the Hebrew or by the Septuagint, which has simply
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpe&gt;steilen</font><font face="Palatino">.
It is worthy of remark, however, that Luther's German agrees with Calvin, and
renders "hatte zween funtidchafter heimlich ausgefaubt von Gittim;" "had sent
out two spies secretly from Sittim." The mention of the place, Sittim or
Shittim, occurs in the French version, but is omitted without explanation in
Calvin's Latin. It was situated in the plains of Moab near the left bank of the
Jordan, and is particularly mentioned in Numbers 25 as the abode of the
Israelites, when they allowed themselves to be seduced into gross idolatry by
the daughters of Moab, and were in consequence signally punished. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1" color="Maroon">ft32
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">This word "clam" may refer either to the
secrecy of Joshua in sending the spies, or to the secrecy which they were to
employ in making their inquiries. Either meaning seems good. The latter is
countenanced by the Septuagint, which unites the secrecy and the spying in the
single compound word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kataskopeu~sai</font><font face="Palatino">;
but it is evident, both from the version and the Commentary, that Calvin prefers
the former. &#8212;

</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Had the season of the year when these
transactions took place not been known from other sources, the mode of
concealment to which Rahab resorted would have gone far to fix it. The "stalks
of flax" with which she covered them, was evidently the crop of flax as it had
been taken from the ground after attaining maturity, and laid out in the open
air to dry, agreeably to a custom still practiced, before it was subjected to
the process of <i>skutching</i>, for the purpose of being deprived of its woody
fiber. The flax sown about the end of September was pulled in the end of March
or beginning of April, which accordingly was the period when the Israelites
began to move their camp. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1" color="Maroon">ft35
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">It may either mean that "they" (the
Israelites) "had conspired," as here translated, or as the French has it, that
"Rahab had conspired," &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1" color="Maroon">ft36

literally, "there was no crime in the treachery." French, "Il n'y a point eu de
crime de trahison en ce faict;" "There was no crime of treachery in the act."
Neither of these properly conveys Calvin's meaning. From what follows it is
evident that he held all treachery to be criminal as implying a deviation from
truth; while he also held, that under the special circumstances Rahab was
justified in withdrawing her allegiance from her countrymen and transferring it
to the Israelites. He therefore only justifies the <i>act</i> without approving
of the <i>mode</i> of it. This view appears to be accurately expressed by the
term "abandoning," which has accordingly been substituted in the translation.

tell." One of the most common instances given is the case in which a simple
statement of the truth might essentially endanger the interest, or, it may be,
the life of an individual whom we are under a natural or conventional obligation
to defend from all injury. A son, for example, is pursued by murderers; he takes
shelter under the paternal roof; his mother has just succeeded in concealing him
when the murderers arrive. Is she entitled to give a false answer to their
interrogatories? The question is one of the most difficult and delicate that can
be raised; but Calvin has undoubtedly given the right decision when he lays down
the broad principle, that those who hold any lie to be excusable, "do not
sufficiently consider how precious truth is in the sight of God." Were anything
necessary to reconcile us to this decision, we may easily find it in the havoc
which has been made of all morality by acting on its opposite, as evinced
particularly in the case of Jesuit and other Romish casuists. &#8212;

</font></sup><font face="Palatino">This seems to be the proper place to insert a
short account of the Jordan, and more especially of that part of it in the
neighborhood of which the Israelites were now encamped. This becomes necessary,
because Calvin had altogether omitted it, partly, as some expressions in his
Commentary would seem to indicate, from having unfortunately attached little
comparative importance to geographical details, and partly, as he very modestly
expresses it, from not having been very well acquainted with them. Indeed, at
the period when he wrote, the geography of the Holy Land was very imperfectly
known, but we have not the same excuse, as numerous well-qualified travelers
have since traversed it in all directions, and published careful descriptions
both of its general features and of almost all the localities possessed of much
historical interest. In a single note, only a few leading points can be adverted
to, but it seems not impossible in this way, to give a distinct idea of the
nature of the passage which the Israelites were now preparing to make, and of
the wonderful interposition by which they were enabled to accomplish
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Jordan, then, by far the most important
river of Palestine, is formed, near its northern frontiers, by several streams
which descend from the mountains of Lebanon, and after flowing nearly due south,
for a direct distance of about 175 miles, discharges its waters into the north
side of the Dead Sea. In the upper part of its course, before it reaches the
late of Tiberius, more familiarly known by its usual scriptural name of the Sea
of Galilee, it has much of the character of an impetuous torrent, and is hemmed
closely in on both sides by loftly mountains, but on issuing from the south side
of the lake, it begins to flow in a valley, the most remarkable circumstance
connected with which, is its great depth beneath the level of the ocean. Even
the Sea of Galilee is 84 feet, and the Dead Sea, where the Jordan falls into it
is 1337 feet beneath this level. The intervening space between the two seas,
forms what is properly called the valley of the Jordan, and consists of a plain,
about six miles across in its northern, but much wider in its southern half,
where it spreads out, on its east or left bank, into the plains of Moab, and on
its west or right bank, into the plains of Jericho. This valley, throughout its
whole length, is terminated on either side by a mountain chain, which in many
parts rises so rapidly as soon to attain a height exceeding 2500. Within the
valley thus terminated, a minor valley is enclosed. It is about three quarters
of a mile in breadth, and consists, for the most part, of a low flat, bounded by
sandy slopes, and covered by trees or brushwood. Nearly in the center of this
flat the river, almost concealed beneath its overhanging banks, pursues its
course, with few large windings, but with such a multiplicity of minute
tortuosities, that though the direct distance is not more than sixty-five, the
indirect distance or total length of the stream is estimated at not less than
two hundred miles. The river, in its ordinary state, within its banks, has a
width of from twenty to thirty yards, and a depth, varying from nine to fifteen
feet. The banks are there from twelve to fourteen feet high, and immediately
beyond them, the flat bears evident marks of being frequently inundated. These
inundation's take place in spring, and are caused by the melted snow brought
down, partly by the three principal tributaries of the Jordan, the Jarmuch, or
Shurat-el-Mandour, the Jabbok, or Zerka, and the Arnon, or Wady Modjet, which
all join it from the east, but chiefly by the main stream, which is then
copiously supplied from the snowy heights of Lebanon. This rising of the waters,
of course, begins as soon as the thawing influence of the returning heat begins
to be felt, but does not attain its maximum till the impression has been fully
made, or, in the first weeks of April. Such was the state of the stream as the
Israelites now safely assumed to have been from seven to Twelve miles north of
the Dead Sea, and not far from the Bethabarah, where our Savior, after
condescending to receive baptism at the hands of his forerunner, went up from
the banks, while the heavens opened, and the Spirit of God descended like a
dove, and lighted upon him. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1" color="Maroon">ft43
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">These remarks are made on the assumption that
the waters had risen so as not only to reach the highest edge of the banks, and
make the usual channel what may be called brim-full, but had spread themselves
to some distance over the plain. It may have been so, but there is no distinct
statement to this effect, and the concluding clause of the fifteenth verse does
not literally bear the meaning which Calvin and our English translators have
assigned to it. His rendering is, "Jordanes autem erat plenus ultra omnes suas
ripas;" literally, "Now Jordan was full beyond all his banks." The original only
says that "Jordan fills up to (completely fills) all his banks." The Septuagint,
in like manner, says, "</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">O de&lt;
Iorda&gt;nhv ejphrou~to kaq o[lhn thn krhpi&gt;da
aujtou~</font><font face="Palatino">;" "Now the Jordan was filled as to all his
embankment." The same meaning is very exactly given by Luther, whose version is
"Der Jordan aber war voll an allen feinen ufern;" "Now Jordan was full on all
his banks." The difference between the renderings is slight, but it is of
importance not to overlook it, because even such slight differences have
sometimes furnished the infidel with plausible grounds for assailing the credit
of the sacred narrative. In the present instance it has been insinuated that the
historian has exaggerated the extent of the inundation in order to heighten the
importance of the miracle. &#8212;

presumed to have crossed is about forty miles; and the most natural meaning of
the passage seems to be, that when the waters stood, as it were, congealed in a
heap, they remained so long in that state, as to cause a kind of reflux tide,
which was perceptible as far back as Adam on the one hand, and Zareptan on the

the shallow water. The other view which supposes that the banks were only filled
and not overflowed, besides being more in accordance with the original, as was
formerly shown, appears to derive additional confirmation from the language here
used. It is said the waters returned the moment the priests touched the dry
ground with the <i>soles</i> of their feet; in other words, so long as they were
climbing up the steep bank, and, of course, had no firm footing, the heap of
waters continued, but it was immediately dissolved as soon as they could set
down their foot firmly in consequence of having reached the flat. &#8212;

argued, 1. That the eating of the Passover by an uncircumcised person was
expressly prohibited, (Exodus 12:48) 2. That the observance of it during the
wandering in the desert is, by implication at least, dispensed with in the
words, "And it shall come to pass, when you be come to the land which the Lord
will give you, according as he has promised, that you shall keep this service."
(Exodus 12:25) 3. That the observance of the Passover at Mount Sinai was in
compliance with a special mandate, and would not have taken place without it. 4.
The assumption that sacrifices were offered in the desert is questioned as
inconsistent with
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1" color="Maroon">&lt;300525&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos
5:25. It may be added, that the order to circumcise, evidently intended as a
preparation for the celebration of the approaching Passover, seems to imply that
there had previously been a similar omission of both ordinances. It must also
have been difficult, if not impossible, while in the wilderness, to obtain flour
in sufficient quantity to make unleavened Passover bread for a whole people.

for Exodus 32:34. However, it could also be a general reference to events
occurring throughout Chapter 32, (the making of the calf in verses 2-3, God
saying He would not be their Leader in verse 10, and the reference to the angel

farther length of fixing what particular angel it was. With almost unanimous
consent they declare it to have been Michael, though they are unable to support
their opinion by anything stronger than the first verse of the twelfth chapter
of Daniel, [Da 12:1] in which it is said, that "at that time shall Michael stand
up, the great prince which stands for the children of thy people." The sounder
view here advocated by Calvin, and generally adopted by the early Christian
Fathers, is well expressed by Origen, who says, in his Sixth Homily on this
Book, "Joshua knew not only that he was of God, but that he was God. For he
would not have worshipped, had he not recognized him to be God. For who else is
the Captain of the Lord's host but our Lord Jesus Christ?" It would make sad
havoc with our ideas of divine worship to admit that the homage which Joshua
here pays could be lawfully received, or rather could, so to speak, be

expressed, it is not out of place to add those of the profoundest and most
philosophical English theologians on the same subject. Bishop Butler, in his
Analogy, Part 2, chapter 3, after saying that "it is that province of reason to
judge of the morality of Scripture; <i>i.e.</i>, not whether it contains things
different from what we should have expected from a wise, just, and good Being
&#8212; but whether it contains things plainly contradictory to wisdom, justice,
or goodness; to what the light of nature teaches us of God," continues thus: "I
know nothing of this sort objected against Scripture, excepting such objections
as are formed upon suppositions which would equally conclude, that the
constitution of nature is contradictory to wisdom, justice, or goodness: which
most certainly it is not. Indeed there are some particular precepts in
Scripture, given to particular persons, requiring actions, which would be
immoral or vicious, were it not for such precepts. But it is easy to see, that
all these are of such a kind, as that the precept changes the whole nature of
the case and of the action: and both constitutes and shows that not to be unjust
or immoral, which, prior to the precept, must have appeared, and really have
been so: which well may be, since none of these precepts are contrary to
immutable morality. If it were commanded to cultivate the principles, and act
from the spirit of treachery, ingratitude, cruelty; the command would not alter
the nature of the case, or of the action, in any of these instances. But it is
quite otherwise in precepts, which require only the doing an external action:
for instance, taking away the property or life of any. For men have no right to
either life or property, but what arises solely from the grant of God. When this
grant is revoked, they cease to have any right at all in either: and when this
revocation is made known, as surely it is possible it may be, it must cease to
be unjust to deprive them of either. And though a course of external acts,
which, without command, would be immoral, must make an immoral habit, yet a few
detached commands have no such natural tendency. I thought proper to say thus
much of the few Scripture precepts which require, not vicious actions, but
actions which would have been vicious had it not been for such precepts: because
they are sometimes weakly urged as immoral, and great weight is laid upon
objections drawn from them. But to me there seems no difficulty at all in these
precepts, but what arises from their being offences; <i>i.e.</i>, from their
being liable to be perverted, as, indeed, they are, by wicked designing men, to
serve the most horrid purposes, and, perhaps, to mislead the weak and
enthusiastic." &#8212;

the ancient city, took place, according to the ordinary chronology, 520 years
after Joshua pronounced the curse. It would seem, however, that another Jericho
had been built at a much earlier period, not actually on the former site which,
while the memory of the curse remained, was probably avoided, but at no great
distance from it. Of this fact, the mention made of Jericho in

18:21, as one of the cities of Benjamin, is not decisive, because it may have
been intended to indicate merely a locality, and not an actually existing city,
nor is it absolutely certain that the "city of palm trees" which Eglor captured,
(Judges 3:13) was a rebuilt Jericho, though by that name Jericho was generally
known. Its existence, however, at least a century before Hiel, is clearly
established by the directions given to David's ambassadors, after their
insulting treatment by the king of Ammon, "to tarry at Jericho." (2 Samuel 10:5)
It may be worth while briefly to glance at the subsequent history of Hiel's
sacrilegious city. As if the penalty of rebuilding had been fully paid by the
exemplary punishment inflicted on the founder, the curse appears to have been
withdrawn, and in the course of about twenty years we learn that it had not only
been selected as a school of the prophets,

time of Herod the Great, who, after capturing and sacking it, rebuilt it in a
much more magnificent form, and erected in it a splendid palace, where he often
resided and ultimately died. It also became a favorite residence of his son but

to bring it more into accordance with their views, attempt to explain parts of
it away by means of a minute and forced criticism. On finding this process not
very successful, they endeavor to supply its deficiency by extraordinary
conjectures. First, with regard to the criticism, it is said that in the
directions which the Lord gives to Joshua, (Joshua
7:10-15)</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1" color="Maroon">
{*}</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he receives no authority to put any
person to death, except the one who should be found to have actually committed
the crime. When the words of the
15</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1">th</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
verse, "he and all that he has," are quoted in opposition to this view, the
answer is, that the expressions does not necessarily mean more than the man
himself, his cattle, and other property, and therefore <i>may</i> not have
included his family, properly so called, or the persons who formed his
household. Another criticism, still more extraordinary, would scarcely be
deserving of notice had it not received the countenance of so distinguished a
name as that of Grotius, who insists that Achan was the only person who actually
suffered death, though his children were taken out to the place of execution and
verse, in which it is said that "All Israel stoned <i>him</i> (Achan) with
stones, and burned <i>them</i> with fire;" <i>i.e.,</i> as he explains, stoned
Achan only, and then burnt his dead body, and his cattle, and other effects
designated by <i>them.</i> Such are specimens of the criticism which this
transaction has called forth, and it would almost be an insult to the reader to
give a serious refutation of them. The <i>conjectures</i> to which we have
referred are equally extravagant. One of them is given in the Cyclopaedia of
Biblical Literature, under the article Achan, and as the writer appears both to
have invented it, and to plume himself on the invention, it is but fair to give
it in his own words; &#8212; "We prefer the supposition that they (Achan's
family) were included in the doom by one of those sudden impulses of
indiscriminate popular vengeance, to which the Jewish people were exceedingly
prone, and which, in this case, it would not have been in the power of Joshua to
control by any authority which he could, under such circumstances, exercise."

the two places is not less than twenty miles, Ai being only twelve and Ebal
thirty miles north from Jerusalem. The journey of so many miles by the whole
body of the Israelites, and through a country which, at least up to the victory
of Ai, was in undisputed possession of the enemy, must have occupied a
considerable time, and have been accomplished with no small labor and
difficulty. How comes it that not one word is said in regard to it, and that we
are led at once from Ai to Ebal just as if the two places, instead of being
widely separated, had been actually contiguous to each other? Were the incidents
of the journey so unimportant as not to require the slightest notice? Or is the
narrative contained in the Book of Joshua so very succinct that even
transactions which might occupy a large place in a more copious work have been
purposely excluded from it? If both these questions are answered in the
negative, and it would seem that they must be so answered, the only other
question is, Has the order of time been observed? In other words, have we not in
the interesting account now about to be given of one of the most wonderful
national conventions on record, another instance of anticipation of narrative
similar to that which we have already seen in the first chapter? Assuming this
to be the case, the continuation of the narrative is to be looked for in the
ninth chapter, while the account of the transaction on Mounts Ebal and Gerizim
is to be regarded in the light of an episode. It is very remarkable that the
whole episode is omitted by the Septuagint at this place, and not introduced
before giving the account of the league of the Amorites, contained in the

imposition thus practiced. The capital of the Gibeonites was not above fourteen
miles west from Jericho, and scarcely half that distance south-west from Ai,
where the Israelites had recently gained so signal a victory, and it is
therefore not improbable that the Israelites, while pursuing the fugitives, had
actually been within the territory which their leaders now ignorantly believe to
be so very distant, as to be altogether beyond the limits of the promised land.
The compliments paid to their prowess so flattered their pride, and the alliance
of a powerful though distant nation held out the hope of so many advantages in
the further prosecution of their conquests, that they fell at once into the
snare, as if they had almost been willing to be deceived. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1" color="Maroon">ft81
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Calvin was well qualified, by his legal
education, to discuss the important question here raised, and it is impossible
to dispute the soundness of his general positions in regard to it, both here and
in the previous section of the Commentary on this chapter. There is, however, an
appearance of inconsistency in some of the statements. In the section beginning
with the third verse, he says in Latin, "Cum larvis ergo paciscitur Josue, nec
quidquam obligationis contrahit, nisi secundum eorum verba;" or as it is in
French, "Josue donques traitte alliance avec des masques ou phantosmes et n'est
nullement oblige, sinon suivant leurs paroles;" "Joshua, then, makes an alliance
with masks or phantoms, and is in no way bound, except according to their
words." Again, in the section beginning with verse the sixth, he says, "Dixi
summo jure evanidum et irritum fuisse ejusmodi foedus," or as it is in French,
"J'ay dit qu'a la rigueur de droit une telle alliance estoit nulle et cassee;"
"I have said, that in strict law such an alliance was null and void." And he
gives the reason in the form of a question, when he asks, "What do they (the
Gibeonites) gain when their request is granted, but just that they are to be
kept safe, provided they have come from a distant country?" But if the
Gibeonites did not gain, or, in other words, were not entitled to demand
anything, it is perfectly obvious that the Israelites could not be bound to
grant anything. They were the two parties to a mutual contract, in which the
claims of the one party were exactly the counterpart or measure of the
obligations of the other. It might have been expected, therefore, that after
Calvin had decided that the Gibeonites had no claim, he would, of course, have
decided that the Israelites had incurred no obligation. Here, however, when
considering this latter point, he seems to change his ground, by distinctly
asserting, that we may not resile even from pactions in which we have been
deceived. The inconsistency, however, is only apparent. He does not say that we
are bound by such pactions, as if they were valid in themselves, but he adverts
to circumstances which may lay us under a formal obligation to act as if we were
bound by them. In other words, he removes the case from a court of law into the
court of conscience, and thus brings it under the class of cases to which St.
Paul referred, when he drew a distinction between things lawful and things
expedient. Joshua and the elders had sworn rashly, but having by so doing put
the honor of the God of Israel, so to speak, in pledge, they were bound, at
whatever cost, to redeem it. &#8212;

An additional clause not found in the original, and excluded by the common

Jerusalem was only about five miles S.S.E. from Gibeon, while the other towns,
situated S.S.W., were at distances varying from twenty to thirty miles. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1" color="Maroon">ft87
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">The conjecture that the narrative is here
inverted, seems somewhat gratuitous. Lachish, the most remote of the towns, was
not more than thirty miles distant, and Jerusalem, as has been mentioned, was
only five; and, therefore, in so far as distance merely is concerned, there is
nothing to prevent us from holding in accordance with the literal purport of the
narrative, that the kings had suddenly advanced against Gibeon, and were
actually besieging it when the Gibeonites dispatched their embassy to
Joshua.</font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="1" color="Maroon">ft88
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Here, again, apparently from exaggerating the
distance, Calvin thinks it necessary to resort to an ingenious explanation, and
give a kind of coloring to the narrative. The distance from Gilgal to Gibeon was
more than eighteen miles, and this might certainly be accomplished by a forced
march in the course of a single night. Calvin says we are not to suppose that
"Joshua accomplished three days' journey in a single night." But it is nowhere
said that Gibeon was <i>three days' journey</i> from Gilgal. The words
are,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">In other words, the Israelites, on this particular
occasion, employed three days, or rather, if we adopt the common Hebrew mode of
computation, part of a first, the whole of a second, and part of a third day.
Such a statement scarcely justifies the inference that the average time of
making the journey between the two places was three days. &#8212;

that he was behind it in this. &#8212;

explain it away. It is rather strange that among this number are some of the
most distinguished Jewish rabbis as Levi-ben-Gerson and Maimonides, both of whom
maintain that there was no miracle, but only something very like one. Their
chief inducement to adopt this very extraordinary view, is zeal for the honor of
Moses, which they think would be seriously impugned by admitting that a miracle
which he never performed was performed by the instrumentality of his successor
Joshua. &#8212;

as it were spoken of God, or of the people of Israel, rather than of him who

sanction of many expositors of eminence, both ancient and modern, who consider
it to have been some record in which an account of the leading events in the
history of the chosen people was regularly inserted, and which might thus come
to be commonly spoken of as the Book of the Just, very much in the same way as
we are accustomed to speak of the Book of Worthies, the Book of Martyrs, etc.

with David's lament over Saul and Jonathan. Founding on this reference, De Wette
and other rationalists argue that the Book of Joshua is not of the early date
usually ascribed to it, and must have been written after the time of David. This
argument assumes that Jasher is the name of an author living in the time, or
subsequently to the time, of David, and, but for this assumption, for which no

Gennesara ex cujus tractu pars hostium profecta erat." French, "Et le lac de
Merom ou ils s'estoyent campez, qui est contigu au Jourdain, approche beaucoup
plus pres de Gilgal que ne fait Genesara, du rivage duquel ume partie des
ennemis s'estoit levee;" "And the lake of Merom, where they had encamped, which
is contiguous to the Jordan, approaches much nearer to Gilgal than Gennesaret
does, on the shores of which a part of the enemy had been raised." The
geographical details here given, and more especially those relating to the lake
of Merom, are both defective and inaccurate. The impression left by the
Commentary is, that after the kings, composing this formidable league, had
united their forces, they began to march southwards, and had arrived within a
moderate distance of Gilgal, where they probably expected to come suddenly on
Joshua, and take him by surprise. Meanwhile they encamped by the lake of Merom,
and Joshua having, in consequence of a divine intimation, set out hastily with
his army, gives them the surprise which they expected to have given him.
According to this view, the lake of Merom was comparatively near to Gilgal, and
hence this is distinctly asserted in the Latin and French quotation which
commences this note. The French says plainly, that there was a shorter distance
to Gilgal from the lake of Merom than from that of Gennesaret. And the Latin,
though not free from ambiguity, says, either the same thing or something still
more inaccurate, namely, that the lake of Merom was nearer to Gilgal than to the
lake of Gennesaret. On the contrary, it is now well known that the lake of
Merom, the modern El Hule, is situated ten miles to the north of the lake of
Gennesaret, and consequently is exactly that number of miles farther from Gilgal
than the lake of Gennesaret is, the distances of the lakes from Gilgal being
respectively, for Merom, about seventy-five, and for Gennesaret sixty-five
miles. Such being the fact, it is obvious that Joshua could not have been at
Gilgal when he was honored with a divine communication, promising him the
victory on the following day. The true state of the case seems to be, that after
Joshua had conquered the central and southern parts of the country, a number of
kings or chiefs, whose territories extended over the whole of the north of the
promised land, entered into a common league, and appointed the lake of Merom as
their place of rendezvous. Joshua, well informed of the league, and alive to its
formidable nature, did not wait to give the enemy time to mature their schemes,
or remain inert till they were actually within a day's march of his camp, but
set out with a determination to act on the offensive, and with this view had
advanced far to the north, into the very heart of the enemy's country, when any
fears which their formidable array might have produced, either in himself or his
army, were completely removed by the assurance of speedy and signal success.

they possessed to any of their other cities. Moreover, as these cities were

the great labor which it would be necessary to take, very little benefit would
redound to the reader." It may be added that these descriptions of boundaries,
how minutely soever they may be detailed, must, from their very nature, leave a
very vague impression on the mind of the most careful reader, and are much less
adapted for the ear than for the eye, which, by a single glance at a map,
furnishes information much more vivid, distinct, and accurate than can be
obtained from pages of description. At the same time it ought to be remembered,
that accurate and detailed descriptions of the boundaries of the different
tribes were absolutely indispensable to the Israelites themselves, to whom they
formed a kind of title-deeds, vindicating their right of possession, and
securing them against encroachment. &#8212;

vague imaginings here ascribed to him, actually obtained her consent to the
proposal which he was about to make? It may not have been, as Calvin supposes, a
sudden thought which struck him in the heat of battle, but a calm resolve formed
before he set out on his expedition against Debir, and intended to reward the
most valiant of those who had assisted him in his war against the giants. And it
is even not impossible that both he and his daughter, to whom Othniel, from his
near relationship, must have been well known, had no doubt from the prowess he
had previously exhibited, that he would outstrip all his competitors and carry
off the prize. These, of course, are mere conjectures, but they are at least as
plausible as those indulged in by other expositors, who, after raising the
question, appear to have given themselves much unnecessary trouble in attempting
to solve it. &#8212;

was either so meant by Caleb, or so interpreted by his followers. He very

Joseph, the strictest equity was observed. Is it necessary, however, to adopt
one of the two alternatives, &#8212; either that separate lots were taken for
Ephraim and Manasseh, or that Joshua deceived them? Though they counted as two
tribes, they had only one patriarch for their ancestor, and it may therefore
have been most expedient that, as they were brethren, their settlements should
be adjacent to each other. This might, perhaps, have been obtained by taking
separate lots, for we have already seen, on several occasions, how the lot,
though apparently fortuitous, was providentially controlled, so as to give
results at once confirmatory of ancient predictions, and conducive to the public
good; and we may therefore presume that even if separate lots had been taken,
the result might be still have been to place the two kindred tribes in
juxtaposition. But this was only problematical, and the only way of placing the
matter beyond doubt was to make one lot serve for both. And there was no
necessary injustice in this, since, as has been repeatedly observed, the lot
only fixed the locality, without determining its precise limits, and thus left
it open to enlarge or curtail them according to the extent of the population. If
injustice had been done to the children of Joseph, it would not have been merely
because they had been placed in one lot, but because this lot, though really
intended for two tribes, had been left as small as if it had been intended only
for one. The unreasonableness and dishonesty of the complaint, therefore, lay,
according to this view, in their insisting on the fact that only one lot had
been taken, and at the same time keeping out of view the other equally important
fact, that in fixing its boundaries due allowance had been made for their
numbers, and distinct settlements of sufficient magnitude given to each. That
only one lot had been taken is strongly confirmed by the whole tenor of the
narrative: <i>First, </i>When the children distinctly put the question to
Joshua, "Why has thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit?" he does
not silence them at once by answering that the assertion which they thus broadly
made in the form of a question was not true. On the contrary, the indirectness
of his answer seems to imply that the truth of the assertion could not be
denied. <i>Secondly, </i>The narrative in Joshua 16, in describing the
allocations of Ephraim and Manasseh, speak of them as forming only one lot.

its locality made it easily accessible from all quarters, its site, in the heart

understanding that the survey made on this occasion was very minute, embracing,

to leave a single corner unexamined, and extending with the same minuteness, not
only to the lands actually conquered, but to those still in the undisputed
possession of the original inhabitants. Assuming this to be the fact, the
dangers to be encountered by the surveyors are certainly not exaggerated in the
very graphical description of them here given, and nothing but a series of
miraculous interposition's could have saved them. It may be suggested, however,
that the object of the surveyors was only to obtain such a general measurement

in the Commentary is singularly inaccurate. In the Latin it is said that the
children of Naphtali "Videntur contigui ab una parte fuisse filiis Juda: alibi

qu'ils estoyent environnez du secours de leurs freres;" "It seems that on one
side that they were surrounded by the help of their brethren." The fact,
however, is that Judah and Naphtali are at the opposite extremities of the
country, and so far from being contiguous to each other, are widely separated by
the intervention of no fewer than five tribes, which commencing on the frontiers
of Judah, and proceeding northwards, are, in succession, Benjamin, Ephraim,
Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun. Then, as it stretched from the shores of the
lake of Gennesaret, north to the roots of Lebanon, it cannot well be said to
have been surrounded on all sides by the enclosures of other tribes. It
certainly had Zebulun on the south-west, and Asher on the west, but on the north

It is only by means of labored criticism, accompanied with a degree of
straining, that some expositors have arrived at a different conclusion. But why
should it be deemed necessary to employ criticism for such a purpose? There is
surely no antecedent improbability that Joshua, after all the turmoil's of war
were over, should have more than once come forth from his retirement, and called
the heads of the people, or even the whole body of them together to receive his
counsels, when he felt that the time of his departure was at hand. Observe,
moreover, that each meeting is ushered in by its own appropriate preamble, and
has its own special business. In the one, Joshua speaks in his own name, and
delivers his own message; in the other, all the tribes are regularly assembled,
and are said to have "presented themselves before God," because, although Joshua
was still to be the speaker, he was no longer to speak in his own name, but with
the authority of a divine messenger, and in the very terms which had been put
