PREFACE</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Coming into the field as a Translator of Calvin so
late as I do, and after the various able Preliminary Notices of my predecessors
in the task, it would ill become me to offer any lengthened remarks, either
generally on the personal character and theological system of our illustrious
author, or more particularly on his merits as a Commentator upon Scripture. It
may not, however, be deemed superfluous that I should refer my readers to the
brief but interesting Memoir of Calvin, written by his associate and friend
Theodore Beza, and translated by Henry Beveridge, Esq., in Volume I. of Calvin's
Tracts in this Series. It would, I presume, be scarcely<i> </i>possible to
produce within a similar compass any Biography of the great Reformer which could
at all be brought into competition with this. That the colouring of partiality
may be discerned in it, the circumstances of the case would lead us to expect;
but as to the main facts of his life, whilst there can be little ground for
supposing Beza to be ignorant of them, so is he above the suspicion of having
intentionally falsified them. "Every reasonable person," says Bayle "will agree
with me, that, with respect to the historical sequence of Calvin's travels, no
author is more credible than Theodore Beza when the occurrences are of such a
nature as neither to injure nor enhance the glory of
Calvin."</font><br><font face="Palatino">It would at any rate appear to be
peculiarly unseasonable, at the present moment, to attempt any new Life of
Calvin, when an announcement has recently been made of a large amount of
materials having been discovered, which, when published, will probably throw
much additional light on the subject. I allude to a statement of the French
correspondent of the "<i>Evangelical Christendom</i>"<i> </i>for December 1851,
vol. 5. p. 494, to the following effect: &#8212; "A young man, equally
distinguished by his piety and learning, M. Jules Bonnet, had been commissioned,
in the reign of Louis Philippe, to collect the unpublished Letters of Calvin in
the Public Libraries of France, Geneva, etc. He has found 497, of which 190 are
written in the French language, and 307 in Latin. This correspondence promises
the greatest interest. It commences in 1524, when Calvin was yet on the benches
of the University, and continues up to 1564, the period when the illustrious
Reformer died. The greater part of these letters are addressed to Farel,
Melancthon, Theodore Beza, and other distinguished theologians. The French
letters are written to the King of Navarre, the Duchess of Ferrara, the Prince
of Conde, etc. One is addressed to the Duke of Somerset, who exercised then high
authority in England, and contains twenty-three
pages."</font><br><font face="Palatino">It may not be impossible that a more
accurate examination of these documents will prove that some of them are already
before the public; yet few, I think, into whose hands this work may fall will
abstain from uniting in the hope expressed by our informant, that this
correspondence should be published; or, if they are at all acquainted with the
writings of Calvin, will fail to agree in the opinion that "it will present to
literature some excellent models of style; to the historian, some precious
documents; to the theologian, some interesting ideas; and to simple Christians,
some edifying sentiments."</font><br><font face="Palatino">I would even venture
here to record my own fervent aspiration, that it may please God to dispose
men's hearts to afford such renewed encouragement to those who have undertaken
the great national work of which this volume forms a portion, that it may not be
abandoned until the whole Remains of Calvin, including the above-mentioned
letters, shall have appeared in an English dress, and until every emanation from
his almost miraculously fertile mind shall have enriched the religious
literature of our age and country. I believe, however, I am correct in saying,
that it will be impossible to put the top-stone on this monument of his
Christian sagacity and industry, unless every exertion be made to obtain
supporters by those who are desirous of its
completion.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Work, which it is now my
privilege for the first time to introduce to the English Reader, is confessedly
by no means the least worthy of its Author. One of the ablest and most laborious
of our own Theological critics, Mr. Hartwell Horne, has especially singled it
out for eulogy from amongst the whole series of Calvin's commentaries. "His<i>
</i>Harmony of the four last books of the Pentateuch (he says) has been much and
deservedly admired for its ingenuity. The <i>History </i>contained in them forms
a distinct part. The rest is comprised under the following divisions:
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>1.</b></font><font face="Palatino">
Those passages which assert the excellency of the Law by way of
<i>Preface</i>;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>2.</b></font><font face="Palatino">
The <i>Ten Commandments</i>,<i> </i>under each of which are comprehended all
those parts of the Law which relate to the same subject; and this forms the
great body of the
Harmony;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino">
The <i>Sum of the Law</i>,<i> </i>containing those passages which enjoin Love to
God, and Love to our
Neighbor;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino">
<i>The Use of the Law</i>;<i> </i>and lastly, its <i>Sanctions </i>of Promises
and Threats."</font><br><font face="Palatino">I have quoted Mr. Horne's
compendious account of the Book, in order that its character may at once be
understood; and surely the very<i> </i>idea of thus combining and arranging this
portion of Scripture, so as to present its contents in one simple and consistent
whole, must strike us as indication of no ordinary grasp and originality of
mind. With this Harmony before him, it is somewhat strange that Lightfoot should
have thus expressed himself in the Epistle Dedicatory to his "Chronicle<i>
</i>of the Times, and the Order of the Texts of the Old Testament;" "I do not
remember that I ever heard or saw this kind of task undertaken in any language,
namely, 'to harmonize the Old Testament,' and to lay the current of it in a
proper series; and, therefore, I acknowledge I have made a very bold venture in
attempting to break this ice, and to tread in these untrodden paths, for which
foolhardiness I have no other plea than my own ignorance and the reader's
gentleness." It was, one would suppose, hardly within the range of possibility
that his ignorance could have extended to unacquaintance with this considerable
work from the pen of Calvin; and yet, though his own plan was far more
comprehensive, and at the same time less artificial in its management than that
of Calvin, at least the boast of such absolute originality as he claims, seems
to be barred by the existence of the Book I have translated. It is perhaps even
still more remarkable that it should be passed over altogether by Dr. Townsend,
in the account of previous Harmonies prefixed to his own valuable "Connexion<i>
</i>of the Old Testament!"</font><br><font face="Palatino">The only solution I
can give of this omission on the part of these two eminent writers &#8212;
neither of whom would have been at all likely to do intentional injustice to the
<i>clarum et venerabile nomen </i>in question &#8212; is that at which I have
above hinted, viz., that whilst there are undoubtedly manifest points of
similarity in their undertaking, there was still a considerable difference in
the mode of its performance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The object which
Calvin had in view, and which he has so efficiently executed, was not so much to
present the narrative of each of the four last books of the Pentateuch in its
regular order of occurrence, though it necessarily happens that, with respect to
a great part of them, this must incidentally be the case. His aim was a far
higher one than that of a mere Chronologist. He sought not mainly to arrange the
facts of Scripture, but rather to systematize its doctrines, and to bring out
the mind of the Spirit of God in the revelation of His just, and good, and holy
Law in a complete and harmonious form. His work was intended as an auxiliary in
that important process of generalization, which every diligent and devout reader
of the Bible must to a certain extent, though sometimes even unconsciously,
carry on in his own mind; not satisfying himself with the notions conveyed by
isolated texts, but "comparing<i> </i>spiritual things with spiritual," until he
arrives at a nearer comprehension of that perfect order which reigns in the
midst of their apparent discrepancies.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
ingenuity of his arrangement it is impossible to gainsay. That it is open to
objections, even of a graver character than have sometimes been alleged against
ordinary Harmonies, he seems himself to have felt; but with his usual candor and
ability, he meets them in the Preface, to which the reader is referred as the
best apology for his motives, and the clearest exposition of his
design.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But whatever may be thought of its
execution, it is certain that we have here the opinions of a master-mind on
various topics of paramount interest and importance, when it had attained its
fullest maturity and development. We expressly learn from Beza, <i>vide </i>Life
of Calvin, p. 82, that both the Commentary itself, and its Translation into
French, which was made by himself, were amongst the labors of 1563,<i> </i>the
penultimate year<i> </i>of his mortal existence, and this statement is confirmed
both by Senebier, as quoted in the Translator's Preface to Genesis, vol. 1. p.
18, and by Calvin's own Dedicatory Epistle to the French Translation of the
Commentaries on the whole Pentateuch, which is given in the latter work, p. 27,
and which bears the date of Geneva, "le dernier jour le Juillet, M.D.<i>
</i>LXIII."</font><br><font face="Palatino">One can scarcely here forbear from a
passing allusion to the gigantic, and almost incredible labor involved in these
publications. "Calvin's<i> </i>diseases (says his friend and biographer) had so
much increased, and were so numerous, as to make it impossible to believe that
so strong and noble a mind could be any longer confined in a body so fragile, so
exhausted by labor, and, in fine, so broken down by suffering. But even then he
could not be persuaded to spare himself. Nay, if at any time he abstained from
public duty, (and he never did so without the greatest reluctance,) he still at
home gave answers to those who consulted him, or wore out his amanuenses by
dictating to them, though fatigued himself." Making every allowance for the
assistance he received in the mere mechanical portion of his Work; and viewing
this arrangement, and its Commentary purely as an intellectual effort, it is
surely a marvelous production under the circumstances here detailed, and, in
itself, a remarkable evidence of the vast resources, and highly disciplined
powers of the mind which gave it birth. Nay, more than this, may it not be
fairly questioned whether it must not have been made "a labor of love" with him,
and whether any less powerful impulse than love towards Him, who hath first so
freely and so abundantly loved us, working in dependence upon strength from
above, could have carried it through?</font><br><font face="Palatino">We may
indeed well imagine, that it was an undertaking after his own heart, conceived,
it may be, in earlier years, but reserved for execution as the appropriate
solace of his declining age. As life wore on, or rather, in his ease, we may
say, as life wore out; as daily experience increasingly taught him the
imperfection of human wisdom; as the difficulties of his position 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f1</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in the van of the Reformation thickened around him, doubtless the Scriptures of
God grew more and more precious to his soul, and were still more highly valued
as the counsellors of his mind and the delight of his
heart.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There were certain subjects, too,
necessarily brought before him in his meditation upon these particular Books,
which must have been very congenial to him. It was not unnatural that he should
take pleasure in soberly and calmly reviewing those doctrines which had so
largely exercised his earlier thoughts, and that the distinctive tenets, which
are usually associated with his name, and which, as the Article of the Church of
England testifies, are "full of sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable comfort to
godly persons, and such as feel in themselves the working of the Spirit of
Christ," should once<i> </i>more pass before him in his latter days, and demand
his serious consideration. Here, then, was the opportunity. The Election of
Israel, their Predestination, and Calling to be the Lord's peculiar people, and
the judicial blindness of wicked Pharaoh's heart, led him to reflect and speak
with more than ordinary fullness upon the divine decrees of our heavenly Father;
and, perhaps, some of his most prejudiced opponents might be surprised to find
the limitations which his system recognized, and the moderate tone of his
statements, if they could be induced to examine them here in their particular
application, rather than in the cruder and harsher form of general deductions
and logical definitions. At any rate &#8212; if, according to Bishop Burnet,
"the common fault on both sides (in this controversy) is, to charge one another
with the consequences of their opinions, as if they were truly their tenets"
&#8212; it must be confessed by all, that our Author is by no means guilty of
denying the responsibility of the sinner, or the need of personal holiness in
the righteous. If, elsewhere, he may have seemed to dogmatize too accurately,
and too closely to confine the dealings of Almighty wisdom within the narrow
tracks of human apprehension, they will perceive but little of such a spirit
here. They will find him here, as in all his other Commentaries, a faithful and
honest Expounder of God's Word, seeking to build upon it no theories of his own,
but to elicit in all sincerity and godly simplicity the instruction it was
intended to impart. The error into which he may most justly be accused of
falling, is not the making it assert too much but too little. The fancies of the
Rabbins and of the Allegorists were his aversion; and it may be that he
sometimes ran into the opposite extreme, and cleaved<i> </i>too rigidly to the
literal interpretation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But there is yet another
reason why so firm an upholder of the truth and authenticity of the Bible should
have been greatly interested in an exposition of the Pentateuch. Even before the
days of Calvin these precious Books had been a favorite point for the
unbeliever's assaults. They had not, indeed, been so systematically impugned as
in these latter times; but still their credit had even then been assailed with
no inconsiderable subtlety, and particular points in them had been subjected to
severe and unfavorable criticism. Calvin's remarks are not unfrequently leveled
directly against these adversaries; but, apart from this direct advocacy of the
truth, his labors indirectly furnish one of the best barriers possible against
the acceptance of the notion, that the books of the Pentateuch were but a
collection of fragments, and by no means the production of a single Author.
Nothing can more satisfactorily prove the unity of these Books than that
homogeneous body of Truth into which Calvin has here resolved
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I had intended to offer some observations
upon the writers who have preceded and followed Calvin in his illustration of
this part of the Bible. I find, however, that the necessity of the case would
prevent me from presenting anything more than a mere Bibliographical Catalogue,
which it would be easy enough to draw up, but which would here be somewhat out
of place. It will be seen, that in the brief illustrative notes appended to the
text, many of them have been referred to.</font><br><font face="Palatino">For
the Notes on the Hebrew words, etc., signed W., I am indebted to my dear and
venerable friend and neighbor, the Rev. Henry Walter, B.D. and F.R.S., Rector of
Hasilbury Bryan, Dorset, formerly Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge, and
Professor of Natural Philosophy in the Honourable East India Company's College
at Haileybury. It is no slight personal gratification to me to have my name thus
publicly associated with his; and I feel that it will operate with those, who
are acquainted with his valuable Writings, as a high recommendation of the
work.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the Notes, <i>C</i>. will signify
Calvin; <i>L</i>., Luther; <i>S</i>.<i>M</i>., Sebastian Munster; LXX, the
Septuagint; <i>A</i>.<i>V</i>., our own Authorized Version; and <i>V</i>., the

PREFACE OF JOHN CALVIN</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>TO THE FOUR LAST BOOKS OF
MOSES;</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><i>Arranged By Him In Form Of A
Harmony,</i></font><br><font face="Palatino"><i>And Illustrated By
Commentaries.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If I do not at once begin by stating my reasons for
the plan I have adopted in the composition of this Work, it will undoubtedly
incur the censures of many. Nor will it be attacked only by the malevolent and
the envious, (a matter of little consequence,) but some will perhaps be found,
who, with no other cause of disapproval, and without any malignity, will still
think that I have inconsiderately, and therefore unnecessarily, altered the
order which the Holy Spirit himself has prescribed to us. Now, there cannot be a
doubt that what was dictated to Moses was excellent in itself, and perfectly
adapted for the instruction of the people; but what he delivered in Four Books,
it has been my endeavor so to collect and arrange, that, at first sight, and
before a full examination of the subject, it might seem I was trying to improve
upon it, which would be an act of audacity akin to sacrilege. I pass by those
critics with indifference whose object is to frame causes of detraction out of
nothing, and whose greatest pleasure it is to invent occasions of railing; but
there will be no difficulty in conciliating those who are only unfavorable
through misunderstanding, if they will but listen calmly to the course I have
pursued. For I have had no other intention than, by this arrangement, to assist
unpracticed readers, so that they might more easily, more commodiously, and more
profitably acquaint themselves with the writings of moses; and whosoever would
derive benefit from my labors should understand that I would by no means
withdraw him from the study of each separate Book, but simply direct him by this
compendium to a definite object; lest he should, as often happens, be led astray
through ignorance of any regular plan.</font><br><font face="Palatino">These
four books are made up of two principal parts, viz., the Historical Narrative
and the Doctrine, by which the Church is instructed in true piety, (including
faith and prayer,) as well as in the fear and worship of God; and thus the rule
of a just and holy life is laid down, and individuals are exhorted to the
performance of their several duties. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f2</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This distinction Moses does not observe in his Books, not even relating the
history in a continuous form, and delivering the doctrine unconnectedly, as
opportunity occurred. I admit, indeed, that whatever refers to the regulation of
the conduct is comprehended in the ten commandments; but, since all have not
sufficient intelligence to discern the tendency of what is elsewhere taught, or
to reduce the different precepts to their proper class, there is nothing to
prevent such assistance being afforded them, as, by setting before them the
design of the holy Prophet, may enable them to profit more by his
writings.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moreover, the use and application of
the narrative in the four Books is twofold; for the deliverance of his ancient
people reflects, as in a bright mirror, the incomparable power, as well as the
boundless mercy, of God in raising up, and as it were engendering his Church.
But that the most gracious Father should have followed up this same people with
his continual bounty even unto the end, and have so contended with their gross
impiety, their detestable iniquity, and foul ingratitude, as not to cease to be
more than liberal towards the unthankful and the evil, is a manifest proof of
his inestimable loving-kindness; whilst we may perceive in his constant
government of them, how unwearied is the course of his grace in cherishing,
defending, honoring, and preserving those whom he has once embraced with his
love. Hence may we obtain a source of confidence; hence, too, may we learn to be
bold in prayer; while, lest we should be in doubt whether these exertions of
God's grace, which Israel experienced<i> </i>as well in their original calling
as in their successive history, have any relation to ourselves also, Moses has
stated their cause to have been that gratuitous adoption, which is common to us
with them, from the times that the only-begotten Son, having "broken down the
middle wall of partition," vouchsafed to become our head. On the other hand, the
terrible and memorable punishments, which are everywhere recounted, instruct us
in reverence towards God, and inspire our hearts with awe, lest we should
falsely boast ourselves to be his children, whilst indulging in the liberty of
sin. For, since God so severely punished idolatry, evil affections and lusts,
rebellion and other crimes, we may learn that he nowhere more evidently inflicts
his judgments than upon his Church, and thus we may appropriate to the deceivers
of our own day whatever happened to the hypocritical
Jews.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>I.</b></font><font face="Palatino">
The doctrine is divided into four principal Heads. In order to prepare their
minds for its reception,<i> </i>Moses commends the authority of the Law by many
eulogies. Whatever statements, therefore, occur as to the Dignity of the Law are
set down by way of <i>Preface</i>, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f3</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that God may be duly reverenced.<i> </i>Consequently, they precede in order the
precepts of the Law, and will occupy the <i>first
</i>place.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>II.
</b></font><font face="Palatino">The Ten Commandments follow, in which God has
briefly, but comprehensively<i> </i>summed up the Rule of a Just and Holy Life;
yet so as not to separate from them those interpretations which the Lawgiver has
added unconnectedly. For many Precepts, which are not found in the Two Tables,
yet differ not at all from them in sense; so that due care must be taken to
affix them to their respective<i> </i>Commandments in order to present the Law
as a
whole.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>III.</b></font><font face="Palatino">
The Third Head Of Doctrine<i> </i>consists of 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f4</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Supplements; by which word I mean, with respect to the First Table, the
Ceremonies and the outward Exercises of Worship; with respect to the Second
Table, the Political Laws, for the object of both these parts is merely to aid
in the observance of the Moral Law; and it is not a little important, that we
should understand that the Ceremonies and the Judicial Ordinances neither change
nor detract from the rule laid down in the Ten Commandments; but are only helps,
which, as it were, lead us by the hand to the due Worship of God, and to the
promotion of justice towards men. We are aware that of old there was a constant
controversy of the Prophets against the Jewish people; because, whilst
strenuously devoting themselves to Ceremonies, as if True Religion and Holiness
were comprised in them, they neglected real
righteousness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Therefore, God protests that he
never enjoined anything with respect to the Sacrifices: and he pronounces all
External Rites but vain and trifling, if the very least value be assigned to
them apart from the Ten Commandments. Whence we more certainly arrive at the
conclusion to which I have adverted, viz., that they are not, to speak
correctly, of the substance of the law, nor avail of themselves in the Worship
of God, nor are required by the Lawgiver himself as necessary, or even as
useful, unless they sink into this inferior position. In fine, they are
appendages, which add not the smallest completeness to the Law, but whose object
is to retain the pious in the Spiritual Worship of God, which consists of Faith
and Repentance, of Praises whereby their gratitude is proclaimed, and 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f5</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
even of the endurance of the Cross. As to all the Political Ordinances, nothing
will obviously be found in them, which at all adds to the perfection of The
Second Table: therefore it follows, that nothing can be wanted as the rule of a
good and upright life beyond the Ten
Commandments.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>IV.
</b></font><font face="Palatino">The Last Part shews the end and use of the Law;
and thence its usefulness is very extensive. For how would it profit us to be
instructed in righteousness of life, unless the perception of our guilt and
iniquity induced us to seek after the remedy? But when God allures us so gently
and kindly by his promises, and again pursues us with the thunders of his curse,
it is partly to render us inexcusable, and partly to shut us up deprived of all
confidence in our own righteousness, so that we may learn to embrace his
Covenant of Grace, and flee to Christ, who is the end of the law. This is the
intention of The Promises, in which he declares that he will be merciful, since
there is forgiveness ready for the sinner, and when he offers the spirit of
Regeneration. On this depends that sentence of St. Paul, that <i>Christ is the
end of the Law</i>.<i> </i>Still I do not so distinguish this class from the
foregoing, as if it had nothing in common with them. For, before arriving at it,
it will be often necessary to refer both to the terrible ruin of the human race,
as well as to the peculiar blessing of Adoption, and to that increasing flow of
fatherly love which God extends to his people. For all the expiations have no
other meaning than that God will be always merciful, as often as the sinner
shall flee to the refuge of his pardon. But how needful this division is will be
best understood as we proceed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The song of Moses
and his death will be the conclusion of the Four Books.</font><br><br><br></div>

conclude from this expression that Joseph died first of his brethren, whereas it
is evident that the others were passed over, and his name was expressly
mentioned to do him honor, as being the only one then in authority. How long
they survived their father, Moses does not say, but only marks the beginning of
the change, &#8212; as much as to say, the Israelites were humanely treated for
a considerable space of time; so that the condition of those who went down with
Jacob was tolerable, since, free from all injustice and tyranny, they tranquilly
enjoyed the hospitality accorded to them. At the same time, he gives us to
understand that, when all that generation was gone, the desire and the memory of
the land of Canaan, which they had never seen, might have died out of the minds
of their descendants, if they had not been forcibly aroused to seek after it.
And unquestionably, since that people were forgetful and careless of meditating
on God's mercies, God could not have better provided for their salvation than by
allowing them to be cruelly tried and afflicted; otherwise, as though their
origin had been in Egypt, they might have preferred to have remained for ever in
their nest, and by that indifference the hope of the promised heritage would
have been effaced from their
hearts.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>

were fruitful.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f8</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>To what an extent they increased Moses relates in the 12th chapter, viz., to
the number of 600,000, besides women and children; which was certainly an
incredible increase<i> </i>for so short a time. For, though 430 years be counted
from the date of the covenant with Abraham to the departure of the people, it is
clear that half of them had elapsed before Jacob went down into Egypt; so that
the Israelites sojourned in that land only 200 years, or little more &#8212; say
ten years more. How then could it come to pass that in so short a time a single
family could have grown into so many myriads? It would have been an immense and
extraordinary increase if 10,000 had sprung from every tribe; but this more than
quadruples that number. Wherefore certain sceptics, perceiving that the relation
of Moses surpasses the ordinary ratio of human propagation, and estimating the
power of God by their own sense and experience, altogether refuse to credit it.
For such is the perverseness of men, that they always seek for opportunities of
despising or disallowing the works of God; such, too, is their audacity and
insolence that they shamelessly apply all the acuteness they possess to detract
from his glory. If their reason assures them that what is related as a miracle
is possible, they attribute it to natural causes, &#8212; so is God robbed and
defrauded of the praise his power deserves; if it is incomprehensible to them,
they reject it as a prodigy. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f9</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But if they cannot bring themselves to acknowledge the interference of God
except in matters by the magnitude of which they are struck with astonishment,
why do they not persuade themselves of the truth of whatever common sense
repudiates? They ask how this can be, as if it were reasonable that the hand of
God should be so restrained as to be unable to do anything which exceeds<i>
</i>the bounds of human comprehension. Whereas, because we are naturally so slow
to profit by his ordinary operations, it is rather necessary that we should be
awakened into admiration by extraordinary dealings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us conclude, then, that since Moses does not here
speak of the natural course of human procreation, but celebrates a miracle
unheard of before, by which God ratified the truth of his promise, we should
judge of it perversely, and maliciously, if we measure it by our own feeble
reason, instead of meditating with reverence<i> </i>upon what far transcends all
our senses. Let us rather remember how God reproves his unbelieving people by
the Prophet Isaiah.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
51:1) For, in order to prove that it would not be difficult for Him, in spite of
the small number to which the Israelites were reduced, to produce a great
multitude, He bids them look into "the<i> </i>hole of the pit from whence they
were digged," viz., to Abraham, and Sarah that bare them, whom he multiplied
though alone, and childless. Certain Rabbins, after their custom, imagine that
four infants were produced at a birth; for as often as they meet with any point
which perplexes them, they gratuitously invent whatever suits them, and then
obtrude their imaginations as indubitable facts; and proceed foolishly, and
unseasonably, to discuss that this is physically probable. There are Christians,
too, who, with little consideration, have imitated them here, contending that
what Moses describes is in accordance with experience, because the fecundity of
certain nations has been almost as great. We indeed sometimes see confirmed by
remarkable examples what the Psalmist says, (Psalm 107:36,) that God "maketh<i>
</i>the hungry to dwell" in the wilderness, "that they may prepare a city for
habitation, and sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of
increase; and he blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;" as
also, that "He turneth a fruitful land into barrenness," and strips it of
inhabitants; but the design of Moses is to shew, that there never was any
fecundity, which was not inferior to the increase of the people of Israel. Hence
his comparison between the seventy souls, and the multitude which proceeded from
them, that this special blessing of God might be distinguished from ordinary
cases; hence too the accumulated expressions, which undoubtedly are meant for
amplification, that "they<i> </i>were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and
multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them." For
the repetition of the adverb, <i>Meod</i>,<i> Meod</i>,<i> </i>marks an unusual
abundance, Nor do I reject the conjecture of some, that in the word

king.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>When more than one hundred years
had been happily passed in freedom and repose, the condition of the elect people
began to be changed. Moses relates that the commencement of their troubles
proceeded from jealousy, and from the groundless fear of the Egyptians, because
they conceived that danger might arise from this strange nation, unless they
hastened to oppress it. But before he comes to this, he premises that the
remembrance of the benefits received from Joseph had departed, because it might
have in some measure mitigated their cruelty, had it still been unimpaired. It
is probable that this oblivion of the gratitude due to him arose from the
moderation of Joseph; for if he had demanded great privileges for his people,
and immunity from tributes and burdens, the remembrances of the saving of the
country by an Israelite would have been famous for many ages; but it appears
that he was content with the kind hospitality afforded them, that his brethren
might dwell comfortably, and without molestation in the land of Goshen, because
he wished them to be sojourners there until the time of deliverance arrived. And
in this way he best provided for their safety, lest being thus ensnared, they
might have fallen into the nets of destruction. But in proportion as the
moderation of the holy man exposed them not to jealousy and complaint, so was
the ingratitude of the Egyptians less excusable in forgetting, after little more
than a single century, that remarkable benefit, which should have been
everywhere preserved in their public monuments, lest the name of Joseph should
ever perish. Their unkindness, then, was intolerable, in refusing that his
kindred and descendants should sojourn with them, since they ought to have
ascribed the safety of themselves and their country, after God, to him, or
rather under the hand and with the blessing of God. But this disease has always
been flagrant in the world; and certainly it is good for us that evil should
ever be our reward from men for our kindnesses, that we may learn in the
performance of our duty to look to God alone, since otherwise we are unduly
addicted to conciliate<i> </i>favor and applause for ourselves, or to seek after
more earthly advantages. Still it was no common return which the Israelites had
liberally received during more than 100 years for Joseph's sake, that they lived
comfortably in a proud, avaricious, and cruel nation. Nevertheless, whatever
happens, although we are not only defrauded of all recompense, but even although
many of whom we have deserved well conspire for our destruction, let us never
regret having done rightly; and, in the meantime, let us learn that nothing is
more effective to restrain the desire of doing wrong, than those ties of mutual
connection, by which God has bound us together. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f12</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But, although the favor conferred by Joseph had been forgotten by all, the shame
and sin of ingratitude cleaves especially to the king; in whom it was more than
base to forget by whose industry and care he received so rich a yearly revenue.
For the holy Patriarch, by buying up the land, had obtained a fifth part of the
produce as a yearly tribute for the king. But so are tyrants accustomed to
engulf whatever is paid them, without considering by what right it is
acquired.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he said unto his
people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>That is to say, in a public
assembly, such as kings are wont to hold for consultation on public affairs. As
if Moses had said that this point was proposed by the king for deliberation by
his estates; viz., that because it was to be apprehended that the Israelites,
trusting in their multitude and strength, might rise in rebellion, or might take
advantage of any public disturbance to shake off the yoke and to leave Egypt,
they should be anticipated, and afflicted with heavy burdens, to prevent their
making any such attempt. This Pharaoh calls

"dealing<i> </i>wisely with them;" for though the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;kj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chakam</i>,<i> </i>is often taken, in a bad sense, to mean "to<i>
</i>overreach with cunning," still in this case he concealed under an honest
pretext the injury which he proposed to do them, alleging that prudent advice
should be taken lest the Egyptians might suffer great loss through their
carelessness and delay. This was common with heathen nations, to profess in
their counsels, that what was right should be preferred to what was profitable;
but, when it comes to the point, covetousness generally so blinds everybody,
that they lose their respect for what is right, and are hurried away headlong to
their own advantage. They make out too that what is advantageous is necessary;
and so persuade themselves that whatever they are compelled to do is right. For
that specious yet fallacious pretext readily occurs, and easily deceives, that,
when any danger is apprehended, it ought to be met. By the tragic poets, indeed,
that detestable sentiment, <i>occupandum esse scelus</i>,<i> </i>"that<i> </i>we
should be beforehand in crime," is attributed to wicked and desperate
characters; because our nature convinces us that it is unjust and absurd; and
yet is it commonly considered the best mode of precaution, so that only those
are accounted provident who consult for their own security by injuring others,
if occasion requires it. From this source almost all wars proceed; because,
whilst every prince fears his neighbor, this fear so fills him with
apprehension, that he does not hesitate to cover the earth with human blood.
Hence, too, amongst private individuals, arises the license for deceit, murder,
rapine, and lying, because they think that injuries would be repelled too late,
unless they respectively anticipated them. But this is a wicked kind of cunning,
(however it may be varnished over with the specious name of foresight,) unjustly
to molest others for our own security. I fear this or that person, because he
both has the means of injuring me, and I am uncertain of his disposition towards
me; therefore, in order that I may be safe from harm, I will endeavor by every
possible means to oppress him. In this way the most contemptible, and imbecile,
if he be inclined to mischief, will be armed for our hurt, and so we shall stand
in doubt of the greater part of mankind. If thus every one should indulge his
own distrust, while each will be devising to do some injury to his possible
enemies, there will be no end to iniquities. Wherefore we must oppose the
providence of God to these immoderate cares and anxieties which withdraw us from
the course of justice. Reposing on this, no fear of danger will ever impel us to
unjust deeds or crooked counsels. In the words of Pharaoh, all is otherwise;
for, having given warning that the Israelites might, if they would, be
injurious, he advises that their strength should in some way or other be broken.
For, when we have once determined to provide for our own advantage, or quiet, or
safety, we ask not the question whether we are doing right or
wrong.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, the
people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It not unfrequently happens that
the minds of the wicked are aroused to jealousy by the mercies of God, acting
like fans to light up their wrath. Nevertheless, the very least proof of his
favor ought not on that account to be less agreeable to us, because it is made
an occasion to the wicked of dealing more cruelly with us. In fact, God thus
attempers his bounty towards us, lest we should be too much taken up with
earthly prosperity. Thus the blessing on which all his happiness depended
banished Jacob from the home of his father, and from his promised inheritance;
but yet he assuaged his grief with this single consolation, that he knew God to
be reconciled to him. So also his posterity, the more they experienced of God's
goodness towards them, the more they were exposed to the enmity of the
Egyptians. But Pharaoh, to render them hated, or suspected, refers to their
power, and accuses them of disaffection, whereof they had given no token. Yet he
does not accuse them of rebellion, as if they would take armed possession of the
kingdom, but that they would depart elsewhere; whence we may conjecture, that
they made no secret of the hope which God had given them of their return. But
this seemed a plausible excuse enough, that it was anything but just for those,
who had of their own accord sought the protection of the king, to be freely sent
away; and thus

for gradually diminishing the children of Israel. Since they are subjects, they
may afflict them with burdens, to depress them; and this slavery will weaken and
decrease them. But their power over them as subjects should not have been
carried so far as to impose upon inoffensive persons, to whom they had granted
free permission to reside among them, these new tributes; for they ought first
to have considered upon what conditions they had been admitted. The exaction,
then, by which Pharaoh broke faith with them, was in itself unjust; but the
crime to which he proceeded was still greater, because he did not simply seek
for pecuniary advantage, but desired to afflict the wretched people by the
heaviness of their burdens. For the Israelites were not only compelled to pay
tribute, but were put to servile labor, as Moses immediately adds. As to the two
cities, it is doubtful in what sense they were called <i>miscenoth</i>.

the mercy of God and the cruelty of the king of Egypt. When, therefore, the
wretched Israelites were tyrannically afflicted, he says that God came to their
aid, and so powerfully that his interference was successful. Thus was that
wicked and deceitful design frustrated, which the Egyptians had set on foot for
destroying the Church. Thence may we, too, conceive the hope, that whatsoever
the wicked imagine against us will come to nought, because God's hand is
greater, and shall prevail. But we must bear afflictions patiently, because he
would have us struggle against, and rise under the weight imposed upon us; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f16</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and because we know that it is the peculiar office of God to oppose himself to
unjust counsels, in order that they may not succeed, let us learn to abstain
from all deceit and violence, lest we wantonly provoke God. But this passage is
especially intended to console the believer, that he may be prepared to take up
his cross more patiently; since God is sufficient to supply the help, to which
the wrath of the wicked must finally yield. What is said in the second part of
the verse, that the Egyptians 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f17</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
were grieved, means, that they became more anxious, as they saw that they
availed nothing, and that their unexpected increase threatened still greater
danger; for, since they feared the Israelites before they had afflicted them, no
wonder that they felt alarmed lest they should avenge themselves when provoked.
And hence the profitable instruction may be gathered, that while the wicked
proceed to horrible crimes in order to insure their safety, the Almighty visits
them with the very just return, that thus their anxiety is augmented. Some
render it, "the Egyptians hated the people of Israel;" and so the word

thought ever arises, still the blind impetuosity of their folly hurries them
forwards, so that they doubt not to be able in their obstinate lust to prevail
even in opposition to God; as will be made clearer in the progress of this
history. The cruelty of the exactions is expressed, when he says that "their
lives were made bitter," nothing being sweeter than life; therefore, it appears,
that their miseries were extreme and intolerable, which made life burdensome. He
confirms this in other words, and also specifies<i> </i>their tasks, that they

And the king of Egypt spake.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The tyrant
now descends from the open violence and cruelty which had availed nothing, to
secret plots and deceit. He desires the infants to be killed at their birth; and
commands the midwives to be the instruments of this dreadful barbarity. We read
of no such detestable example of inhumanity since the world began. I admit it
has occasionally happened, that, upon the capture of a city, the conquerors have
not spared even children and infants; that is to say, either in the heat of
battle, or because the defense had been too obstinate, and they had lost many of
their men, whose death they would avenge. It has happened, too, that an uncle,
or brother, or guardian, has been impelled by the ambition of reigning to put
children to death. It has happened, again, that in the detestation of a tyrant,
and to destroy the very memory of his family, his whole offspring has been
slain; and some have proceeded to such cruelty against their enemies, as to tear
the little ones from their mothers' breasts. But never did any enemy, however
implacable, ever so vent his wrath against a whole nation, as to command all its
male offspring to be destroyed in the midst of peace. This was a trial, such as
to inflict a heavy blow on men of the utmost firmness, much more to bring low a
fainting people, already weary of their lives. For, at first sight, each would
think it more advantageous and desirable for them to sink down into an humbler
state, than that the wrath of their enemies should be thus provoked against them
by the blessings of God. And it is probable, such was the prostration of their
minds, that they were not only sorely smitten, but almost stupified. For nothing
else remained, but that the men should die without hope of offspring, and that
the name and race of Abraham should soon be cut off, and thus all God's promises
would come to nought. In these days, in which we have to bear similar insults,
and are urged to despair, as if the Church would soon be utterly destroyed, let
us learn to hold up this example like a strong shield: seeing that it is no new
case, if immediate destruction seem to await us, until the divine aid appears
suddenly and unexpectedly in our extremity. Josephus falsely conjectures that
the midwives were Egyptian women, sent out as spies; whereas Moses expressly
says, that they had been the assistants and attendants of the Hebrew women in
their travail; and this erroneous idea is plainly refuted by the whole context,
in which it especially appears that they were restrained by the fear of God from
yielding to the sinful desire of the tyrant. Hence it follows, that they were
previously possessed with some religious feeling. But another question arises,
why two midwives only are mentioned by name, when it is probable that, in so
great a population, there were many? Two replies may be given; either that the
tyrant addressed himself to these two, who might spread the fear of his power
amongst the others; or, that, desiring to proceed with secret malice, he made a
trial of the firmness of these two, and if he had obtained their acquiescence,
he hoped to have easily succeeded<i> </i>with the others; for shame forbade him
from issuing an open and general
command.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the midwives feared
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses does not mean that they were
then first affected with the fear of God; but he assigns this reason why they
did not obey his unjust command, viz., because reverence towards God had greater
influence with them. And certainly, as all our affections are best directed by
this rein, so also it is the surest shield for resisting all temptations, and a
firm support to uphold our minds from wavering in seasons of danger. Now, they
not only dreaded this crime as being cruel and inhuman; but because purer
religion and piety flourished in their hearts; for they knew that the seed of
Abraham was chosen of God, and had themselves experienced that it was blessed;
and hence it was natural to feel, that it would be an act of very gross impiety
to extinguish in it the grace of God. We must also observe the <i>antithesis
</i>between the fear of God and the dread of punishment, which might have
deterred them from doing right. Although tyrants do not easily allow their
commands to be despised, and death was before their eyes, they still keep their
hands pure from evil. Thus, sustained and supported by reverential fear of God,
they boldly despised the command and the threatenings of Pharaoh. Wherefore
those, whom the fear of men withdraws from the right course, betray by their
cowardice an inexcusable contempt of God, in preferring the favor of men to his
solemn commands. But this doctrine extends still more widely; for many would be 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f19</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
</font><font face="Palatino">more than preposterously wise, whilst, under
pretext of due submission, they obey the wicked will of kings in opposition to
justice and right, being in some cases the ministers of avarice and rapacity, in
others of cruelty; yea, to gratify the transitory kings of earth, they take no
account of God; and thus, which is worst of all, they designedly oppose pure
religion with fire and sword. It only makes their effrontery more detestable,
that whilst they knowingly and willingly crucify Christ in his members, they
plead the frivolous excuse, that they obey their princes according to the word
of God; as if he, in ordaining princes, had resigned his rights to them; and as
if every earthly power, which exalts itself against heaven, ought not rather
most justly to be made to give way. But since they only seek to escape the
reprobation of men for their criminal obedience, let them not be argued with by
long discussions, but rather referred to the judgment of women; for the example
of these midwives is abundantly sufficient for their condemnation; especially
when the Holy Spirit himself commends them, as not having obeyed the king,
because they feared God.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the king of Egypt called for
the midwives.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He was not reduced to a
more moderate course by equity or mercy; but because he dared not openly expose
to slaughter the wretched and harmless infants at their birth, lest such
atrocity should arouse the wrath of the Israelites to vengeance, He<i>
</i>therefore secretly sends for the midwives, and inquires why they have not
executed his murderous command? I doubt not, however, that he was restrained
rather by the fear of rebellion than by shame. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f20</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In the answer of the midwives two vices are to be observed, since they neither
confessed their piety with proper ingenuity, and what is worse, escaped by
falsehood. For the fabulous story which the Rabbins invent to cover their fault,
must be rejected, viz., that they did not come in time to the Hebrew women,
because they had warned them of the wicked design of the king; and so it came to
pass that they were not present when they were delivered. What can be more tame
than this invention, when Moses shews in his narrative that they were guilty of
falsehood? Some assert that this kind of lie, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f21</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which they call "the lie officious, or serviceable," is not reprehensible;
because they think that there is no fault where no deceit for the purpose of
injury is used. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f22</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But I hold, that whatever is opposed to the nature of God is sinful; and on this
ground all dissimulation, whether in word or deed, is condemned, as I shall more
largely discuss in explaining the law, if God grants me time to do so. Wherefore
both points must be admitted, that the two women lied, and, since lying is
displeasing to God, that they sinned. For, as in estimating the conduct of
saints we should be just and humane interpreters; so also superstitious zeal
must be avoided in covering their faults, since this would often infringe on the
direct authority of Scripture. And, indeed, whensoever the faithful fall into
sin, they desire not to be lifted out of it by false defences, for their
justification consists in a simple and free demand of pardon for their sin. Nor
is there any contradiction to this in the fact, that they are twice praised for
their fear of God, and that God is said to have rewarded them; because in his
paternal indulgence of his children he still values their good works, as if they
were pure, notwithstanding they may be defiled by some mixture of impurity. In
fact, there is no action so perfect as to be absolutely free from stain; though
it may appear more evidently in some than in others. Rachel was influenced by
faith, to transfer the right of primogeniture to her son Jacob; a desire,
undoubtedly, pious in itself, and a design worthy of praise, anxiously to strive
for the fulfillment of the divine promise; but yet we cannot praise the cunning
and deceit, by which the whole action would have been vitiated, had not the
gratuitous mercy of God interposed. Scripture is full of such instances, which
shew that the most excellent actions are sometimes stained with partial sin. But
we need not wonder that God in his mercy should pardon such defects, which would
otherwise defile almost every virtuous deed; and should honor with reward those
works which are unworthy of praise, or even favor. Thus, though these women were
too pusillanimous and timid in their answers, yet because they had acted in
reality with heartiness and courage, God endured in them the sin which he would
have deservedly condemned. This doctrine gives us alacrity in our desire to do
rightly, since God so graciously pardons our infirmities; and, at the same time,
it warns us most carefully to be on our guard, lest, when we are desirous of
doing well, some sin should creep in to obscure, and thus to contaminate our
good work; since it not unfrequently happens that those whose aim is right, halt
or stumble or wander in the way to it. In fine, whosoever honestly examines
himself, will find some defect even in his best endeavors. Moreover, by the
rewards of God, let us be encouraged to the confidence of thus obtaining good
success, lest we should faint at the dangers we incur by the faithful
performance of our duty; and assuredly no danger will alarm us, if this thought
be deeply impressed upon our hearts, that whatever ill-will our good deeds may
beget in this world, still God sits in heaven to reward
them.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He made them

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f23</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>It is not at all my opinion that this should be expounded as referring to
the women, and I am surprised that many interpreters have been grossly mistaken
on so dear a point. All are agreed that the pronoun is masculine, and therefore,
according to ordinary usage, should refer to males; but because the two letters
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;</font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;</font><font face="Palatino">
are sometimes used interchangeably, they have supposed that the two clauses of
the verse must be connected, and both referred to the women. But there is no
need of this, since the sentence runs very well in this way: &#8212; "The people
multiplied and waxed very mighty, and it came to pass, because the midwives
feared God, that God made <i>them </i>houses," <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>.,<i> </i>the
Israelites; as much as to say, that through the piety of these women, they
obtained an abundant offspring. And because some saw that a suitable meaning
could not be elicited by this false interpretation, they have imagined that, by
the inspiration of God, well-fortified houses were built them by the people,
where they might be secure from the attacks of their enemies. Nothing can be
more puerile than this conceit. But lest readers should puzzle themselves
unnecessarily on this not very perplexing point, let us inquire what the Hebrews
meant by this expression, "to<i> </i>make houses." When God promises
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;090235&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 2:35) that he will build for Samuel "a<i> </i>sure house," there is no
question that he refers to a stable priesthood. Again, when he declares
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;100727&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 7:27) that he will build a house for David; and when a little afterwards
we read in David's prayer, (v. 27,) "thou<i> </i>hast revealed to thy servant,
saying, I will build thee a house," the royal dignity is clearly to be
understood. It is plain, too, from the address of Abigail, that this was a
common mode of speaking, where she says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;092528&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 25:28,) "the<i> </i>Lord will certainly make my lord a sure house." Now,
it is quite unsuitable to the female sex and name that a woman should be made
head of a family. Whence it appears that the words are forcibly 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f24</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
wrested if we say that God made a house for the midwives; but it will be most
applicable to the whole people, that it was multiplied by God, until it arose
like a perfect building to its full height. The conclusion is, that the
Israelites owed to the exertions of two women the fact, not only that they
survived and were preserved, but also that they flourished more and more, in
order that thus the glory of God might shine forth with greater brightness,
since he so marvelously preserved his people when very near destruction by these
weak instruments. But Moses puts the word "houses"<i> </i>in the plural number,
because the people were built up by the increase of the offspring of separate
families.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Pharaoh
charged.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>If he had not been transported
with wrath and struck with blindness, he would have seen that the hand of God
was against him; but when the reprobate are driven to madness by God, they
persevere obstinately in their crimes; and not only so, but, like the deranged 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f25</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
or frantic, they dash themselves with greater audacity against every obstacle.
It is indeed commonly the case<i> </i>that cruelty, having once tasted innocent
blood, becomes more thirsty for it; nay, in general, wicked men, as if excited
by their course, grow hotter and hotter in crime, so that there is no end nor
measure to their iniquity; but here, in this very<i> </i>desperate rage, we must
perceive the vengeance of God, when he had given up the tyrant for the devil to
destroy him, whilst we also remember his design both to try the patience of his
people as well as to set forth his own goodness and power. The tyrant, finding
that his snares and deceit availed nothing, now shakes off fear and flies to
open violence, commanding the little ones to be torn from the breasts of their
mothers and to be cast into the river. Lest there should be any lack<i> </i>of
executioners, he gives this charge to all the Egyptians, whom he knew to be more
than ready for the work. He spares the daughters, that, being enslaved and
allotted to the Egyptians, they might produce slaves for their masters, whilst
by them the races and names could not be preserved. Here it may be worth while
to meditate on a comparison with our own times. Antichrist, with all his
murderous agents, leaves in peace those who by their treacherous silence deny
Christ, and are prepared to embrace as slaves every kind of impiety; neither
does he exercise his cruelty, insatiable though it be, where he sees no
manliness to exist; and he exults and triumphs, as if his end was gained, when
he perceives any who had some courage in professing their faith fallen into
effeminacy and cowardice. But how much better is it for us to die an hundred
times, retaining our manly firmness in death, than to redeem our life for the
base service of the devil.</font><br><br></div>

And there went. </i></font><font face="Palatino">I have preferred rendering the
verb in the pluperfect tense (abierat, "there had gone") to prevent all
ambiguity; for unless we say that Miriam and Aaron were the children of another
mother, it would not be probable otherwise that this marriage was contracted
after the passing of the edict. Aaron was three years old when Moses was born;
and we may easily conjecture that he was brought up openly and securely. But
there is no doubt but that the cruelty was greatest at its commencement.
Therefore, if they were uterine brothers, there is no other explanation except
to say that, by the figure called
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">u[steron
pro&gt;teron</font><font face="Palatino">, he now relates what had happened
before. But mention is only made of Moses, because it then first began to be
criminal to breed up male infants. The Hebrews use the word for going or
departing, to signify the undertaking of any serious or momentous matter, or
when they put any proposal into operation. Nor is it superfluous for Moses to
say that his father married a wife of his own tribe, because this double tie of
kindred should have confirmed them in their attempt to preserve their offspring.
But soon afterwards we shall see how timidly they acted. They hide the child for
a short time, rather from the transient impulse of love than from firm
affection. When three months had elapsed, and that impulse had passed away, they
almost abandon the child, in order to escape from danger. For although the
mother would have probably come next day, if he had passed the night there, to
give him the breast, yet had she exposed him as an outcast to innumerable risks.
By this example, we perceive what terror had taken possession of every mind,
when a man and his wife, united to each other by close natural relationship,
prefer exposing their common offspring, whose beauty moved them to pity, to
peril of wild beasts, of the atmosphere, of the water, and of every kind, rather
than that they should perish with him. But on this point different opinions are
maintained: whether or not it would have been better to discharge themselves of
the care of their child, or to await whatever danger attended its secret
preservation. I confess, indeed, that whilst it is difficult in such
perplexities to come to a right conclusion, so also our conclusions are apt to
be variously judged; still I affirm that the timidity of the parents of Moses,
by which they were induced to forget their duty, cannot advisedly be
excused.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We see that God has implanted even in
wild and brute beasts so great instinctive anxiety for the protection and
cherishing of their young, that the dam often despises her own life in their
defense. Wherefore it is the more base, that men, created in the divine image,
should be driven by fear to such a pitch of inhumanity as to desert the children
who are intrusted to their fidelity and protection. The reply of those who
assert that there was no better course in their desperate circumstances than to
repose on the providence of God, has something in it, but is not complete. It is
the chief consolation of believers to cast their cares on the bosom of God;
provided that, in the meantime, they perform their own duties, overpass not the
bounds of their vocation, and turn not away from the path set before them; but
it is a perversion to make the providence of God an excuse for negligence and
sloth. The parents of Moses ought rather to have looked forward with hope that
God would be the safeguard of themselves and their child. His mother made the
ark with great pains, and daubed it; but for what purpose? Was it not to bury
her child in it? I allow that she always seemed anxious for him, yet in such a
way that her proceedings would have been ridiculous and ineffectual, unless God
had unexpectedly appeared from heaven as the author of their preservation, of
which she herself despaired. Nevertheless, we must not judge either the father
or mother as if they had lived in quiet times; for it is easy to conceive with
what bitter grief they compassed the death of their child; nay, to speak more
correctly, we can scarcely conceive what terrible agonies they suffered.
Therefore, when Moses relates how his mother made and prepared an ark, he hints
that the father was so overwhelmed with sorrow as to be incapable of doing
anything. Thus the power of the Lord more clearly manifested itself, when the
mother, her husband being entirely disheartened, took the whole burden on
herself. For, if they had acted in concert, Moses would not have assigned the
whole praise to his mother. The Apostle, indeed,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581123&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:23,) gives a share of the praise to the husband, and not undeservedly, since
it is probable that the child was not hidden without his cognizance and
approval. But God, who generally "chooses<i> </i>the weak things of the world,"
strengthened with the power of his Spirit a woman rather than a man, to stand
foremost in the matter. And the same reasoning applies to his sister, into whose
hands his mother resigned the last and most important act, so that while Miriam,
who, on account of her tender age, appeared to be exempt from danger, is
appointed to watch over her brother's life, both parents appear to have
neglected their duty.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when she saw that he was
a goodly child.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There is no doubt but
that God had adorned him with this beauty, in order the more to influence his
parents to preserve him; as it sometimes happens that, when God sees his people
slow in the performance of their duty, he spurs on their inactivity by
allurements; although it appears from the testimony of the Apostle, that this
was not their only motive to have pity on him, but that it was the prop, as it
were, of their weak faith; for he tells us
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581123&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:23) that "by faith Moses was hid three months of his parents." If any object
that faith and regard for beauty are things not only very different but almost
contrary to each other, I reply, that by the wonderful compassion of God, it
comes to pass that the very impediment which might darken faith becomes its
assistant, though it ought indeed to rest upon the promises alone. Therefore, if
faith had shone purely and brightly in their hearts, they would have cared
nothing for his beauty; on the other hand, unless the promise had had its power,
nay, unless it had occupied the first place, there was no such efficacy in the
goodliness of his appearance as would have led them willingly to hazard their
lives. We conclude, then, that, since they had good hopes of the deliverance
promised to them, their courage was increased by the additional motive of his
beauty, and that they were so attracted to pity, that all obstacles were
overcome. Thus does God ordinarily work, leading his people in their darkness
like the blind, when they are wavering through ignorance and weakness of heart.
In fine, the love which his beauty awakened was so far from being a part of
faith, that it deservedly detracts from its praise; but God, who, in his
wonderful wisdom, makes all things to work for the good of his chosen ones,
sustained and strengthened their tottering faith by this
support.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And his sister stood afar off.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is
probable that this was Miriam. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f26</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
By the fact of her standing to watch what became of him, it appears that his
parents had some hope remaining, though it was but small. For it is scarcely
doubtful but that whatever Egyptian had come that way would have been his
executioner, as well from the command of the king as from the general hatred of
the nation against the Hebrews. It seems, then, that Miriam was set by her
parents to watch, rather to witness her brother's murder, than to provide for
the safety of the child. But, since we have just seen that, in the darkness of
sorrow and despair, some sparks of faith still survived, the mother, exposing
her little one on the river's side, did not abandon all care of him, but desired
to commend him to the mercy of any passer-by, and therefore stationed her
daughter afar off to act as circumstances arose. For, if she had heard that the
child still lay there at night, she would have come secretly to give him the
breast. This determination, however, as is often the case in times of perplexity
and trouble, was vain, though God miraculously stretched forth his hand for the
child's preservation. For there can be no question but that his secret
providence brought the king's daughter to the river, who had the courage to take
up the child and to have it nursed; and that he, too, influenced her mind to the
kind act of saving its life, &#8212; in a word, that he controlled the whole
matter. Indeed, all pious persons will confess that he was the author of her
great and uninquisitive kindness in not taking more pains to learn who were the
child's parents, and why a nurse offered herself so immediately, which
circumstance might have naturally awakened suspicion. Thus it did not happen
without many miracles that the child escaped safely from the ark. Scoffers would
say that all occurred accidentally; because perverse delusion has possession of
their minds, so that they are blind to the manifest works of God, and think that
the human race is governed by mere chance. But we must hold fast to the
principle, that whilst God rules all men by his providence, he honors his elect
with his peculiar care, and is watchful for their deliverance and support; and
if we carefully weigh all the circumstances, reason will easily assure us that
all things which led to the preservation of Moses, were disposed by his
guidance, and under his auspices, and by the secret inspiration of his Spirit.
For to ascribe to fortune such an harmonious combination of various and manifold
means, is no less absurd than to imagine with Epicurus that the world was
created by the fortuitous conjunction of atoms. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f27</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Assuredly he drew out Moses, who was to be the future redeemer of his people, as
from the grave, in order that he might prove that the beginning of the safety of
his Church was like a creation out of nothing. And this was the crowning act of
his divine mercy, not only that he was given to his mother to be nursed, but
that she received wages for it.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the child
grew.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here, however, their grief is
renewed, when his parents are again obliged to give up Moses, and he is torn as
it were from their bowels. For, on this condition, he passed over to the
Egyptian nation, not only that he should be alienated from his own race, but
that he should increase the number of their enemies in his own person. And
certainly it is scarcely credible that he could be long tolerated in the
tyrant's court, and amongst the most cruel enemies of Israel, unless he
professed to be a partaker of their hatred. We know of what corrupting
influences courts are full; it is well known, too, how great was the pride of
the Egyptians, whilst experience teaches us how prone even the best natures are
to yield to the temptations of pleasure, wherefore we must wonder the more that,
when Moses was engulfed in these whirlpools, he still retained his uprightness
and integrity. Certainly the hope of their redemption might seem here again to
suffer an eclipse, the course of circumstances being all against it; but thus
the providence of God, the more circuitously it appears to flow, shines forth
all the more wonderfully in the end, since it never really wanders from its
direct object, or fails of its effect, when its due time is come. Nevertheless
God, as with an outstretched hand, drew back his servant to himself and to the
body of his Church, by suggesting in his name the recollection<i> </i>of his
origin; for the king's daughter did not give him this name without the
preventing Spirit of God, that Moses might know that he was drawn out of the
river when he was about to perish. As often, then, as he heard his name, he must
needs remember of what people he sprang; and the power of this stimulus must
have been all the greater, because the fact was known to everybody. The daughter
of the king, indeed, could have by no means intended this, and would have rather
wished the memory of his origin to be lost; but God, who put words in the mouth
of Balaam's ass, influenced also the tongue of this woman to bear loud and
public testimony to the very thing which she would have preferred to conceal;
and although she desired to keep Moses with herself, became his directress and
guide in returning to his own nation. But should any be surprised that she did
not fear her father's anger in thus publicly recording the violation of his
command, it may readily be replied that there was no cause of offense given to
the tyrant, who would have willingly allowed any number of slaves to be born to
him, so that the name of Israel were abolished. For why did he spare the lives
of the female infants, but in order that Egyptian slaves might be born of them?
And, regarding Moses in this light, he did not conceive that the act of his
daughter had violated his command, nay, he rather rejoiced that the Israelitish
nation was thus diminished, and the Egyptian nation numerically increased. One
question only remains, viz., how it occurred to the mind of Pharaoh's daughter
to give Moses an Hebrew name, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f28</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
when it is certain from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;198105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

pretended to be an Egyptian.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014223&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis

which expressed this signification, or we may prefer supposing that he had an
Egyptian name, which was interpreted by his Hebrew one, and this I am most
inclined to think was the case. When Moses subsequently fled, he again took the

faith which the Apostle celebrates begin to shew itself, when Moses, despising
the pleasures and riches of the Court, chose rather to suffer the reproach of
Christ, than to be accounted happy apart from companionship with the chosen
people. Nor was it only love for his nation, but faith in the promises, which
induced him to undertake this charge, by which he knew that he should incur the
hatred of all the Egyptians. For although he did not immediately resign his
wealth, and honorable station, and influence, and power, this was, as it were,
the preparation for divesting himself of all these deceitful allurements. Whence
the Apostle says,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">There is certainly no doubt but that he avowed his
desire to return to his true and natural kindred, from whom he had been
separated: for we gather from the context, that he did not come to see his
brethren only to pity their estate, but to bring them some consolation, and even
to share their lot. Nor was the Court so near that he could daily visit them in
his ordinary walk. And it is said that "he<i> </i>went out the second day."
Therefore, he privately withdrew himself from the Court, or, having asked
permission, preferred to expose himself to enmity, rather than not discover his
affectionate regard to his people. But he relates that he looked on their
burdens, or troubles, so that their unjust oppression must have naturally
aroused him to give them help. He adds, too, another motive, that he "saw<i>
</i>an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew." It is probable that they were harshly
treated by their taskmasters if they were slow in their work, and since they
were given over to the will of wicked men, that every one might exercise the
same cruelty upon them with
impunity.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he looked this way and that
way.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Hence it more evidently appears
that Moses came with the design of succouring his unhappy brethren, and of
relieving and aiding them with his help, since, by killing the Egyptian, he
avenged the injury done indeed to an individual, but having a bearing on the
whole nation. But although he was inspired by the Holy Spirit with special
courage for the performance of this act, still it was accompanied with an
infirmity, which shews that he did not undertake without hesitation what he yet,
knew to be his vocation. For Stephen
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440725&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
7:25)<i> </i>bears witness that Moses was not impelled by a rash zeal to stay
the Egyptian, but because he knew that he was divinely appointed to be the
avenger and deliverer of his nation. Still he looked about to see whether any
one saw him, and dared not punish the wrong-doer, except by a secret blow. Thus
we perceive that he was not altogether so bold as he should have been, and that
he had to strive against his timidity. Again, we gather from his hesitation that
his faith was weak, so that we must not suppose that it was thus praised by the
Apostle because it was absolutely perfect. In the first place, then, let us
conclude that Moses did not rashly have recourse to the sword, but that he was
armed by God's command, and, conscious of his legitimate vocation, rightly and
judiciously assumed that character which God assigned to him. Thence it follows,
that private persons would act improperly, and would be by no means countenanced
by his example, if they sought to repress wrong by force and arms. Thus far we
should imitate Moses in rendering aid to the suffering and oppressed, as far as
our means go, and in caring not to incur the ill-will of the wicked, when we
oppose ourselves to their oppressions; but we must leave it to the judges, who
are invested with public authority, to draw the sword of vengeance. If these do
not afford their aid to the innocent when they are unjustly treated, all we can
do is to murmur; as not even Moses would have been allowed to proceed further,
unless he had been the appointed avenger and deliverer of the people. As to the
fear, by which he betrayed his pusillanimity and his present unpreparedness for
fulfilling his office, let us learn that the obedience of the saints, which is
stained by sin, is still sometimes acceptable with God through mercy; and
therefore, although the weakness of the flesh is a draw-back to us in the
performance of our duty, still let us cease not to struggle against it; for our
assurance of this ought to have no small effect in animating us, when we are
persuaded that there is pardon ready for our hesitation, if we do not yield to
it.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, two men of the Hebrews.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">This perseverance shews that Moses was firm and
determined in his design of returning to his brethren, and abandoning the Court;
and that he had advisedly renounced its splendor, its wealth, and comforts,
although he was by no means ignorant of the miseries to which he exposed
himself, and how painful and disagreeable, nay, how ignominious a condition
awaited him. Wherefore we need not wonder if the Apostle says, that he
chose</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"rather to endure the
reproach of Christ," "and to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to
enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581125&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hebrews
11:25, 26.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Besides, the sad sight of the
tyrant's violence and of the burdens by which his brethren were oppressed, was
anything but an obstacle to his proceeding, because, being prepared by the hope
of future recompense to bear the cross, he was superior to present fear. But he
does not assume, as before, the character of a judge; but performs a duty, which
the law of charity demands of every one, addressing the men who strove together
as a peace-maker, and exhorting them both to be reconciled, though he especially
blames the wrongdoer. This was not peculiar to Moses, but the common duty of all
believers, when the innocent are harshly treated, to take their part, and as far
as possible to interpose, lest the stronger should prevail. It can scarcely be
done without exasperating those who are disposed to evil; but nothing ought to
allow us to be silent, while justice is violated by their forwardness. For in
this ease, silence is a kind of consent. Yet Moses reproves moderately, and in
kind terms, the man who had assaulted his brother; because he does not so much
wish to reproach him with the greatness of his fault, as to find the means of
calming his ferocity.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who made thee a
prince?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>No wonder if the headstrong and
wicked man repels angrily this mild admonition; for thus are those, who are
disposed to injustice, accustomed to rage as soon as they are reproved, and to
drive away good advisers with contumely. And certainly it is an uncommon virtue
to acknowledge our faults, and patiently to submit to correction. For in
proportion to a man's evil disposition, and to the greatness of his offense, is
his rage under admonition, and his violence in altercation; wherefore, whoever
undertakes to restrain the wicked must expect to meet with these indignities.
Still, we may understand from the petulance of this individual how perverse were
the minds of the whole nation. On this account Stephen says that Moses was
refused by his own nation, and accuses them all of ingratitude.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440735&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
7:35.) But, without being too hard on this people, we learn from this example
how rude is the nature of those whom God has not tamed; for their perverseness
as firmly repels correction, as an anvil repels the blow of a hammer. When,
therefore, they are so stubborn that though ten times reproved they are still
hardened, no wonder if God deals with them more roughly, as he declares he will
do by the mouth of David.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191827&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
18:27.)<i> </i>Lest we should experience this, let us submit to his rod in time;
and since this is not given to all, let us entreat him to make us truly
teachable. For what shall we gain by kicking against the pricks? Moreover, a
kind of brutal fierceness accompanies this perverseness, as is again seen in
this instance. The vile and abject slave asks Moses, Who made him a judge over
the Hebrews? as if he, and all his race, were not exposed to universal
contumely. If the lowest of the Egyptian rabble had struck him a blow, he would
not have dared to murmur; yet he rages as imperiously against this mild
admonition, as if he were free from all subjection. What follows is even worse,
"Intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian?" He ought to have
received Moses as if he had been an angel of God, on account of such a proof of
his zeal and piety; but, turning the benefit into an accusation, he not only
hatefully taunts him with what it would have been just to praise, but even
threatens him. Meantime, we cannot doubt but that the holy man must have been
racked by a sore temptation, when he finds such barbarity in his nation. He
knew, indeed, that the Egyptians would have been his professed enemies, if the
matter had got abroad; but he never could have expected such an unworthy return
from his brethren, whose misery he desired to relieve; and therefore it was a
proof of incredible strength of purpose to surmount such an
obstacle.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now when Pharaoh
heard.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses acknowledges his fear,
though it was not sufficient to withdraw him from the work to which he was
called. We said before, that his zeal was mingled with infirmity, but yet
prevailed; so that he performed the duty entrusted to him manfully, yet at the
same time timidly. But this is another proof of his firmness, that he is not
ashamed of what he had done, so as to endeavor to appease the king, but he
betakes himself to exile; nor is he so alarmed in this critical time as to sink
down in helplessness or despair, but he departs into the land of Midian, and
prefers wandering in the Desert, to a reconciliation with the enemies of the
chosen people. But although God appears by this circuitous course to decline
from his purpose of delivering them, yet he marvelously carries on His work. We
have already sufficiently perceived that Moses was certainly not yet ripe for
the arduous contests which awaited him; that, having been brought up delicately
and luxuriously in the Court, he was not yet accustomed to the great and
continual anxieties of which the sequel of the history will shew him the
conqueror. Therefore God in a manner withdrew him, that he might gradually
render him fit and equal to undertake so difficult a task. For the experience of
forty years in such a laborious and ascetic mode of life, did not a little avail
to prepare him for enduring any hardships; so that the Desert may well be called
the school in which he was taught, until he was invited to his more difficult
charge. As to his "sitting<i> </i>down by a well," I interpret it, that he sat
down there to rest from his fatigue about sunset, that he might ask for
hospitality from the people, who he hoped would come at eventide to draw water.
From this unprosperous beginning he might conjecture what an uncomfortable
reception he had to expect.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

sat down to ask for hospitality at the waterside, whither in a dry country the
inhabitants were likely to flock in the evening. But it was by no means due to
chance that he came so opportunely to render assistance to the damsels, and that
Jethro so hospitably invited him; but God was the guide of his wandering
servant's way, not only to obtain for him a resting-place for a day, but a
comfortable habitation even to the close of his exile. For Jethro (whose title
shews that he was of some dignity amongst his people) not only engaged his
services, but chose him for his son-in-law. Although the occupation of a
shepherd was a humble one, yet there was no little consolation in this high
connection. All are not agreed about the word

</i>The Chaldee paraphrast badly translates it "Prince," because it does not
accord with the fact that the shepherds of the country were at variance with his
daughters. Nor is it more probable that a rich and chief man would have been
without servants, so as to be obliged to expose his daughters daily to the
insults and quarrels of the shepherds. I think, then, that he was a priest
(<i>sacrificum</i>,)<i> </i>which is the opinion most generally received. But
the question is, whether he worshipped false gods, or the one true God? and
certainly many probable reasons lead us to conclude, that he did not sacrifice
to idols; because Moses could scarcely have been persuaded, not merely to live
in a house which was defiled by foul unrighteousness, but even to marry into it.
Besides, hereafter, many indications of piety will appear in the language of
Jethro. Although, as almost the whole world had then fallen into many corrupt
practices, it seems likely to me that his priesthood was in some measure
corrupted. In the time of Abraham, Melehizedek was the only priest of the living
God. Abraham himself was extricated from a deep abyss of idolatry into which his
family was plunged. It was, then, hardly possible that the Midianites should
have retained the pure worship; and indeed it is plain from other passages, that
they were joined to idols. After duly weighing all these points, nothing occurs
to me as more probable, than that under the priesthood of Jethro the true God
was worshipped, according as tradition had revealed Him, but not purely; because
religion was at that time everywhere contaminated by diverse superstitions. But
there is some difference between idolatry and the impure worship of God,
corrupted in some respects. I say, then, that they were worshippers of the true
God, because they had not entirely departed from the principles of His religion,
although they had contracted some defilement from the stinking puddles of error
which had gradually crept in. There is also another question among interpreters
as to the name "Jethro."<i> </i>Those who think <i>Bethuel</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f30</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>was a different person from Jethro, are easily refuted; for it is quite
evident, that Moses in the next chapter speaks of the same person, though under
another name. Nor would it agree with the mention of his marriage, that the name
of the father should be altogether omitted; and it is a forced construction to
suppose, that in such immediate connection two persons should be spoken of as in
the same degree of relationship. Again, if Jethro was the son of
<i>Bethuel</i>,<i> </i>living in the same house, he would have been a member of
the family, but not its head, and therefore Moses would not be said to have fed
<i>his </i>flock. Besides, it is probable that Hobab (who will be afterwards
called the son of <i>Bethuel</i>,<i>
</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;041029&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
10:29) was the brother-in-law of Moses, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>.,<i> </i>the brother
of his wife; from whence we collect, that Jethro, as is not unusual, had two
names. For it is absurd to think that it is Hobab whom Moses here calls Jethro,
and an unreasonable invention. We shall hereafter see that Jethro came into the
Desert to congratulate Moses; but it is related in the same place that he "let
him depart;"<i> </i>and certainly it would not have been kind to press a man
bowed down by age to accompany him on his long journey. For if he was older than
Moses, he was scarcely less than ninety; and what sense would there have been in
promising a decrepit old man the reward of his labor, after they should reach
the land of Canaan?</font><br><font face="Palatino">But the whole controversy is
put an end to in one word; because Moses writes that Jethro returned home, but
that Hobab was persuaded to listen to his earnest requests, and to remain with
him. Nothing can be more probable than that the old man <i>Bethuel</i>,<i>
</i>who was unequal to bear the fatigue of a long journey, returned straight
home, having left his son behind with Moses, to be to him "instead of eyes,"<i>
</i>and to guide them on their
way.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>

Reuel</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f31</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>I do not think any blame attaches to the daughters of <i>Bethuel </i>for not
offering hospitality to Moses, because young women should be modest, and it
would have been an act of too great forwardness to invite an unknown foreigner,
without acquainting their father. But God inspires the heart of their father
with gratitude, so that he desires him to be sent for. Moses, therefore, is
brought from the well, and finds a home in which he may live comfortably, and is
treated with kindness on account of his matrimonial alliance. And certainly
there was need of some alleviation for his manifold cares and sorrows; since it
was a hard trial, which would not only pain him greatly, but would have
altogether overwhelmed him in despair unless the holy man had been supported in
some way in enduring his forty years' exile. We may easily conjecture from our
own feelings how great must have been the weariness of so tedious a delay,
especially when he saw that the flower of his age was past, and that his
strength was failing, so that he would be afterwards but little fitted for
activity. It was, therefore, difficult for him to be intent on that vocation,
which might seem to be obsolete, and abrogated in this period of forty years.
These heavy troubles and anxieties are in some degree mitigated, but yet not so
completely as to prevent the recurrence of many opposing thoughts. Wherefore
God's grace is more astonishing, which kept him peaceful and calm in the midst
of so many cares, so that, in expectation of the unknown time, he should be
content with his mean and humble lot, and stand in daily preparation to perform
the part of a deliverer. As to the word

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f32</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
yal</i>,<i> </i>the Jews themselves are not agreed: many think that it merely
expresses consent; others take it to mean "to<i> </i>swear." And perhaps
<i>Bethuel </i>was unwilling to give his daughter to an unknown guest, unless he
bound himself by an oath to live there, as otherwise it might be feared that
Moses might take away his wife elsewhere. Thus the marriage-vow was a promise to
remain. Thence we see the integrity of that age, that the sanction of an oath,
through reverence to the name of God, was so strong, that both were contented
with this bond.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He called his name
Gershom.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I do not approve of their view
who think this was a name of congratulation to alleviate the pain of banishment,
but rather imagine that Moses gave this name to his son, as well to remind
himself as his father-in-law and his wife, that he sought a country elsewhere,
and that there he was but a sojourner. Nor is there any objection in his promise
to his father-in-law to remain, because he did not so bind himself as to shake
off or break the yoke of his divine vocation. It was only a provision to this
effect, that Moses should not lightly forsake the home where he was so kindly
welcomed. It is not credible that he was silent as to the cause of his exile: in
the first place, to avert the suspicion of wrong-doing, and in witness of his
innocence; and secondly, that he might proclaim the peculiar favor with which
God had honored the people of Israel. Wherefore, in the name of his son, he
would set before himself an unceasing memorial, by which he might be kept, alive
to the hope of redemption; for he declares that land, in which he had found
apparently a peaceful resting-place, and a pleasant home, to be "strange"<i>
</i>to him. Nor does he compare Midian with Egypt, for he was but a sojourner in
either land; but wherever he may dwell, he declares himself a stranger, until he
should obtain the inheritance which God has promised. And, indeed, it would have
been absurd to call that land, where he had found a settled home, a foreign
land, in reference to Egypt, especially since the Apostle bears testimony that
he had left that land under the influence of faith.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581127&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews

time of testifying his faith, when he professed that he was a sojourner in a
foreign land.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

He uses the demonstrative pronoun to mark the forty years in which God kept his
servant in suspense, as if he had forsaken him. By adding "many,"<i> </i>he
expresses the approaching end of the interval. When, therefore, he had reached
his eightieth year, and had married and grown old in the land of Midian, the
intolerable cruelty of their tyrannical masters extorted new sighings and cries
from the children of Israel; not that they began then first to grieve and
lament, but because they became more alive to their woes, and their duration
made them to be felt more acutely. We know that the hope of a happier issue is
soothing to our woes; and the hope that some one more kind would succeed the
dead tyrant, in some measure softened the misery of the afflicted people. But
when the change of kings in no wise lightened their oppression, their sorrow was
increased, and forced them to cry out more loudly than before. Thus, then, I
understand the words of Moses, that when the tyrant was dead, the children of
Israel were not treated more humanely, and therefore cried out more vehemently.
Although it is not likely, I think, that the Pharaoh who had at first afflicted
them with burdens and taxes, and had commanded their children to be killed,
lived till this time; because in that case he would have reigned more than
eighty years, which is not usual. Before the birth of Moses, the Israelites had
already been sorely oppressed for many years. Nor had (the king) proceeded at
once to so great an atrocity as to command all the males to be killed; but when
he found that his cruel edicts availed nothing, he advanced to this extremity.
From the birth of Moses until the time here spoken of, about eighty years had
passed; and hence we may suppose that, before their deliverance drew near, there
had been one or more successive kings. When these various changes of
circumstances left the condition of the people unchanged, or even made it worse,
extreme necessity drew forth this unwonted lamentation, and despair itself drove
them to pray, not that there had been an entire neglect of supplication to God
before, but because they looked also in other directions, until all earthly
means being entirely cut off, they were forcibly drawn to seek in earnest for
help from above. From this example we learn that, although the pressure of our
tribulations weighs us down with sorrow and pain, yet that our prayers are not
straightway directed to God, and that much is required to stimulate our sluggish
hearts. Moses also infers that it was no wonder if God's assistance was not
earlier afforded, since the children of Israel were stupified in their misery.
Let this example, then, teach us to flee to God at once, in order that he may
make haste to bestow his
grace.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And their cry came
up.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses magnifies the mercy of God by
this circumstance, that he took not vengeance on their slowness, as it deserved,
but graciously inclined to their tardy cries. In fact, we may observe in this
history what is described in Psalm 106, that the most stubborn and hard-hearted
in their extremity turn their prayers at length to God, rather from the
exceeding greatness of their trouble than from the well-regulated exercise of
faith. He says, "by reason of the bondage;" because it is the attribute of God
to succor the oppressed, to deliver the captives, and to raise up them that are
brought low; and this office he constantly performs. As to what is added, that
"God remembered his covenant," it is the explanation of the cause why he heard
their groaning, viz., that he might ratify his gratuitous promise made to
Abraham and his descendants. He expressly mentions the three patriarchs, because
God lodged his covenant with them, that it might continue firm for perpetual
generations. And, indeed, since God is inclined towards us to help us of his own
free mercy, so he offers himself, and invites us voluntarily; and therefore
confidence in prayer must only be sought for in his promises. Thus the <i>copula
</i>here should be resolved into the <i>illative particle</i>,<i> </i>that "God
heard their groaning, <i>because </i>he remembered his covenant." How far
remembrance is possible with God, we must learn from its contrary. God is said
to forget when he does not really and openly appear, and stretch forth his hand
to help; therefore, when we say he "remembers," we mark our <i>apprehension
</i>of his aid; and both expressions have relation to effect. In the same way he
is said "to behold," and its opposite, "to<i> </i>turn his back," because we
then <i>perceive </i>that he beholds us when he actually succours
us.</font><br><br></div>

occupied as a shepherd for a long time (viz., about forty years) before this
vision appeared to him. The patience, then, of the holy man is commended by his
continuance in this work; not that Moses had any intention of boastfully
celebrating his own virtues, but that the Holy Spirit dictated what would be
useful to us, and, as it were, suggested it to his mouth, that what he did and
suffered might be an example for ever. For he must have had much mental struggle
at this tedious delay, when old age, which weakens the body, came on, since even
in those days few retained their activity after their eightieth year; and
although he might have lived frugally, yet temperance<i> </i>could not protect
even the most robust body against so many hardships, because it is given to very
few persons to be able thus to live in the open air, and to bear heat, and cold,
and hunger, constant fatigue, the care of cattle, and other troubles. God,
indeed, miraculously supported the holy man in the performance of his arduous
duties; but still the internal conflict must have gone on, &#8212; why does God
so long delay and suspend what he so long ago determined? It was, then, no
ordinary virtue which overcame these distracting assaults, which were constantly
renewing his anxiety; whilst, in the mean time, he was living poorly, in huts
and sheds, as well as often wandering over rough and desert places, though from
childhood to mature manhood he had been accustomed to luxury; as he here
relates, that, having led his flock across the Desert, he came to Horeb, which
certainly could not have been effected without his experiencing the cold as he
lay on the ground by night, and burning heat by day. The title of "the<i>
</i>mountain of God" refers 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f35</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
by anticipation to a future period, when the place was consecrated by the
promulgation of the Law there. It is well known that Horeb is the same mountain
which is also called Sinai, except that a different name is given to its
opposite sides, and, properly speaking, its eastern side is called Sinai, its
western, Horeb. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f36</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Since, then, God appeared there and gave so many manifest signs of his heavenly
glory, when he renewed his covenant with his people, and furnished them with a
rule of perfect holiness, the place became invested with peculiar
dignity.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Angel of the Lord
appeared unto him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was necessary that
he should assume a visible form, that he might be seen by Moses, not as he was
in his essence, but as the infirmity of the human mind could comprehend him. For
thus we must believe that God, as often as he appeared of old to the holy
patriarchs, descended in some way from his majesty, that he might reveal himself
as far as was useful, and as far as their comprehension would admit. The same,
too, is to be said of angels, who, although they are invisible spirits, yet when
it seemed good to the Almighty, assumed some form in which they might be seen.
But let us inquire who this Angel was? since soon afterwards he not only calls
himself Jehovah, but claims the glory of the eternal and only God. Now, although
this is an allowable manner of speaking, because the angels transfer to
themselves the person and titles of God, when they are performing the
commissions entrusted to them by him; and although it is plain from many
passages, and 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f37</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
especially from the first chapter of Zechariah, that there is one head and chief
of the angels who commands the others, the ancient teachers of the Church have
rightly understood that the Eternal Son of God is so called in respect to his
office as Mediator, which he figuratively bore from the beginning, although he
really took it upon him only at his Incarnation. And Paul sufficiently expounds
this mystery to us, when he plainly asserts that Christ was the leader of his
people in the Desert.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:4.) Therefore, although at that time, properly speaking, he was
not yet the messenger of his Father, still his predestinated appointment to the
office even then had this effect, that he manifested himself to the patriarchs,
and was known in this character. Nor, indeed, had the saints ever any
communication with God except through the promised Mediator. It is not then to
be wondered at, if the Eternal Word of God, of one Godhead and essence with the
Father, assumed the name of "the Angel" on the ground of his future mission.
There is a great variety of opinions as to the vision. It is too forced an
allegory to make, as some do, the body of Christ of the bush, because his
heavenly majesty consumed it not when he chose to inhabit it. It is also
improperly wrested by those who refer it to the stubborn spirit of the nation,
because the Israelites were like thorns, which yield not to the flames. But when
the natural sense is set forth, it will not be necessary to refute those which
are improbable. This vision is very similar to that former one which Abraham
saw.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011517&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
15:17.) He saw a burning lamp in the midst of a smoking furnace; and the reason
assigned is, that God will not permit his people to be extinguished in darkness.
The same similitude answers to the bush retaining its entireness in the midst of
the flame. The bush is likened to the humble and despised people; their
tyrannical oppression is not unlike the fire which would have consumed them, had
not God miraculously interposed. Thus, by the presence of God, the bush escaped
safely from the fire; as it is said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;194601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
46:1, that though the waves of trouble beat against the Church and threaten her
destruction, yet "shall<i> </i>she not be moved," for "God<i> </i>is in the
midst of her." Thus was the cruelly afflicted people aptly represented, who,
though surrounded by flames, and feeling their heat, yet remained unconsumed,
because they were guarded by the present help of
God.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses said, I will now
turn aside.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is certain that his mind
was disposed to reverence from no rashness, but by divine inspiration. Although
not yet accustomed to visions, he still perceives that, this is no unmeaning
spectacle, but that some mystery was contained in it, which he must by no means
neglect, and to the knowledge of which he was divinely called. In this, too, we
must observe his tractableness, in turning aside to learn. For it often happens
that God presents himself to us in vain, because we presumptuously reject such
great mercy. Let us learn, then, by the example of Moses, as often as God
invites us to himself by any sign, to give diligent heed, lest the proffered
light be quenched by our own apathy. But from his calling it a "great sight," we
gather that he was taught by secret inspiration the depth of the mystery, though
it was as yet unknown. In this way God prepared his mind to reverence, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f38</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that he might the sooner profit by
it.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God called unto him out of
the midst of the bush.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In the first
place, my readers will observe that, as is the case in almost all visions, it
was not a voiceless spectacle to alarm the holy man, but that instruction
accompanied it by which his mind might obtain encouragement. For there would be
no use in visions, if the senses of those who see them were kept in alarm. But
although God was unwilling to terrify his servant, yet, in two ways, he claims
authority and reverence for his intended address; first, by calling Moses twice
by name, he makes his way into the depths of his heart, that, as if cited before
the tribunal of God, he may be more attentive in listening; and, again, by
commanding him to put off his shoes, he prepares him to humility, by admiration
and fear. There is much discussion with respect to the latter clause amongst
many, who delight in allegory. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f39</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I will not recite their various opinions, because a simple exposition of the
true meaning will dispose of the whole of their subtle triflings. Moses is
commanded to put off his shoes, that by the very bareness of his feet his mind
might be disposed to reverential feelings; and on this account, too, he is
reminded of the holiness of the ground, because, in our prayers, the bending of
the knees, and the uncovering of the head, are helps and excitements to the
worship of God. And this, I think, is made sufficiently clear by the reason
which is immediately added, that the place on which Moses stood was "holy
ground," and, therefore, not rashly, or in a profane manner to be trodden on.
Whence we gather, that he was instructed by the outward sign of adoration to
enter into the presence of God as a trembling suppliant. He had, indeed, said,
"Here am I," (which was a testimony that his mind was teachable, and prepared to
obey,) yet it was good that he should be more actively aroused, in order that he
might come before God with greater fear. But if this most noble Prophet of God
had need of such a preparation, no wonder that God stirs up our unwilling
hearts, by many aids, in order that we may worship him in truth. And although
the same command is not given to all which was given to Moses, still let us
learn, that this is the object of all ceremonies, that the majesty of God, being
duly and seriously perceived in our minds, may obtain its rightful honor, and
that he may be regarded in accordance with his dignity. If any prefer the deeper
meaning (<i>anagoge</i>,)<i> </i>that God cannot be heard until we have put off
our earthly thoughts, I object not to it; only let the natural sense stand
first, that Moses was commanded to put off his shoes, as a preparation to listen
with greater reverence to God. If the question be now raised as to the holiness
of the place, the reply is easy, that it received this honorable title on
account of the vision. Mount Sinai did not, therefore, naturally possess any
peculiar sanctity; but because God, who sanctifies all things, deigned to give
there the sign of his presence. Thus Bethel was dignified by Jacob with high and
honorable titles.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012817&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
28:17.)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"How<i> </i>dreadful is
this place! this is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of
heaven;"</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">because it had been consecrated by a special
revelation. For, wherever we see any sign of the glory of God, piety awakens
this feeling of admiration in our hearts. In the meantime, however, since we are
too prone to superstition, these two errors must be avoided; lest, in our gross
imaginations, we should, as it were, draw down God from heaven, and affix him to
places on earth; and, also, lest we should account that sanctity perpetual which
is only temporary. The remedy of the first evil is to reflect on the nature of
God; of the second, to observe his design, how far, and for what use he
sanctifies places. For since the nature of God is spiritual, it is not allowable
to imagine respecting him anything earthly or gross; nor does his immensity
permit of his being confined to place. Again, the sanctity of a place must be
restricted to the object of the manifestation. Thus Mount Horeb was made holy in
reference to the promulgation of the law, which prescribes the true worship of
God. If the descendants of Jacob had considered this, they would never have set
up Bethel as a holy place in opposition to Sion; because,<i> </i>although God
once appeared there to the patriarch, He had never chosen that place; therefore
they were wrong in proceeding from a particular instance to a general
conclusion.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

himself as some heavenly power, nor claim for himself only the general name of
God, but recalling to memory his covenant formerly made with the patriarchs, he
casts down all idols and false gods, and confirms Moses in the true faith. For
hence he knew surely, that he had not set his hopes in vain in the God whom
Abraham and the other patriarchs had worshipped, and who, by the privilege of
adoption, had separated their race from all other nations. And lest, through the
long lapse of time, Moses might think that what had been handed down concerning
Abraham was obsolete, He expressly asserts that His faithfulness still held
good, by calling Himself "the God of his father." But since, in setting forth
the hope of redemption, He renews the memory of His covenant, we gather that it
was not obliterated from the heart of Moses; because it would have been absurd
so to speak of a thing unknown; nor would it have been of any use to make
mention of promises of which no recollection existed in the heart of Moses.
Since, therefore, the hope of the redemption of the chosen people depended on
the covenant which God had formerly made with the patriarchs, He shews that He
had not been trusted to in vain, because His engagement would not be
ineffectual. It was not so much a sign of reverence as of terror that Moses
covered his face; yet must we take both feelings into account, that he felt
sudden alarm at the sight of God, and voluntarily adored his majesty. It was
necessary that his mind should be affected, and impressed with reverential
feelings, that he might be more ready to obey. We read in Isaiah,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
6:2,) that even the angels veil their faces, because they cannot bear the
infinite glory of God; no wonder then that a mortal man dared not to look upon
him. The name of God is appropriated to the visible appearance in which his
majesty was
concealed.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And the Lord said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Before he delegates
to Moses the office of delivering his people, God encourages him in a somewhat
lengthened address to the hope of victory and success; for we know how doubts
enfeeble and hold back the mind with anxiety and care; Moses then could not
engage in or set about his work earnestly until furnished with the confidence of
divine assistance. Therefore God promises to be his guide, that in reliance upon
such aid he may gird himself boldly to the warfare. From hence we may gather
this general doctrine &#8212; that, however slow and unwilling we may naturally
be to obey God, we must not turn away from any command when he assures us of
success, because no stimulus can be stronger than the promise that his hand
shall be always ready to help us when we follow whither he calls us. With this
object God thus speaks before he makes mention of the vocation of Moses, that he
may more cheerfully enter upon his work, in the assurance of a successful issue.
Moreover, when God has founded the redemption of his people upon his gratuitous
covenant, and therefore on his own free bounty, he adds another argument derived
from his justice, namely, that it is impossible for the judge of the world not
to help the oppressed and afflicted when they are undeservedly mistreated, and
especially when they implore his assistance. This is true generally, that God
will be the avenger of all unjust cruelty; but his special aid may be expected
by believers whom he has taken into his friendship and protection. Accordingly,
when he has declared that he has been moved by his adoption of this people not
to desert it in its extreme necessity, he adds, in confirmation, that he has
come to restrain their oppressors' tyranny, since he has heard the cry of the
afflicted. This was said at that particular time to encourage Moses; but it
ought to afford no common consolation in the troubles of us all when we are
groaning under any unjust burden; for God, whose sight was then so clear, is not
now so blind as not to see all injustice, and to pity them that call upon him.
Although the expression here used in the original, "seeing I have seen," is a
Hebraism, still it signifies that, while God delays and suspends punishment, his
winking at men's evil deeds is no proof that he does not behold them from
heaven, and will in due time appear as their judge, for the words denote a
continued observation &#8212; as much as to say, that even then he was beholding
them, when by his quiescence he might have seemed to neglect the tribulation of
his people. By adding that he had heard their cry, he indirectly rebukes their
lukewarmness, since we do not read that they cried until compelled by their
extremity and despair. Therefore there is no cause for wonder that they almost
wasted away under their misfortunes before succor came, because their prayers
were scarcely offered 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f41</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
after a long time. And not even then is it probable (as I said before) that they
prayed earnestly; but God had more respect to his mercy and faithfulness than to
their right and well-grounded preparedness. In these words the Spirit exhorts us
to call upon God, and not to be stunned and stupified by our cares and sorrows,
but to learn to fly straightway to this sacred anchor; as the Psalmist also
says, "The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto
their cry,"<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
34:15,) and as he testifies in another place,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;196502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
65:2,) that he is a God that heareth prayer; thus does he anxiously invite us to
this remedy whenever we are hard pressed. When he speaks of them as his
"people<i> </i>which are in Egypt," the apparent inconsistency does not a little
tend to confirmation, implying that the promise which he made to Abraham with
regard to inheriting the land of Canaan would not be without effect; for it
would not accord with the truth of God that a people to whom an inheritance
elsewhere was given should sojourn in Egypt, unless it was to be freed in the
appointed season. It might also be understood <i>adversatively &#8212;
</i>although<i> </i>a people dwelling in Egypt be far from the land of Canaan,
and so might seem in a manner to be put away from me, still have I heard their
cry. But the probable meaning is, that because it was not fit that a people
which was to inherit the Holy Land should always remain sojourning elsewhere,
therefore God would shortly deliver them. In the end of the verse the repetition
in other words, "I know their sorrows," is also an amplification of what came
before.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I am come down to deliver
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now more clearly announces his
intention not only to relieve their present calamity, but to fulfill the promise
given to Abraham as to the possession of Canaan. He therefore marks the end of
their deliverance, that they might enjoy the rest and inheritance promised to
them. It is a common manner of speaking to say, God descends to us, when he
actually puts forth his power and shews that he is near us; as much as to say,
that the Israelites would experience plainly that his help was at hand. The
"large" land seems to be brought in comparison with the straits in which they
now were; for although the land of Goshen was fertile and convenient, still it
scarcely afforded room enough for their increasing multitude; besides, there
they were kept shut in like slaves in a house of bondage. Finally, he again
assures them that he would deal graciously with them, because he had heard their
cry, and was not ignorant of their sorrows, although he might have long delayed
to avenge them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

</i></font><font face="Palatino">After God had furnished his servant with
promises to engage him more cheerfully in his work, he now adds commands, and
calls him to undertake the office to which he is designed. And this is the best
encouragement to duty, when God renders those, who would be otherwise slow
through doubt, sure of good success; for although we must obey God's plain
commands without delay or hesitation, still he is willing to provide against our
sluggishness by promising that our endeavors shall not be vain or useless. And
certainly it is a feeling naturally implanted in us all, that we are excited
into action by a confidence of good success; therefore although God sometimes,
for the purpose of trying the obedience of his servants, deprives them of hope,
and commands them peremptorily to do this or that, still he more often cuts off
hesitation by promising a successful issue. Thus, then, he now aroused Moses to
perform his commands by setting the hope of the deliverance before him. The
<i>copula </i>must be resolved into the <i>illative particle</i>,<i> </i>because
the command and vocation undoubtedly depend upon the
promise.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who am
I?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He cannot yet be accused of
disobedience, because, conscious of his own weakness, he answers that he is not
sufficient for it, and therefore refuses the commission. His comparison of
himself with Pharaoh was an additional pretext for declining it. This, then,
seems to be the excuse of modesty and humility; and as such, I conceive it not
only to be free from blame, but worthy of praise. It is no contradiction to this
that he knew God to be the proposer of this very arduous task, for he wonders
that some one else was not rather chosen, since God has so many thousands of
beings at command. But another question arises, why he, who forty years ago had
been so forward in killing the Egyptian, and, relying on the vocation of God,
had dared to perform so perilous a deed, should now timidly deny his sufficiency
for the deliverance of the people? It does not seem probable that his rigor had
decreased from age; though youth is naturally ardent, and age induces coldness
and supineness: but it appears that his fault was of another kind, viz., that he
advanced hastily at first, not having sufficiently considered his own powers,
nor weighed the greatness of his undertaking. For although such precipitation
may be praiseworthy, still it often fails in the middle of its course; just as
precocious fruits either never arrive at maturity, or soon perish. Therefore,
although Moses afforded an example of a noble disposition, when he so hastily
devoted himself to God's work; yet was he not then provided with that firmness
which would support him to the end, because the faith, which prevailed in his
heart, had not yet struck its roots deeply enough, nor had he thoroughly
examined his own capability. Therefore does he tremble when he is brought to the
point, though he had been more confident when its difficulty was as yet
unconsidered. So daily do we, who appear to ourselves of good courage 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f42</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
when out of the reach of darts, begin to quake as the battle comes near us;
because we perceive the dangers which did not affect us at a distance. No
wonder, then, if Moses, who had been ready to obey forty years ago, and who had
perseveringly cherished in himself this holy feeling, is filled with new alarm,
when he is commanded to enter on the field of
battle.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And he said, Certainly I will be with thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>It is remarkable that God sets his ready help alone against all to overcome
every fear, and to take away every scruple; as much as to say, It matters not
who Moses is, or what may be his strength, so that God be his leader. In these
words we are taught, that he is never regarded by us with due honor, unless
when, contented with his assistance alone, we seek for no ground of confidence
apart from him; and, although our own weakness may alarm us, think it enough
that he is on our side. Hence these celebrated confessions of his
saints:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore, in proportion to our advancement in the
faith, when we are exposed to the greatest dangers, do we magnify the power of
God, and, exalting ourselves in that, advance boldly against all the world; and
this is the ground of firm and unwearied obedience, when the thought that God is
with us is deeply rooted in our hearts. But, after Moses is commanded to turn
away his reflections from himself, and to fix all his regards upon the promised
help of God, he is confirmed by a sign, that the Israelites should sacrifice on
Mount Horeb three days after their departure from Egypt. Still this promise
appears neither very apt nor opportune, since it would not exist in effect till
the thing was done. I pass over the forced interpretations, which some, to avoid
this absurdity, have adduced; since others wisely and prudently observe, that
the confirmation which we receive from posterior tokens, is neither useless nor
vain, and that there are examples of it elsewhere in Scripture. Samuel, by
anointing David, promises that he shall be king of the people; and pronounces
that this shall be the sign that the anointing is from God.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;091613&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 16:13.) David had long to battle with misfortunes before he could enjoy
this token, yet will it not be thought superfluous, since in its season it
confirmed the favor of God. Isaiah, prophesying of the raising of the siege of
the city, adds a sign,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Ye shall
eat this year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which
springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye and reap, and plant
vineyards, and eat the fruit
thereof."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233730&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah

<div><font face="Palatino">Yet, before he beheld that sign, he already knew that
Christ was the Son of God; for the prophecies of both his parents were well
known to him. But there is nothing absurd in the faith, which is founded on the
word, being increased by the addition of a sign. In fine, God magnifies his
mercy by the new mercy which supervenes, thus, as it were, heaping up the
measure; and, in truth, the vocation of Moses was ratified by a remarkable
proof, when, in the very place on which he then stood, the people, brought forth
by his instrumentality, offered a solemn sacrifice. In the meantime God kept his
servant in suspense, as though he had said, Let me perform what I have decreed;
in due time you will know that your were not sent by me in vain, when you have
brought the people safely to this
spot.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, when I come to the
children of Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>If we believe that
Moses spoke his own sentiments here, he would say, that he could not be the
messenger of an unknown God; which seems highly improbable. For who can think
that the faith of the holy Prophet was so obliterated, that he was forgetful of
the true God, whom he had devoutly served? Whereas, in the name of his elder
son, he had borne witness to his solemn recollection of Him, when he voluntarily
professed himself a stranger in the land of Midian. Nor does it appear at all
more suitable to the children of Israel, in whose mouths the covenant made with
their fathers constantly was. It will not, however, be far from the truth, if we
suppose that the faith both of Moses and the Israelites had grown somewhat faint
and rusty. He himself, with his father-in-law, was altogether without the
instruction which would retain him in that peculiar worship, and in that
knowledge, which he had imbibed in Egypt; and the whole people had departed far
away from the course of their fathers; for although the brightness of the true
and ancient religion was not entirely gone, still it only shone in small sparks.
But whilst Moses tacitly confesses his ignorance, because he was not
sufficiently familiar with the doctrine handed down from the holy patriarchs,
yet because he was about to present himself to the people as a stranger, he
infers that he shall be rejected, unless he brings with him some watchword which
will be acknowledged. "I will declare that which thou commandest, (he seems to
say,) that I am sent by the God of our fathers; but they will deride and despise
my mission, unless I shall present some surer token, from whence they may learn
that I have not falsely made use of thy name." He therefore seeks for a name
which may be a distinguishing mark; since it is not a mere word or syllable
which is here in question, but a testimony, by which he may persuade the
Israelites that they are heard on the score of the covenant with their
fathers.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am that I am.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">The verb in the Hebrew is in the future tense,
"I<i> </i>will be what I will be;" but it is of the same force as the present,
except that it designates the perpetual duration of time. This is very plain,
that God attributes to himself alone divine glory, because he is self-existent
and therefore eternal; and thus gives being and existence to every creature. Nor
does he predicate of himself anything common, or shared by others; but he claims
for himself eternity as peculiar to God alone, in order that he may be honored
according to his dignity. Therefore, immediately afterwards, contrary to
grammatical usage, he used the same verb in the first person as a substantive,
annexing it to a verb in the third person; that our minds may be filled with
admiration as often as his incomprehensible essence is mentioned. But although
philosophers discourse in grand terms of this eternity, and Plato constantly
affirms that God is peculiarly
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">to&lt;
o]n</font><font face="Palatino"> (the Being); yet they do not wisely and
properly apply this title, viz., that this one and only Being of God absorbs all
imaginable essences; and that, thence, at the same time, the chief power and
government of all things belong to him. For from whence come the multitude of
false gods, but from impiously tearing the divided Deity into pieces by foolish
imaginations? Wherefore, in order rightly to apprehend the one God, we must
first know, that all things in heaven and earth derive 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f43</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
at His will their essence, or subsistence from One, who only truly is. From this
Being all power is derived; because, if God sustains all things by his
excellency, he governs them also at his will. And how would it have profited
Moses to gaze upon the secret essence of God, as if it were shut up in heaven,
unless, being assured of his omnipotence, he had obtained from thence the
buckler of his confidence? Therefore God teaches him that He alone is worthy of
the most holy name, which is profaned when improperly transferred to others; and
then sets forth his inestimable excellency, that Moses may have no doubt of
overcoming all things under his guidance. We will consider in the sixth chapter
the name of Jehovah, of which this is the
root.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

honey.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And God said moreover.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">God again assumes his name taken from the
covenant which he had made with Abraham and his posterity, that the Israelites
may know that they do not deceive themselves in an uncertain God, provided they
depart not from the religion of their fathers; for as soldiers assemble round
their standard to maintain the order of their ranks, so does he command them to
look back upon the special grace of their adoption, and to know that they are a
people elected of God, because they are Abraham's sons. He confines them within
these limits, that they may not wander about in search of God. For we know that
whatever opinions were held by the Gentiles as to the Deity, were not only
entangled with many errors, but were also ambiguous, so that they were always
wavering with respect to them. God demands another kind of religion from his
people, on the certainty of which their hearts may depend. Besides, their long
sojourn in the land of Egypt, although it had not destroyed the knowledge of the
true God, had yet much obscured that light of revelation which their fathers
possessed. And again, the promise might seem to be obsolete, when they had
received no assistance, whilst overwhelmed in such an abyss of misery; and on
this ground the faith received from their fathers had undoubtedly grown cold.
Wherefore, that they may learn to repose upon it, he calls himself the God of
their fathers, and declares, that by this title he will be celebrated for ever;
for I cannot consent to refer this to the previous expression, "I am that I
am,"<i> </i>since the context does not admit of it. Hence might be inferred the
incomparable love of God towards his chosen people, because he had passed over
all the nations of the earth, and had attached himself to them alone. But we
must remember, that although it was honorable to Abraham and the patriarchs for
God to take his name from them, yet that the main object of this was to confirm
the truth of his promise. There may be an apparent incongruity in saying, "this
is my memorial unto all generations," because a much more excellent memorial
succeeded in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ; but my reply is, that since,
in the coming of Christ, the truth of the covenant made with Abraham was shewn
forth, and was thus demonstrated to be firm and infallible, its memory was
rather renewed than destroyed; and that thus it still survives and flourishes in
the Gospel, since Abraham even now ceases not to be the father of the faithful,
under the one Head. We conclude that God would not be spoken of on earth,
without the effects of his gratuitous adoption appearing, by which he may be
proved to be faithful and
true.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go and
gather.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Because it was not easy either
to gather the whole people into one place, or for his commission to be heard by
so great a multitude, Moses is commanded to begin with the elders, and to speak
to them concerning their coming deliverance, that they may thus by their
authority arouse the body of the people to a good hope. For their dismissal must
be sought for from the king in the name of all, and all their minds prepared for
departure; since, unless they had timely notice of it, there would have been no
general consent to embrace the mercy of God. It was then of great importance
that the vocation of Moses should be well known, that they might boldly follow
him as the leader set over them by God. He does not express without a purpose,
that the God who had been seen by him, was the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob;
for the vision, which would have been otherwise hardly credited by the people,
depended on the ancient covenant which was deposited with them. Therefore, in
order to obtain belief for his words, Moses reminds them that the deliverance,
of which he was now about to treat, and of which he is appointed by God as the
leader, was formerly promised in Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Lastly, because we
usually receive with difficulty what is new and strange, Moses therefore lays
his foundation on the old revelations, which were beyond the reach of doubt. But
he repeats what he had before related to be said to himself, thus setting before
the others what he had privately heard to assure him of his vocation. We know
that when God does not immediately succour us in our adversities, our minds are
worn down with grief, and sink into despair; because we think that God has no
care for us. Lest, therefore, the minds of the Israelites should despond, Moses
is commanded to tell them that it is God's time for remembering them; and,
although he might seem not to behold for a while, yet that he would not for ever
forget his own people. What follows, that the injuries done to them by the
Egyptians had come into account, is added in confirmation; for, since he is
judge of the world, he cannot but rise as an avenger after long endurance of
injustice and tyranny. Let us, too, learn from this passage, when God seems to
turn away his face from us, by delaying to help us, to wait patiently until he
looks upon us in due season; since his forgetfulness is only temporary, when he
gives us over to the will of our enemies. I have shewn elsewhere how these
phrases are to be understood, viz., that according to the estimate of our own
senses, things are attributed to God which do not properly belong to
him.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I have
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this expression God reminds us
that he in his secret counsel determines what he will do, and therefore that we
must put a restraint on our desires, which otherwise press forward too fast, and
let him freely and voluntarily appoint what he knows to be best to be done; not
because he has need of taking time to deliberate, but that we may learn to
depend on his providence. By this decree the children of Israel were assured
that the end of their woes was near, because there is nothing which can prevent
God from performing his work. But he speaks briefly, as of a thing well known;
because what had been handed down through the patriarchs, as to their future
deliverance, was not entirely forgotten. He enumerates several nations whose
lands He would give them, that he might thus the more attract them to come
forth. With the same object he affirms that the whole country flows "with milk
and honey," lest its barrenness should alarm them, because famine had driven
their fathers out from thence. But although the land of Canaan was naturally
fertile, there is no doubt but that its fruitfulness chiefly arose from the
blessing of God. The conclusion is, that a spacious dwelling-place is prepared
for them, since for their sake God will drive out many nations, that they may
possess the habitations of them all; and that, finally, they need not fear want,
because God will abundantly supply them with food, as if the whole of that land
were filled with rivers of milk and
honey.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

</i>The literal translation is, "They shall hearken to thy voice," which many
take to be a promise from God that they should be obedient; but the sense given
in the Latin, "after<i> </i>they shall have heard thy voice," seems more
consonant, that first of all He should command them by the mouth of Moses, and
that then they should accompany him in bearing the message to Pharaoh. For,
before so difficult an undertaking was enjoined to them, it was desirable that
the authority of God should be propounded to them, so that they might go about
it with unwavering hearts. The sum of the message is, that they should seek
permission from Pharaoh to go and sacrifice; but lest they might be thought to
do so from mere unfounded impulse, they are desired to premise that God had met
with them and had given them the command. For the word which expresses his
<i>meeting </i>with them, means that he presented himself voluntarily. They had
indeed cried out before, and often appealed to the faithfulness and mercy of
God; yet still this was a voluntary meeting with them, when, contrary to the
hope of them all, he avowed that he would be their deliverer, for, as we have
already said, they cried out more from the urgency of their affliction than from
confidence in prayer. A pretext is suggested to them, by which suspicion and
anger may be turned away from themselves; for a free permission to depart
altogether, by which grievous loss would have arisen to the tyrant, never would
have been accorded. Besides, by refusing so equitable a demand, he despoiled
himself of his royal right and power, since he thus withheld His due honour from
the King of kings; for although the Israelites were under his dominion, yet did
not his rule extend so far as to defraud God of his rightful worship. It was
expedient, too, that the people should depart without the king's permission only
for very good reasons, lest hereafter license of rebellion should be given to
other subjects. Pharaoh indeed suspected differently, that the sacrifice was a
mere false pretense; but since this mistrust proceeded from his tyranny, his
ingratitude was sufficiently proclaimed by it, because through his own evil
conscience he forbade that God should be served. Whatever, again, might be his
feelings, still the miracles by which the command was followed must needs have
taught him that their mission proceeded from God. If the Israelites had merely
spoken, and no confirmation of their words had been given, he might perhaps have
naturally guarded himself against deception; but when God openly shewed that he
was the originator of this departure, and that he commanded the sacrifice beyond
the bounds of Egypt, all grounds of excuse are taken away; and thus the
departure of the people is placed out of the reach of calumny. If any object
that it is alien from the nature of God to countenance any craft or pretense,
the reply is easy, &#8212; that he was bound by no necessity to lay open his
whole counsel to the tyrant. They mistake who suppose that there is a kind of
falsehood implied in these words; for God had no desire that his people should
use any deceit, he only concealed from the tyrant (as He had a perfect right to
do) what He was about ultimately to effect; and in this way He detected and
brought to light his obstinacy. In a word, God entered the lists for the
Israelites, not in an earthly controversy, but for religion, to which all the
rights of kings must give way. But Jehovah calls himself the God of the Hebrews,
that Pharaoh may know him to be the peculiar God of that nation, and that their
form of worship was different from the customs of Egypt, and, in fact,<i>
</i>that he is the only true God, and all others are
fictitious.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I am sure that the king of
Egypt.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God forearms his people, lest,
suffering a repulse at their first onset, they should retire, and abandon in
despair the work enjoined to them. It was, indeed, a hard thing to hear that
their expedition would be vain; and that they might as well address themselves
to the trunk of a tree, since there was no hope<i> </i>of reaching the obstinate
heart of Pharaoh; but they would have been much more discouraged by this trial,
if his stubbornness had been discovered unexpectedly. Therefore God foretells
that their words would avail nothing; but at the same time he announces that he
should succeed by his own wondrous power. If any think it absurd for these
unhappy men to be wearied by their useless labor, and to be repulsed with
ridicule and insult, I answer, that this was for the sake of example, and that
it was advantageous for setting forth God's glory, that the king, having been
civilly applied to, should betray his impious perversity, since nothing could be
more just than that what he had unjustly refused, should be extorted from him
against his will. But interpreters differ as to the meaning of the words. For
some translate it literally from the Hebrew, "no, not by a mighty hand;" as
though God said that the pride of the king would be unconquerable, and not to be
subdued by any power or force; but the context requires a different sense,
because the remedy is afterwards opposed to it, "and<i> </i>I will stretch out
my hand;" and the result is added, that Pharaoh, overcome at length by the
plagues, would let the people go. And this view is grammatically correct; for
the Hebrews use the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">alw</font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f45</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
velo</i>, for "except." Therefore God commands his people to be firm and
confident, although Pharaoh may not immediately obey; because he would evidence
his power 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f46</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in a remarkable manner for their deliverance. In the meantime he arouses them to
hope by the promise of a successful issue; since he will forcibly compel Pharaoh
to yield.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will give this people
favor.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this extreme exercise of His
bounty He encourages the Israelites to contend and strive more heartily; since
otherwise it would be hard for them to struggle with the great cruelty of the
king. Therefore He promises them not only liberty, but also abundance of rich
and precious things. But, inasmuch as this was hard to believe, that the
Egyptians their bitterest enemies would become so kind and liberal as to exert
such beneficence towards them, God reminds them that it is in His power to turn
the hearts of men whithersoever He will. He proclaims, then, that He will cause
these wolves of Egypt to become like lambs, and that they who used to bite and
devour should now supply them with the very wool from their backs. This passage
contains rich and extensive doctrine; that whenever men cruelly rage against us,
it does not happen contrary to the design of God, because He can in a moment
quiet them; and that He grants this license to their cruelty, because it is
expedient thus to humble and chasten us. Again, we gather from hence, that we
have no enemies so fierce and barbarous, as that it is not easy for Him readily
to tame them. If we were surely persuaded of this, that men's hearts are
controlled, and guided by the secret inspiration of God, we should not so
greatly dread their hatred, and threatenings, and terrors, nor should we be so
easily turned from the path of duty through fear of them. This alarm is the just
reward of our unbelief, when we repose not on God's providence; and although we
ought to take pains to conciliate the kindness of all by courtesy, yet should we
remember that our efforts will not gain their favor, unless God should so
incline their hearts.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>

</i>Those who consider these means of enriching the people to be but little in
accordance with the justice of God, themselves reflect but little how widely
that justice of which they speak extends. I acknowledge that it is His attribute
to defend every one's rights, to prohibit theft, to condemn deceit and rapine;
but let us see what every one's property is. Who will boast that he has
anything, except what is given him by God? And all is given on this condition,
that each one should possess according to His will whatever God pleases, who is
free to take away at any moment whatsoever He has given. The Hebrews spoiled the
Egyptians; and should the latter complain that an injury is done them, they
would argue against God that He had transferred His own free gifts from them to
others. Would this complaint be listened to, that God, in whose hands are the
ends of the earth, who by His power appoints the bounds of nations, and reduces
their kings to poverty, had deprived certain persons of their furniture and
jewels? Another defense is set up by some, that the Hebrews took nothing which
was not their own, but only the wages which were due to them; because they<i>
</i>were iniquitously driven to servile labors, and had subsisted meanly upon
what belonged to themselves. And certainly it would have been just that their
labor should have been recompensed in some way. But there is no need of weighing
the judgment of God by ordinary rules, since we have already seen that all the
possessions of the world are His, to distribute them according to His pleasure.
Nevertheless I do not thus suppose Him to be without law; for although His power
is above all laws, still, because His will is the most certain rule of perfect
equity, whatever He does must be perfectly right; and therefore He is free from
laws, because He is a law to Himself, and to all. Neither would I simply say
with Augustin, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f48</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that this was a command of God which should not be canvassed but obeyed, because
He knows that He commands justly, and that his servants must obediently perform
whatever He commands. This indeed is truly said, and yet we must hold fast that
higher principle, that, since whatever people call their own they possess only
by God's bounty, there is no juster title to possession than His gift. We will
not therefore say that the Hebrew women purloined that which God ordered them to
take, and which He chose to bestow upon them; neither will God be accounted
unjust in bestowing nothing but what was His own.

The word which I have translated "<i>hospitem</i>,"<i> </i>or "hostess,"<i>
</i>some understand as a "fellow<i>-</i>sojourner;" and this is not very
important, because we gather from the other word, that the Egyptians were mixed
among the Hebrews. In the end of the verse, because the original expresses,
"ye<i> </i>shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters," almost all
interpreters expound it to mean that they should ornament them; but it seems to
me that it only refers to the abundance of the spoil; as much as to say, you
shall not only obtain as much as you can carry yourselves, but shall also load
your sons and daughters.</font><br><br></div>

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f50</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And hence we may better perceive under what infirmity he labored, so that his
faith was almost stifled. On the one side, he was willing and ready to obey; but
when the arduous difficulties of his task presented themselves, he could not
escape from this conflict until he had exhausted all efforts to escape. Nor
indeed can we greatly wonder that he resisted for a time, since he could see
scarcely any advantage in his undertaking. I admit that he ought to have
proceeded according to God's command, even with his eyes shut, since on His will
alone all believers are bound to depend; he ought not to have judged of a thing
(in itself) incredible, from his own reasoning, but from the voice of God. Nor,
in point of fact, did he either refuse to credit God's words, or wish to reject
the burden imposed upon him; but when, on the other hand, he beheld dangers from
which he could not disentangle himself, his mind was thus a prey to distracting
feelings. Neither is there any believer who is not often drawn into such
harassing discussions, whenever his mind is darkened by the perception of
obstacles. There was, therefore, in the mind of Moses, willingness and zeal,
though alacrity and firmness were wanting; because through his weakness he was
compelled to hold back by the hinderances which presented themselves. We must
carefully distinguish between the timidity which delays our progress and the
bold refusal which is allied to contempt. Many, in flying from trouble, are so
withheld from duty, that they grow hardened in their inactivity; while those who
desire to act rightly, although through anxiety and fear they apparently recoil,
still aspire to ulterior progress, and, in a word, do not so far alternate as to
withdraw themselves altogether from the command of God. Moses seems, indeed, to
murmur, and to enter into altercation with God; but whether this were audacity
or simplicity, there was more of modesty in it, than as if he had hidden himself
in silence, as we have said that many do, who by their silence only strengthen
themselves in the liberty to disobey. This was clearly his object, that he might
afterwards be more fitted to proceed. The holy man was very anxious, because he
knew from experience that his countrymen were depraved, and almost intractable;
disburdening himself, then, of this anxiety into the bosom of God, he desires to
be confirmed by a fresh promise, so that he may be freed from this impediment,
and proceed with alacrity.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What is that in thine
hand?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In accordance with the idiom of
the Hebrew language, Moses now explains more fully, and more distinctly pursues,
what he had before only generally alluded to respecting the signs. In the three
signs which he refers to we must consider their respective <i>meanings</i>.<i>
</i>The pastoral crook, which he carried in his hand, is flung on the ground,
and becomes a serpent; again it is taken back into his hand, and recovers its
original nature. I doubt not but that God wished to shew him, that although his
condition was abject and despicable, still he would be formidable to the king of
Egypt. For his rod was the symbol of a shepherd; and what would be more
contemptible than for a keeper of sheep to come up from the desert, and to
oppose to the scepter of a most powerful king that crook, by which he could
scarcely protect himself and his flock from wild beasts? But God assures him,
that although deprived of earthly splendor, wealth, or power, he would still be
terrible to Pharaoh; as much as to say, that he need not fear lest Pharaoh
should despise him, or take no account of him as a mere rustic, because his rod,
turned into a serpent, would inspire more terror than a thousand swords. As to
what Moses says, that he himself fled from it in alarm, unquestionably God
intended to affright his servant, that he might the better estimate from his own
feelings what would be the power of God to terrify that proud king. This, then,
was the object of the miracle, that there was no occasion for mighty armies,
since Pharaoh would tremble at the sight of the simple rod; and that the rod
need not be wielded and violently agitated, because it would inspire sufficient
terror by its own movement and agitation. The one part of the miracle, where the
rod returned to its former shape, was intended to shew Moses, that what was to
be hostile and injurious to his enemy, would be an assistance and safeguard to
himself. Therefore, the same rod which encouraged<i> </i>and emboldened Moses,
depressed and overwhelmed his foe. But that he dares, in immediate obedience to
the voice of God, to lay hold of the serpent, is a proof of his remarkable
faith; and this appears more manifestly from his sudden change, that he fears
not to provoke a poisonous and noxious animal, by taking hold of its tail, when
he had so lately fled from its very sight in consternation. His timid mind,
then, was capable of great courage, and his timidity and piety brought forth
their fruit alternately. And this is especially worthy of remark, that Moses was
strengthened by the presence of God; but that he was weakened when he turned his
eyes to the untameable minds of his own race, and to the proud tyranny of Egypt.
The question now arises, whether the change of the rod into a serpent was real,
and actual, or whether the outward form only was changed? Although I should be
unwilling to contend pertinaciously for a thing of little consequence, I embrace
that opinion which is more probable, that not merely an image or vision
appeared, but that God, who created all things out of nothing, gave a new nature
to the rod, and again made a rod out of the serpent, which was in no degree more
difficult than to change Lot's wife into a pillar of salt.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011926&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
19:26.) Since this was easy to God's power, it does not appear likely to me that
He had recourse to the illusion of visions. As to the imitation of the
magicians, we will speak of their sorceries in their proper
place.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they may
believe.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This spectacle, then, was not
shewn to Moses once only, but the power was imparted to him also of frequently
repeating the miracle; both to acquire credit from the Israelites, and to
repress the audacity of Pharaoh. For although the sentence is incomplete, there
is no ambiguity in the sense, viz., that Moses is armed with power from heaven
to make his vocation sure, and that none may doubt him to be a Prophet divinely
commissioned. It would be tedious here to dilate expressly on the use of
miracles, suffice it briefly to lay down, that they sometimes serve as
preparatives to faith, sometimes for its confirmation. We see an example of both
in the metamorphosis of the rod, by which Moses was the more animated and
encouraged to gather strength, although he already believed God's promise; but
the Israelites, who were both incredulous and unteachable, were prepared and
compelled to believe. Besides, the miracle opened a door of faith with the
Israelites, that, being persuaded of his prophetical office, they might submit
to be taught; whilst he was himself led on to greater assurance and
perseverance. For although the Almighty begins further back, and refers to the
adoption of the patriarchs, and this was calculated to lay the foundation of
their hope of redemption, it still does not follow that they were prepared to
receive Moses, until the authority of his ministry had been established.
Wherefore, I have said, that their faith was commenced by the
miracle.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Put now thy hand into thy
bosom.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this sign Moses was instructed
that what is in the greatest vigour withers away at once, at the command of God;
and that what is dry is thus restored to its original vigour; in a word, the
statement of Paul was confirmed by it, that God "calleth those things which be
not, as though they were."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:17.) It was, so to say, a kind of leprosy, when Moses was banished from the
court into the land of Midian, where he led his flock through wild and rough
places, among thorns and brambles. After he had passed forty years like one
half-dead, having no dignity or name, he regained, as by a restoration,
(<i>postliminio</i>)<i> </i>what he had lost. Therefore God now promises him
that he would soon restore what He had taken away. This is the simple connection
of the sign with its effect, with which sober readers will be content, without
giving heed to the subtleties of others. For this was particularly needful to be
understood, that all men stand or fall according to God's will; that when
they<i> </i>seem most strong, their strength suddenly fails, and they waste
away; and, again, as soon as God pleases, they return from their deformed and
failing state to rigor and beauty. In this way the holy man learnt that, as he
had lain in obscurity for a time, because he had been withdrawn, by God's hand,
from the society of men, and had been cast into solitude, so he need not despair
of becoming a different man by the same hand. This condition, too, in some
measure, pertained to the whole body of the people; but because it better suits
the person of Moses, it is preferable to retain this exposition; lest, only
considering his present position, as a mean and humble shepherd, he should
distrust his capacity for undertaking his office, and that he should expect
dignity and boldness to be given him by God. Moreover, God did not mean to
instruct Moses individually only, (as we have said,) but to raise him above the
contempt of the people, that the exile by which his dignity had been marred,
should not detract from his influence and authority; but, because the calling of
God shone forth in him like a resurrection, that he should, at the same time, be

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall come to pass, if
they will not believe thee. </i></font><font face="Palatino">In these words God
took away from Moses every handle for doubt; as much as to say, that he was
sufficiently provided and strengthened to overcome the stubbornness of the
people; and yet, heaping up the measure to overflowing, he afterwards added a
third sign, from whence Moses might attain full confidence, and that no further
hinderance should oppose his pious desires. This, too, is a remarkable evidence
of the kindness of God, that he deigned so liberally to add sign to sign, and to
contend with the evil heart of the people, until with a strong hand he drew them
out of their torpor of incredulity. Surely, if they neglected the first miracle,
they were unworthy to have another proof of his power set before them by God. It
was, then, a wonderful exercise of longsuffering still to persevere in arresting
their dullness. With equal clemency does He now overlook our sluggishness of
heart; because, when with far less reverence than we ought we receive the
testimonies whereby He manifests His grace, He avenges not our foul ingratitude,
but rather adds new remedies for the cure of our unbelief. As by the two former
miracles God shewed the power which he willed to exercise by the hand of Moses,
so in this third He taught them what would be His dealings with the Egyptians.
And then, both from within and from without, Moses was confirmed before all the
people. The conclusion is, then, that when God should lift up His hand against
the Egyptians, so far would they be from having strength to resist, that the
very strongholds in which they proudly trusted should be felt to be adverse and
injurious to them. We know how many and various were the advantages they derived
from the Nile. Their land, on one side, was rendered, by its opposing barrier,
safe and invincible; its many ports enriched their nation by their convenience
for the importation and exportation of merchandise; the fertility of their
fields arose from its inundations; in a word, Egypt attributed the chief part of
its prosperity to the Nile. But now God gives warning not only that it should
not profit the Egyptians, but that it was in His power to turn all its
advantages into injuries; nay, that the very stream which used to fertilize
their land by its irrigation, should cover and defile it with blood. With
respect to the words, the "voice<i> </i>of the sign" is figuratively applied to
mean a demonstration of the power of God, by which the Israelites might be
taught that Moses was sent them by God as their deliverer. For although the rod
turned into a serpent could not speak, yet very loudly, indeed, did it announce,
that what the Israelites deemed altogether impossible, would not be difficult to
God. Others thus resolve the particle

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f51</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
"If they will not believe your voice, because of the sign;"<i> </i>but the
former interpretation is more correct. The meaning of the expression, however,
is added soon afterwards, in this distinction &#8212; "If they will not believe
also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice;"<i> </i>as though God had
said, that His power cried out,<i> </i>or thundered in His miracles, to obtain a

escape, so as to force himself from the task imposed on him, not that he desires
to refuse the command, but because he trembles at its importance. It is this
distrust of his own powers which makes him so hesitating and timid. The remedy
was obvious, that he should assure himself, since he well knew that he was
undertaking nothing rashly, that God, whose command he obeyed, would supply him
with ample strength. In this, then, lay the fault, that he did not cast all his
cares on God, and, setting aside his own weakness, hope against hope, like
Abraham, who</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"considered not his
own body now dead; neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb; being fully
persuaded that what God had promised, he was able also to perform."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450418&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
4:18, 19, 21.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">It was an act of modesty in him
to reflect on the defect which he mentioned, if he had but asked for succor from
God; but when he proceeds further, and requests to be altogether discharged, he
does an injustice to God, as if He would lay a greater burden on His servants
than they could bear, or would give any inconsiderate command. This over-anxious
caution is, therefore, deservedly condemned, although it may have some admixture
of virtue; because whatever difficulty we encounter, this ought to be a
sufficient encouragement to us, that as often as God chooses men as His
ministers, although they are in themselves good for nothing, He forms and
prepares them for their work. It is, indeed, lawful to fear in perplexities,
provided that our anxiety overcomes<i> </i>not the desire to obey; but whatever
God enjoins it is never right to refuse on any pretext. Moreover, we see that
the instruments which seem but little suitable are especially employed by Him,
in order that His power may more fully appear. He might, if He had chosen to use
Moses as His ambassador, have made him eloquent from the womb; or, at least,
when He sends him to his work, have corrected his stammering tongue. It seems a
mockery, then, to give a commission of speaking to a stammerer; but in this way,
(as I have said,) He causes His glory to shine forth more brightly, proving that
He can do all things without extrinsic aid. Interpreters vary as to the meaning
of the words. Some think that the clause "since thou hast spoken to thy servant"
is added in amplification, as if the tongue of Moses began to be more slow than
ever since the vision had appeared; but since the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;g</font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f52</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>gam</i>, is thrice repeated, I interpret it simply, that Moses had never been
eloquent from his infancy, and that he was not now endued with any new
eloquence.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Who hath made man's mouth?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here the
cause is expressed, why the hesitation of Moses was worthy of reprehension;
viz., because arrested by his own infirmity, he did not look up to God, who,
being above the want of any human aid, easily accomplishes whatsoever He has
decreed, and subduing all the obstacles which terrify men, obtains in any
direction assistance according to his will. Moses objects his stammering as a
cause for holding back; God replies, that it is He alone who governs the tongue
which He has created; therefore, that if some be tongueless or dumb, and some
quick and eloquent of speech, the difference is all of His good pleasure. Whence
it follows that all nature (as it is called) is subject to his government, so
that He easily finds means of the things that are not; and, on the other hand,
remove far out of the way whatever impediments interpose, and even forces them
into obedience. But He not only asserts his right and power of government in the
general course of nature, but teaches that it is of His special grace alone that
some exceed others in eloquence; and not only so, but that it is in His hand to
make wonderful changes, so as to strike the most eloquent dumb, and to fit the
tongue of the dumb for speaking. And this experience also shews, that sometimes
those who excel in readiness of speech, want words; and, on the contrary, that
the stammering and slow of speech plead a single cause with admirable dexterity,
although the power may be wanting to them in every other case. Since, then, it
is in God's power to bind or to loose men's tongues at any moment, it was wrong
of Moses to hesitate, as if in surprise, because he possessed not natural
freedom of speech; as if it were not possible for the author of nature to remedy
this disadvantage. But while it is good to magnify the immense power of God, in
removing all the hinderances which oppose us, so must we beware of resting upon
it indiscriminately, as though it were subject to our fancies. For we see men,
whilst they too boldly undertake whatever their own lusts suggest, shielding
themselves with this thought, that all means and events are in God's hands, so
that nothing may stand in the way of their impetuosity. But the power of God is
basely profaned by this rashness; and, therefore, this truth is not duly applied
to its legitimate purpose, unless a vocation and command clearly invites us on.
We must, then, mark the connection: Go, where I shall send thee. Am I not
Jehovah, who gives to men speech, and sight, and hearing? the tendency of which
is, that Moses, confidently trusting to the bounty of God, should devote himself
earnestly to his work.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Send, I pray thee, by the

as alluding to Christ, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f53</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as though Moses said, that His power was needed to accomplish so mighty a task,
introduce a forced and far-fetched sense, which is contradicted by the context,
for God would not have been so aroused to anger by such a prayer. I see not why
others should suppose it to be spoken of Aaron; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f54</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for there is no weight in their conjecture, that Moses preferred his brother to
himself. The third sense is more probable, viz., that God should stretch forth
his hand to direct whomsoever he destined for the work. In that case, the
relative must be in the masculine gender; but in order to avoid all ambiguity, I
prefer the feminine, as I have translated it. (<i>Mitte per manum per
quam</i>.)<i> </i>For there is no doubt but that Moses desires the task, too
weighty and difficult for himself, to be transferred to some one else; just as
if he had said &#8212; Since there are multitudes at hand whom thou mayest
employ, choose whomsoever thou wilt of them, provided only it be some other, and
that I be excused. There is an implied antithesis between Moses and others, in
which he hints at his own natural disqualification, and says that others are
endued with dexterity, industry, and activity; and thence he argues that it will
be absurd that God should reject the hands which are adapted and ready for the
work.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the anger of the Lord was
kindled.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This passage confirms, by
opposition, that expression, that there is no better sacrifice than to obey the
voice of the Lord,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;091522&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 15:22,) since God is so grievously offended with the hesitation of Moses,
in spite of his specious excuses. But nothing is more pleasing to God than to
maintain the authority of his word, and that men should suffer themselves to be
guided by this rein. God had pardoned His servant's slowness and unwillingness
to the work; but beholding that he obstinately refused, He spares him no longer.
Hence we are warned cautiously to beware, lest if God bear with us for a time,
we give way to self-indulgence, as if we were permitted to abuse His patience
with impunity. Still it is a mark of His fatherly kindness, that in His anger He
contents Himself with reproof. As to His saying that he knew that Aaron would be
his brother's interpreter, it is questionable whether He had intended from the
beginning to employ him in this way, or whether He conceded thus much at length
to the diffidence of Moses.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is indeed true,
that God does nothing which He has not decreed by His secret providence before
the creation of the world; yet sometimes second causes intervene why this or
that should be done. Either view is probable, &#8212; either that God affirms
Aaron to be already chosen by Him to be an assistant to Moses, or that He says
He will grant this concession to the infirmity of Moses. The latter pleases me
best, that Aaron should be added in anger as his brother's companion, and that
part of the honor should be transferred to him; when Moses, by his own
repugnance, had deprived himself of some of his dignity. But why is he called
"the Levite," as if he were an unknown person? Some reply, that there were many
among the Israelites of that name; but this simple solution satisfies me, that
it was not any indifferent individual of the children of Israel who was promised
to Moses as his companion, but his own brother; one who, by his close
relationship, might exercise greater familiarity with him. Unless, perhaps, God
looked forward to the future calling of the tribe of Levi; for he tells us, by
the mouth of Malachi, that His covenant was with Levi, that his descendants
should be the keepers of the law and of the truth, and the messengers of the
Lord of hosts.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
2:4-8.) Thus the sense would be very satisfactory, that God would restrain His
wrath, and although aroused to anger by the refusal of Moses, he would still
take an ambassador out of that tribe which he destined to the priesthood.
Moreover, no slight confirmation is added, in that Aaron would come forth to
meet his brother in the Desert, and would receive him with great joy. It was as
much as to shew that whilst God was pressing forward His servant from the land
of Midian with the one hand, He would stretch forth the other to draw him into
Egypt. Though the vision ought to have quickened him to perform God's command,
yet because it was necessary to stimulate his inactivity, Aaron was sent, as if
God openly put forth His hand to excite him forward. For he had neither come
into the Desert for pleasure, nor by chance, nor from vain curiosity; but Moses
knew assuredly that a banner thus was set up for him by God, to shew him the
certainty of his way. So by the coming of Ananias the vision seen by Paul was
confirmed, and placed beyond the reach of doubt.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440917&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
9:17.) This was, indeed, extorted from God by the importunity of Moses.
According to His infinite goodness He willed to elicit from the sin of His
servant materials for His grace; just as He is accustomed to bring light out of
darkness.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 4:6.) God mentions his brother's gladness to Moses, in order to
reprove his own indifference; as much as to say, Aaron will willingly come
forth, and will receive you with joy and gladness; whilst you, depressed with
sorrow and anxiety, or stupified by distrust, can scarcely be induced to stir a
foot.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall be thy
spokesman.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God destroys the pretext for
his exemption, by assigning to his brother the office of spokesman, and yet does
He not put the other in his place; nay, so merciful is the arrangement, that
while He yields to His servant's prayer, He yet confers honor upon him in spite
of himself. The offices are thus divided &#8212; Moses is to have the authority,
Aaron is to be the interpreter. Thus Moses is set before his brother, from no
respect to his own dignity; because the grace of God was to shine forth
conspicuously in the head no less than in the members; as it is expressed in
these words, that "Aaron should be instead of a mouth, and Moses instead of
God;" <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>.,<i> </i>that he was to dictate what Aaron should
faithfully report, and to prescribe what he should obediently follow. By this
example did God bear witness that the gifts of the Spirit, as well as our
vocations, are distributed by Him at His own good pleasure; and that none excels
either in honor or in gifts, except according to the measure of His free<i>
</i>bounty. But that the first-born is made subject to the younger, and is only
appointed to be his spokesman, whereas God might have accomplished by his hand
and labor, what he rather chose to perform by Moses; hence let us learn
reverently to regard His judgments, because they are incomprehensible to us, and
like a deep abyss. "To<i> </i>be instead of God" is the same as to lead or to
direct, or to have the chief command; as the Chaldee Paraphrast 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f55</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
renders it, to be the chief or master. It is a very weak calumny of the Arians
to abuse this and similar passages, in order to refute the proofs of Christ's
divinity, because there is a great difference in speaking of one as God simply
and absolutely, and with circumstantial additions. For we know that the name of
God is attributed to every potentate, improperly indeed, yet not unreasonably;
as when the devil himself is called "the<i> </i>god of this world,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 4:4;) but wherever mention is made of the true Deity, Scripture
never profanes that sacred
name.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt take this
rod.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There is no doubt that God chose
this shepherd's rod to be the instrument of his power, in order the more to
confound the pride of Pharaoh. For what but shame and reproach could it bring to
Moses, that he should bear with him the crook with which he had heretofore
guided his sheep in their folds and hovels? This symbol, then, of a rustic and
contemptible occupation, was opposed to the scepter of Pharaoh, not without
humiliation. In this respect, therefore, the obedience of Moses is worthy of
praise, because he is not ashamed of a mean and humble appearance, but willingly
carries his rod, and thus makes himself as nothing, and glorifies God. So is God
usually wont to hide his treasures in earthen vessels, and to choose "the weak
things of the world to confound the things that are mighty." But from Moses
being commanded to work the miracles with the rod, we gather that outward signs
are often made use of by God, when He works by His own hand; not to derogate at
all from his power, or to obscure his praise, but to make it manifest that the
whole world is subject to him, and that he freely applies to whatever use he
pleases, things which are otherwise of no
account.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses
went.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is surprising that Moses should
have suppressed the vision whereby the mind of his father-in-law might have been
most inclined to let him go; for he speaks merely of human feelings, that he
desired to revisit his brethren and relations. Yet it must have been
disagreeable to his father-in-law to lose his services, and that diligence and
industry by which he had largely profited; nor could it have been pleasant to
send away his daughter and grandchildren to a foreign country. Whether he was
forbidden to do so by God, or whether he was silent from fear and shame, is
uncertain; but I incline rather to this supposition, that he dared not speak of
his vocation, lest its incredibility should cause him to be suspected of
falsehood and vanity. Since, then, it would have been difficult to obtain belief
as to his vocation, he preferred making a pretext of his natural affection. But
Jethro being persuaded more by divine inspiration than by that excuse, was
easily prevailed on; although I make no doubt that for forty years Moses had
been giving such proofs of his honesty, that he was exempted from every evil
suspicion. We know how much respect is gained by long experience; since, then,
Moses had so long manifested his integrity, his father-in-law could have no
fears of his levity, or fraud, or deceit. By this example believers learn ever
to seek to obtain a good reputation; for there is nothing which so greatly
facilitates the transaction of all affairs as the constant course of an upright
and innocent life. For, from whence arises so much difficulty in obtaining what
each may want from his neighbor? Whence such hinderances, such reproaches on one
side and the other, but because, while every one would be believed, no one
labors to obtain credit by his integrity? But although Moses had conciliated his
father-in-law by his upright and holy life, still he was confirmed in his
vocation by the readiness with which his demand was complied with, for the
permission was full of courtesy and kindness without any sign of unwillingness
or regret.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>

had spoken to his servant after permission to return had been given him by his
father-in-law; but my opinion rather is, that what had before been omitted is
here inserted out of its place. Such repetition is frequent in the Scriptures. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f57</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Moses, therefore, adds to what he had already said, that the fear of danger was
removed, since God had testified that the recollection of his having slain the
Egyptian had ceased. For this would have been a stumblingblock at the very
outset, if Moses had supposed that this accusation would have met him; not
because his conscience<i> </i>smote him before God, but because he would have
been rejected by the perverse judgments of men. Therefore, on this point, also,
God provides against his fear, assuring him that the enemies were dead who had
plotted against his life. And, perhaps, he now particularly notices this,
because in asking for leave to depart, he could safely speak of it; for it is
probable that Jethro, before he had married his daughter to an unknown
foreigner, had demanded the cause of his exile; since it was easy to conjecture
by his wandering in the Desert, that he had been expelled from his country.
Having then confessed that he fled from the wrath of the king, he now says that
he is recalled by divine revelation, and that a safe return is promised him. Nor
is he guilty of falsehood; for, amongst other things, God had promised him that
no danger awaited him from his former
enemies.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses took his

with him, Moses clearly and freely professed, that he was returning to Egypt, to
dwell there. The ass upon which he set them, is a plain proof how humble was his
condition, and how slender his substance. For it is improbable that he left
either money or silver vessels or precious garments with his father-in-law, so
as to present himself to his people in poverty and nakedness. But as he had been
content in the land of Midian with his indigence and coarse fare, he continues
in the same simple estate; nor is he ashamed in his contemptible and common
habit to mount the stage on which his poverty would be conspicuous, which in the
Desert had been concealed. It is well known as a matter of experience, that the
poor are led to crime more by the fear of shame than by hunger, cold, and other
discomforts. Wherefore Moses withstood a very heavy temptation, when he cared
not for being laughed at, and despised, and presented himself without any
earthly splendor. But there is here an implied antithesis between "the<i>
</i>rod of God" and the appearance of the humble and despised man, without any
other equipment whatever; it is as much as to say, that it did not trouble him
that he was without everything else, as long as he had the rod, which abundantly
compensated for all deficiencies. Therefore, although he perceived that he would
be exposed to the scorn of high and low, in leading the ass, burdened, as we
have been observing, still he thought himself well, and more than well provided
in his rod, the instrument of divine power, by which he should magnificently
triumph, and could afford to dispense with the pomp of royalty. And surely the
marks by which God would have his servants distinguished, deserve this honor,
that we should require nothing to be added to their dignity. We must observe the
epithet applied to the rod; it is called no longer the rod of Moses, but "the<i>
</i>rod of God," because it is not used, as of old, to conduct his flock, but 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f58</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to represent the power of God. For since it was by the sovereign power of God
that it worked miracles, whatever concerned their glory is truly and properly
ascribed to God. Elsewhere, indeed, it is called the rod of Moses; inasmuch as
God communicates his own titles to the ministers chosen and created by himself,
since he supplies them with the efficacy of his
Spirit.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When thou goest to
return.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses had not previously
enumerated the wonders; but from this verse we gather, that whatever we shall
presently read to be done, was already commanded by God. There is then, no
doubt, but that God had already advised him of his whole course of proceeding,
lest he might yield to the obstinacy of the proud tyrant, and when two or three
miracles had been wrought in vain, might cast away his rod, together with the
charge committed to him. Now, therefore, God exhorts him to perseverance; and
although he might perceive after three or four miracles that the obstinacy of
the king was indomitable, still that he should not turn back, nor be
discouraged, but should continue even unto the end. This, then, is the sum, that
he should not faint nor fail, when he saw the inutility of his first efforts;
nor cease to contend boldly till he had fulfilled all the objects of his
vocation. Moreover, lest he might think it the effect of chance, that he did not
immediately obtain the victory, or might consider it strange that the miracles
should be eluded with impunity by a mere mortal, as if he stood before God
unconquered in his boldness, God himself foretells that he would be the
moderator of all this contest, nay, that whatsoever should seem to oppose the
deliverance of his people would arise from his own secret counsel. Thus he shews
Moses the reason why he should not stop until he had performed all the miracles;
because the tyrant must be gloriously conquered, and overwhelmed in so many
hard-fought engagements, that the victory might be more splendid. In the
meantime He declares that the king of Egypt would not be thus obstinate contrary
to His will; as if He could not reduce him to order in a moment; but rather that
He would harden his heart in order that He might violently overwhelm his
madness. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f59</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The word which Moses uses signifies sometimes to apprehend, sometimes to
restrain by force, sometimes to strengthen; but it seemed to me that I should
best render its sense by the word "<i>constringo</i>," to<i> </i>constrain;
since undoubtedly God would make it appear that he would be the President 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f60</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(as it were) of all the contests in which Moses was to engage, so as even to
control the heart of his adversary, and to harden it into obstinacy. Since the
expression seems harsh to delicate ears, many soften it away, by turning the act
into mere permission; as if there were no difference between doing and
permitting to be done; or as if God would commend his passivity, and not rather
his power. As to myself, I am certainly not ashamed of speaking as the Holy
Spirit speaks, nor do I hesitate to believe what so often occurs in Scripture,
that God gives the wicked over to a reprobate mind, gives them up to vile
affections, blinds their minds and hardens their hearts. But they object, that
in this way God would be made the author of sin; which would be a detestable
impiety. I reply, that God is very far from the reach of blame, when he is said
to exercise his judgments: wherefore, if blindness be a judgment of God, it
ought not to be brought in accusation against him, that he inflicts punishment.
But if the cause be often concealed from us, we should remember that God's
judgments are not without reason called a "great<i> </i>deep," and, therefore,
let us regard them with admiration and not with railing. But those who
substitute his permission in the place of his act, not only deprive him of his
authority as a judge, but in their repining, subject him to a weighty reproach,
since they grant him no more of justice than their senses can
understand.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel is my son, even my
first-born.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God thus refutes, by
anticipation, the only pretext by which Pharaoh could justify his refusal to let
the people go. For Jacob had spontaneously submitted himself and all his family
to his government; he had then free power to retain the people, which, by the
common law of nations, was subject to the dominion of Egypt. But if it be an act
of impiety to violate the ordinance instituted by God, the demand of Moses might
appear improper, that the legitimate authority of the king should be abolished
against his own will. For what was the object of proposing the departure of the
people, except to compel the king to renounce his own authority? In order, then,
to shew that he took nothing away unjustly or unreasonably from Pharaoh, God
alleges the privilege by which the Israelites were excepted from ordinary laws;
for by calling them His sons, He claims liberty for them; since it would be
absurd that God himself, the supreme Ruler of heaven and earth, should be
deprived of the sons whom He had deigned to adopt. He, therefore, indirectly
compares his own paternal power with Pharaoh's earthly rule; because nothing
could be less reasonable than that a mortal should refuse to yield to the Maker
of himself and all the world. Still this is not applicable to all believers in
general; as if it were wrong for them to be subject to kings, or as if their
temporal subjection deprived them of their inheritance of the world; but mention
is here only made of the special prerogative with which God had honored the
posterity of Abraham, when he gave them the dominion of the land of Canaan.
Therefore, not content with the simple appellation of son, He calls Israel his
first-born. By this honorable title He unquestionably prefers him to the other
nations; as though He had said, that he was raised to the degree of the
primogeniture, and was superior to all the world. This passage, then, may be
accommodated to the calling of the Gentiles, whom God had already decreed to
bring into fellowship with his elect people, so that, although they were
younger, they might be united with his first-born. I allow, indeed, that all the
race of Adam was then cast off; but, because Adam was made in the image of God,
his posterity were always reckoned, in a certain sense, to be the children of
God; for, whilst I readily admit that the holy offspring of Abraham are here
compared with the nations who at that time were still heathen, and that in this
respect they are called his first-born, because they are pre-eminent in dignity;
still we must come to Christ, the only head, in order that the adoption should
be sure. For we must hold fast to that statement of St. Paul, that the blessing
of Abraham was not promised to his seeds, but to his seed; because not all that
sprang from his flesh are accounted to be children, but those that were called;
as Isaac, Ishmael being rejected, and as Jacob, Esau being passed by.

as here, of the whole people, Matthew limits to Christ; and justly, since upon
Him alone the grace of adoption is founded.

the legation, but its final clause; for Moses warned the desperate man of his
son's death, when everything else had been tried in vain. The meaning is, then,
that the obstinacy of the tyrant must not prevent Moses from pressing him even
to this final act. Therefore this injunction was an exhortation to perseverance;
as appears from the context, when God declares that he will punish the obstinacy
of the tyrant, because he refused to obey the command to let the people go.
Moreover, since this denunciation was very severe, and might very greatly awaken
the tyrant's wrath, therefore Moses is thus early commanded to prepare himself

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass by the
way.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The expression, "the<i> </i>Lord
met him," is here used in a bad sense, for an adverse meeting, or hostile
encounter; as though Moses should say that the hand of the Lord was against him
to interrupt his journey. In what form He appeared we know not, except that the
words pretty plainly imply that Moses was assured of His anger, so as to be
aware that his death was near. For had he not been instructed by revelation or
by an angel, it would not have at all profited him to be shewn the impending
danger. Nevertheless the cause is not expressed for which he perceived that God
was so angry with him; except that we may gather it from what follows. For why
should Zipporah have taken a sharp stone or knife and circumcised her son, had
she not known that God was offended at his uncircumcision? Certain Rabbins,
then, are unwise in their conjecture, that Moses had provoked God's vengeance on
this occasion against himself, because he took his wife and children with him as
being a useless charge, which would be likely to encumber him. They pronounce
also, too boldly, on the nature of his scourge, viz., that he was afflicted by a
severe disease, which endangered his life. Be it sufficient for us to know that
he was terrified by the approach of certain destruction, and that, at the same
time, the cause of his affliction was shewn him, so that he hastened to seek for
a remedy. For, as we have just said, it would never have otherwise occurred to
himself or his wife to circumcise<i> </i>the child to appease God's wrath; and
it will appear a little further on, that God was, as it were, propitiated by
this offering, since he withdrew his hand, and took away the tokens of his
wrath. I therefore unhesitatingly conclude, that vengeance was declared against
Moses for his negligence, which was connected with still heavier sins; for he
had not omitted his son's circumcision from forgetfulness, or ignorance, or
carelessness only, but because he was aware that it was disagreeable either to
his wife or to his father-in-law. Therefore, lest. his wife should quarrel with
him, or his father-in-law trouble him, he preferred to gratify them than to give
occasion for divisions, or enmity, or disturbance. In the meantime, however, for
the sake of the favour of men he neglected to obey God. This false dealing was
no light offense, since nothing is more intolerable than to defraud God of his
due obedience, in order to please men. There was a mixture too of distrust and
ingratitude in it; for, if the favour of God had had its due weight, he would
have been withholden by no fear from this pious duty. Let us then learn from
hence to use reverently the sacraments, which are the seals of God's grace, lest
he should severely avenge our despisal of them; and at the same time we should
remember that the external profession of piety, and the worship of God is a
sacrifice so pleasant to God, that he will not allow us to omit the care of
diligently testifying it as if it were a matter of small importance. Not that he
cares for the ceremonies themselves, but because he would have honor paid to the
pledges of his grace, in proportion to the benefit which is received from them.
On this account Paul bears witness, that a pestilence raged among the
Corinthians when the Lord's supper was profaned,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461130&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 11:30;) because it was an act of impiety that so precious a treasure
should be lightly esteemed. But it is worthy of observation, that whereas Moses
had two sons with him, mention is here only made of one; from whence is deduced
the probable conjecture that one of the two was circumcised.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f61</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Some think that Eliezer, the eldest, was not so, because Moses had not dared to
confess his religion so soon, and to awaken hatred on account of it.<b> </b>But
I should rather imagine that when, in regard to one he had experienced the
hostility of his family, he omitted it in the case of the second, to avoid the
anger of his wife or his father-in-law; for if, in the lapse of time, he had
attained more courage, he would not have hesitated to correct the former
omission; but, worn out by domestic quarrels, he at last departed from his duty.
By this example we are warned that we have daily need of God's help to support
our strength, lest our courage should fail us, and our zeal should gradually
grow cold or luke-warm; for Satan is constantly devising many temptations, by
which he may either destroy or lessen our diligence. Therefore, whosoever
desires to approve himself to God in the whole course of his life, must prepare
the armor and the strength for enduring this contest; for if Moses was deficient
in perseverance, we shall be equally, or even more liable to the same failure,
unless the Lord uphold us by his
Spirit.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Zipporah took a sharp
stone.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Because the wife here improperly
assumed this office, some of the Rabbins conjecture that this was done in the
absence of her husband; but the context contradicts them; and therefore I doubt
not but that she seized hold of a knife or a stone hastily, as is common in
times of fear and confusion. For fear had so affected her mind, that she did not
act with consideration. Moses, too, might have lain incapable in his anxiety.
Certainly the child was not duly circumcised; and still it is plain from the
event, that the ceremony thus rashly performed pleased God; for it is
immediately added, that "He let him go." For thus I interpret it, that the
scourge of God ceased or was removed, because he was pacified by the repentance
both of Moses and of Zipporah, although it was improper 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f62</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in itself; not that imperfect obedience is pleasing to God absolutely, but
relatively, through indulgence, it is sometimes approved. Thus punishment was
remitted in the case of wicked Ahab, when for a season he was humbled, on
account of his hypocritical tears.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;112129&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 21:29.) When, therefore, Zipporah, who had opposed her husband,
circumcised her son with her own hands, although she had not yet seriously
repented, yet God was contented with the suppression of her pride, so as to
cease from afflicting Moses. Still we must not take this as an example, as if,
by manifesting the signs of repentance, hypocrites would always find God
merciful; but rather he sometimes graciously pardons the unworthy, as far as the
infliction of punishment goes, that, by this kindness, he may invite us to true
and sincere repentance. Let us conclude, then, that the confusion of Zipporah,
and the stupor of Moses were pardoned; whilst she rashly hastened to circumcise
her son, not out of presumption, but yielding to the fears of destruction
threatened by God. Thus

their folly is confuted who wish to obtain a color for baptism by women from
this passage; for they contend that if infants be in danger of death, they may
be properly baptized by women, because Zipporah circumcised<i> </i>her son. But
they will themselves allow that, if a man be present, a woman could not lawfully
administer this sacrament. It is a perversion, then, to lay down a rule from a
confused and hasty act.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b><i>

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[gn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>negang</i>, which some construe "she held," is more properly taken
transitively. For although, in some degree, as necessity compelled, Zipporah
submitted herself to God, yet, aroused to violent anger, she turns against her
husband, and fiercely reproaches him with being "a<i> </i>bloody husband." Hence
we perceive how far she was from a pious disposition to obey; since she thus
furiously attacks her husband, and vents her wrath on him, on no other account
but that God had extorted from her the circumcision of her son. Some think that
she spoke this to her son, from an impulse of maternal grief or pity; but they
wrest the words too violently; and it is better to keep to the natural meaning,
viz., that she expostulated with her husband, because she had redeemed his life
by the loss of her child's
blood.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said to
Aaron.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>When, from the long lapse of
time, Aaron must have supposed that his brother had died in exile, he now
receives the joyful announcement, from the mouth of God, that he is alive; and
not only so, but he is excited with the hope of His special favor; for, although
God does not explain in detail what he had decreed to do and prepared, yet, by
his revelation, he promises him something unusual and unexpected. But the
brevity of the command is remarkable, for God says not a word of the
deliverance, but desires him to be the disciple of his younger brother; and
although, by his promptitude, he manifested the greatest zeal and anxiety to
obey, still he is not put on an equality with Moses, who is slow, and dubious,
and vacillating, and almost supine; but he is commanded to learn of him the
design of God. Only, lest he should question his own and his brother's vocation,
he is instructed by a divine vision, that God is the author of the whole
transaction, which serves as a recommendation of the verbal information he is to
receive. For although Aaron was the messenger of God, and the organ of the Holy
Spirit, we still see that he was not exempt from the usual condition to which we
are subjected, of hearing God's word at the mouth of man. If, then, there are
any who object to be taught by the medium of man's voice, they are not worthy of
having God as their Teacher and Master; for it is soon after added, that Moses
related all that was commanded him, as well as the great power which had been
delegated to him of working miracles. But Aaron himself, although the elder, not
only paid honor to his brother, whom he knew to be a Prophet of the Lord; but
willingly submitted himself to him as to an angel. The kiss is mentioned as a
sign of recognition, by which he testified the firmness of his
faith.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses and Aaron

faithfully and religiously the two brothers executed the commands of God. They
gather together the elders of the people, because the mighty multitude, as we
are told they were, could not be collected in one place. Besides, God wished not
to contend by means of the tumultuous and confused clamor of a mob, but with the
miracles, which calmly breathed forth his divine power. But it is again worthy
of observation, that Aaron is substituted to speak in the place of Moses. For if
slowness of speech prevented Moses from doing so, why is not God's discourse
directed to Aaron? Wherefore is this circuitous proceeding, that he promulgates
to the people not what he himself heard directly, but received indirectly
through his brother, except that this mode is agreeable to God for the purpose
of proving their faith? For while by this proof the humility and modesty of
Aaron were exhibited, since he objected not to depend on his brother's mouth, so
also the tractableness of the elders appears in suffering the commands of God to
be thus passed to them from hand to hand, and in not scrupulously inquiring why
God did not directly address themselves, or thunder from on high. They were, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f64</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
however, aided by the miracles, because they were so stupified by their miseries
that otherwise simple preaching would have had no weight with
them.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>

believed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Either this is a
<i>synecdoche</i>,<i> </i>a part of the people being put for the whole, or else
Moses signifies that after the announcement was published, all with one consent
embraced the message of their deliverance. I prefer the former meaning; because
their solemn adoration is immediately subjoined, which could only have taken
place in a public assembly. But we shall presently see how fickle and infirm was
their belief. It is plain, from its levity and inconstancy, that it was without
any living root. But it is not unusual that the word belief should be improperly
applied to a mere assent and disposition to believe, which speedily passes away.
Thus Christ
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;410415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
4:15) speaks of the faith of many as transient. "The people," therefore,
"believed," when they heard that their afflictions were regarded by God, since
that statement carried with it credibility and authority; but it was such belief
as might be dissipated by the first adverse wind; and so, indeed, it happened.
This passage, then, teaches, that theirs is no great attainment, and that they
are deserving of no great praise, who eagerly and joyfully receive what is
propounded to them in God's name, unless faith, being deeply rooted in their
hearts, sustains itself boldly against the assaults of temptation. Some connect
the clauses differently, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f65</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
"The<i> </i>people believed; and when they heard that assistance in their
calamities awaited them, gave thanks to God." But the <i>copula </i>is here
rightly resolved into the <i>expositive particle</i>,<i> </i>and the sense is
<i>&#8212; </i>"When the people had heard what Aaron reported, they believed."
God's visiting them here expresses the actual occurrence, viz., that God was
willing to render them aid in their sore distress. Their "worshipping" was in
token of their gratitude, because it was not enough for them privately and
individually to reflect on the favor of God, unless they also openly manifested
their religious feeling; not as if God greatly requires outward ceremonies, but
because they are useful supports to our infirmity, and it is right, that not the
mind only, but the body also, should be employed in the service of
God.</font><br><br></div>

forth how many and how great were the proofs of God's power displayed in the
deliverance of his people. For, since the pride, the madness, and the obstinacy
of the king were indomitable, every door was closed, until broken down
miraculously, and by various means. It was, indeed, possible for God to
overwhelm him at once, by a single nod, so that he should even fall down dead at
the very sight of Moses; but, as we have already briefly stated, and he will
himself presently declare,<i> </i>He, <i>in the first place</i>,<i> </i>chose
more clearly to lay open His power; for if Pharaoh had either voluntarily
yielded, or had been overcome without effort, the glory of the victory would not
have been so illustrious. <i>In the second place</i>,<i> </i>He wished this
monument to exist of His singular love towards His elect people; for by
contending so perseveringly and so forcibly against the obstinacy of this most
powerful king, He gave no doubtful proof of his love towards his Church. <i>In
the third place</i>,<i> </i>He<i> </i>wished to accustom His servants in all
ages to patience, lest they should faint in their minds, if He does not
immediately answer their prayers, and, at every moment, relieve them from their
distresses. <i>In the fourth place</i>,<i> </i>He wished to shew that, against
all the strivings and devices of Satan, against the madness of the ungodly, and
all worldly hinderances, His hand must always prevail; and to leave us no room
to doubt, but that whatever we see opposing us will at length be overcome by
him. <i>In the fifth place</i>,<i> </i>By detecting the illusions of Satan and
the magicians, He would render His Church more wary, that she might carefully
watch against such devices, and that her faith might continue invincible against
all the machinations of error. <i>Finally</i>,<i> </i>He would convince Pharaoh
and the Egyptians, that their folly was not to be excused by any pretense of
ignorance; and, at the same time, by this example, He would shew us how horrible
a darkness possesses the minds of the reprobate, when He has deprived them of
the light of his Spirit. These things must be attentively observed in the course
of the narrative, if we desire to profit by
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Since it is difficult to obtain access to
kings, who deign not to admit to their presence any of the lower orders, Moses
and Aaron must have been endued with no ordinary confidence, when they boldly
approached Pharaoh. For it was a disagreeable message, and one very likely to
give offense, that he should permit the people to take three days' journey
beyond the bounds of Egypt; since a suspicion must unquestionably arise that,
being thus dismissed, they would no longer remain his subjects, and that thus a
part of the land would be emptied of its inhabitants. Still Moses and Aaron do
not fear to deliver God's command, in which there was this additional annoyance
to the proud and sensitive ears of the king, viz., that they attributed the
glory of Deity to the God of Israel alone; for, by calling Him Jehovah, they
imply that the gods worshipped in Egypt were false, and invented by the
imaginations of man. We have said elsewhere that there was no deceit in the
pretext that God called his people into the wilderness to hold a feast, although
He does not reveal His counsel to the tyrant; for it was really His pleasure
that a sacrifice of thanksgiving should be offered to Himself on Mount Sinai,
and that they should be thus separated from the polluted nation with which they
were mixed up; and, assuredly, He wished to arouse the tyrant's wrath, by
ignominiously condemning the whole of Egypt, as not capable of pure worship. For
He was obliged by no law to declare<i> </i>openly their deliverance; but that He
might draw forth from the mind of the tyrant the venom of his impiety, He asked
for nothing connected with the advantage of His people,<i> </i>but merely
demanded the worship which was due to Himself. The word which Moses uses means
properly to hold a feast, but also embraces whatever is connected with it; and,
therefore, by <i>synecdoche</i>,<i> </i>it is taken here, as also in other
passages, for the solemn worship of God.

should be such madness in a mortal as, by thus wantonly scorning God, to fly, as
it were, in the face of heaven! 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f67</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But we must observe, that the tyrant being devoted to idolatries, thus insulted
the God of Israel, that he might manifest his great piety towards his false
gods. For his mockery, in scornfully bandying back the name of Jehovah, must be
referred to the words of Moses, as much as to say, Why do you bring against me
this unknown phantom under the title of the eternal God, as though we had no god
of our own? Thus Pilate, when Christ said, "To this end was I born, and for this
cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth," asks
ironically, and not without mockery, "What is truth?"

18:37, 38.) In short, Pharaoh did not conceive himself to be dishonoring the
Deity, when he rejected this false (<i>prodigiosum</i>)<i> </i>God, as he
thought. Yet his error did not avail to justify him, since it arose from insane
audacity and contempt of God. Admit that he was unwilling that any should
depreciate his idols, and that he thus imagined himself to perform a religious
duty; still it was an act of very gross impiety, so carelessly to repudiate the
name of the true God, and even to assail it with mockery. We may remark a like
madness in all idolaters. Being intoxicated by their errors they boldly mock at
God, and deign not to make inquiries about Him. The cry of the Papists
now-a-days is, that we are imposing a new God on the world; and, applauding
themselves in their wildest ravings, they<i> </i>do not hesitate to condemn our
whole doctrine as impious; not because they are persuaded that they are
themselves worshipping God aright; but they are willfully blind, that they may
elude, with impunity, the sacred majesty of God, and stupify their consciences,
and preserve to themselves their death-like slumber. They seem to themselves to
be sharp-witted and facetious, when they are scoffing at the novelty of our
doctrine; though its truth would be plain enough, if they would only open their
eyes. The Epicureans, too, (of which pestilent sect the world is now full,)
although they foam and rage against God, still invariably take refuge in some
cloud, under which their detestable madness may be concealed: for they pretend
that amidst such a multitude of opinions, it is scarcely possible to discern who
is God, or what He commands. Still, however, this is their constant object,
viz., that they may have nothing to do with God, and yet may conceal by jests
the shame of their impiety; as if it were free for them to reject what they are
willfully ignorant of. But after Pharaoh had indirectly derided the message of
Moses, as a ludicrous affair, he more openly and more contemptuously vents his
pride, implying that he cares not for that God, with whose name Moses and Aaron
would frighten him.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they said, The God of the
Hebrews.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses and Aaron proceed with
their message; neither does the pride of the tyrant decrease or weaken their
courage in proclaiming the glory of the One true God, who had peculiarly
attached Himself to them. And, certainly, this is the attribute of faith, to
trample upon everything that exalteth itself on earth; since the truth of God is
superior to all human greatness. Nor could they more effectually refute that
profane and impious word, "I know not the Lord," than by again asseverating that
the true God is the Protector of their nation, and that this had been disclosed
to them in an open manifestation of Himself. The threatening, which they added,
admonishes Pharaoh that his rebellion would not be unpunished, if he kept back
the people from the worship of God; for if He would take vengeance on the people
which was retained against their will, how could <i>he </i>escape with impunity,
who professedly entered into contention with God? When, then, they declare that
some calamity would befall them unless they obeyed the call of God, they
intimate that Pharaoh must beware of some greater
visitation.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the king of Egypt said
unto them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is surprising that the
king, in the excess of his arrogance, did not more cruelly entreat these
servants of God, whom he accounted the ringleaders of sedition. But he was
undoubtedly restrained by God from proceeding at once to destroy them. By his
pertinacity in resisting their departure, he will more clearly shew by and bye
how important to his interests he considered it that the people should remain in
Egypt; how comes it then that he is contented with verbal reproof, and refrains
from shedding their blood, if it were not that God protected his servants under
the shield of His defense? He harshly reproves them, indeed, and condemns them
to the same labors, by which the rest of the people were oppressed; but since it
is notorious that moderate rigor never satisfies tyrants, we conclude that they
were preserved under the guardianship of God, and would otherwise have died a
hundred times over. But let us learn from his accusation against them, as the
promoters of rebellion, to bear patiently, after their example, calumnies and
false imputations; only, in reliance on God's command, let us be fully conscious
that we are unjustly accused. The next verse, wherein he says, that "the people
of the land are now many," is intended to aggravate their guilt; both because
they would inflict a deeper injury on the public, than as if they had withheld a
few from their work; and also, because, by inflaming a large number of people,
they would bring greater danger on the
country.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Pharaoh
commanded.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We shall more clearly
perceive, as the narrative proceeds, that these taskmasters and officers were
taken from amongst the children of Israel, although we have before read that
some were Egyptians. But, as tyrants are ingenious in securing their own
interests, Pharaoh in his subtlety wished to provide that none should escape,
but that all alike should be brought in turn to the labor. For some, in such a
multitude, might have evaded the Egyptians; but, when the charge was given to
the Israelites, their familiar knowledge would prevent any from escaping.
Besides, it is probable that with these taskmasters was deposited the straw,
which they distributed either to parties of ten, or to individuals; he therefore
doubles the work in this way, by commanding them to gather the straw with which
the bricks were made. But, according to the proverb, that "the<i> </i>edicts of
kings are monosyllables,"<i> </i>Moses shews the vehemence of the tyranny by the
brevity of the command. But this passage teaches us, that when God has begun to
regard us for the purpose of relieving our troubles, He sometimes takes occasion
to increase the pressure of our burdens. Thus, when God had engaged to be the
deliverer of the Israelites, their trouble became greater, by the tyrant adding
to their ordinary tasks that of gathering the straw for themselves. For thus it
pleases God to prove the faith of His people; and thus is it expedient to lift
up to Him their minds, which are too much set on earth, whilst they do not
immediately perceive the fruit of the grace promised to them, nay, whilst they
feel that nothing else is brought them by God's favour, except that their
condition becomes worse. It is very useful for us to ponder this, that we may
more patiently and calmly bear to be excited to the love and desire of heavenly
blessings, by crosses and adversities. Now-a-days the Gospel procures hatred for
many, deprives others of their pleasures, degrades others from their honours,
brings to others the loss of their goods, sentences others to prison, others to
exile, and endangers the life of some; in a word, the more God exerts His power,
the more is Satan's rage excited on the other side, and the wicked become more
fiercely cruel. This offense would greatly shake us, unless we knew, from the
admonition of this example, that the inestimable grace, which is offered us in
Christ, ought to be so valued by us, that in comparison with it, riches,
honours, and all that men seek after, should be accounted nothing; and that we
should find no difficulty in despising inconveniences of whatever
kind.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let there more work be laid
upon the men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although Pharaoh knew that
he was cruelly entreating the unhappy Israelites, who ought, as strangers, to be
hospitably and kindly received, yet he says that they were abusing their
idleness, and were revolting because he indulged them too much. Thus, when
tyranny has lost all regard for justice, there are no bounds to its harshness;
and so far from being moved to pity by complaints, they only aggravate its
cruelty. And these are the means by which its flatterers inflame it more, viz.,
that its subjects will never be quiet unless they faint under the weight of
their burdens; that this is the best receipt for governing them, so to oppress
them that they dare not open their mouths; if they cry, or murmur, that they
should be oppressed the more, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f69</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
till they grow hardened, and, as it were, callous to their bondage. They,
therefore, relax not their contumelies and cruelties until the wretched people
have altogether succumbed. Pharaoh insults them still more wantonly, when he
says that he imposes heavier burdens upon them, that "they may not regard vain
words." But what are these, except that they ask permission to worship God? His
impiety, therefore, bursts forth in the midst of his tyrannical insolence; nor
does he only mean to utter a blasphemy against God, but he is instigated by the
wiles of Satan to undermine the faith of the Church. By a similar impulse,
Rabshakeh proclaimed that Hezekiah deceived the people by "vain words," when he
bade them trust in the living God.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah

vanity.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So the people were scattered
abroad.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This circumstance proves how
bitterly they were afflicted, and what labor beyond their strength was imposed
upon them. In order to make bricks, at least, they should have remained in a
particular spot, but straw is not supplied to them for the purpose; they are
obliged, therefore, to disperse here and there, and to gather stubble instead of
straw in the distant parts of Egypt. They could not do both; it was then in fact
just to procure a false pretext, which he might catch at as the ground of their
condemnation: as now we often see the enemies of Christ inventing the most
insupportable torments, by which the unhappy Church may be driven to deny the
faith. For it was the design of Pharaoh to drive Moses and Aaron far away, that
they might never agitate any more for the departure of the people; and if he had
obtained this wish, he would doubtless have remitted some part of his abominable
cruelty; but, because they did not cease, he wished to extort from the people by
bitter sufferings, that they should send them away themselves, or refuse even to
lend an ear to the commands of God. For although he must have been perfectly
conscious that there was no reason to accuse the people of idleness, but that
the tale of bricks was not delivered, because the poor wretches, who had been
hardly able before to perform half their labor, were now incapable, by the
utmost exertion, to bear their burdens, and therefore sees that they are
altogether overwhelmed by them; yet still he reproaches them with reveling in
idleness, in order that they may turn away from Moses, and renounce and abandon
the hope presented to them from on high. And, because he can only torment them
more by killing them outright, he commands their officers to be beaten, that by
their punishment the whole people might be in greater dread. Finally, those whom
he saw standing too firmly, he determined to drive at last to despair. He is
deaf to every excuse of the officers; for when he had once made up his mind to
crush the people until he had destroyed in them all recollection of God, there
is no more feeling or pity in him than in a
stone.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

from the cruel bondage in which they were. Some also explain it, that the
officers themselves felt, from their own experience, after they had been so
inhumanly repulsed by the king, how unhappy was their condition. But if I must
choose either meaning, I should prefer what I have above stated, that they
themselves sympathized with the public calamity, whilst they could see no hope
of deliverance. Unless, perhaps, it would be better thus to take it, &#8212;
that, when they came into the people's presence, they were themselves of sad
countenance, and looked upon them with looks cast down by sorrow and shame,
because they brought the cruel edict for doubling their labour. And certainly I
willingly embrace this meaning, that when they were forced to promulgate the
command of the king, their countenances betrayed their sorrow, because they
could not evade the necessity of being the ministers of his ungodly tyranny and
cruelty. For Moses adds immediately after, that they delivered the edict. Hence,
then, their mournful aspect, because they unwillingly oppressed their brethren,
whose troubles they would have preferred to lighten. The sum of the matter is,
that their case was altogether desperate; because the officers themselves
conveyed this message of the unchangeable cruelty of the tyrant, and by the
agitation of their countenances bore witness that no mitigation could be hoped
for.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b><i>

<i>eth</i>,<i> </i>for "together with;" but it is more in accordance with the
context that the officers and some part of the elders or people encountered
Moses and Aaron as they returned from Pharaoh. An accidental meeting is
indicated, from whence it arose that their minds were still more exasperated
against the Lord's servants. That blind grief is here described which, with a
fury akin to madness, aroused the Israelites to unfounded anger against the
innocent, who had deserved nothing of the kind. It is not indeed wonderful that
they were so brutalized by the weight of their sorrows as to lose all sense of
justice, and were even so completely driven out of their minds, as unreasonably
to vent their indignation against the ministers of their deliverance; for this
not unfrequently happens; but although it may be too common a fault, yet are not
they free from the accusation of ingratitude who are carried away thus
inconsiderately by the force of their passions; nay,<i> </i>we should learn from
this example how carefully we ought to restrain our grief, which, if indulged,
parts company both with reason and with kindness. For what could be more unjust
than because Pharaoh is tyrannical and cruel to lay the blame on Moses and
Aaron? But; this outbreak arose from want of faith; because they measure the
favor of God by their immediate success. They had lately thanked God for their
promised redemption; now, as if they had been deceived, they accuse Moses and
Aaron. Hence we gather how wavering was their faith, which vanishes at once upon
so slight a cause. If the calling of Moses had not been ratified by miracles,
they might have taken occasion to be angry from their ill success; but now, when
they had experimentally known that God was the author of the whole proceeding,
it is an act of perversity and falsehood to accuse Moses of rashness; and thus
they do injustice not only to a mortal man, but to God their deliverer &#8212;
an injustice which is doubled by the blasphemous abuse of His name, when they
speak of Him as the promoter of a bad cause. For the expression, "the Lord
&#8212; judge," is, as it were, to impose upon Him the law by which He must
condemn Himself. On this account intemperate grief is still more to be watched
against, which, whilst it bursts out immoderately against men, does not even
spare God. They did not indeed think that they were reproaching God and
rejecting His loving-kindness; for the excess of their passion had transported
them out of themselves. Meantime we must mark the source of the evil, namely,
that they were impatient, because God did not immediately complete what He had
promised, but deferred it for a time; and again, because they sought to be
exempted from every evil. Thus they preferred rotting, as it were, in their
miseries, to suffering some little inconvenience for the hope of the favor of
God. And this cowardice is natural to almost all of us, that we prefer to be
without God's help rather than to suffer under the cross, whilst He leads us to
salvation gradually, and sometimes by a circuitous path. Nothing indeed is
sweeter than to hear that our afflictions are regarded by God, and that He will
come to our relief in tribulation; but if God's favor awakens the wrath of the
ungodly against us, we shall be prepared to abandon all His promises rather than
purchase the hopes they afford at so great a price. In the meantime, we see how
kindly God contended with the intemperate and corrupt conduct of His people. For
certainly by reproaching Moses and Aaron so rudely, the Israelites rejected (as
far as in them lay) that message respecting their deliverance which they at
first had greedily received; and yet He ceased not to carry on His work even to
the end.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses
returned.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This return unto the Lord is
here used in a bad sense for forsaking his office; for Moses is not related to
have either calmly prayed, or, as in a difficult emergency, to have humbly
sought counsel of the Lord; but, leaving the men with whom he had to do, to have
gone back in disgust to God, to demand his dismissal. He returned, then, to God,
that the whole undertaking might be abandoned, as though he had never been sent.
This is what the words convey, since he openly expostulates with God, because He
had permitted His people to be more cruelly entreated, though He had promised
them deliverance. At first sight, his madness would seem to be greater than that
of the whole people, because he directly and openly accuses God as the author of
all the evil which Pharaoh had inflicted; yet I doubt not but that he rather
sorrowfully recounted the complaints of the people than spoke his own
sentiments. Still his bitterness is not altogether excusable, when he repents of
his vocation, and is indignant, because an unsuccessful charge had been
intrusted to him. But when he accuses the slackness of God in redeeming His
people, it is made apparent how deep is the darkness which had taken possession
of his mind. He had been forewarned in good time of the hardness of Pharaoh's
heart; he had heard that he would not yield until crushed by God's mighty hand;
now, forgetting of all, he marvels that their redemption is not complete. The
same thing often occurs to us, that the doctrine of faith and hope, which in
peaceful times shines brightly in our hearts and echoes from our tongue, is
altogether lost when we come to serious conflict. Wherefore we ought to devote
ourselves with greater goodwill to its study, that even in the most trying
circumstances the recollection of it may be our support.</font><br><br></div>

receiving so kind and gentle a reply from God; but the Father of all goodness of
His infinite mercy pardoned both the sins of Moses and of the people, that He
might effect the deliverance which he had determined. Yet He adduces nothing
new, but repeats and confirms His former declaration, that Pharaoh would not
obey until forcibly compelled to do so. The expression, "thou shalt see," is a
tacit reproof of his immoderate impatience, in not waiting for the result of the
promise. The reason is then added why God is unwilling that His people should be
spontaneously dismissed by the tyrant, viz., because He wished the work of their
liberation to be conspicuous. We must remark the strength of the words "drive<i>
</i>them out;" as if He had said, that when Pharaoh had been subdued, and routed
in the contest, he would not only consent, but would consider it a great
blessing, for the people to depart as quickly as possible. The sum is, that he,
who today refuses to let you depart, will not only set you free, but will even
expel you from his kingdom.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And God
spake.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God pursues His address, that
Moses may again uplift the fainting courage of the people. Moreover, He rebukes
their distrust, by recalling the memory of His covenant; for if this had been
duly impressed upon their minds, they would have been much more firm in their
expectation of deliverance. He therefore shews that He has now advanced nothing
new; since they had heard long ago from the Patriarchs that they were chosen by
God as His peculiar people, and had almost imbibed from their mother's breasts
the doctrine of his adoption of them. Wherefore their stupidity is the more
unpardonable, and more manifest, when they thus factiously complain of Moses, as
if he had himself invented what he had promised them in the name of God. He also
stings them by an implied comparison; Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had eagerly
embraced the promise given them, and had quietly, and perseveringly trusted in
it; whilst they, who boasted of their descent from that holy stock, disdainfully
rejected it, because its fulfillment did not immediately appear. And, in order
to amplify their sin, he reasons from the less to the greater: since a fuller
and clearer manifestation of it is presented to them than there had been to the
fathers, it follows that they ought to have been more ready to believe it.
Whence it is plain that their stupidity is inexcusable, since they will not
receive God, when he is so familiarly presenting himself to them. Translators do
not agree as to the epithet "Sadai." Some derive it from the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dd&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shadad</i>,<i> </i>and imagine that the final letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">y</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>yod</i>,<i> </i>is the double
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>daleth</i>.<i> </i>If we agree to this, it will mean the same as "the
Destroyer;" or at any rate will signify the awful majesty of God. Others are
rather of opinion that the root is
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shad</i>,<i> </i>which means "a<i> </i>teat." To others it appears to be a
compound word from the relative
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>esher</i>,<i> </i>or
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yd</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>di</i>,<i> </i>which in Hebrew means "<i>sufficiency</i>."<i> </i>Thus he
will be called "Sadai," who abounds with all good things. It is indeed sure that
they use this word in a good as well as a bad sense; for where Isaiah threatens
that God will be the avenger of sins, he calls him "Sadai."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
13:9.) So also in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;182316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
23:16,<i> </i>"Sadai<i> </i>troubleth me." In these and similar passages, the
terrible power of God is unquestionably expressed; but when He promises to
Abraham that He will be the God "Sadai," He is engaging himself to be merciful
and bounteous. Here again, where He says that He appeared to the Fathers as the
God "Sadai,"<i> </i>He has not respect so much to His might in exercising
judgment, as to His abundant and perfect loving-kindness; as though He had said,
that He had manifested to Abraham and the other Patriarchs how great was His
efficiency in preserving and defending His own people, and that they had known
from experience how powerfully and effectually He cherishes, sustains, and aids
them that are His. But although He declares what benefits He conferred upon
them, He says that He was not known to them by His name "Jehovah;" signifying
thus that He now more brightly manifested the glory of His divinity to their
descendants. It would be tedious to recount the various opinions as to the name
"Jehovah." It is certainly a foul superstition of the Jews that they dare not
speak, or write it, but substitute the name "Adonai;"<i> </i>nor do I any more
approve of their teaching, who say that it is <i>ineffable</i>,<i> </i>because
it is not written according to grammatical rule. Without controversy, it is
derived from the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hyh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>hayah</i>,<i> </i>or
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>havah</i>,<i> </i>and therefore it is rightly said by learned commentators to
be the essential name of God, whereas others are, as it were, epithets. Since,
then, nothing is more peculiar to God than eternity, He is called Jehovah,
because He has existence from Himself, and sustains all things by His secret
inspiration. Nor do I agree with the grammarians, who will not have it
pronounced, because its inflection is irregular; because its etymology, of which
all confess that God is the author, is more to me than an hundred rules.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f72</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Nor does God by "His name" in this passage mean syllables or letters, but the
knowledge of His glory and majesty, which shone out more fully and more brightly
in the redemption of His Church, than in the commencement of the covenant. For
Abraham and the other Patriarchs were content with a smaller measure of light;
whence it follows that the fault of their descendants would be less excusable,
if their faith was not answerable to the increase of their grace. Meanwhile,
Moses is awakened to activity whilst God is setting before him a magnificent and
singular means of shewing forth His
glory.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I have also established
my covenant.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The hope of the deliverance
which He had formerly promised, and which the Patriarchs had expected, He
confirms by alluding to the covenant, as I have just above said; and the
particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;g</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gam</i>,<i> </i>which is twice repeated, is, in the first case,
<i>causal</i>,<i> </i>in the second, <i>illative</i>,<i> </i>as much as to say,
"Since I covenanted with your fathers, therefore I have now determined to bring
you into the land of Canaan;" unless it be preferred to resolve it thus, "I,<i>
</i>the same who established the covenant with your fathers, now also have heard
your groaning." Moreover, because the covenant is founded on free grace, God
commands the redemption to be expected as much from His good pleasure as from
His steadfastness. But He again commends the faith of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
because they patiently consented to be strangers and pilgrims in the land of
Canaan, which by the covenant of God was their own lawful inheritance. For it
was a proof of their exemplary virtue, to be wanderers all their lives, and not
to have a single corner to put their foot upon, unless what was granted them by
sufferance for the erection of their tents, being at the mercy of their
neighbors; as natives are always apt to despise strangers. And by this
comparison the slowness of heart and ingratitude of their posterity is the more
condemned, if they refuse to take possession of this land, which was so
earnestly desired by their holy fathers, and at the sight of which alone they
counted themselves blessed, although they were only sojourners
there.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I have also heard the
groaning.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He assigns the reason why He
so long had delayed to fulfill His promise, viz., because He would have His
people sorely troubled, that He might more openly succor them in their
affliction; besides, He chose that they should be unjustly oppressed by the
Egyptians, in order that He might more justly rescue them from their tyrannical
masters, as He had said to Abraham that He would avenge them after they had been
afflicted.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
15:13, 14.) He therefore reminds them by this circumstance, that the due time
for helping them had come; because, if they had been always treated humanely,
and the laws of hospitality had been observed towards them, there would have
been no cause for shaking off the yoke; but now, after that the Egyptians,
regardless of all justice, had broken faith with them, it was just that the
groaning and cries of His cruelly afflicted people should be heard by God. But
He always expressly asserts that this depended on the covenant, both that the
Jews might acknowledge him to be only bound to them by regard to His own free
promise, and also that, being persuaded that He is true to His promises, they
might more surely expect deliverance. The meaning of God's "remembering" His
promise I have elsewhere said to be, that he shews His remembrance of it by what
He does. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f73</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
What follows in the next verse, "Say unto the children of Israel, I am the
Lord," is intended to remove their doubts. It was a thing as impossible to human
apprehension, to tear away this weak and unwarlike people from their cruel
tyrants, as to rescue sheep from the jaws of wolves, and to preserve them in
safety after they had been mangled and wounded by their teeth. Therefore God
begins by declaring his incomparable power, to shew that there is no difficulty
with Him in performing anything whatever, although incredible. Therefore, he
adds, that he would "redeem them with a stretched-out arm, and with great
judgments,"<i> </i>as much as to say,<i> </i>I will give miraculous proofs of my
mighty power, which shall surpass all human apprehension. By "<i>judgments</i>,"
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f74</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He means the manner of His dealing, which would at the same time testify His
justice. For with the Hebrews this word means any disposition, method, order, or
custom, and sometimes also measure. We say in French, <i>facons notables ou
estranges</i>,<i> </i>(notable or strange
<i>fashions</i>.)</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will take you to
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The end of their liberation is here
described in the continued tenor of His grace. For it would have been little
that the people should once be redeemed from Egypt, unless, when redeemed, they
had lived under the defense and guardianship of God. As, therefore, He had long
since separated the holy seed of Abraham from the other nations by circumcision,
He now again sets it apart, (<i>sanctificat</i>,)<i> </i>and promises that he
will be their God. In these words, then, their peculiar election, as well as its
perpetuity, is asserted; since to be accounted the people of God means the same
as to be by especial privilege received into his favor, and to be called by
adoption to the hope of eternal salvation. But the future tense shews that the
benefit was not to be merely temporal, when God with a stretched-out arm shall
bring the people out of Egypt, but that this should only be the beginning of
eternal protection. Moreover, we should observe the <i>anagoge </i>or similitude
between us and the Israelites, because God has once delivered us by the hand of
his only-begotten Son from the tyranny of Satan, to this end, that he may always
pursue us with his paternal love. Afterwards he subjoins the possession of the
land of Canaan as an earnest or pledge, which was given to the Israelites, in
order that God might always dwell among them, protect them with his aid, and
defend them with his power. I have said that this was the earnest of their
adoption, because the faith of the fathers was not to be tied to earthly
blessings, but to tend to an higher object. Meanwhile, by this outward sign God
shewed them that they were his peculiar people, for whose habitation he chose
the land in which he would be worshipped. By saying He "would lift up his hand,"
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f75</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He means in confirmation, because the promise was ratified by the addition of an
oath. It is indeed certain that there is enough and more than enough
steadfastness in the simple word of God; but He made this concession to man's
weakness, and interposed His sacred name as a pledge, that they might with
fuller confidence be persuaded that nothing was promised them in vain. To lift
up the hand, means to swear; a similitude taken from men, who, by this gesture,
testify that they speak in the sight of God, as if they would call Him down as a
witness from heaven. This is not applicable to God, who swears by Himself,
because there is none greater to whom He may lift His hand,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580613&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
6:13;) but, metaphorically, the custom of men is transferred to Him. As to the
insertion, that "they should know that He was the Lord," after they had been
brought forth, it contains an indirect rebuke; since that knowledge is too late
which comes after the event. But at the same time, He promises that He would
cause them openly to experience how true He is in all His sayings, that the
Israelites may more constantly expect their redemption. Repeating at the close
that He is Jehovah, He magnifies (as He had just before done) His invincible
power, which easily surmounts all impediments; whilst this expression also
contains a testimony to His truth, as if He had said that He alone can be safely
trusted to, because He is both faithful in His promises and possessed of
infinite power.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses spake
so.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>From this verse it appears that
Moses is referring to the second message which he was commanded to bear. For
they had before heard with great joy and approbation, and had expressed their
thankfulness to God, that the time of their deliverance was come. Now Moses
relates that their hearts were shut against the announcement that he made to
them of this grace. Thus do the afflicted often, by closing their ears, shut the
gate against the promises of God, which is indeed a marvelous thing. For it is
not to be wondered at, if they who are full and intoxicated with prosperity,
reject the mercy of God; but it is contrary to nature that the sorrow which
ought to awaken the longings of those who are overwhelmed with trouble, should
be an obstacle to their receiving the comfort freely offered them of God. But it
is too common for people the more they are respectively afflicted, to harden
themselves against the reception of God's help. Moses relates that the children
of Israel were affected by this disease, when so kind an invitation of God was
repulsed from their deaf ears, because anguish had taken possession of their
hearts. But since it is natural for us to be thus straitened by pain and grief,
let us learn from this example to struggle that our minds should escape from
their sorrows, so far at least as to be able to receive the grace of God; for
there is no greater curse than to be rendered heavy and dull, so as to be deaf
to God's promises.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses more clearly sets forth how
indulgently God bore with the malevolent repulse of the people; the just reward
of which would have been, that He should have suffered them to rot a hundred
times over in their miseries, when they so obstinately rushed to their own
destruction. It is, therefore, of His extraordinary loving-kindness, that He
ceases not to aid those who are willing to perish. Moreover, it must be
observed, that Moses was strengthened by this new command, since he had been
himself shaken by the despair of the people. But; it was no trifling sin to be
so hardened and stupified by misfortune, as to reject the remedy proposed to
them. He might then reasonably conjecture, that he was to proceed no further,
lest he should be foolishly exposing himself to so many anxieties at his own
great peril, and with no profitable result. But God meets this temptation, and
commands him, nevertheless, to contend perseveringly with the obstinacy of
Pharaoh. But the answer of Moses shews, that this legation had been again
enjoined upon the holy man, since the time that the anguish of the people had
closed the way of God's grace. For when at first the people were aroused by the
first message to a cheerful hope of deliverance, this happy commencement had
encouraged Moses to extraordinary energy for the performance of his task; and
this might naturally fail him upon the unprosperous event which had now taken
place, until he had been animated anew to perseverance. He therefore asks to be
dismissed, lest his labor should be in vain, and reasons from the less to the
greater, since it would be much more difficult to influence the mind of Pharaoh
to give up his claims against his will, than to persuade the afflicted (people)
to receive the aid proffered to them from on high. But he had now learnt from
experience, that the people's hearts were as a door closed against God; why then
should he try to move the exceeding great rock from its place? Although it was
not his design to shake off the burden of the vocation imposed upon him, yet he
would have willingly withdrawn himself indirectly, and turned his back upon it.
Thus we sometimes see the heartiest of God's servants beginning to faint in the
midst of their course, especially when they encounter difficulties, and stumble
upon some path which is worse than they expected. Wherefore we must the more
earnestly entreat of God, that amidst the various trials against which we have
to struggle, He may never deprive us of the assistance of His power, but rather
continually inspire us with new strength in proportion to the violence of our
contests. But what hope of the deliverance now survived, the minister of which
was so down-hearted and depressed, and which the people themselves had so openly
despised, if God had not accomplished all things by Himself? Nor is there any
doubt that He wished to shew, by this failure on the part of men, that His own
hand was sufficient for Him. That Moses should call himself "of uncircumcised
lips," I refer to his stammering, which he had before alleged as an obstacle;
although, if any prefer to understand it otherwise, I make no strong
objection.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>

The drift is, that however often the work might have been in some way

people. But it is evident that he speaks of the first command, because he says

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These be the
heads.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The object of Moses here is to
testify to all ages the origin of his race, that none may doubt that, in the
free departure of the people, the promise given to Abraham was completed. For if
the Israelites had gone forth under any other leader, there might have been some
question as to the chief author of it; now, since Moses was chosen from that
family, and from the posterity of Abraham, it more dearly appears that the whole
matter was effected under the guidance of God. But although he enumerates not
only the tribe of Levi, but begins with Reuben the first-born, and then subjoins
Simeon, still it is easily seen that he especially refers to the tribe of Levi;
yet, because the families of Reuben and Simeon came first in order, he fitly
proceeds from them to the third. He does not, however, recount the others at
present, because a more favorable opportunity would occur hereafter. This, then,
is the point to be observed, that the minister of their deliverance, by whose
hand God would ratify the truth of His promise, was chosen from the race of
Abraham. And certainly we see how Satan in opposition has obscured, through
profane writers, this memorable history with many fables, and especially when he
cunningly endeavors to bury the race of Abraham. Moses, by divine wisdom,
anticipates this subtlety, mentioning the heads of the families by name, lest
there should be any obscurity about the origin of the
nation.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And these are the names of the
sons of Levi.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Because it was especially
desirable to know the origin of Moses and Aaron, he refers to it at greater
length, and more distinctly enmnerates the families which descended from the
patriarch Levi; not to attribute any peculiar dignity to his own race, but to
make it appear more dearly that the people was not brought out by any stranger,
but that he, who was to be the witness among his brethren of the power, and
grace, and truth of God, was divinely chosen from the genuine stock of Abraham.
And certainly it was right that this incomparable blessing of God, if any,
should not only be celebrated, but also proved, in order that its certainty
might be preserved, as well as its memory, in all ages. But how remote from any
ambitious feeling was the design of Moses in this narrative, we may gather from
a single part of it, where he says that he was the offspring of his father's
aunt; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f76</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for although the law had not yet forbidden illicit marriages, yet did nature
itself dictate, that it was improper for a nephew to have connection with his
aunt, who stands in the degree of his mother. When, therefore, Moses does not
hesitate to confess that he sprang from an incestuous marriage, he does not only
fail to consult his own reputation, but ingenuously proclaims the disgrace of
his parents, for the sake of illustrating solely the glory of God. Nor was
ignorance excusable, although the law was as yet unwritten, in neglecting the
distinction between right and wrong, by the violation of natural modesty. But
because men are too apt to indulge in such licentiousness, it was necessary to
prohibit in express terms these vile affections, which have almost always
immoderately and extensively prevailed amongst Orientals. Meanwhile, we may
learn that the imitation of the patriarchs is not safe, when we think that we
may indiscriminately adopt whatever they did. That in their long lives, Levi,
Kohath, and Amram begat so few children, viz., the first, three; the second,
four; the third, two; did not occur without the design on the part of God, that,
in the incredible fecundity which afterwards ensued, the miracle of His grace
might appear more clearly; for who would have thought that it could happen that,
in less than 200 years, so immense a multitude could spring from so few persons?
Nor did it happen by human provision; but after God, according to His wont, had
seemed to mock them in their humble and contemptible beginnings, His power was
more brightly manifested by their sudden and unusual multiplication. I pass over
some points which seem to be of little or no
importance.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These are that Aaron and
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is not without a cause that
Moses so often reasserts that their office was assigned to himself and his
brother by the command of God, both that the Israelites may perceive that they
were rescued from their deep abyss by divine grace, and that their minds may be
recalled to God's ancient covenant, and may acknowledge that their Fathers' hope
was not in vain; and, finally, that they may hereafter altogether devote
themselves to God. There seems, also, to be an indirect <i>antithesis
</i>between the armies of the people and two vile and abject men. For they<i>
</i>would have been far from being able to bear so weighty a burden, unless God
had exceeded all their hopes in working miraculously by their hands. Therefore
the Spirit magnifies elsewhere this grace, that God</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"led his people, like a
flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197720&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
77:20)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For what could be less probable than that a great
multitude, which would make up many nations, should obey the commands of two
men, should be ruled by their counsel, and gathered into one place by their
exertions, in order that they should migrate into another land against the will
of a very powerful king? For what was their united authority to command twelve
armies, separated in their several battalions? What no earthly kings, with all
their power and wisdom, their terror and their threats, could effect, God
performed by means of two unwarlike men, neither experienced nor renowned; when
Moses himself, alarmed by the magnitude of the work, often deprecated the
commission entrusted to him. For, at the end of this chapter, he again repeats
his excuse, that he was not eloquent, but of hesitating and embarrassed speech.
This, then, is the point to which all tends, viz., to assign to God the praise
of His loving-kindness, and to heighten His glory. There is some ambiguity in
verse 28, for it might be read separately with this sense, that "God not only
spoke in the wilderness of Midian, to set Moses over the people in their
deliverance, but also in Egypt after some time had elapsed;" thus "on the
day,"<i> </i>would mean, "after some time," but it seems better to me to read
the three verses in connection with each other.</font><br><br></div>

consolation was afforded him in his anxiety, and a remedy given for his want of
faith; since he was both armed himself with divine authority, and Aaron was
appointed as his companion and assistant. For that he was "made<i> </i>a god to
Pharaoh," means that he was furnished with supreme authority and power, whereby
he should cast down the tyrant's pride. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f77</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Nor did God take away anything from Himself in order to transfer it to Moses;
since He so communicates to His servants what is peculiar to Himself as to
remain Himself in His completeness. Nay, whenever He seems to resign a part of
His glory to His ministers, He only teaches that the virtue and efficacy of His
Spirit will be joined with their labors, that they may not be fruitless. Moses,
therefore, was a god to Pharaoh; because in him God exerted His power, that he
should be superior to the greatness of the king. It is a common figure of the
Hebrews, to give the title of God to all things excellent, since He alone reigns
over heaven and earth, and exalts or casts down angels, as well as men,
according to His will. By this consolation, as I have said, the weakness of
Moses was supported, so that, relying on God's authority, he might fearlessly
despise the fierceness of the king. A reinforcement is also given him in the
person of his brother, lest his stammering should be any hinderance to him. It
has been already remarked, that it was brought about by the ingratitude of
Moses, that half the honor should be transferred to his brother; although God,
in giving him as his companion, so far lessened his dignity as to put the
younger before the first-born. The name of "Prophet" is here used for an
interpreter; because the prophetical office proceeds from God alone. But,
because God delivered through one to the other what He wished to be said or
done, Aaron is made subject to Moses, just as if he had been God; since it is
fit that they should be listened to without contradiction who are the
representatives of God. And this is made clearer in the second verse, where God
restricts the power given to Moses, and circumscribes it within its proper
bounds; for, when He directs him to speak whatever He commands, He ranks him as
His minister, and confines him under authority, without departing from His own
rights.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will
harden.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As the expression is somewhat
harsh, many commentators, as I have before said, take pains to soften it. Hence
it is that some take the words in connection, "I<i> </i>will harden Pharaoh's
heart by multiplying my signs;" as if God were pointing out the external cause
of his obstinacy. But Moses has already declared, and will hereafter repeat it,
that the king's mind was hardened by God in other ways besides His working
miracles. As to the meaning of the words, I have no doubt that, by the first
clause, God armed the heart of His servant with firmness, to resist boldly the
perversity of the tyrant; and then reminds him that he has the remedy in his
hand. Thus, then, I think this passage must be translated, "I indeed will harden
Pharaoh's heart, but I will multiply my signs;" as though He had said, his
hardness will be no obstacle to you, for the miracles will be sufficient to
overcome it. In the same sense, He adds immediately afterwards, "Although<i>
</i>Pharaoh should not hear you, still I will lay on my hand;" for thus, in my
opinion, the conjunctions should be resolved <i>adversatively</i>.<i> </i>I do
not altogether reject the interpretation of others; "I will harden Pharaoh's
heart, that I may multiply my signs;" and, "He 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f78</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
will not hearken unto you, that I may lay on my hand." And, in fact, God willed
that Pharaoh should pertinaciously resist Moses, in order that the deliverance
of the people might be more conspicuous. There is, however, no need of
discussing at length the manner in which God hardens reprobates, as often as
this expression occurs. Let us hold fast to what I have already observed, that
they are but poor speculators who refer it to a mere bare permission; because if
God, by blinding their minds, or hardening their hearts, inflicts deserved
punishment upon the reprobate, He not only permits them to do what they
themselves please, but actually executes a judgment which He knows to be just.
Whence also it follows, that He not only withdraws the grace of His Spirit, but
delivers to Satan those whom he knows to be deserving of blindness of mind and
obstinacy of heart. Meanwhile, I admit that the blame of either evil rests with
the men themselves, who willfully blind themselves, and with a willfulness which
is like madness, are driven, or rather rush, into sin. I have also briefly shewn
what foul calumniators are they, who for the sake of awakening ill-will against
us, pretend that God is thus made to be the author of sin; since it would be an
act of too great absurdity to estimate His secret and incomprehensible judgments
by the little measure of our own apprehension. The opponents of this doctrine
foolishly and inconsiderately mix together two different things, since the
hardness of heart is the sin of man, but the hardening of the heart is the
judgment of God. He again propounds in this place His great judgments, in order
that the Israelites may expect with anxious and attentive minds His magnificent
and wonderful mode of
operation.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Egyptians shall
know.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is a species of irony, viz.,
that the Egyptians, subdued by the plagues, should at last begin to feel that
their contention was against God. The object, however, of God was to encourage
Moses, lest he should fail before the madness and fury of his enemies.
Therefore, although the Egyptians might be stupid n their rage, still God
declares that in the end they would know that they had fought to their own
destruction when they waged war against heaven; for there is an implied
<i>antithesis</i> between their tardy acknowledgment of this and their present
slowness of heart, which was at length forcibly removed when God thundered
openly against them from heaven. For we know how unconcernedly the wicked oppose
their 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f79</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
iron obstinacy to the Divine threatenings, until they are forced into a state of
alarm by violence; not because they are humbled beneath the hand of God, but
because they see that by all their raging and turbulence they cannot escape from
punishment; just as drunkards, awakened from their intoxication, would willingly
drown their senses in eternal sleep, and even in annihilation; yet, whether they
will or not, they must bear the pains of their intemperance. Moreover, this
acknowledgment which was to be extorted from the unwilling, admonished Moses and
others 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f80</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to attribute just praise to the power of God, before they were experimentally
convinced of it. It is true, indeed, that the sincere worshippers of God also
are sometimes instructed by punishments, (to which reference is made,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
26:9, "when<i> </i>thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world
will learn righteousness;") but a kind of "knowledge" is here pointed out which
so prostrates the reprobate that they cease not to lift up their horns, as it
were, against God; and thus it casts them down without amending them. There was
also an experimental knowledge for the elect people, of which mention has been
already made,

the Lord your God, after that I shall have brought you out from the land of
Egypt;"</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">but this (properly speaking) is nothing more than a
confirmation of the faith which, before the event takes place, is content with
the simple word. Or, God certainly, by the event itself, reproves the dullness
of His people when He sees that their confidence in His own word is not
sufficiently strong. But the wicked so know God, that, lost in shame and fear,
they see not what they do see.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses and Aaron
did.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is not for the sake of boasting
that Moses reports his own obedience; but after having ingenuously confessed his
hesitation, he now relates that he and his brother were in better courage for
the performance of their office. In the meantime he shows that he, as well as
his brother, was God's minister, and that he brought no industry, nor talent,
nor counsel, nor dexterity himself, but simply obeyed God. Still from their
example we must learn, that as we may not set about anything except what God
prescribes, so we ought obediently and without objection to pursue whatever He
commands. What follows as to their age is meant in amplification; since it was
no common case, considering the natural coldness and heaviness of old age, that
two octogenarians should have actively engaged in so difficult a charge. For I
do not assent to the opinion of those who think that their dignity was enhanced
by their age. I admit that age is venerable; but Moses had far different views,
namely, that, excluding all human means, he might celebrate God's glory, who
performed so mighty a work by men who were failing and decrepit with age. For
although their vigor was as yet unabated, their old age might have made them
timid, and might have also affected the people with anxiety, when they beheld
their leaders to be not only of advanced age, but even naturally not far from
the grave.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

repeats the same thing, because he wrote for persons of rude and dull minds. But
it behooves us, lest we should be disgusted by his simple and popular style,
diligently to examine how little we are inclined to be acute and earnest in our
consideration of the works of God. No doubt there is here related what we have
already heard respecting the change of the rod into a serpent, except that he
now tells us that the miracle which had before been performed in the wilderness
of Midian, and afterwards in Egypt, in the sight of the people, was likewise
performed once more before Pharaoh. Moreover, we gather from hence that at the
request of Pharaoh the servants of God had proved and testified their vocation;
and therefore that his pertinacity was the less excusable, since he despised the
power of God so manifestly shewn forth. For this is usual with unbelievers, to
demand proofs of God's power, which they may still discredit, &#8212; not that
they professedly scorn God, but because their secret impiety urges them to seek
after subterfuges. The message is disagreeable and full of what is annoying to
the proud king; and because he does not dare directly to refuse God, he invents
a plausible pretext for his refusal, by asking for a miracle; and when this is
performed, he seeks still deeper lurking places, as we shall very soon perceive.
Since, therefore, it was certain that he would not pay a willing obedience to
the divine command, and would not yield before he had been miraculously
convinced, God furnishes His servants with a notable and sure testimony of His
power. Moreover, the change of the crook, or shepherd's staff, into a serpent
had this object, namely, that the mean<i> </i>and rustic guise of Moses should
not be despised. For (since kings are wont to exalt themselves very highly)
Pharaoh might have laughed at the audacity of Moses and Aaron, who, forgetful,
as it seemed, of their condition, put themselves into conflict with the whole
power of Egypt; but Pharaoh knew, although they were not to be dreaded for their
splendid appearance, and had nothing magnificent about them, that they were
still not destitute of sure and strong help, when he saw the serpent come forth
from the rod. In a word, God bore witness that His power is hidden beneath the
infirmity of His servants, so that at every season He might render formidable to
the greatest monarchs those who otherwise are like earthen vessels. It is not
clear to me why Aaron was commanded to cast down the rod rather than Moses,
unless, perhaps, because God would designedly humble the pride of the arrogant
king, when He did not deign to exert His power by the hand of His superior
servant, but only employed the inferior one. Therefore, with reference to this
ministration, the rod of God and of Moses is now called the rod of Aaron. Thus
Paul boasts of <i>his </i>gospel, the office of preaching which he knew to be
committed to him.

conscious of their vocation; and knew that they were endued with divine power
for working miracles, yet would they never have dared to approach the fierce and
cruel tyrant, unless the inward inspiration of the Spirit had armed them to
persevere. Hence, then, arose their magnanimity to overcome all terrors; because
God raised them by faith above everything that is lofty on earth, and sustained
them by this support. Therefore do they come to the conflict with invincible
strength, and confirm by a miracle their most hateful mission. But as to the
question which is ordinarily raised here, whether the change of the rods was
true and substantial, as they call it; with respect to that of Moses, I am
confidently persuaded that it was so; for there is no more difficulty with God
to change the forms of things, than there was to create heaven and earth out of
nothing. Philosophers are not ignorant of the great variety of transmutations
which occur in nature, nay, it is patent even to the uninstructed; but, because
the rod was changed into a serpent in an extraordinary manner, and contrary to
the course of nature, we must form the same judgment of it as of the change of
Lot's wife into a pillar of salt; except that the rod soon after returned into
its original nature.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011926&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
19:26.) There is more reason for doubt respecting<i> </i>the rods of the
magicians, since it is probable that the eyes of the wicked king were deceived
by their illusions. But there would be nothing absurd in our saying, that such
liberty was conceded to them by God, not that they should create one body out of
another, but that they should set forth the work of God as being their own. For
assuredly the potency of error far surpasses the bounds of our comprehension.
This Paul affirms to be given to Satan for the punishment of unbelievers,
"that<i> </i>they should believe a lie," because they will not obey the truth.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;530211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 2:11.) He says, indeed, that the coming of Antichrist shall be
with signs and lying wonders, but by adding the word "power," he shews that the
deception or illusion shall not consist so much in the external form of things,
as in the perverse abuse of signs. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f81</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Therefore Christ absolutely pronounces that "false prophets shall shew great
signs and wonders."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402424&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
24:24.) It might be, then, that God in just vengeance might choose the rods of
the magicians to be changed into serpents; as we shall hereafter see that the
waters were changed by their enchantments into blood, that the earth was covered
with frogs and lice, that the fields were smitten with hail, and the atmosphere
darkened.

Still we must be assured, that not even a fly can be created except by God only;
but that Satan lays hold, for the purpose of his impostures, of things which are
done by the secret judgment of
God.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Pharaoh also
called.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The impiety of the tyrant, which
had before lain hid in the recesses of his heart, now breaks forth; when he does
not hesitate to enter into the lists with God. For he was sufficiently
instructed in the wonderful power of God, had not his iniquity urged him onwards
into desperate madness. In asking for a sign, he thought (as I before said) that
he should have had just cause for despising Moses; as the wicked trust that they
may do anything with impunity, unless God should openly appear from heaven to
prohibit them; but, because inflexible perversity altogether has possession of
their hearts, they do not hesitate to resist the manifest power of God. Thus the
wickedness of Pharaoh blinded his eyes, that, seeing the light, he saw it not;
but, though convinced, still he sought for darkness to hide the sight of the
light from him. He received, therefore, the just reward of such impious and
diabolical arrogance, when he was deceived by the juggles of his own magicians.
This is an example of great use, and well worthy to be noted; by which we are,
first of all, taught, that the wicked, whatever disposition to be taught they
may assume, still remain inwardly rebellious and stubborn; and, moreover, that
they are not only inclined to error, but are eagerly borne towards it with all
their heart. This vice is not always conspicuous in every individual; but when
God brings His light nearer to them, it is easily detected, and betrays itself.
How many, now-a-days, among the Papists are followers of wicked superstitions
under the pretext of simplicity? As long as, under the garb of ignorance, they
deceive themselves and others, they seem to be worthy of pity; but, as soon as
the truth shines forth, they<i> </i>demonstrate their love for the impostures by
which they perish, and their delight in falsehoods. Assuredly (as Paul says)they
have "received not the love of the truth."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;530210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2

by whose fascinating and fair words they may become besotted in their errors. It
is remarkable, that they are honourably called "wise<i> </i>men" by courtesy,
although they were but inventors of deceit, and destitute of sound learning. For
although astronomy flourished among them, and the study of liberal arts was
cultivated, it yet appears from the context that they were devoted to many
foolish imaginations, nay, that all their degenerate science was but vanity. For

signifying jugglers, or those who deceive the eyes and the senses by their
enchantments; but the latter is used for those who cast nativities, telling
people's fortunes by the horoscope, and prognosticating by the aspect of the
stars. Therefore, although the Egyptian magicians had departed from genuine
philosophy, they still retained the name of "wise men," that they might obtain
credit for their delusions: as the devil, in order to appropriate God's glory,
or to change himself into an angel of light, is wont to conceal his falsehoods
by specious titles. Doubtless Pharaoh sought, as in a case of perplexity, to
examine it more certainly by comparison; but yet for no other reason than to
conceal his impiety under a fresh covering. The word

<i>lahat</i>,<i> </i>although properly signifying the blade of a sword, is here
used for enchantment. I think, however, that they mistake, who assign the reason
for this to be, that they exercised their sorceries by a sword, or some similar
weapon. It rather designates metaphorically the versatile motion, by which the
magicians exhibit one thing for another; for it properly signifies "a<i>
</i>flame." This severe and terrible vengeance upon Pharaoh ought to inspire us
with terror, lest, in our hatred of truth, we should seek after deceptions. For
this is intolerable profaneness, if designedly we desire to pervert the
distinction between truth and falsehood. Therefore it is not to be wondered at,
if God plunges into the deepest darkness of error, those who shut their eyes
against the light presented to them; and if He hands those over to be the
disciples of Satan, who refuse to listen to Him as their
master.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For they cast down every
man.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The number of the magicians is not

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;550308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 3:8,) it is probable that they were not the only ones, but the chief,
and, as it were, the ringleaders. But I will not dispute this questionable
point. The admonition of Paul is more to the purpose, that "as Jannes and
Jambres withstood Moses," so also there should always be false teachers, who
would oppose Christ's true ministers, and indeed should "wax<i> </i>worse and
worse." (Verse 13.) It is an awful fact that the reins were so given to these
magicians, that they contended with Moses in almost an equal contest. But the
ingratitude of the world is worthy of bearing the same punishment of blindness.
God elsewhere testifies that when He permits false prophets to work miracles to
deceive, it is to prove men's hearts.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
13:3.) And truly, unless our own hypocrisy were like a veil to take away the
distinction between black and white, Satan would avail nothing by such arts and
deceptions; but we ourselves, as if devoted to destruction, willingly cast
ourselves into his nets; but especially against the reprobate, who obstinately
seek for occasions of error, God casts this last thunderbolt, namely, He gives
efficacy to the delusion, and so deprives them of their senses at the same time,
that they do not guard themselves from manifest destruction. Many indeed would
excuse Pharaoh, because, being deceived by his magicians, he did not disentangle
himself from the error which he could not escape; for what could he do when he
saw the contest equally maintained? But it must be thoroughly understood that
none are so hurried away except those whom God would resist; especially the
spirit of confusion and mental blindness seizes on those who have been obstinate
in their wickedness. Nor must the mark of distinction be overlooked, that the
rod of Moses swallowed up the rods of the magicians. How then was it that
Pharaoh did not perceive Moses to be victorious? how was it that he rather
turned aside to his own impostors? how was it, in fine, that he did not
acknowledge God's servant who had been superior in the contest, except that the
wicked maliciously close their eyes against the manifested power of God?
Whosoever will aim at the right mark shall certainly never be destitute of God
as his guide. Therefore blame is justly thrown upon Pharaoh, because through the
hardness of his heart he would not attend. Too frivolous is that cavil which the
Papists advance, that the serpent is called the rod of Moses, as the bread
transubstantiated into the body of Christ retains the name of bread; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f87</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for they unskillfully confound two altogether different things; because, in the
mystery of the Lord's Supper, the analogy between the sign and the thing
signified always remains; in this miracle the case is entirely otherwise. Again,
because the change was only temporary, Moses properly called that a rod to which
its previous form was presently to be restored. Besides, in comparing the true
serpent with the fictitious ones, he was unwilling to make a difference in
names. But, to pass all this over, the Papists will prevail nothing, until they
have shewn that the bread is transubstantiated into the body. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f88</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Nay, what they foolishly wrest against us, we may retort upon them, namely, that
the bread is called the body of Christ although it remains bread, just as the
serpent which then appeared is called the
rod.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses now begins to relate the
two plagues which were inflicted upon Egypt before Pharaoh was induced to obey;
and although there was something prodigious in the madness which strove against
God's hand so powerfully constraining him, yet in the person of this single
reprobate, the picture of human pride and rebellion, when it is not controlled
by a spirit of tractableness, is presented to our view. Let the faithful then be
admonished by this narrative diligently to beware, lest, by wantonly rebelling
against God, they provoke a similar vengeance upon themselves. For the same
Being who hardened Pharaoh's heart is the constant avenger of impiety, and,
smiting His enemies with a spirit of confusion, renders them as furious as they
are senseless. Moreover, lest Moses, stumbling against this obstacle, should
desist from the course he had begun, God encourages him to the combat, as much
as to say, that he had to contend with a very hard stone until it should be
broken. Hearing that Pharaoh's heart was hardened, he might begin to waver,
unless a hope of victory were shewn him from elsewhere. But since the obstinacy
of this beast is indomitable, God arms His servant with new weapons, as much as
to say, that he must be worn down though he could not be broken. But although to
some the analogy may appear far-fetched, between the ten plagues and the ten
precepts of the law, yet, in my opinion, it is probable, and agreeable to
reason, that before God promulgated the law the wicked were smitten with as many
plagues as He was about to give precepts to His people, that in this way He
might confirm their authority. First, however, He commands Moses to take up the
rod, and reminds him of the recent miracle that he may gird himself to the new
conflict with greater confidence. Then, after the Hebrew manner, He more fully
lays open what He had briefly touched upon; for, at first, no mention is made of
Aaron, but God only announces to Moses what He would have done; then He explains
that the hand of Aaron was to be interposed. Where God reminds them that the rod
was lately turned into a serpent, He shews that we profit but little by His
works, unless our faith gathers strength from them. Besides, when God denounces
to Pharaoh what He is going to do, He renders him more inexcusable, because he
is not awakened by threats to repentance. God indeed knew<i> </i>that this would
be without success; but although he knows the disease to be incurable, He still
ceases not to apply the remedies &#8212; not indeed such as will restore health,
but such as will draw out the secret poison from the mind. Many are here at
issue (<i>litigant</i>)<i> </i>with God, because He not only speaks to the deaf,
but even, by admonishing or chastising them in vain, exasperates their malice
more and more. But it is for us, when any appearance of unreasonableness
perplexes us, reverently to adore the secret<i> </i>judgments of God and to be
soberly wise. Meanwhile the event shews that God's threatenings do not fall
ineffectually, but that the contempt of them doubles both the crime and the
punishment.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is the more extended
narrative of which I spoke; for Moses mentions nothing different from what went
before, but explains more distinctly his mode of action in the performance of
the miracle, namely, that what God had commanded was completed by the
instrumentality of Aaron. There was a reason for commencing with this miracle,
that the Egyptians might know that there was no safeguard for them in the
resources upon which they prided themselves the most. We know what great wealth,
defense, and conveniences arose to them from the Nile; thence came their
abundant fisheries, thence the fertility of their whole country, which it
irrigated in its inundation, a thing that, in other lands is injurious; its
navigation was most advantageous for their merchants, it was also a strong
fortification to a good part of the kingdom. Therefore, in order to cast down
the Egyptians from their principal dependence, He turns its waters into blood.
Besides, because water is one of the two elements of which man's life consists,
in depriving the Egyptians of one part of their life, He used the best and
shortest method of humiliating their haughtiness, had they not been altogether
intractable. He might, indeed, by a single breath, have dried up all the sources
of water, and overwhelmed the whole nation by drought; but this would have been
commonly believed to have happened by chance, or naturally, and therefore would
have been a less apparent prodigy, whilst it would have shut up the way for
others. It would, then, have been sufficient, by the terror of death it
awakened, to turn them to the fear of God, unless their madness had been
desperate. Moses enumerates, besides the river, the streams, and ponds, and
pools of water; because, in different parts of the country, as well artificially
as naturally, the Nile was so diffused, that scarcely any other country is
provided in all directions with such an abundance of water; as though God should
say, "It shall avail you nothing to possess such an immense supply of water;
because you shall thirst as much as if the Nile were dry."<i> </i>He adds, "both
in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone;"<i> </i>meaning, that in whatever
kind of vessel they came to draw, they would find nothing but
blood.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses and Aaron did
so.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He repeats that what God threatened
as to the death of the fish, and the stinking of the Nile, actually took place;
that he may aggravate the sin of the king, who was unaffected by the manifold
power of God. Still he immediately adds that his counsellors witnessed it also.
Hence we may conjecture, that the same infatuation had pervaded the whole court.
It was also proper that so memorable a circumstance should not only be known
generally, but that its author should be seen by many eyes. But it was a sign of
the reprobation of the whole nation, that there was none of all that multitude
who labored to correct the folly of the king. Whence also it appears that God
confounds the wisdom of the world; for there was no nation which gloried more in
its universal knowledge; even as Isaiah reproaches them of their boast.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231911&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
19:11.) But we see in how shameful a manner, on the one hand proud, and on the
other amazed, they betrayed not a single spark of sound
intelligence.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the magicians of Egypt did
so.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>A question arises as to how the
magicians could imitate Moses, when the material to work upon no longer
remained; for, if there were no water left in Egypt, its transmutation was
impossible. But I have no doubt but that, for the purpose of their illusion,
pure and clear waters appeared for a little while, and then were changed into
blood. For, since the season for concluding the contests was not yet arrived,
doubtless God opened a way for Himself, until they reached their end. The
supposition of Augustine 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f89</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is a forced one, that the magicians took the water, which remained pure and
unaltered among the habitations of the Israelites. I should more willingly
accept what he says, that, perhaps the waters were smitten by them at the same
instant, so that in one place the power of God shone forth, in another their
deception prevailed &#8212; although the solution I have given is very
sufficient. Whether the change were true or imaginary, I dare not decide; except
that it is more in accordance with the delusions of Satan, that the eyes of the
wicked were deceived. Nor is there any necessity to philosophize more subtilely
with Augustine, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f90</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that there is a seminal principle infused into all created things, so that one
species may generate another. We may rather take our stand on the teaching of
Paul, that God sends strong delusion to ensnare the unbelievers with lies,
because they refuse to embrace the truth,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;530211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 2:11;) and I have already shewn from another passage of Moses,
that, by the just judgment of God, false prophets perform signs and wonders.
Moses, however, seems to hint that it was only an illusion, where he adds, "the
magicians did so <i>with their enchantments</i>;"<i> </i>as if the flashes, as
of lightning, dazzled the eyes of the spectators; for this I have shewn to be
the meaning of the word. Yet I do not question but that God altogether preserved
His people from this calamity, so that these guests and strangers were supplied
with the water of Egypt, whilst not a drop was left for the natives of the land.
Thus was the king convicted of obstinacy, because<i> </i>he was not more
attentive to observe this distinction; nay, he must have been doubly mad and
foolish, to the destruction of himself and his kingdom, to set the delusion of
the magicians against the power of God. But this often happens to the reprobate,
that they rush eagerly as it were to their own destruction, whilst they are
borne away by satanic impulse in opposition to God. Yet this was no slight
temptation to God's servants, to see the ministers of Satan almost rivaling
themselves. For, if God chose to bear witness to their deliverance by miracles,
&#8212; when they saw their enemies endued with a similar power, how could their
own vocation be ratified and sure? And indeed it is probable that their faith
was shaken by these machinations; yet I count it certain that it did not yield
and give way; for, if Moses had been overcome by doubt, he would have confessed
it, as it was his custom to do. But God opened their eyes, so that they should
regard with contempt the tricks and deceptions of the magicians; besides, the
divine vision had shone upon them together with the word, so that it was no
marvel that, thus supported, they should repel, or sustain, every assault with
firmness.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Pharaoh turned.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">In this word Moses teaches us that the hardness
of heart, to which God had devote Pharaoh, was voluntary; so that the sin rested
in himself, nor did the secret appointment of God avail anything to lessen his
culpability, for his folly is condemned, because he did not "set his heart to
this also." Whence it follows that he was the author of his own obstinacy,
because, being blinded by pride and contempt, he took no account of the glory of
God. Thus the wicked, although as being vessels of wrath, they are cast of God
into a reprobate mind, still harden themselves, because wittingly and willfully
they run against God, and thus their security, audacity, and perverseness take
away from them the excuse of ignorance or error. Wherefore this example warns us
not to slumber when God arouses us, but attentively to consider His works, which
may instruct us to reverence and fear Him. The statement that the Egyptians dug
wells for themselves increases the certainty of the miracle, as does also what
is added as to the seven days; for if the corruption of the water had only been
momentary, some suspicion of delusion might have crept in, which was removed
both by the continued taste and appearance. Therefore it was said before, that
the Egyptians would suffer inconvenience and pain

from the want of water; for thus I explain it, that they should be sorrowful and

now begun, God demands of Pharaoh His own peculiar right, viz., that His people
should serve Him, but out of the land of Egypt, that His worship might be
separate and pure from all defilement, for He desired (as was before said) by
this separation of His people to condemn the superstitions of the Egyptians.
Meanwhile there was no excuse for the tyrant, when, with sacrilegious boldness,
he presumed to deprive God of His just honor. Therefore, in refusing to let them
go, he was declared not only to be cruel, but also a despiser of God.
Threatening is also added, that at least he may, however unwillingly, be driven
to obey; for thus must the stubborn be dealt with, who never are brought to duty
except when forced by fear or punishment. Indeed, God sometimes also threatens
His own servants, in order to stimulate their laziness; but especially is He
more severe towards the perverse and disobedient. Thus is it said,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191826&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

when He addresses Pharaoh. In this second plague there are, besides, two things
to be remarked by us; for, <i>first</i>,<i> </i>God shews that the Egyptians had
hitherto held their lives by a precarious tenure, as it were, because He had
protected them from the incursion of frogs by His special mercy. We know that
Egypt, on account of its many marshes, and the sluggish and almost stagnant
Nile, was full of frogs and venomous animals; now, when great multitudes of them
come forth suddenly, cover the surface of the fields, penetrate even to the
houses and bed-chambers, and finally ascend even into the royal palace, it
plainly appears that they were before only restrained by God's hand, and thus
that the God of the Hebrews was the guardian and keeper of that kingdom.
<i>Secondly</i>,<i> </i>God chose not only to inflict a punishment upon the
Egyptians, but to expose them to mockery by its ignominious nature; nor can we
doubt but that their pain must have been much embittered by this contumely, when
they saw that they were thus evil-entreated not by some victorious army, but by
filthy reptiles; and besides this, that their calamity had its origin in the
Nile, which enriched their country with so many advantages. But let us learn
from this history that there are many deaths mixed up with our life, and that it
is not otherwise lengthened out to us, except as God restrains the dangers which
everywhere beset us; and again, although He may not openly strike us with
lightning from heaven, nor arm his angels for the destruction of men, still, at
His slightest nod, all creatures are ready to execute this judgments; and,
therefore, we must ascribe it to His kindness and long-suffering, if the wicked
do not perish at each moment. Finally, if we are<b> </b>ever galled by ignominy
or disgrace, let us remember that this happens designedly, that the shame itself
may mortify our pride.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto
Moses, Say unto Aaron.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is
questionable whether God thus enjoined Moses in a continuous address, or whether
He waited until Pharaoh contumaciously despised His command. It is probable,
indeed, that after Pharaoh had paid no attention to the threats, the execution
of the punishment was commanded. Meantime, we must recollect what I before said,
that Moses moved not even a finger; but, as he had been commanded, transferred
the active measures to his inferior minister, that thus Pharaoh might be treated
more contemptuously. It was thus that he overwhelmed the whole land, as it were,
by a breath. But although in this way God cast down the fierce tyrant in his
swelling pride to be trampled beneath their feet, still the wickedness of the
magicians did not rest. Thus was it requisite that the servants of God should be
exercised by constant contests one after
another.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Pharaoh called for
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Pharaoh at last appears to be
softened, and to lay aside some of his fierceness; but it will soon appear that
he was not really tamed. It may indeed have been that, seized with terror, he
seriously took refuge in cries for pardon; but that he lied to God, and to
himself, is plain from his very inconstancy; because, as soon as a reprieve was
granted, he returned to his natural disposition, nay, he effectively manifested
that his malice was only repressed by fear, since it presently began to vent
itself again. Thus do hypocrites, when they are beneath God's afflicting hand,
or tremble under the apprehension of His chastenings, humbly and submissively
implore His mercy; but when the evil has been withdrawn for a little while, this
short truce puffs up their hearts, as if they had attained an eternal peace. The
Prophet complains in the psalm, that thus also it happened with the
Jews,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"When<i> </i>he slew them,
then they sought him; and they returned and inquired early after God; and they
remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer;
nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him
with their tongues; for their heart was not right with him, neither were they
steadfast in his covenant."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197834&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
78:34-37.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">In fine, this is a disease common to
all hypocrites, that, having found by experience their frowardness to be
destructive to them, they feign penitence for the sake of obtaining pardon,
because they cannot escape the judgments of God; but, when they fancy themselves
escaped, they hasten back to the same pride, they kick against God, and even
wantonly insult him; in a word, it is only their trouble that humbles them and
that only for a short time. But although Pharaoh's fear extorted this from him,
that he sought for Moses to entreat for him, and was anxious to appease God, yet
was it a token of his deceitful and double mind, that he made it, as it were, a
bargain, that the frogs should be taken away before he let the people go. His
impiety, therefore, lay concealed in his heart, so long as he thought that he
could not defy God with impunity; but, relying confidently on impunity, he
manifested his deceit and perfidy. Although it was not with any sincere feeling
of repentance that he now humbly speaks of Jehovah by name, yet it shews that
the stoutness of his spirit was broken, of which mention was made before, when
he inquired in mockery, "Who is the
Lord?"</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses said unto
Pharaoh.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Commentators differ as to the
meaning of this passage. They are too speculative who expound it, that this
honor was granted to Pharaoh, that he should fix the time in which Moses was to
pray. Again, there is a flatness in the exposition, that Pharaoh might glory
because the frogs were to die. Those who expound it, that Pharaoh should be
freed from the frogs, so that he might glory in safety, express part of the
meaning, but not the whole. It rather appears to me that there is an implied
<i>antithesis </i>between the perverse boasting, wherewith Pharaoh had exulted,
and that pious glowing which he ought to seek for in the mercy of God; as if
Moses had said, "Thus far you have exalted yourself improperly, trusting in your
power, and afterwards when bewitched by the enchantments; now rather glory,
because you have an <i>intercessor </i>and patron to plead for you to God." For
it was needful that the arrogance, which had so falsely elevated him, that he
dared to contend with God, should be crushed, and that no hope should be left
him, save in the mercy of God. But to "glory<i> </i>over" Moses, means that he
should seek his glory in the advocacy of Moses, and should account it a very
great happiness that he should deign to interpose for his reconciliation with
God. For<i> </i>the<i> particle
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l[</font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f93</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is often so taken. Yet Moses by no means wished to detract at all from the
glory of God; but (as I have lately said) desiring to humble the pride of the
haughty king, he told him that nothing would be better and more glorious for him
than to have a good hope of pardon, when he had obtained as his advocate the
servant of the living God, whom he so cordially hated. He only affirms that the
frogs should "remain<i> </i>in the river;" as much as to say that they should be
content with their ordinary habitation and bounds; for we know that frogs,
although they sometimes jump out on the bank, still do not go far from the
water, because they are nourished by humidity. Thus he hints that they were let
loose by God's command to cover the ground, and that it was still in His power,
if He chose, that they should invade the fields and houses again in new
multitudes; and that it must be ascribed to His blessing, if they kept
themselves in the waters, and did not make incursions beyond their own
boundaries.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he said,
Tomorrow.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>If you refer this to Moses,
there is ambiguity in the sense; but, it being probable that they were Pharaoh's
words, I think that he is asking for a respite till tomorrow, before he lets the
people go. For they fall into an absurdity, who think that he asked Moses to
drive away the frogs by his prayers on the morrow, as if Pharaoh went quietly to
sleep, and put off the remedy of the evil. There is, then, no pretence for
understanding it, that Pharaoh, as if his mind were quite tranquil and unmoved,
desired to have his land delivered from the frogs on the following day: but
rather it means, that if he be released from this difficulty, he promises the
discharge of the people, but yet suspends it till the next day, for the purpose
of deceit. For there was no other reason for this procrastination, except that,
having obtained what he wanted, he might depart from his engagement, as he
actually did; but Moses, satisfied with this promise, undertakes to bring it
about that God should disperse the frogs; and this, I doubt not, was performed
on the same day. For this was the cause of the tyrant's changing his
determination, that, by the interposition of the night, his fear departed. And,
certainly, it is gathered from the following words, that the frogs were soon
after removed; for it is said that Moses and Aaron prayed after they had gone
out; which would be but little in accordance with the notion, that the next day
was waited for. It is not by any rash or presumptuous impulse that Moses affirms
that Pharaoh should obtain his desire; because it appears from his success that
he was assured of its being God's will. Thus often are the prophets, although no
spoken revelation may intervene, directed nevertheless by the secret inspiration
of the Spirit. In this confidence, also, Moses declares that Pharaoh should know
that there is none other God to be compared with the God of Israel. This,
moreover, is the true knowledge of God, when whatsoever lifts itself up to
obscure His glory, is reduced to its proper level, and every high thing yields
or is cast down, so that He alone may be
exalted.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blot when Pharaoh
saw.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Hence it appears that the wretched
tyrant, like a winding serpent, twisted and turned his mind to crooked counsels;
for when he was trembling beneath the present feeling of God's power, he dared
not obstinately resist any longer; he only sought a little breathing time; now,
being freed from fear, he returns to his former contumacy. But this is a sign of
a perverse and crooked disposition, not to submit willingly, but to pay only a
temporary deference, when necessity is more than usually urgent. God foreknew,
and had foretold to Moses, that this perfidy was hidden in the recesses of his
heart; but he was willing to bring it to light, and therefore remitted the
punishment; and hence was the opportunity for
dissembling.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto

Aaron is commanded to act as the inferior of Moses in punishing the tyrant; and
this as being more ignominious than as if Moses alone had been employed. The
nature of this third plague is very remarkable. God troubles Egypt not only with
frogs, but with lice; for although the Hebrews are not entirely agreed as to the
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;nk</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
kinim</i>,<i> </i>yet they admit that they were little animals or insects, which
produced shame together with annoyance even to the meanest of men. We see then
how magnificently God trampled upon the pride of Egypt, by inflicting a
punishment full of affront and disgrace; for although it would have been painful
to sink under a powerful and warlike enemy, yet was it far more sad to be basely
destroyed by lice. Nor can we doubt that God prepared such an army as this,
principally that He might openly manifest how easily He can bring to nought in
derision all earthly strength and power. And surely, unless the Egyptians had
been something more than stupid and beside themselves, this calculation would
have come into their minds; what would hereafter happen, if the Maker of heaven
and earth should apply Himself to their destruction with all His might, when
they perceived themselves to be wasted away in this almost ludicrous contest
with Him? But let us learn from this history, that all creatures are ready at
God's lightest command, whenever He chooses to make use of them to chastise His
enemies; and again, that no animal is so vile and contemptible as not to have
the power of doing injury when God employs it; and, finally, that reprobates
obtain this at last by their proud doings, viz., that they are, with the
greatest infamy, made to yield to the worms themselves, or to
lice.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the magicians did
so.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>They "did" is here put for "they
tried to do;" for they did not succeed, as presently appears. They are therefore
said to have done, what they in vain attempted, or what they essayed, but
without success. And in this way God took away from Pharaoh whatever excuse
remained, under pretext of being deceived; for although he had previously
himself sought for these deceptions, still his obstinacy was not without color
of excuse, as long as the magicians rivaled Moses in the contention; but when he
sees their art fail, he professedly sets himself in opposition to God. Although
it was not with reference to him alone that God restrained these impostors, but
He exposes them to the ridicule of all, in order to assert altogether for
Himself alone the glory of perfect power. Hence we gather how well, according to
His inestimable wisdom, He represses whatever license He for a time permits to
the ministers of Satan; for when, by bearing with their audacity, He has
sufficiently proved the faith of His people, He compels them to stop abruptly,
as it were, that they may sink in confusion, and "proceed no further," as Paul
says, when recounting this history.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;550309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 3:9.)</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then the magicians said unto
Pharaoh.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is probable that they were
reproved harshly, because they had come to a stop in their rivalry with the
servants of God; wherefore they excuse themselves by saying, that there is no
more room for their wisdom and magical arts. We gather from hence that they had
so been able to delude by their sorceries, that they thought themselves very
good and praiseworthy artificers of deception. For on no other account had the
people accounted them wise than because they had themselves first attained this
confidence; therefore they oppose the finger of God to their subtlety and skill,
as much as to say, that there is no longer any question as to the excellence of
their art, but that whatever could be required from astrologers and masters of
juggling, was now brought to nought by the extraordinary power of God. They do
indeed contradict themselves; because what could have been their object in
contending with Moses and Aaron, except they had boasted that God was on their
side? But if they had been acting under the auspices of God, how ridiculous was
it to confess that those, whom they had before opposed, were their superiors,
and to accord them the praise of the victory, because they were endued with
power from God? We see then how infatuated they were with all their cunning. But
in the meantime we must recollect what I have lately glanced at, that they not
only led others into error, but were also deceived, because they thought there
was some science in the deceptions of their magic; as now-a-days we see that the
fortune-tellers and other impostors, who call themselves judicial astrologers,
so pride themselves in their follies, as to have no hesitation in taking the
first rank amongst the learned. Besides, ambition itself impelled the magicians
to say, that God wrought by the hand of Moses; for they were ashamed to confess
that any human being excelled them in wisdom. But the confession was extorted
from them, that they might greatly magnify the glory of the one true God, and at
the same time bear witness to the legitimate vocation of Moses; for if the power
of God is manifested conspicuously in Moses, it follows that he is a true and
divine Prophet. But, because He does not equally work in them, but brings their
efforts to confusion, it may thence be concluded that they are enemies of God.
That they should have contended unsuccessfully, and have been foiled in the
midst of their attempts, was sufficient to restrain their vanity; but this was
much worse, that they should make out God to be the enemy of their art. It is
true that they spoke this inconsiderately, because they only wished to consult
their own fame, and to defend the false honors of their learning; but it pleased
God thus to convict them, so that Pharaoh should perceive that he had entered
into contention with the living God, and not with two ordinary men. As to the
form of expression, it is clearly metaphorical; for in Luke's Gospel the Spirit
is called "the<i> </i>finger of God,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;421120&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
11:20;) as likewise, in many passages, the same Spirit is intended by "the hand
of God." Still, we must mark the reason, lest any unlearned person should take
it literally, as if the Spirit, who truly is Eternal God, were but some portion
of the Divinity. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f94</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But since the magicians were compelled at length to recognise God's power in the
miracle, our folly will be worse than base if this same consideration does not
obtain with us. Although it becomes us to acknowledge the hand of God in two
ways; for neither when He acts by means, (as it is called,) does He detract from
Himself at all; and, therefore, His hand may be seen with the eyes of faith in
the whole course of nature; but, since He stirs up our indifference by miracles,
therein it shines forth more conspicuously. Because, however, we shall soon see
that the magicians did not therefore repent of their folly, let us learn
sincerely and cordially to humble ourselves beneath God's powerful hand, as soon
as it appears. That Pharaoh, when deserted by the magicians, did not cease at
all from his obstinacy, is a proof to us that, however wickedness may seek for
its support in different directions, still the corruption is implanted within,
which is of itself at enmity with
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

Rise up early.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As<i> </i>Pharaoh
advances in daring rashness, so does God on the other hand proceed to restrain
his impetuosity by opposing impediments. This is what the wicked at length
obtain by long and multiplied contention, that having received many wounds they
perish by various torments. With respect to the command that Moses should meet
Pharaoh, when he shall go down in the morning to the river-side for his
pleasure, it is uncertain whether God would have the tyrant encountered in
public, because the palace was difficult of access; although it seems probable
to me, that a place was chosen in which the proceeding would be more manifest,
and where the voice of His messenger would be more clearly heard. Therefore,
that nothing might be done secretly, Moses proclaims in open day, before the
whole multitude, that judgment of God, which immediately afterwards took effect.
But here no mention is made of the rod, as in the former plagues; because God
sometimes makes use of external instruments, that we may know that all creatures
are in His hand, and are wielded according to His will; but sometimes acts
independently of them, that we may know that He needs no such assistance. This
varied mode of action demonstrates that He subjects all things to His empire as
He pleases, and yet that He is contented with His own power. This plague has
some affinity to the two previous ones, inasmuch as its infliction is attended
with ignominy, which may put the tyrant to shame. The Hebrew word

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f95</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
g<i>narob</i>,<i> </i>means the same as the Latin "<i>examen</i>
<i>insectorum</i>,"<i> </i>a swarm of insects. Many interpreters think that
there was a mixture of various kinds; and this I do not reject, since it is
probable that their foul odour was multiplied, so as almost to suffocate the
tyrant. Those who explain it as describing bears, lions, tigers, wolves, and
other wild beasts, depart without any reason from the genuine meaning of the
word.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will
sever.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although this had not been
expressly declared<i> </i>as yet, still it must be extended to the other
plagues; for it is certain, that when God inflicted punishment on the Egyptians,
He did not proceed promiscuously against all men; and, therefore, that His
chosen people, in whose behalf He acted, were free from all inconvenience. But
now perhaps for the first time this distinction is made more evident to Pharaoh,
whereas before the peculiar grace of God had not been known to him. From hence,
however, it was more than plain, that mercies and punishments were in the power
of the one God of Israel, so that He might spare His own people, and treat them
kindly and paternally, whilst, on the other hand, He exercised<i> </i>vengeance
against His enemies. Wherefore He adds, "to the end thou mayest know that I am
the Lord God in the midst of the earth." There is all implied <i>antithesis
</i>here, which casts down all idols, and exalts the God of Israel alone. But
although "the earth" may be here taken for the whole habitable globe, it will be
properly confined to Egypt, as if God affirmed that He was supreme in the midst
of Egypt, or everywhere throughout all Egypt, which means the same. The
expression which follows, although somewhat harsh, yet contains no ambiguity.
God is said to have "put a redemption between his people and the Egyptians; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f96</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because, as if He had erected barriers, or set up a fence to preserve one corner
in safety, He had withholden His favor from the whole surrounding district.
Moreover, because the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlp</font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f97</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>phelo</i>,<i> </i>signifies to be admirable, or to be concealed, some
interpreters translate it, "I will render admirable 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f98</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the land of Goshen;" but I have preferred following the more usual rendering
which appears to be most appropriate. Lastly, it is to be observed that time for
repentance is again given to Pharaoh, so that, if he were curable, he might
prevent the punishment denounced against him: for God might have sent the
insects at the moment; but He assigns the morrow, to prove the wickedness of the
tyrant.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Pharaoh called for
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Pharaoh imagines that he is
granting a great thing, if the Israelites are permitted to offer sacrifice to
God in Egypt. He and all his people should have humbly embraced the worship of
God, and casting away their superstitions should have sought to Moses as their
instructor in sincere piety. He departs from none of their common vices; he does
not renounce his idols nor forsake his former errors; but only permits God to be
worshipped in one part of his kingdom. But this is customary with the reprobate,
to think that they have sufficiently done their duty, when they yield ever so
little to God. Hence it arises, that when they are conquered and compelled,
still they would not hesitate to detract somewhat from the rights of God; nay,
if they might do so with impunity, they would willingly rob Him of all. And in
fact as long as fortune 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f99</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is propitious, and they enjoy a state of prosperity and safety, they deprive
God, as much as may be, of all His glory; but when the power of resisting fails
them, they so descend to submission as to defraud Him of half His due honor. God
had commanded a free departure to be conceded to His people; Pharaoh does not
obey this command, but endeavors to satisfy God in another way, viz., by not
forbidding them to offer sacrifice in Egypt. This sin, which was common in all
ages, is now-a-days too clearly manifest. Our Pharaohs would altogether
extinguish God's glory, and this they madly set themselves to compass; but when
reduced to extremities, if there be no further use in professedly contending
with Him, they maim and mutilate His worship by a fictitious course, which they
call a reformation. Hence arose that mixture of light and darkness, which was
named "the Interim"

kon, </i>which Moses here uses, has a wide signification; for the Hebrews say of
whatever they do not approve, that it is not right (<i>rectum.</i>)<i>
</i>Therefore almost all the interpreters agree in this, that Pharaoh demanded
what was by no means equitable, because he would have exposed the Israelites to
be stoned by his people. If this opinion be admitted, we must read the passage
connectedly, that it was not in accordance with reason, that the Israelites
should sacrifice in Egypt in a strange manner, because the novelty would not be
tolerated. There are two clauses in the sentence; one, that it was not right for
them to offer in Egypt a sacrifice to God, which was abominable to the
inhabitants themselves, or to offer a profane sacrifice of the abominations of
the heathen; the other, that there was a danger of the Israelites being stoned,
if they provoked the Egyptians by a ceremony, which was detestable to them. As
to the second clause, there is no doubt that "the abomination of the Egyptians"
is taken actively for the sacrifices which they abominate. The same seems to be
the meaning of the first clause; for it would be harsh to interpret the same
forms of expression differently within a few words of each other; except that
the name of Jehovah, put in opposition as it is to "the abomination," seems to
require a passive signification. For Moses says emphatically, that "it is not
right to sacrifice the abomination of Egypt to Jehovah the God of Israel." If
this view be adopted, "the abomination" will be the profanation of true and pure
worship, wherewith the sacred ceremonies of the Egyptians were defiled; as much
as to say, that it was unlawful to mix up the worship of the true God with such
sacrilege. And, in fact, Moses seems to contend with a twofold argument; first,
that it was not right, secondly, that it was not expedient. Take this, then, as
the first reason, that a sacrifice which should. be polluted by the abominations
of Egypt, would neither be lawful nor pleasing to God; the second will follow
after, that the Egyptians would not tolerate it; because they would conceive
both themselves and their gods to be grievously insulted, if their accustomed
mode of sacrificing should be violated. This interpretation is fuller, and
contains fuller doctrine, if Moses, first of all, was solicitous as to the honor
of God, and did not regard the advantage of the people only; and in this
sentiment, that the true God could not be duly worshipped unless when separated
from all idols, there is nothing forced. But, since in the same verse "the
abomination of the Egyptians" is taken actively, it will be well, in order that
the construction may be more easy, to expound it thus in both places. Then the
sense of the first clause will be, it is not consistent to expose the worship of
our God to the reproaches and sneers of the Gentiles; which would be the case,
if the Egyptians should see us honoring a sacrificial ceremony which they
abominate. I do not, indeed, assent to their opinion, who will not admit the
passage to consist of two clauses, but read it connectedly thus &#8212; that it
was not right to do this, because the Egyptians would stone the Israelites. For
Moses not only had regard to what was best for the people, but primarily to what
would please God, viz., that His holy name should not be profaned. I see no
foundation in reason for restraining, as is usually done, the word "abomination"
to the animals of sacrifice; and, therefore, I extend it to the whole operation
of sacrificing.

change must be made in God's command, but that His injunction must be obeyed
simply, and without exception. Nor is there little praise due to the firmness of
Moses, who so boldly and unreservedly rejected the pretended moderation of the
tyrant, because it would have somewhat interfered with the will of God. He

proposed to deceive and lie, because he was prevented by fear; but only, because
overwhelmed with a present sense of his calamity, he dared not raise his crest
against God. Therefore (as I said before) he did not so much wish designedly to
conciliate and frustrate Moses by falsehood, as he deceived himself. For we must
observe that (like one who has a wolf by the ears) he was constrained to promise
the dismissal of the people, whom he retained to his own great injury. And this
is why he commends himself to their prayers, for necessity urged him to implore
God's pardon and peace: although it might have been that he desired craftily to
engage their affection to himself under the pretext of religion. For by this
anxious precaution for himself, he betrays his want of confidence. Finally, by
requesting their prayers, he, as it were, throws out a rope by which he may draw
them back to himself when the sacrifice was

demand, because he knew that the design of God was otherwise; and God had justly
left him in ignorance as to what He did not yet wish him to know. There is,
then, no reason why Moses should be accused of bad faith when he faithfully
fulfilled the charge committed to him; although he was silent as to what he was
not ordered to declare, even as to that which God wished to be concealed from
the tyrant. But the holy Prophet, aroused to pious indignation by the king's
perfidy, does not immediately remove the plague, but waits till the morrow; and
moreover, denounces with severity that, if he should persist in deceit, its
punishment awaited him. This great magnanimity he had derived from the miracles,
for, having experienced in them the unconquerable power of God, he had no cause
for fear. For it was an act of extraordinary boldness openly and before the
tyrant's face to reproach him for his falsehoods, and at the same time to
threaten him with punishment unless he desisted from them. But we said before
that Moses had not acted from the workings of his own mind, when he promised
Pharaoh what he asked, but that he had spoken thus confidently from special
impulse. For the general promise in which God affirms that He will grant the
prayers of His servants, must not be applied to particular cases, so that they
should expect to obtain this or that in a specified manner, unless they have
some peculiar testimony from the word or the Spirit of
God.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>

best, viz., that by the result God proved that He ratified what Moses had said,
whom He had made the proclaimer of His judgment; but if any one prefer to refer
it to his prayer, let him retain his opinion. When he adds that the "heart of
the king was hardened at this time also," he aggravates the crime of his
obstinacy, since there was no bound to his rebellion under such a series of
punishments, by which even an iron heart should have been

Moses is here recounted; and it is possible that he was quiet and silent, whilst
God foresaw what it was necessary to do, and even commanded what He would have
done. But since he only gives a brief summary of occurrences, we may probably
conjecture that, as the evil grew worse, he had recourse from time to time to
the remedy. In the denunciation, "the Lord God of the Hebrews" is no unmeaning
repetition, that Pharaoh may learn that he, whom he thought to have repelled in
the abundance of his pride, was still in the field against him. For God insults
his ferocity, and by setting forth his name contemptuously defies his wrath. We
have already said that Pharaoh is convicted of sacrilege, both in his oppression
of God's people and in defrauding God Himself of His due honor; therefore those
words, "Let my people go, that they may serve me," have the force of aggravating
his sin.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>

</i></font><font face="Palatino">God again urges him to obedience through fear
of punishment, as He usually deals with the froward. Yet he permits him a short
space of time for repentance, (as before,) if perchance he may lay aside his
perverse determination to refuse. And this Moses now relates more distinctly in
the fifth verse, both to show the extreme obstinacy of his malice, because the
tyrant mocks at God's forbearance, and follows his own lust; and also to
manifest more clearly from the circumstance of time, that the cattle of Egypt
were smitten not by chance but by the hand of God. There is also an implied
reproof of his senseless obstinacy, as though Moses said, that God was already
enough, and more than enough, provoked; and therefore, unless he should desist,
that God had new and more terrible plagues at hand, whereby He would overwhelm
him. The murrain is appositely called God's "hand," because it arose from His
just judgment; for this expression is opposed to natural causes, to the arts and
devices of men, and to accidental chances &#8212; as if Moses had said that the
hand of God would appear in "the very grievous murrain," that Pharaoh may
perceive the Deity to be wroth with him. Moreover, though this might seem a
lighter plague than those preceding it, yet it was doubtless more grievous and
afflictive to the Egyptians, because it involved much greater injury at a future
period. The hand of God had before been adverse to them for a short time, and
the evil had been removed together with the infliction; but now the destruction
of the cattle will affect them for many years. For this kind of gradation in the
judgments of God must be observed, as the Law also denounces against
transgressors punishments sevenfold greater, if they do not speedily return into
the way. (See
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;032618&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus

<i>comprehensive</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f103</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
expression, for immediately it will appear that a considerable number of animals
still remained. But he means that the herds were everywhere destroyed, and the
flocks smitten by the murrain; or, if you prefer it, that the murrain was
general in its attack, and that it reduced Egypt to a state of poverty by the
destruction of their cattle and other animals. Finally, the universal term
merely refers to this plague having been a remarkable proof of God's anger,
because the pestilence did not only kill a few animals, as it usually does, but
made havoc far and wide of a vast number of herds and
flocks.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>

it may be, that, in the blindness of his obstinacy he neglected this, until he
was reminded by Moses; for we know how the reprobate shut their eyes against the
manifest marks of God's wrath, and willfully indulge in their errors. Certainly
there is no doubt that Pharaoh, whilst he seeks to harden himself in every way,
deliberately passed over what it was very useful for him to know; but, since he
was informed by Moses of the distinction between the Egyptians and the
Israelites, he is compelled, whether he will or no, to ascertain from actual
inspection, what he would have gladly been in ignorance of. But this was no
obscure demonstration of God's paternal favor towards His chosen people; that
the contagion should not have affected that part of Egypt, which was fullest of
cattle, though it ravaged the whole surrounding neighborhood. Wherefore, the
hardness of the king's wicked heart was all the more base and marvelous, since
he was not moved even by this extraordinary circumstance; for it was a token of
horrible folly, that, when the matter was examined and discovered by his
underlings, he still hardened his heart and would not obey

time of the punishment, but redoubles the plagues in a continuous series; nor
does he threaten Pharaoh, but, leaving him, executes the judgment which He
decreed; both because it was now more than sufficiently manifested that
admonitions were of no avail with him, and also that his desperate wickedness
might be reproved in every way. For although I have lately said that all which
happened is not fully related, still the narrative of Moses rather leads us to
infer, that nothing about the boils was previously told to Pharaoh, but that the
ashes 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f105</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
were sprinkled, when he had no suspicion of anything of the kind. But it did not
happen naturally that the heaven was darkened by the dust, and that the disease
arose from thence; for how could a few ashes cover the whole air? But by this
visible sign the tyrant was taught that the calamity which ensued was inflicted
by Moses and Aaron. Moreover, God invested His servants with high and power,
when He gave them command over the air, so that they should envelop it in
darkness, and poison it with contagion. Hence we gather, that the devil's are
called the princes of the air, not because they govern it according to their
will, but only so far as the permission 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f106</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to wander in it is accorded to
them.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the magicians could
not.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Since the magicians were now also
at hand, doubtless they were possessed by their former folly, so that they stood
in readiness, as it were, in case an opportunity of contention should be offered
them. And, in fact, since Satan, although ten times conquered, is still
perpetually hurried forward with indefatigable obstinacy, so neither do his
ministers desist from their madness, notwithstanding they have experienced how
unsuccessful are their battles. These enchanters had lately confessed that their
art availed no farther, and yet they embolden themselves to try all extremities,
until the disease of the boils drives them back in disgrace. Wherefore, that we
may not betray our madness by similar audacity, let us learn to give God His
full glory by voluntary submission. But that Pharaoh, when not only deprived of
their assistance, but even when abandoned, and without their presence, is
neither changed nor softened, proves that he was not so much deceived by the
impostures of others, as stupefied by his own malice and perversity; although
Moses here repeats that "his heart was hardened by God;" because He desired, as
if by an opposing barrier, to have an opportunity for manifesting His power. And
here their ignorance is refuted, who imagine that God is endued with mere
prescience; for when "as the Lord has spoken" is added, He attributes both in
conjunction to Himself, viz., the effect as well as the foreknowledge. On this
point we shall enlarge a little further on; yet let us remark that at the same
time the tyrant was not absolved from crime, for that his hardness of heart was
voluntary. The blains, which were epidemic on the cattle, are a proof that they
did not all die in the former
catastrophe.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

to try the mind of the wicked king; not that there is any hope of a cure, but
that his obstinacy may be more and more discovered. For it was desirable as an
example, that it should be known openly how madly those, who are cast into a
reprobate state of feeling, and who are possessed by a spirit of willfulness,
rush upon their own destruction. Surely it would be incredible, that any human
being should have ever resisted God with such headstrong folly and obstinacy,
unless this picture had been presented to us. How often was Pharaoh commanded to
send the people away, and on every occasion a ratification of the command 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f107</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
was added! So that God no less thundered from heaven than He spoke on earth by
the mouth of His servant and ambassador; yet still the mind of the tyrant was
not subdued into obedience, because Satan alienates the minds of those, whom by
God's permission he holds in devotion, and bondage, to himself. Meanwhile, they
heap up more terrible vengeance against themselves by their impious contempt of
warnings.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I will at this

implied, "unless he should submit himself to God." The meaning is, that although
he had already chastised his pride, yet that this had been done gently and in
moderation; but that He now would use a heavier scourge, since the lighter rods
had been unavailing. Thus his ingratitude is reproved, because he had not
acknowledged that he had been spared, in order that, having suffered only some
trifling losses, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f108</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he might return to his right mind. Wherefore, because God had proceeded
gradually with his punishments, He now threatens that He will inflict many on
him at once; as he is wont to act with the rebellious. On which account also
David exhorts us not to be</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"as the horse and mule
&#8212; whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle when they are restive,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
32:9;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">whence he concludes, that "many sorrows shall be to
the wicked" and rebellious. But Moses here denounces plagues, which shall not
only affect the head and arms, but which shall reach to the heart itself, and
inflict a deadly wound in his very bowels; for Pharaoh was so obstinate that it
was not enough to batter his sides. In flue, he is enjoined to make haste and
provide against the awful judgement which impended, unless he chose rather to
perish with all his (servants.) The expression, "all my plagues," embraces
whatever chastisement we shall hereafter see inflicted on him; and therefore the
word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rbd</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>deber</i>, designates every kind of death; as much as to say, that He would
heap punishment upon punishment, until He had destroyed the tyrant together with
his whole nation. What is afterwards added, "that thou mayest know that there is
none like me in all the earth," implies that Pharaoh had hitherto struggled
against Him, because he had never really and seriously apprehended the extent of
the divine power; for wherever it is really felt, it is impossible but that
pride must be humbled before it. And, doubtless, the reprobate, although in some
measure they recognize the power of God, still rush on with a kind of frenzied
impulse, and their wickedness is combined with blindness of heart, so that
seeing, they do not see. Meantime we are reminded, that the reprobate only gain
this by their stupidity, that God should proceed against them with all His
forces, and drag and compel them against their will to understand His power,
from which they fly. But that he may expect no longer truce, God affirms in the
next verse that He is advancing with an outstretched hand. For God is not here
commending His patience in the slowness of His procedure, as some prefer to
explain it; but He rather admonishes him that the execution was nigh at hand,
since He had armed Himself, and prepared His forces before He had spoken a
word.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And in very deed for this

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ytdm[h</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>hagnemadthi, </i>is variously explained; it properly signifies "to appoint;"
some, therefore, refer it to his eminent position, as if God had placed Pharaoh
on the throne, for the purpose of better manifesting His glory. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f109</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The Greek interpreter extends the meaning, translating it
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejxh&gt;geira&gt;
se</font><font face="Palatino">, "I have stirred thee up, as much as to say,
that Pharaoh had been chosen by the secret counsel and providence of God that
His power might be exercised upon him; as He is constantly said to stir up those
whom He brings forward, to apply them to those objects for which he has destined
them. Others think that this sentence depends on what has gone before, and
interpret it "I have preserved thee," or "chosen that thou shouldest survive."
For the Hebrew verb, which is transitive in <i>Hiphil,</i> is derived from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dm[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gnamod, </i>which means "to stand up." Since, therefore, God had restrained
Himself, He now assigns the cause of His moderation, because if Pharaoh had
fallen in one trifling engagement, the glory of His victory would have been less
illustrious. In fine, lest Pharaoh should flatter himself, or harden himself by
vain confidence, God affirms that He does not want strength to destroy him
immediately, but that He had delayed his ultimate punishment for another
purpose, viz., that Pharaoh might slowly learn that he strove in vain against
His incomparable power; and that thus this remarkable history should be
celebrated in all ages. But although Paul follows the Greek interpreter, there
is no reason why we should not embrace this latter sense; for we know that the
Apostles were not so particular in quoting the words, but that they rather
considered the substance. But, although we admit that by God's long-suffering
Pharaoh continued to hold out, until he became a clear and notorious proof of
the madness and folly of all those who resist God, yet this also has reference
to the eternal prescience of God; for therefore did God spare Pharaoh to stand
for a time, because, before he was born, he had been predestinated for this
purpose. Wherefore, also, Paul rightly concludes, that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"it is not of him that
willeth, nor of him that
runneth."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450916&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
9:16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For whether God raises up or upholds the reprobate,
He wonderfully manifests His glory by their perverseness. Thus is their
ignorance refuted, who, by this cavil, endeavor to overturn the eternal
predestination of God; because it is not said, that He created Pharaoh with this
intention, but that he suspended His judgment for a. time. For this intermediate
and progressive course of proceeding arose from this source, that Pharaoh was
the organ or instrument of God's
wrath.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b> As yet exaltest thou
thyself. The expression which Moses uses 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f110</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
denotes the pride of Pharaoh; because he too insolently exalted himself by
trampling on the people. God therefore inquires, as if in astonishment, what
this blinded fury meant, that the tyrant should hope that the injuries whereby
he undeservedly afflicted God's people, would be permitted with impunity? For he
was already taught, by many miracles, that God had, as their protector,
undertaken the cause of His people, so that He would be the avenger of all their
unjust treatment. At the same time He ironically reproves the tyrant's folly, in
that he was not humbled by so many chastisements; as if He had said, that
although, when intoxicated by prosperity, he might have raged against the
wretched people with tyrannical and persevering arbitrariness, yet, after
undergoing so many plagues, it was surely time to
cease.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, tomorrow about this
time.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God now indicates the kind of
punishment which He was prepared to inflict, viz., that He would smite with hail
both man and beast, and a part of the crops. It sometimes, indeed, happens that
the corn is destroyed by hail, and occasionally that great injury is thus
inflicted even on men and beasts; nay, it is regarded as an unusual blessing if
ten or fifteen years pass by without such a calamity. But God makes it apparent
by certain signs in the judgment, which he has determined to execute, that the
hail did not arise from natural causes, but that the atmosphere was manifestly
armed by Him for the battle. First, the morrow is fixed; nor is this enough, the
hour also is added. But what astronomer or philosopher could thus measure the
moments for storms and tempests? Then again, its unusual violence, such as had
never been seen before, is appointed. Fourthly, its extent, from the extreme
boundaries of Egypt, from the one side to the other, as well as its expansion
over its whole breadth. Scarcely once in twenty years will a storm so widely
prevail, flying, as this did, like an arrow; but, restrained within narrow
limits, it; will not thus diffuse itself far and wide. Lastly, the distinction
is added between Goshen and the rest of Egypt. Hence it is plain, that this hail
was not produced by an accidental impulse, but made to fall by God's hand; in a
word, that it was not the drops of moisture frozen in mid air, but a portent
which transcended the bounds of
nature.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sealed therefore
now.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He does not give this counsel as if
he would spare His professed enemy, but he insults his mad confidence, because
hitherto in his supine security he had despised whatever punishments had been
denounced against him. He indirectly hints, therefore, that now is the time for
fear. Secondly, that when God contends, the event is not a doubtful one; because
He not only openly challenges him to the combat, but assures him that He shall
have no difficulty in putting him to the rout. Finally, he shows him, that He
has no need of deceit, or of any stratagems to overtake His enemy, but that,
although he grants him a way of escape, still He should be
victorious.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that feared the word of the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In these words Moses shows that
there were some who were so far taught by experience as not altogether to
despise what he had denounced; for hence arose their fear from the denunciation
of the punishment, because they were persuaded that Moses was the servant of
God, and a Prophet, as well as the herald of the Divine judgment. Although it
likewise appears that they had not seriously repented so as to obey God, but
were impelled to take these precautions by immediate and momentary terror. Thus,
particular fear often makes the reprobate anxious either to deprecate or fly
from the vengeance of God. Still Moses says, that their fear profited them, for
they did not experience the same calamity as others, who were more insensible.
In this way God bore witness, that in proportion as each one more obstinately
despises His judgments, the more grievously and heavily is he afflicted; but
that some unbelievers are in some degree spared from inconveniences, and more
gently chastised, because they at least do not proudly exalt themselves to
despise His power. Moreover, by this destruction the judgment of God more
clearly shone forth, when among the Egyptians themselves, whosoever was most
hardened received the sure reward of his contempt. Yet are we taught by this
example, that it does not greatly profit unbelievers, though God may pardon them
for a while when they are alarmed and humbled; because they ever remain under
condemnation to eternal death.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The rod of Moses is again employed
to bring on the storm, not so much for Pharaoh's sake, as that Moses may be the
more encouraged to the remaining contests, when he sees the proof of his
vocation renewed. In the meanwhile, we may observe the trial of his faith, since
before he had received the command to stretch forth his rod toward heaven, he
had not hesitated to predict to Pharaoh the grievous and miraculous hall. But if
any one thinks that this is an
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">u[steron
pro&gt;teron</font><font face="Palatino">, and that what was first in order of
time is related last, I will not debate it; but this seems more probable to me,
and also to be rightly gathered from the text, that when the day had elapsed,
Moses was commanded to execute that of which the means was before unknown to
him. Hence, also, both Moses himself learnt, and we also ought now to learn,
that all the elements, although without sense, are still ready to render any
kind of obedience to their Maker; since, at the stretching forth of the rod the
air was troubled in an incredible manner, so that it hurled down an abundance of
hail for the destruction of beasts and
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

recollect, what I have already touched upon, that Pharaoh did not lie
designedly; for when seized by terror, he caught at every means to appease God,
but soon after relapsed into his former state of mind. For although with
fox-like cunning the wicked pretend submission, when they see themselves caught,
in order to escape from the snare, still they do not mean to mock God by their
soft words; but rather under the pressure of necessity they are ready to do
anything, and therefore offer propitiation's and satisfactions; but when their
fear has departed, because whatever they promised was forcibly extorted from
them, they directly break out afresh. A very similar circumstance is related of
Saul. He confesses to his own disgrace the innocence of David, and yet, as soon
as he has escaped from the danger, and is freed from fear, he does not cease to
persecute him cruelly.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;092418&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 24:18, and 26:21.) But if we admit that this was mere dissimulation,
Pharaoh had greater cause for fear, because, being experimentally convinced that
God was his adversary, he was impelled by his fear to make any conditions
whatever. But, first of all, he acknowledges that he had "sinned this time," not
to excuse the former cases, but. because, in such gross contempt, the crime of
obstinacy was still more detestable. And this more fully appears in the
following words, wherein he acknowledges the justice of God, and confesses the
wickedness of himself and his people. It is just as if he had said, that he is
deservedly punished, because he had too long provoked God, who is a just judge.
Now since, as far as his words go, Pharaoh professes true repentance, we may
gather from them, that, sinners do not attribute to God the honor due to His
justice, unless they condemn themselves; and this must be more carefully
observed, because there are few who think that, while they are endeavoring to
rebut the accusations of guiltiness, they are dishonoring God. Yet, whosoever
does not judge himself, and who does not frankly confess his sins, is assuredly
murmuring against the judgment of God. Pharaoh, at length, has recourse to
deprecation, in which he desires to have Moses and Aaron as his intercessors;
not, I admit, without deception, (because hypocrites are always double-hearted;)
yet it is certain, that because he was terrified by his troubles, he sought for
peace with God, lest his rebellion should draw down upon him new and greater
punishments; but as soon as, having obtained his desire, he ceased to be afraid,
the secret wickedness which lay, as it were, stifled under the abundance of his
miseries, burst forth out of the sense of security. What immediately follows is
variously explained by the translators; some understand it negatively, "that
there be not," or "if there be not &#8212; thunderings;" and even these disagree
among themselves; for some suppose that Pharaoh congratulates himself, because
the thunders have ceased; but it is plain from the context that they are grossly
mistaken. If, then, a negation is intended, the passage must necessarily refer
to the future; as if Pharaoh had said, that he should be very graciously dealt
with, if God should please to allay the thunderings. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f112</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But the various reading is equally probable; "It is much, or a great thing, that
there are, or have been thunderings;" as though he said, that he had been
punished enough, or more than enough for his folly; or (as best pleases myself)
that he is now subdued by terror, whilst he is alarmed by the continual rollings
of the thunder and the beating of the hail; for he seems to desire to prove the
truth of his conversion, because he is conquered by the terrible power of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this answer Moses indirectly
hints, that he leaves the presence of Pharaoh, in order duly and purely to
supplicate God; since by his unbelief he would in a manner pollute the
sacrifices. For, as he had already shown, that legitimate worship could not be
offered by the people except away from Egypt, so now he seeks to be alone for
prayer; and thus, by this change of place, he indicates that the place, in which
Pharaoh dwells, is unholy. We have already said, that Moses promises nothing out
of mere rash impulse, but that, taught either by the inspiration of the Spirit,
or by sure revelation, he pronounces, with the authority of a prophet, what God
is about to do. Moreover, it is not without reason that Moses exhorts Pharaoh to
learn from the remission of the punishment, that the God of Israel is the Lord
of Egypt also; for the word earth seems here to be limited to Egypt; although I
do not deny that it may be properly understood of the whole world; but,
whichever you may prefer, Moses rightly concludes, that the glory and dominion
of God is perfectly manifested, not only when he appears as an avenger in the
infliction of punishment, but that He also shows it in an opposite way, when all
the elements are subservient to His mercy. Besides, His power is still more
clearly shown forth, when He himself heals the wounds which He has inflicted;

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But as for thee and thy servants,

proves with what magnanimity the holy Prophet was endued, who, without taking
any account of the wrath of the imperious and cruel tyrant, does not hesitate to
condemn the impiety of himself and his whole court. Nor can it indeed be
questioned, that God miraculously restrained so many wild beasts to keep their
hands off Moses; for it cannot be attributed either to their moderation or
humanity, that men, otherwise worse than bloody-minded, did not kill him a
hundred times over, when he so bitterly provoked them. But, from his firmness,
it also appears how much he had profited by his novitiate; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f113</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because he, who had before fled far for refuge in fear of their darts, now has
no alarm in the hottest conflict. But he justly affirms that the Egyptians do
not "fear the Lord;" because alarm and terror do not always lead the mind to
reverence and due obedience. For Moses speaks of true fear, which altogether
attaches us to God, wherefore it is called "wisdom," and "the beginning of
wisdom"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;200107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
1:7, and Psalm 111:10.) But hypocrites, although they fear the name of God, are
very far from willingly desiring to serve Him. Wherefore, lest we be deceived by
empty imaginations, let us learn honestly to sift all our feelings, and
diligently to examine into all those winding 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f114</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
recesses, wherewith human hearts are filled and incredibly entangled. A question
arises, why Moses undertook the part of an intercessor, when he sees no
repentance? my reply is, that he was not thus ready to spare, as if he had been
persuaded; but that he gave a short intermission, until the king's impiety
should again betray itself, and thus God should fulfill what he had predicted
respecting all the plagues. It is, then, absurd to gather, as some do, from this
passage, that ministers of the word and pastors should be satisfied with a mere
verbal confession; for Moses did not so much intend to pardon as to open a way
for the remaining judgments of
God.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the flax and the

the hail inflicted; and shows that a part of the fruits of the earth was
destroyed, viz., that which had already grown into stalk; but that the seeds
which grow more slowly were spared. For God desired to give a remnant of hope,
which might invite the king and his people to repentance, if only their
wickedness were curable.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>34.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when Pharaoh

audacity from the mitigation of his punishment, as security arms the reprobate
against God; for as soon as the scourges of God rest for awhile, they cherish
the presumption that they will be unpunished, and construe the short truce into
an abiding peace. Pharaoh, then, hardens anew his heart, which he seemed to have
somewhat changed, as soon as he is delivered from this infliction; as though he
had not been warned that others remained behind, nay, that the hand of God was
already stretched out against him. Therefore, at the end of the chapter, Moses
amplifies the crime when he adds, that this had been foretold

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses passes on to another plague,
whereby God took vengeance on the treachery and obstinacy of the wicked king;
viz., that He gave over the remaining produce of the year, which He had spared,
to be eaten and devoured by locusts. And this was no ordinary punishment, to
destroy Egypt by dearth and famine, when all their corn had perished. But,
before Moses proceeds to this, he again relates that he was the proclaimer of
this plague, and that God had announced to him the reason why Pharaoh had so
often resisted to his own injury. Therefore God says, that He had hardened his
heart, in order that he might show forth these miracles and evidences of His
power; for if Pharaoh had been humbled, and had yielded immediately, the contest
would have been superfluous; since what would be the object of contending with a
conquered and prostrate enemy? The obstinacy of the tyrant, then, in so often
provoking God, opened the way to more miracles, as fire is produced by the
collision of flint and iron. Thence also the silly imagination is refuted, that
the heart of Pharaoh was no otherwise hardened than as the miracles were set.
before his eyes; for Moses does not say that his heart was divinely hardened by
the sight of the signs, but that it pleased God in this manner to manifest His
power. Hence also we gather, that whatever occurred was predestinated by the
sure counsel of God. For God willed to redeem His people in a singular and
unusual way. That this redemption might be more conspicuous and glorious, He set
up Pharaoh against himself like a rock of stone, which by its hardness might
afford a cause for new and more remarkable miracles. Pharaoh was, therefore,
hardened by the marvelous providence of God with this object, that the grace of
His deliverance might be neither despicable nor obscure. For God regarded tits
own people more than the Egyptians, as immediately appears, "that thou mayest
tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son," etc. For far more abundant
material for thanksgiving and for celebrating the memory of their deliverance
was afforded, by the fact of the Israelites having seen God's arm stretched
forth so often from heaven, and with so many prodigies. Had they been redeemed
by any ordinary method, the praise due to God would soon have been forgotten. It
was proper, then, that their posterity should be thus instructed by their
fathers, that they might have no doubts as to the author of so illustrious a
work. But it is here required of the fathers, who had been eye-witnesses of the
signs, that they should be diligent and assiduous in teaching their children;
and on these also, care and attention in learning is enjoined, that the
recollection of God's mercies should flourish throughout all ages. The practical
effect of this doctrine is seen in Psalms 44 and  Psalm
105.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses and Aaron came
in.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses now relates how, at God's
command, he tried whether Pharaoh's heart, after so many experiments, would be
bent to obedience out of fear of the new punishment which impended. But by this
proof his impiety was better known, since, although he saw his kingdom deprived
of a part of its corn, he fears not what is denounced by Moses respecting the
other part. Therefore he reproves him still more severely, inquiring, "How long"
wilt thou proudly resist the command of God? For since plagues vanquish even the
worst natures, it was marvelous that the king, having been smitten eight times,
and in so awful a manner, was still unwilling to yield, as if he were in safety,
and unaffected by any injury. But we may learn from this passage, that we are
chastised with this object by the rods of God, that we may return from the
indulgence of our lusts to submission to Him. This Moses calls (and Peter after
him,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 5:6) to "humble" ourselves before God, or "beneath His mighty hand," when,
having experienced His formidable power, we reverently submit ourselves to His
dominion. Whence it follows, that they, who are neither tamed nor bent by the
fear of punishment., struggle against God as with an iron 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f116</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
brow. Let fear, then, teach us to repent; and that we may not provoke His
vengeance by proud contempt, let us learn that nothing is more terrible than to
fall into His hands. Moses also hints that Pharaoh's contention was not with the
Israelites only, but with God who undertook their cause. And let us not doubt,
therefore, that all tyrants, who unjustly persecute the Church, contend with God
Himself, to whose powers they will find themselves far
inferior.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Else, if thou
refuse.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses denounces the extreme
dearth and famine of the land of Egypt, because the locusts will suddenly arise,
altogether to consume the remaining produce of the year; for half of it had
already been destroyed by the hail. But, although ancient histories bear
witness, and it has happened also in our time, that not only cornfields, but
that pastures have been devoured by locusts, still we may gather from the
circumstances, that this was an extraordinary instance of the divine vengeance;
because Moses both appoints the next day, and also relates that an incredible
multitude suddenly burst forth, and adds, that such had never been seen; and,
lastly, threatens that no house should be exempt from their invasion. Moreover,
it is worth while again to remark the nature of the scourge, that God collects
and arms a host of vile insects, whereby He may insultingly overcome this
indomitable tyrant with all his forces. The ingratitude of Egypt, too, was
worthy of this return, since it was too great an indignity that the posterity of
Joseph should be tyrannically persecuted in that. country, which a little more
than 250 years before he had preserved from famine by his energy. What follows
in verse 6, that "he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh," is recorded as
a token of his indignation; as though Moses, worn out with the perverseness of
the tyrant, had hastily withdrawn himself from him, without bidding him
farewell. Therefore, although he was otherwise of a mild disposition, this
peremptory harshness was to be adopted as a reproof of the arrogance with which
the tyrant spit in the face of heaven itself. But, let the Pharaohs of our age
also learn, that when they impede by their cruel menaces the pure worship of
God, it is in His strict justice that fanatics, like locusts, assail their
kingdoms with their impious errors, and infect their people with
contagion.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

<i>mokesh, </i>a snare or a stumbling-block, is of little consequence, because
it is taken metaphorically for every kind of misfortune or injury. They signify,
then, that no end of their troubles was to be expected so long as Pharaoh shall
contend with Moses; for that evils would follow upon evils. By the question "how
long?" they admonish him that his pertinacity had already been more injurious
than enough; and thence they conclude that there is nothing better to be done
than, by the expulsion of Moses, to free himself from the snare, or to avoid the
stumbling-block, since he could only fight unsuccessfully. As to the second part
of the verse, interpreters differ. The Chaldee Paraphrast translates it with the
introduction of a negative, &#8212; "Knowest thou not yet that Egypt is
destroyed?" Word for word it is, "whether to know before," or "before that to
know." But because the infinitive is sometimes taken for the future, thus does
it seem to accord very well with the sense &#8212; "Do you wish to know the
destruction of the whole kingdom before you desist from your unhappy
contention?" as if they had said, that unless God should avert His anger, the
remedy would be soon too late and
useless.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses and Aaron were

the wrath of the king was appeased, some of the company were hastily dispatched
to bring back Moses in that same hour, lest the calamity denounced by him should
happen on the morrow. For we may gather from the king's words that he was not
altogether overcome by their entreaties; but that, because he was unwilling to
offend all their minds by an abrupt refusal, he suffered Moses to be recalled,
that he might delude them by an underhand artifice; since thus do tyrants escape
unpopularity by the false appearance of consent. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f118</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But he returns to his former purpose, when seeking to compound with God by an
intermediate course he wishes to secure to himself the people's return. It
appears indeed that he was himself also frightened, and sought some way to
propitiate God; meanwhile, as if it were free for him to make conditions, he
proposes such as would be advantageous to himself; as hypocrites are wont so to
treat with God, as if He were compelled to abandon half His rights. But although
he cunningly inquires, as if the point were doubtful, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f119</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
still his suspicion is easily discovered. Therefore, what he knows to be
enjoined him respecting all, he restricts to a few, and yet pretends that he
accords what is right and what ought to satisfy God. But although Moses, in his
answer, abundantly cuts off all pretext for subterfuge, and does not flatter him
with any prevarication or ambiguity, still he suppresses God's counsel
respecting the deliverance of the people &#8212; not because he wishes to
deceive or to lie, but that he may confine himself within the bounds of his
commission. And lest it might be objected that in this way the Israelites would
be withdrawn from their legitimate government, he does not dissemble that, being
adopted by God, they were under the dominion of none other. God therefore openly
asks again His own whom He has once attached to Himself. Nor must He be thought
to have dealt fraudulently with the tyrant, although he conceals His counsel
from him. He says that the Israelites must take their flocks and their herds
with them, that the victims which they should offer to God may be at hand. As to
their "sons and their daughters," he insinuates that the feast-day must be kept
by the very least of them, because God had devoted them all to Himself for the
services of piety.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let the Lord be so with

so clear in itself, should be violently wrested by the interpreters. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f120</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Some thus expound it, &#8212; "I would that God may not otherwise favor you,
than as I am determined to let you go;" while others think that it was spoken
deceitfully, as though he had commended them to God after their departure. I
will not adduce the opinions of all, nor is it necessary. I have no doubt that
it was an ironical sneer, whereby he insults, at the same time, both God and
them; as if he had said, "You boast that God is on your side; experience will
prove this, if I shall let you go." Thus, then, establishing himself as the
supreme judge as to their departure, and claiming to himself the power of
forbidding and preventing them from going, he derides their confidence, because,
in demanding their free dismissal, they profess to do so under the auspices and
by the command of God; just as if he had said, "If I do not hinder you, then you
may reasonably pretend that Jehovah is the guide of your journey." In this way
he wantonly provokes God, and denies that He is able so to aid His people as to
prevent his own power from prevailing to resist Him. Thus the reprobate, after
having been troubled in themselves, sometimes burst forth with ravings of
contempt against God, as if they were well secured from all dangers, and
counting for nothing the aid which God has promised to give to His own people,
fearlessly ridicule the simplicity of their
faith.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Again, in the second clause of the verse,
many, as it appears to me, raise unnecessary difficulties. Some gather from it
this sense, &#8212; "The evil which you are planning shall happen to yourselves,
and shall be turned against your own faces." Others think that it is a
comparison taken from a target, because the Israelites were looking steadfastly
at nothing but ill-doing. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f121</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But I do not doubt that Pharaoh, after having set his tyrannical prohibitions in
array against God, now threatens them, to inspire them with terror. He says,
therefore, that evil awaits the Israelites, and is, as it were, held up before
their eyes, because they are about to suffer the penalty of their rashness. Thus
he signifies that the help of God, in which they confide for protection, is
either evanescent or will profit them nothing. But when he says, "Look to<i>
it</i>," he indirectly taunts them; because, in their reliance on God's
assistance, they are rushing inconsiderately on their ruin. The conclusion is,
that they were ill-advised as to their own interests in making these attempts,

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Since Pharaoh was not induced to
obey by the announcement of the punishment, its execution is here related. And
first, Moses is commanded to stretch out his hand to bring in the locusts, in
right of the authority with which God had invested him; for the stretching forth
of the hand is a token of power. He therefore adds, just beyond, that he
stretched forth his rod, which we have before seen to have been given him as a
royal scepter. It is, then, just as if God had appointed him to be His
vicegerent, and had subjected to him the sea, and earth, and air. But that he
may sink down into the character of a minister, he does not say that the locusts
came up at his command, but assigns the glory of the operation to the Lord
alone. And this mode of expression is worthy of remark, since we learn from it
that the ministers of God, although they bring nothing of their own, still do
not lose their labor, because the efficacy of the Spirit is conjoined to their
word; and still that nothing is detracted from the power of God and transferred
to them, since they are but instruments, which by God's hand are applied in His
service. Thus did not Moses in vain command, as he stretched forth his rod, the
locusts to come up; because the effect of his command immediately appeared.
Still he did not himself create the locusts, nor attract them by the stirring'
of his rod, but they were divinely brought by the power of the east wind. But so
sudden a gathering unquestionably occurred contrary to the order of nature; nor,
if God thus employed the wind, does it necessarily follow that this was usual.
We know that the east wind is a wholesome and gentle wind, and although it is
sometimes stormy with respect to Judea, still it does not seem probable that
either by its strength or by its contagious blast, Egypt was covered with
locusts. But it is possible that God, bringing in the immense abundance of
locusts by a sudden whirlwind, gave the Egyptians a sign of their approaching
calamity, so that it might be more manifest that they had not arisen otherwise
than in accordance with the prediction of Moses. That "before them there were no
such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such," is no contradiction to
the declaration of Joel, who also affirms that such an instance had never
occurred, as that the locust should eat what the palmer-worm had left; and what
the locust had left the canker-worm should eat; and what the canker-worm had
left the caterpillar should eat.,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;290104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joel
1:4;) for he is not there speaking of a single punishment, but of its varied and
multiform continuation.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Pharaoh called for Moses and
Aaron in haste.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This haste arose from anxiety
and fear, because it was a time of extremity, and the enormity of the evil
admitted no delay. By this vehemence, then, Pharaoh betrays his distress, when
he not only willingly is inclined to recall Moses, whom he had lately driven
out, but does so in such haste. The confession which is added, although it
flowed from a double or deceitful heart, still was not altogether feigned. For
we cannot doubt that (because Pharaoh was conscious of his sin) God extorted
from him this cry, "I have sinned," under the smiting and compulsion of His
chastisements. For we must observe this distinction, which I have already laid
down, between the hypocrites who lie and deceive designedly, or who knowingly
and willfully delude others, and those who beguile themselves, and have a terror
of God's judgments, even while they cherish iniquity and impiety in the secret
recesses of their hearts. Pharaoh was a hypocrite of this latter kind, who,
although having no professed intention of deceiving either God or Moses, yet,
because he did not prove and examine himself, did not sincerely confess his sin.
And this must be carefully observed, lest any should slumber in false
repentance, as if temporary fear or forced humiliation could propitiate God. As
to his saying, that he had "sinned against the Lord God and the Israelites," it
must be thus explained, that he had been rebellious against God, because he had
unjustly afflicted that people which He had taken under His care, and into His
confidence. For, although he had not been taught by the Prophets, yet did he
hold this principle; that, because God by plain and illustrious miracles had
shown that people to be under His defense and protection, he had by his
iniquitous and tyrannical oppression of them committed an injury against their
patron and guardian.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He confesses, then, that he
is doubly culpable, because he had been cruel to the people, and had impiously
despised God. This would have been an evidence of true repentance, if it had
proceeded from pure and genuine feeling; for the sinner, voluntarily condemning
himself, prevents the judgment of God. His humiliation also appears in this
respect to have been by no means ordinary, when he humbly prays to Moses for
forgiveness; for it was no slight virtue, that a very powerful king should thus
submit himself to an obscure and despised individual; which even the lower
classes are often ashamed to do. But., inasmuch as his heart was still enchained
by secret corruption, he deceitfully made a show of the outward signs (of
humiliation) instead of the reality. Wherefore David, when he declares, "Blessed
is he whose transgression is forgiven, and whose sin is covered," has good cause
for adding, "and in whose spirit is no guile."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
32:1, 2.) In order, therefore, that we may prove to God, whose attribute it is
to search the heart, the truth of our repentance, let us learn seriously and
inwardly to examine ourselves, lest there should be any hypocrisy lurking within
us. The addition "only this once," is meant to testify the continuance of his
better mind; as though he acknowledged that he had been hitherto perfidious, and
promised that he would hereafter obey God in good earnest. Whence we gather,
that the reprobate do not return immediately to their natural habits and
disposition, because they are ignorant of the power and nature of true
conversion, but, because being without a spirit of uprightness, they have a
perverse and crooked heart. Moreover, by desiring only that this present death
should be removed from him, he seems not much to care for an entire
reconciliation with God; as it is usual for the wicked to be indifferent to the
hatred or favor of God, and only to have a dread of His hand. Careless, then, of
his sin, he merely wishes that punishment should be far removed from
him.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he went
out.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We have stated why the holy Prophet
went out from the king to pray, viz., because he was not worthy that the sacred
name of God should be invoked in his presence. Therefore Moses did not offer
prayer for him, because he thought him to be really converted, but that he might
open God's way for the remaining contests. If, indeed, a choice had been given
to the holy man, I do not doubt that he would have been disposed by his
extraordinary kindness of heart, willingly to provide for the tyrant's safety;
but, since he had heard the revelation of his desperate obstinacy, he was only
intent on manifesting the power of God. Nor is there any question that he prayed
under the special impulse of the Spirit, until he was assured of the final act;
and the event proves that his prayers were not vainly cast into the air, because
the land was immediately cleared of the locusts. We must have the same opinion
with respect to the west wind as we have lately advanced respecting the opposite
wind; for a temporary blast would not have been sufficient to dissipate so vast
and filthy a host; but, in both cases, God testified by a visible token that he
was influenced by the prayers of His servant, and that on this account the
plague was stayed. It is sufficiently well known that the Arabian Gulf is called
by the name of the Red Sea. By the Hebrews it is called

If, therefore, you choose to translate it into Latin it must be called "Mare
algosum et junceum," or "turbinosum." (The weedy and rushy sea, or the
tempestuous sea.) But, since there is something monstrous and incredible in such
raving obstinacy, it is expressly stated that his heart was hardened by God;
that we may learn to tremble at that terrible judgment, when the wicked, seized
by a spirit of madness, do not hesitate to provoke more and more that God whose
name overwhelms them with
terror.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto

without denouncing it; because Pharaoh had deceitfully broken his promise of
being obedient to His word. Since, therefore, he had so wickedly abused God's
clemency, he must needs be suddenly overtaken by a new calamity, that he might
in the darkness feel God's avenging hand, which he had despised. Nor, indeed,
would he have been alarmed by menaces; as it will directly appear, that, when he
was warned of the death of his first-born, and of the same slaughter both upon
the first-born of man and of beast through the whole land, he was unmoved, and
in his security provoked God, as if he had heard nothing. There is no wonder,
then, that God covered the whole land with darkness before Pharaoh could suspect
anything of the kind. At the end of the verse, some translate the word

it to be put indefinitely, understand a noun, with this meaning, "that a man
might feel." But if the transitive sense be preferred, it will be better
referred to Pharaoh. But I willingly subscribe to their opinion, who hold that
the darkness was so thick that it might be felt by the
hand.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses stretched forth his
hand.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this darkness God not only
wished to reprove the blindness of Pharaoh's mind, but in every way to convince
him how senseless and mad he was in his resistance. There is no blessing which
is more common to all men, from the very highest even to the lowest, than light,
which is enjoyed not less by the humblest and most contemptible people than by
the greatest kings. It was, then, a terrible judgment of God, that the whole
world should be enlightened by the sun's rays, whilst the Egyptians, although
possessing sight, were plunged in darkness. What madness, then, could be greater
than theirs, when in their hardness of heart they cease not to contend against
God's hand, formidable as it was? Their waters turned into blood had denied them
drink; frogs and other animals had filled the whole country; they had almost
been consumed by lice; their limbs had been enfevered by boils; the hail had
destroyed part of their corn; the locusts had brought still increased
destruction; even rocks and stones should have been somewhat terrified by such
warnings. This admonition, then, was very seasonable, viz., that darkness should
be spread over all Egypt, that they might understand that, when God was wrath
with them, the very hosts of heaven were armed against them. And, in order that
God's vengeance should be neither obscure nor doubtful, the cause of the
darkness could not be assigned to an eclipse, both on account of its density and
the time it lasted; for both of these circumstances are expressly noted by
Moses, that it may be more clear that the sun was obscured to the Egyptians,
because they had endeavored to extinguish God's glory by their impious contempt.
On the contrary, the Israelites must have acquired new cheerfulness when they
recognized in the sun's brightness that God's paternal countenance was shining
upon them; for He then enlightened them with His favor, as if to show them the
freedom of their egress. And, indeed, He might have at once led them forth from
their astonished enemies; but He chose, as we shall see, to prepare their
departure in another way.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Pharaoh called unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We gather that he was greatly
alarmed by this infliction; because of his own accord he again calls to him (as
before) the men who were so troublesome to him, and the authors of such sore
calamities, that he may treat with them of their departure. But it is asked how,
if no one rose from his place for three days, Pharaoh could send for Moses and
Aaron? If we were to answer that the messengers were sent after the darkness had
been dispersed, this objection must readily arise, via, that it does not appear
probable that this untamable wild beast should be so much subdued, when the
severity of the punishment was relaxed; for thus far we perceive that, as often
as God withdrew his hand, the proud tyrant, having cast aside his fear, returned
to his ferocity. My own opinion is, that whilst the exigency was still pressing
upon him, and he feared lest the darkness should be upon him for ever, he took
counsel how to appease Moses. But when it is here related, that "none rose from
his place," I understand that it is spoken hyperbolically, as though it were
said that they ceased from all the occupations which required light. But
although the night does not allow of our executing the works in which men are
employed by day, still it does not so confine them that they are unable to move
about. Neither has this hyperbole 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f127</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
anything harsh or severe in it, that the Egyptians were so overwhelmed with
darkness as to remain each one fixed as it were in his own place, and not to
behold each other; because in the three days darkness God forbade them from
performing their customary actions. Although Pharaoh is prepared to accord
somewhat more than before, still he does not make an end of shuffling. He allows
their little ones to go, provided their herds remain; either because he hoped
that the people might easily be recalled through fear of famine; or because his
loss would be at any rate less, if he were enriched by such spoils. For it. is
plain that he was very anxious about the men themselves, because he so very
reluctantly made the concession that they might go out to sacrifice without
their goods; which he would not have been unwilling to do, if he had only been
desirous of spoiling them. But this passage again teaches us, that the wicked
only partially yield to God, though they cease not meanwhile to struggle like
malefactors, who are compelled to follow the executioner when he drags them by a
rope round their necks, and yet are not on that account any the more obedient.
This, too, is to be observed, that the wicked are quick in inventing
subterfuges, when they are suffering under God's hand, and that they turn and
twist about in every direction to discover plans for escaping from a sincere and
hearty submission. When he says, "let your little ones also go with you," by
this particle of amplification he would make a specious show of generosity, in
order to cajole Moses and Aaron; as if he said, that he now at length granted
them what they had seemed chiefly to
require.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses no less severely repudiates
all exceptions, than as if he authoritatively demanded of the king what God had
enjoined. And assuredly, by this austere 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f128</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and abrupt manner of speaking he evidenced his courage, whereby he might humble
the arrogance and audacity of the impious king. His pretext indeed was, that
they had need of victims, and in this way he avoids the tyrant's greater
displeasure; but, at the same time, by directly excluding all conditions, and by
not leaving even a hair in the power of the king, he asserts the indivisible
right of God alone; that Pharaoh may know that all his evasions will profit him
nothing. The expression" there shall not a hoof be left behind," contains a
severe reproof, accompanied with anger and contempt; as if he would purposely
pique 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f129</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the virulent mind of the tyrant. But we have already said that there was no
dissimulation in these words: for, although the holy man knew that the counsel
of God had a further object, he still thought it sufficient to deliver the
commands which were prescribed to him; nor would: it be proper to suppose that
God is under an obligation always to make the wicked acquainted with all His
purposes.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's
heart.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>A probable conjecture may be
elicited front hence, that at the coming of Moses some light shone forth, so
that the darkness was not so thick; because Pharaoh would never have dared to
boast himself so proudly without being confident of impunity; but his pretences
at the commencement (of their interview) are here omitted by Moses, though the
mitigation of the horrible punishment which had urged him to supplication
depended upon them. But although he is still in a state of alarm, still he is
hardened, and prepares himself for every extremity rather than simply to obey
God. Here, also, according to his custom, Moses asserts that God was the author
of his obduracy; not because he inspired with obstinacy a heart otherwise
disposed to docility and obedience, but because He gave over as a slave to Satan
a reprobate who was willfully devoted to his own destruction, that he might rush
forward with still increasing pertinacity in his impiety. But, since Moses has
so often used this word, I am astonished at the boldness of certain sophists
who, by the substitution of the word <i>permission, </i>allow themselves by this
frivolous evasion to escape so plain a
statement.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Pharaoh said unto

"Animadverte, et dicto pare," (attend, and obey my word;) and, again, "Moriere,
si te secundo lumine hic offendero," (if I meet thee here again a second day,
thou shalt die.) Nor can it be doubted that Pharaoh, with his usual
intemperateness, now breaks out into fierce and cruel threats; but had he not
been carried away by a spirit of madness, he would not have so boldly opposed
himself to God's servant, whom he had so often known, by experience, to be
endued with unconquerable power, and to be so accredited by God, as to have
supreme dominion over all the elements. Hence, also, we gather, that he had not
been hitherto restrained from treating Moses with severity either by kindness,
or moderation, or patience; because, when the circumstances of his kingdom were
still flourishing, his wrath would have been more excessive; but that he was
kept back by some secret rein. But Moses shows by his answer, how completely he
set at naught all this froth; for he voluntarily defies him, and by declaring
that he will come before his face no more, signifies that he is not worthy that
he should labor any longer in his favor. But we see that the wicked king,
carried away by his fury, prophesied against the wishes of his own mind, for God
returned upon his own head what he threatened against another. Although, at the
same time, it must be remembered that Moses spoke thus not without authority,
but by God's command; because, unless he had been certainly taught that the last
trial was come, he would have ever stood in readiness for the performance of his
part. But it will presently appear from the context, that in this saying also he
was the true messenger of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">EXODUS

fall by his mortal wound. This verse, then, is connected with the preceding, and
explains its cause; because Moses would not have been at liberty to interrupt
the course of his vocation, unless he had now plainly known that he was arriving
at its conclusion. Nor would it otherwise agree with what follows, via, that
Moses spoke to Pharaoh after he had declared that he would not appear any more
in his sight, unless the subject were continued without interruption. But this
sentence is introduced parenthetically, (meaning) that however obstinate Pharaoh
might be, the hour was now come in which he must succumb to God. But God not
only declares that the heart of Pharaoh should be changed, so that he would not
hinder the people's departure, but that he would be himself anxious for that,
which he had so pertinaciously refused; for this is the meaning of the words, he
will not only send you away, but altogether thrust you out. For in his alarm at
their presence, he eagerly drove them from his
kingdom.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>

spoiling the Egyptians, of which mention was made in the third chapter, for it
was not enough for God to rescue His people from that cruel tyranny under which
their wretched lives were scarcely protracted in great poverty and distress,
unless He also enriched them with large possessions, as if they were carrying
away the prizes of victory from conquered enemies. This, therefore, was the
consummation of His otherwise extraordinary bounty, that they departed
splendidly adorned, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f133</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

Surely the sole authority of God absolves them from the accusation of theft and
sinful deception. But it cannot be permitted to any mortal man to censure or
cavil at anything in the commandment of God; not only because His decree is
above all laws, but because His most perfect will is the rule of all laws. For
neither therefore is God unanswerable to law, because: he delights in
uncontrollable power; but because in the perfection of His infinite justice
there is no need of law. But although the excuse which some allege is not
altogether without show of reason, viz., that the very severe labors which the
Egyptians had tyrannically exacted were worthy of some reward, and therefore
that God had justly permitted His people to exact the compensation of which they
would have been otherwise unjustly defrauded, still there is no necessity for
having recourse to these subtleties; for that principle, which we have elsewhere
laid down, ought to be sufficient, that God, in whose hands are the ends of the
earth, to destroy and to overturn at His will its kingdoms, and to change the
government of its nations, much more (has the right) so to distribute the wealth
and possessions of individuals, as to enrich some and to reduce others to
want.</font><br></div>

taking away of what is another's, those things which it has pleased God to
transfer to His own people, must not be counted the property of others. But if
by the laws of war it be permitted to the victors to gather up the spoil of the
enemy, why should we consider it less allowable for God to do so from the
Egyptians, whom He had overcome in ten illustrious battles, before He compelled
them to surrender? As to the pretense of borrowing, the reply is easy, for the
Israelitish women did not lie when they asked for the vessels for the purpose of
sacrifice: since God had thus commanded, in whose power it was afterwards to
devote them to other uses. Still part of them were dedicated to the sanctuary,
as we shall see elsewhere; for besides the altar, the censer, and the
candlestick, and other vessels of that kind, each of the tribes offered vials
and dishes of great value. Yet must we recollect that a particular case is here
related, imitation of which, without God's special command, would be
wrong.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>

</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f135</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
the people favor.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Because the Israelites
never could have hoped that the Egyptians, who had before rapaciously stripped
them of everything, would become so kind and liberal to them, Moses declares
that men's hearts are turned this way or that by God. For, as the Psalm
testifies, that the Egyptians were impelled by Him "to hate His people," (Psalm
105:25,) that He might make way for their glorious deliverance; so He was able
also to incline them in the opposite direction, that they should freely give
what they had before harshly refused, and not without threats and blows. This
doctrine is exceedingly useful to be known, because, when men are harsh and
cruel to us, it: teaches us patience, whilst we are assured that the passions of
wicked men only thus assail us, in so far as God would chastise our sins, and
exercise and humble us. It affords also no little consolation to alleviate our
pains, and seasonably arouses us to call upon God, that He would turn the minds
of our enemies from brutality and unkindness to gentleness. It appears from many
passages that this was ever the persuasion of all the pious, and unquestionably
the expression of Jacob to his sons, "God Almighty give (<i>dabit</i>)<i>
</i>you mercy before the man," was founded on this general feeling.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014314&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
43:14.) But, since Scripture is full of such testimonies, let it suffice to have
quoted this single one. Again, God does not always incline men to mercy, by the
Spirit of regeneration, so that they should be changed from wolves to lambs; but
sometimes by His secret inspiration He for a short time softens them though they
know it not, as we read here of the Egyptians. In the second clause of the
verse, where it is said, "Moreover the man Moses," etc., an inferior and
subordinate reason is given, which availed both to change the Egyptians as well
as to encourage the Israelites, so that both of them reverently deferred to his
words; for although this whole matter was governed by the power of God alone,
still He did not act simply by Himself, but having chosen Moses as His minister,
He assigned 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f136</font></sup><font face="Palatino">a
certain charge to him. Hence the veneration which made the Egyptians as well as
the Israelites obedient to him, that his labor might not be in vain. He only
speaks, indeed, of the Egyptian nation, (for after having spoken of "the land"
first, he adds two divisions, "Pharaoh's servants," i.e., the nobles and
courtiers, and then "the common people," for so in this place I understand the
word "people;") but we shall soon see that the miracles had had a good effect
upon the Israelites also, that they should more readily believe and obey. But;
this passage teaches us that God's servants are often prized and honored, where
yet faith in their doctrine is not possessed, for although the Egyptians
reverence and highly esteem Moses, they do not therefore incline to seek 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f137</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
after piety. And thus the wicked often fear God Himself, when influenced by
particular circumstances, and yet do not devote themselves to His
service.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses said, Thus saith
the Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I lately said that Moses did
not go from Pharaoh's presence until he had delivered the message of his final
destruction. This denunciation is, therefore, connected with the foregoing
passage. Whence it appears how courageously Moses sustained the menaces of the
tyrant, whilst he willingly encounters him, and boasts that he shall be his
conqueror, though he be not in his presence, by the death of his first-born son
in the coming night. Nor is it to be doubted that Pharaoh was confounded with
terror, since, although so cruelly repulsed, he dismissed the Prophet in safety.
Assuredly, since so unreserved a threatening must; have inflicted a very bitter
pang, so it would have aroused the cruelty of the raging tyrant, unless the same
God who had endued His servant with admirable firmness, had also controlled the
impetuosity of the savage beast. Why God, in inflicting punishment on the
children, postponed till another time that of the fathers, whose sin was
greater; why, in wreaking vengeance on the beasts, He spared men, it is not our
province curiously to inquire, because 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f138</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
it is sinful to prescribe to God, whose incomprehensible wisdom surmounts all
human understanding, what should be the rule or measure of His judgments. By
bringing the children and beasts to punishment, He certainly represented clearly
to the wicked despisers of His power, what they had deserved. The first-born of
Pharaoh, who would have been heir of the kingdom, is placed in the first rank of
victims; afterwards the whole body of humbler people is mentioned, for the
maid-servants, who turned their revolving mills, occupied a very low and
despised condition, as appears not only from the ancient poets, but from the
testimony of Scripture itself.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;090816&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 8:16.) If any one chooses to observe the analogy between this plague and
the unjust tyranny by which the Egyptians had afflicted Israel, God's first-born
son, I make no objection. God again puts a difference between the Egyptians and
his own people, when he declares that, in the midst of the great cry, the latter
shall be quiet and tranquil. For this is the meaning of the figure, "A dog shall
not move his tongue," because dogs are wont to bark at the very least noise in
the night. Moreover, although such a separation between the faithful and
unbelievers does not always appear, but rather do similar punishments generally
involve them both together, yet in the final issue God divides them very widely
one from the other. Wherefore we can never lose this felicity, that we know that
all afflictions conspire unto the salvation of us, whom he has once embraced
with His loving-kindness.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And all these thy servants
shall come down.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Thus far Moses had
reported the words of God; he now begins to speak in his own person, and
announces that, by Pharaoh's command, messengers would come from his court, who
would voluntarily and humbly crave for what he had refused respecting the
dismissal of the Israelites. The great asperity of these words inflicted no
slight; wound on the tyrant's mind, for it was the same as if he had said
&#8212; Thus far I have entreated you to allow God's people to depart; now,
whether you will or not, I will freely go, and not even without the request of
yourself and your followers. What he then relates, that he went out "in the heat
of anger," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f139</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
or "in a great anger," shows us that the servants of God, even when they truly
and faithfully perform their duty, are so disturbed with indignation against
sin, that they are by no means restrained from being affected with anger. Nor is
there any question that Moses was thus excited to wrath by the impulse of the
Spirit. Yet, since we are naturally too prone to impetuous passions, we must
diligently beware lest our indignation exceed due bounds. The Spirit awakened in
the heart of Moses this zeal, which here is mentioned, but he at the same time
moderated it, so that it should contain no admixture of unregulated passion. But
since it may, and often does happen that the faithful, when influenced by pious
zeal, still do not sufficiently restrain themselves, nor keep themselves within
due bounds, the spirit of gentleness and propriety must be asked of God, which
may prevent all excesses. Yet the anger of Moses is a proof to us that God would
not have us lazily and coldly perform the duties which He entrusts to us; and,
therefore, that nothing is more preposterous than for certain cynics, whilst
they jokingly and ridiculously philosophize concerning the doctrines of
religion, and sting God's servants with their laughing and wanton witticisms, to
deride their vehemence, which is rather worthy of the highest
praise.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This seems to be a representation
of the reason why Moses was so angry; viz., because he had been forewarned that
he had to do with a lost and desperate man. When, therefore, after so many
contests, he sees the dominion of God despised by the audacity and madness of
the tyrant, deeper indignation bursts from him in their last struggle;
especially because he sees before his eyes that detestable prodigy, viz., an
earthen vessel so bold as to provoke God with indomitable obstinacy. But God had
foretold to Moses (as we have already seen) the end of this his exceeding
stubbornness, lest, having so often suffered repulse, he should faint at length.
Otherwise, there might have crept in no trifling temptation, as to how it could
please God to contend in vain with a mortal man. And it was absurd that the
hardness of a human heart could not be either subdued, or corrected, or broken
by the divine power. God, therefore, asserts that He was thus designing His own
glory, which he desired to manifest by various miracles; and on this account he
adds again in the next verse, that Pharaoh's heart was again hardened by God
Himself; whereby he signifies, that the tyrant thus pertinaciously resisted, not
without the knowledge and will of God, in order that the deliverance might be
more wonderful.</font><br><br></div>

has related in the beginning of the chapter up to this verse, because it
pertains to the perpetual doctrine of the Law. I shall hereafter insert it in
its proper place. But., since here also God gave precepts as to the observation
of the Passover, I have thought it right to interweave them with the history;
because Moses does not merely teach here what God would have observed by His
people in all ages, but relates what He required on a particular occasion. But
my readers are to be reminded that some precepts are temporary, and some
perpetual, like the Law itself. Of this we may see a clear and familiar example
in the chapter before us. For up to this place, Moses had explained what; would
be the due observation of the Passover year by year for ever; but now he only
relates historically, that, on the night in which the people went forth, they
celebrated the Passover according' to God's command. I shall, therefore, lightly
touch upon what is here repeated; since a more fitting place for a full
exposition will be, when we come to the doctrine of the law. The word

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f140</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>pesech, </i>means a <i>passing-over, </i>not of the people, (as many have
falsely thought,) but of God Himself, who passed over the houses of the
Israelites without harm, when He slew the first-born in all Egypt. Since, then,
the wrath of God, which then like a deluge covered the whole of Egypt, left the
Israelites untouched, He instituted a memorial of His <i>passing-over,
</i>whereby they had been preserved in safety amidst the public destruction of
the whole land. He is also said to have passed-over the Egyptians, whom He
deprived of their first-born; but after a different manner, because He spared
His chosen ones, as if they had been far away, or protected in places of sure
refuge.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Moses called for all the
elders.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>His address is especially
directed to the elders, that they might afterwards repeat it to the multitude;
for he could not have been heard at the same time by so great a number of
people. But, although the disorganization of the people had been terrible under
that severe tyranny, still God willed that certain relics of order should be
preserved, and did not suffer those, whom He had adopted, to be deprived of all
government. This also had been an availing means of preserving their unity, so
that the chosen seed of Abraham should not be lost. But Moses here only speaks
of the sprinkling of the blood; because he had already addressed them as to the
eating of the lamb. He therefore commands branches of hyssop to be dipped in the
blood, which had been caught in the basin, and every one's lintel and two
side-posts to be sprinkled with this. By which sign God testified that He will
preserve His people from the common destruction, because they will be discerned
from the wicked by the mark of blood. For it was necessary that the Israelites
should first be reminded, that by the expiation of the sacrifice, they were
delivered from the plague, and their houses preserved untouched; and, secondly,
that the sacrifice would profit them, only if its conspicuous sign existed among
them. We elsewhere see that the Paschal lamb was a type of Christ, who by His
death propitiated His Father, so that we should not perish with the rest of the
world. But, already of old time, He desired to bear witness to the ancients
under the Law, that He would not be reconciled to them otherwise than through
the sacrifice of a victim. And there is no doubt that by this visible symbol He
raised up their minds to that true and heavenly Exemplar, whom it would be
absurd and profane to separate from the ceremonies of the law. For what could be
more childish than to offer the blood of an animal as a protection against the
hand of God, or to seek from thence a ground of safety? God, then, shows that He
spares the Israelites on no other condition but that of sacrifice; from whence
it follows, that the death of Christ was set before them in this ordinance,
which alone constituted the difference between them and the Egyptians. But at
the same time He taught that no advantage was to be expected from the blood
poured forth, without the sprinkling; not that the external and visible
sprinkling produced any good effect, but because by this familiar rite it was
useful that the ignorant should be brought to perceive the truth, and that they
might know that what was put before them Visibly must be spiritually fulfilled.
It is notorious from the testimony of Peter,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 1:2,) that our souls are sprinkled with the blood of Christ by the Spirit.
This was typified by the bunch of hyssop, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f141</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which herb possesses great cleansing power, and therefore, was often used in
other sacrifices also, as we shall hereafter see in the proper
places.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the Lord will pass
through.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He forbids them to go out
during the night, lest they should mix themselves with the Egyptians, but
commands them to keep quietly under the protection of the blood. By this sign
they were admonished that they also were exposed to destruction, if they did not
separate themselves from the unbelievers under the safeguard of the blood.
Afterwards the promise: is added, that, provided this were done, the angel would
pass them over, and inflict no injury upon them, because God would acknowledge
the houses so marked as His own. Wherefore, it is again repeated, that they
should alone be safe by the blessing of the blood, who should not neglect to
sprinkle themselves with it; because faith alone confers upon us the salvation
which is obtained by the slaughter of the victim. The angel, whom God had
delegated for afflicting Egypt, is here undoubtedly called "the destroyer;" and,
although He often executes His judgments by evil angels, it is to be gathered
from other passages that this was one of the elect angels, who also was the
minister of the people's deliverance under Christ as the

obedience by solemn adoration. This indeed they had already done from the
beginning, but with little constancy, because they had been so harassed by their
afflictions as to neglect their duty; but now they correct the fault of
ingratitude. Therefore, they not only declare their feelings of seriousness by

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass, that at
midnight.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Lest the hand of God should be
hidden in this miracle, as well in the preservation of the people as in taking
vengeance upon the Egyptians, Moses sets forth its power by many circumstances.
For he both relates that the destruction took place at midnight, which was the
time prescribed by God, and then adds, that all the first-born of the land were
smitten, from the son of the king to the son of the captive in the dungeon. It
is thus that he indicates proverbially the most abject persons, as he had said
before, "unto the first-born of the maidservant that is behind the mill." For it
could only be by an extraordinary miracle that this calamity could affect every
house without exception, at the same hour, especially when it extended even to
the beasts. <i>Thirdly, </i>he recounts that all the Egyptians were aroused
suddenly, and manifestly convinced that the God of Israel was wroth with them.
<i>Fourthly, </i>that Pharaoh humbly prayed of Moses to lead forth the people in
haste; nay, that he even importunately thrust them out. Yet not even by such
clear and solid proofs has the dishonesty and impudence of some been prevented
from attempting to upset by their falsehoods this memorable work of God. The
calumnies are too well known which Josephus refutes in his reply to Apion the
Grammarian; and it appears from Justin 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f144</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that they were generally received. Nor can we wonder that the devil should have
employed all sorts of artifices, so that by the introduction of various fables
he might efface from men's minds the redemption of the Church. But here also was
manifested the admirable wisdom of God, that the futility of these absurdities
refutes itself, without the use of any arguments against them. Perhaps there was
no intention to deceive on the part of profane writers, when they reported these
frivolous and silly stories about the Jews; for doubtless Strabo 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f145</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
desired to give the true history of the origin of circumcision when he wrote his
foolish and unfounded fables. Nor did even Cornelius Tacitus, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f146</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
although he wrote with malignant and virulent feelings, intentionally put
himself to shame; but when by the impulse of Satan they obscured God's glory,
they were smitten with blindness and folly, so that their ridiculous want of
truth might be discovered even by children; from whence, however, some sparks of
fact may still be elicited, because God would not suffer so memorable an
operation to be altogether forgotten, of which these blind men were the
proclaimers, when the devil was using their aid to obliterate its
memory.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he called for
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is not probable that God's
servants were recalled into the presence of Pharaoh; but the sense of this
passage must be sought for in the prediction of Moses. Pharaoh, therefore, is
said to have called them, when, by sending to them his chief courtiers, he
compelled their departure. And this is sufficiently proved by the context,
because it is immediately added, that the Israelites were by the Egyptians
compelled to go out: in haste. Therefore, although Pharaoh never should have
seen Moses from the time that he threatened him with death if he came to him
again, there is nothing absurd in saying that he called for him when he sent his
nobles to him with his command. The perturbation of an alarmed and anxious
person is expressed to the life in these words, &#8212; "Rise up, get you forth,
both ye and your children; go, serve the Lord; also take your flocks and your
herds, as ye have said." For he takes no less precaution lest he should give any
occasion for delay, than he had before been diligent in bargaining. Whilst,
then, he hastily cuts off all objections, the change in the man betrays itself,
for the same God who had before hardened his iron heart has now broken it.
Hence, too, that cry &#8212; the signal of despair &#8212; "We be all dead men;"
hence, too, their readiness to give willingly of their substance, and to dress
up in spoils those whom they had pillaged before. Nor indeed does he without
reason repeat that this favor proceeded from divine inspiration, since there
would never have been such liberality in robbers as willingly to proffer
whatever precious things their houses possessed, and to give them to the
Israelites, now ready to depart, whom they knew to be justly hostile to them on
account of so many injuries. And that the children of Israel should be so prompt
to obey, who before had been either slow, or inconstant, or sullen, or
rebellious, was brought about by the guidance of the Spirit, who turned their
hearts in a moment; since God well knew how to dispose opportunely all the
springs of action.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>37.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the children of Israel
journeyed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although it is probable that
they were more widely dispersed, since that district could not have contained so
great a multitude, especially when the Egyptians occupied it together with them;
still because the recollection of the promise remained among them, from whence
some hope of their redemption always was preserved, it is not wonderful that
they should have preferred to be kept within narrow bounds, to their great
inconvenience, rather than, by seeking other habitations, to separate from the
main body. That this was the peculiar abode of the nation is plain also from
what has gone before, where Moses related that they were forced to servile tasks
in building those fortified cities wherein they might be shut up, as in prison.
In the number of men which he reports, he commends the incredible miracle of
God's favor in increasing and multiplying their race. Thus is the effrontery of
the impious refuted who think it a sufficient ground for their sneers, that this
great people could not in so short a time have naturally proceeded from a single
family; and therefore they burst out into unrestrained and blasphemous laughter,
as if Moses were simply relating what had happened, and not rather extolling the
extraordinary power of God in the sudden increase of His Church. But we know
that it was no more a matter of difficulty for the Creator of the whole world to
exceed the ordinary course of nature, in the multiplication of a particular
nation, than at the beginning to produce speedily many people from one man and
woman; and again, after the deluge, to renew the human race by a miraculous
augmentation. Now, this is the peculiar character of the Church, that in
producing and preserving it, God exerts unusual power, that it may be separated
from the common condition of mankind; for although it sojourns on earth, yet is
its nature in a manner heavenly, that the work of God may shine forth more
brightly in it. No wonder then if, contrary to usual custom, it should emerge,
as it were, from nothing, if it grows in the same way and makes continual
progress. Such an example does Paul set before us in Romans 4., in the person of
Abraham. But whilst the impious despisers of God betray their stupidity in their
wicked audacity, when they estimate this work of God by their own senses and by
common reason, so, too, do they foolishly err who attempt to defend Moses by
philosophical arguments; for his intention was very different, viz., to show
that the promises were not unfulfilled, "I will multiply thy seed as the stars
of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis

comprehension.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>38.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And a mixed
multitude.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although Abraham possessed
many servants, yet is it scarcely probable that in the famine Jacob maintained
any other persons in his family besides his own children, whom he could hardly
so sustain as to preserve them from dying of hunger. And since Moses, in
relating their coming into Egypt, does not mention any servants, we may
conjecture that they brought no great number, because necessity compelled them
to be content at any rate with a few. From hence we gather that the mixed
multitude, which united themselves with the Israelites, were either the
offspring of Egypt, or had migrated from the neighboring countries to take up
their habitation there; as fertile lands often attract many strangers to them by
the pleasures of abundance. The same expression is used in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;161303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Nehemiah
13:3, where it is said that "the mixed multitude" was separated from the true
Israelites, lest all should promiscuously arrogate to themselves the same
dignity, and, thus the Church should be polluted by a confused admixture, But if
any should think it absurd that ungodly men, with no better hope before them,
would voluntarily forsake a rich and convenient habitation in order to seek a
new home as wanderers and pilgrims, let him recollect that Egypt had now been
afflicted by so many calamities that by its very poverty and devastation it
might easily have driven away its inhabitants. A great part of the cattle had
perished; all the fruits of the earth were corrupted; the fields were ravaged
and almost desert; we need not, therefore, wonder if despair should have caused
many sojourners to fly away, and even some of the natives themselves. It may be
also that, having been inhumanly treated, they shook off the yoke of tyranny
when a way to liberty was opened to them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But
although God gave His people a ready departure, still He did not choose to let
them go out altogether without any inconvenience; for they go not out satiated
with food, nor having delicately supped, but are compelled to carry in their
bags unbaked masses of dough, that they may eat bread burned or toasted on the
embers in their journey. By this example we are taught that God's blessings are
always mingled with certain inconveniences, lest too great delight should
corrupt the minds of the
godly.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus 12:40-42, 50,

this period is not reckoned from the coming down of Jacob, for it is very clear
from other passages, that, from the time that Jacob entered into Egypt to the
Exodus, not more than 230 years at most had passed. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f147</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The Jews generally only reckon 210; but Moses includes also the period during
which Abraham and his children were not in possession of the promised land. The
meaning therefore is, that from the time that the inheritance of the land of
Canaan was given to Abraham, the promise was suspended for 400, years before his
posterity enjoyed their right. For Paul also thus explains this difficulty,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:1,) where he says, that God had confirmed his covenant with Abraham 430 years
before the law was promulgated. Moses, therefore, dates the commencement of this
period from the sojourning of Abraham, when he was still the lord of the land of
Canaan by the just title of donation. With respect to the omission of the thirty
years in the 15th chapter of Genesis, in this there is no contradiction, because
the land had already been promised to Abraham some years previously, though, so
far from obtaining dominion over it, he had scarcely been permitted to occupy it
as "a stranger." Therefore God apprizes him, that 400 years still remained
before he would put his descendants into possession of it; and, consequently,
that the little time which had elapsed was not sufficient for the trial of his
patience, but that both for himself and for his posterity there was need of
extraordinary endurance, lest they should faint under the weariness of the long
delay. Moreover, there is no departure from the usual manner of speaking, in His
not exactly reckoning the number of years. More than 400 years, some twenty, or
thereabouts, indeed, remained; but, since God had no other object than to exhort
His people to patience, He does not accurately compute or define the exact
number of years, because it was sufficient to put before them 400 years in a
round sum. In the same way, it is added in the next verse, "at the end of 430
years," viz., from the time that Abraham had begun to be the legitimate lord of
the land; for Moses wished to show, that although God had long delayed the
fulfillment of His promise, still His truth and faithfulness were certainly
proved, not only because He had precisely performed what He had proraised, but
because He had observed the: foreappointed time. He calls the people, weak as
they were, by an honorable title, "the hosts of the Lord," both to enforce again
the power of God's blessing, and to give due honor to His grace in ruling and
marshalling so confused a band. Although soldiers may be accustomed to
obedience, and have learnt from exercise to keep their ranks; although they may
have generals, commandants, and captains, and banners also under which to range
themselves, still it is a very difficult thing to march an army of 20,000, or
30,000 men by night without. confusion, and in good order; how great a miracle
was it, then, for 600,000 men, with women and children, much baggage, herds, and
flocks, and other encumbrances, to pass by night through the midst of enemies,
and all to escape safely without a single exception! To the same effect, Moses
repeats in the last verse of this chapter, that "the Lord did bring the children
of Israel out &#8212; by their armies," as much as to say, that there was no
confusion in that immense multitude; since God performed the part of an
incomparable Leader in His marvelous
power.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>42.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is a night to be much
observed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He shows that the Israelites
have good cause for sacrificing to God with a solemn ceremony year by year for
ever, and for celebrating the memory of that night; and that the Passover was
instituted in token of their gratitude. But this admonition was very useful, in
order that the Israelites should retain the legitimate use of this solemn
feast-day, and that it might not grow into a mere cold ceremony, as is often the
case; but that rather they might profitably, and to the advancement of their
piety, exercise themselves in this emblem of their redemption. At the same time,
he teaches that this so inestimable a benefit was not to be celebrated in one,
or two, or three generations, but that as long as the people should remain it
was worthy of eternal remembrance, and that it might never be forgotten, the
Passover was to be sacredly observed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moreover
we must remark, that the generations of the ancient people were brought to an
end by the coming of Christ; because the shadows of the Law ceased when the
state of the Church was renewed, and the Gentiles were gathered into the same
body.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>50.</b>

praised, as the wondrous power of God in fashioning their hearts, and directing
their hands, so that, in the darkness of the night, amidst the greatest
disturbances, in precipitate haste, with nothing well prepared, they were so
active and dexterous. Meanwhile, Moses concludes, from the obedience of the
people, that nothing was done without the command and guidance of God; from
whence it is more clearly manifest that He was the sole author of their
deliverance.</font><br><br></div>

why God did not immediately lead His people by the more direct way into the land
of Canaan, which would have been just as easy to Him, but preferred to bring
them round through the desert, by a long and difficult and dangerous journey;
viz., lest, if perhaps they had met with enemies to contend against, a ready
means of return would have encouraged them to go back into Egypt. We know how
great was the supineness and cowardice of this people, as soon as any difficulty
presented itself; and how quick they were to revolt from the divine government,
as often as a heavier burden than they liked was imposed upon them. We know how
often they repented of having followed God as their leader, and thus were
prepared to throw away by their ingratitude the grace offered to them. When,
therefore, they were powerless in the use of arms, and were altogether without
experience of military tactics, with what courage would they have engaged with
an enemy, if any should have advanced against them within a few days of their
coming out? Assuredly they would not have borne up against a single assault, but
would have been willing rather to submit themselves to the Egyptians, with
humble supplications for forgiveness. Lest, then, any desire of return should
steal over their hearts, God was willing to set up a barrier behind them in the
difficulty of the journey. Besides, if in their departure from Egypt they had
immediately encountered the inhabitants of the land of Canaan in war, greater
troubles would have awaited them; for the Egyptians would by no means let them
alone, but., being aided by the subsidies and forces of so many peoples, would
have endeavored to avenge themselves, and, having entered into alliances on
every side, would have hemmed in the unhappy Israelites. Wherefore, God provided
excellently for them, by leading them through inaccessible paths, and by their
very weariness shutting the door against their ever desiring to return into
Egypt; while afterwards He gradually restored their' confidence, before they
came to fight, and had to sustain the attacks of their enemies. I admit, indeed,
that God might have otherwise obviated all these evils; but since He is often
wont to deal with His people on human principles, He chose to adopt the method
which was most suited to their infirmity. Moses now commends this His admirable
design, in order that we may know that nothing was omitted by Him which was for
the safety and advantage of His people. For this "God said," which he mentions,
refers to His providence; as much as to say, that the easier and more ordinary
passage was not undesignedly rejected, but that because God knew it to be more
expedient, He thus advisedly obviated the
temptation.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b><i>

<i>chemishim, </i>is derived from "Five," from whence some have explained it,
that they were furnished with five kinds of arms, but this is too absurd. The
Hebrews, because they could conjecture nothing better or more probable, almost
with one consent would understand it, that they were armed under the fifth rib.
But whence were there so many military corselets ready for the Israelites? But I
reject so forced and improbable a meaning, and doubt not that the word is one of
number; as though Moses had said, that they went out in ranks of five; because,
if each individual in so great a multitude had tried to advance, they would have
been in each other's way. I have therefore thought fit to translate it
"dispositi," (in ranks.) The idea of the Greeks about "the fifth generation," is
very foreign to the present narrative. But in the sense I have given it, there
is nothing obscure or doubtful; for it readily appears that God's favor is
celebrated also in this particular, because He led forth His people in order.
For, although they came out confusedly and hastily, still He restrained there,
as it were, under His banner, and in companies, lest any disturbance should
occur.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses took the bones of
Joseph with him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Hence it appears, that
even in their adversity the memory of their promised deliverance had never
departed from the people, for had not the adjuration of Joseph been currently
spoken of in common conversation, Moses would never have been able to imagine
it; but he expressly states that he acted in obedience to the holy patriarch in
carrying away his bones. It is, therefore, probable that they were so deposited,
that the hope of the people might be kept alive by seeing daily the urn or
coffer which contained them, as if the holy man even after death uplifted from
his tomb a sign of their deliverance; for although by this symbolical act he
cherished his own faith, when he desired that, though dead, he might enter on
the possession of the promised land, yet there is no doubt that he had more
regard to his brethren and the whole posterity of the holy race. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f149</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For, having known by experience their apathy and the weakness of their faith, he
naturally feared lest in a longer lapse of time they should grow more and more
indifferent, and at length should despise the proraise, and give themselves up
altogether to listlessness about it. And certainly it must have been this
mistrust of them which urged him not to be contented with a simple injunction,
but to bind their minds more strongly by an oath. In
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440716&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
7:16, Stephen seems to assert that the other eleven sons of Jacob were also
buried in Sichem; and it may be probably conjectured, that they were led piously
to emulate the example of their brother Joseph. Assuredly the faith of the
departed Joseph, even in his dry bones, preached loudly to his descendants of
the promised deliverance, lest they should grow careless from the long delay;
and when at length the Israelites were led forth, the bones or ashes of the
twelve Patriarchs were like so many standard-bearers, going before the several
tribes to encourage their confidence. Wherefore the cowardice of the people was
still more detestable, so often basely turning their backs upon their journey,
when they had in sight so eminent a ground for confidence. The words of Joseph,
which Moses reports, "God will surely visit you," etc., confirm the expression
of the Apostle,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581122&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:22,) that "by faith &#8212; he gave commandment concerning his bones,"
because he thus takes upon himself the character and office of their surety, to
exhort his nation to embrace the promise. How far the silly superstition of the
Papists in worshipping the relics of saints differs from this object we may
gather from hence without difficulty, viz., that they studiously catch at every
means whereby they may be withdrawn further from the word of
God.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord went before
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses here proclaims another of
God's mercies, that, having redeemed His people, He was their constant leader
and guide; as the Prophet also in the Psalms distinctly makes reference to both.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197715&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
77:15; and 78:14.) It was indeed a marvelous act of loving-kindness that,
accommodating Himself to their ignorance, he familiarly presented Himself before
their eyes. He might, indeed, have protected them in some other way from the
heat of the sun, and directed them in the darkness of the night; but, in order
that His power might be more manifest, He chose to add also His visible
presence, to remove all room for doubt. But, although the words of Moses seem in
some measure to include the Lord in the cloud, we must observe the sacramental
mode of speaking, wherein God transfers His name to visible figures; not to
affix to them His essence, or to circumscribe His infinity, but only to show
that He does not deceitfully expose the signs of His presence to men's eyes, but
that the exhibition of the thing signified is at the same time truly conjoined
with them. Therefore, although Moses states that God was in the cloud and in the
pillar of fire, yet does he not wish to draw Him down from heaven, nor to
subject His infinite glory to visible signs, with which His truth may consist
without His local presence. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f150</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But execrable is the mad notion of Servetus, who pretended that this cloud was
uncreated, as though it were the Deity of Christ, for he substituted this One
Person for the Three, as if there had then been a corporeal Deity, which he
calls the "figurative Son," who was afterwards made flesh; not that He put on
flesh, but because He appeared as man, compounded of three uncreated elements,
and of the seed of David. But, soon after, Moses calls this same being an Angel,
to which he now assigns the name of the eternal God. And with good reason,
because our heavenly Father then led the Israelites only by the hand of His
only-begotten Son. Now, since He is the eternal guardian of His Church, Christ
is not less truly present with us now by His power than he was formerly manifest
to the fathers. When, therefore, Isaiah prophesies His coming, he recounts
amongst others this divine blessing, that "the Lord will create upon every
dwelling-place of Mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day,
and the shining of a flaming fire by night," &#8212; that there might
be</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"a tabernacle for a shadow in
the day-time from the heat, and for a place of refuge and for a covert from
storm and from
rain,"</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230405&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah

and substantially fulfill what then was seen under a figurative symbol. And
surely that promise, &#8212;</font><br></div>

thee by day, nor the moon by night," (Psalm 121:6,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">refers not to a single day, but to all ages. The
statement of Moses, then, that "He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day,
nor the pillar of fire by night," is a blessing which God extends to us, as well
as to them, except only the visible symbol, which was temporary, on account of
the infirmity of the people. As to his saying' that God always appeared to them,
that they might march by night as well as by day, he does not mean that they
went on continually without any rest, since he had just before mentioned that
their first station was in Succoth, from whence they encamped in Etham, but
merely informs us that the flow of God's grace was continual, since the token of
His favor and protection shone forth no less amidst the darkness of the night
than at midday itself.</font><br><br></div>

by which the Israelites might have escaped, now opens a course for His wonderful
power, and by bringing them for one moment to despair, provided for the safety
of His Church through a long period of time. This final act, then, marvelously
illustrated the grace of God, so that the people, however ungrateful and
disaffected they might be, should still acknowledge God as their deliverer;
besides, its consequence was, that the forces of Egypt not only being broken,
but the whole nation being destroyed, or, at least, the flower of it
extinguished, it brought no further trouble upon the people until they were
established in the land of Canaan. If they had freely and peacefully gone forth,
with the king and the people of Egypt quiet, the former miracles would not have
sufficiently availed to testify their redemption; but when, being everywhere
shut in, they see nothing but death before them, whilst the sea suddenly and
unexpectedly affords them a passage, and overwhelms their enemies pressing on
them from behind, they are obliged to confess that they were not only saved from
death but from the deepest abysses by the hand of God. But it appears that, when
they were commanded by Moses to cast themselves, and, as it were, to ingulf
themselves in the narrow passage, of which mention is made, they were astonished
by the miracles, and like them that dream, since they obeyed without hesitation,
although the very aspect of the place must have inspired them with horror. For,
if they had apprehended danger, their readiness to obey would not have been so
great, as we shall presently see. Wherefore it was the intention of Moses not so
much to praise them, as the providence of God. For it is plain, that unless they
had been amazed by the miracles, of which they had seen so many, they scarcely
could have been induced willingly to throw themselves into. defiles from whence
there was no retreat. From the word

<i>hachiroth, </i>nor do I see why the Greeks should have translated it "the

conjectured that it was contracted by piles. Because the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chor, </i>signifies a cave or hole, I know not whether the place might not
have obtained its name, as the mouth of the holes or caverns; for the letter

the Hebrews. Or perhaps some may think it more likely, that though it was

gender is put for the masculine, and it will be "the mouth of the mountains."
But although we may be ignorant of the etymology of the second word, the word
"mouth" makes it certain that the defile was inclosed by rocks, and of narrow
access. Although, if I may tender my own judgment in a doubtful matter, I rather
consider that it is derived from the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">trj</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
charath, </i>which means to engrave, or to furrow, because the rocks were cut as

as to rush upon his destruction. For, if the people had come into the land of
Canaan by a direct course, they could not have been so readily pursued;
therefore God, for the sake, of magnifying His glory, set a bait to catch the

explained, that they were to be "confounded in the land," because they would
find no way of egress; as being on all sides hemmed in in the narrow passage,
with the sea behind them. And where He speaks of the intentions of Pharaoh, He
does not, as men do, conceive a mere probability, but; He declares the secret
mind of the tryrant, as of a thing which He well knew, since it is His attribute
to discern our hearts. Afterwards He goes still further; for he signifies not
only that He foresaw what would happen, but again repeats what we have so often
observed before, that he would harden Pharaoh's heart, that he should follow
after the people. Whence it follows, that all this was directed by tits will and
guidance. But He did not testify this to Hoses only in private, but would have
them all previously admonished, lest, being terrified by the sudden assault of
their enemies, they should despair of safety. But this admonition was less
useful to them than it should have been; because, being soon after surprised,
they are not less alarmed than as if they had been brought into danger through
the error of God and the ignorance of
Moses.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>

but secret; but that the circumstances were reported to him, which stirred him
up to make an attack upon them. When, then, he hears that the people fled in
haste, he thinks that they may be retained by the slightest obstacle. Nor is he
alone influenced by this foolish thought, but all his courtiers blame their own
inertness for letting the people go. They inquire among themselves, Why they
have let the children of Israel depart? as if they had not endeavored in every
way to prevent their free exit &#8212; as if their pertinacity had not been ten
times divinely overcome &#8212; as if God had not at length torn the people from
them, in spite of their reluctance. But this is the stupidity of the wicked,
that they only dread God's present hand, and immediately forget all that they
have seen. They were worn out by the fierce and dreadful punishments; but now,
as if nothing had happened, they discuss why they had not resisted God even to
the end, when he had compelled them to submit with extreme reluctance, after
they had ten times found out that they struggled against Him in vain. But such
is the pride by which the reprobate must be blinded, that they may be driven
onwards to their own destruction, while they are persuaded that there is nothing
difficult to them, and fight against.

cried out that all was over with them; scarcely has a day passed, when they
collect a powerful army as if their forces were uninjured. If any object that

altogether from care and fear; and whence even the desire of calling on God had
grown cold in them, as security always produces drowsiness and an idle spirit.
Hence it came to pass, that this great danger, which they had not expected.
produced the greater fear. But, on the other hand, Moses exalts God's grace,
because he so opportunely and so critically came to the help of the wretched
Israelites exulting in their foolish joy; for otherwise, being suddenly
overtaken, they would have fallen at once into confusion at the first shout of
the enemy. Thus are we admonished by this example, that, while we are safe under
God's protection, the dangers, which might happen, are to be apprehended, not
that we may be anxious and alarmed, but that we may humbly repose under His
wings, and not be uplifted with inconsiderate joy. In the next verse Moses
briefly relates, how formidable a sight presented itself to the Israelites, when
they saw themselves shut in on one part by the sea, ingulfed, as it were, on
both sides by the jaws of the defile, and the army of Pharaoh at the same time

for fear even in the bravest hearts, unless there had been something very
extraordinary about them. But they sinned doubly; because both the hope of
divine assistance had abandoned their hearts together with the recollection of
God's mercies; and they advanced to such an extent of ingratitude as to revolt
insolently against God and Moses. Although there is an appearance of two
contrary facts being here reported, viz., that they cried out unto the Lord, and
mutinied against His minister; yet we may easily gather that this cry neither
arose from faith nor from serious and! well-ordered affections, but that it was
extorted by a confused impulse; since the natural sense impels all men, in their
adversity, promiscuously to offer their prayers to God, although they neither
embrace His mercy nor rely on His power. Thus David, in Psalm 107, says that all
the distressed have recourse to God when any trouble oppresses them; because
God, by the leadings of nature and by secret instinct, draws them to Him in
their danger, in order that the most careless and most profane may be rendered
more inexcusable. Yet in this way do they not render due honor to God, although
by the utterance of their mouths they ask for safety from Him. It is, then,
little to be wondered at, that the Israelites being reduced to such sore anxiety
should have offered prayers and vows accompanied with God's name; especially
since He had recently manifested Himself to them in so many miracles, and they
always had in sight the cloud, or the pillar of fire. But their insane cries
against Moses were plain proof that, as in amazement, they had thoughtlessly
hastened to call upon the name of God. For the exposition 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f154</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is unreasonable which some give, that certain of them piously prayed to God,
whilst others of the multitude wickedly mutinied against Moses; because these
two statements are made in conjunction, and cannot be referred to different
persons.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f155</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is the more proper sense; for the double negative is put for a single one. It is
a bitter and biting taunt; for, not contented with preferring the graves of
Egypt to the death which they feared, they scoffingly inquire how he could have
thought of bringing them into the wilderness, as if the land of Egypt was not
large enough to bury them in. But God had openly and clearly proved Himself to
be the leader of their departing; and, again, it was basely insensible of them
to forget that they were not long since like dead men, and had been miraculously
brought out of the grave. Their madness is wilder still, when they daringly call
to remembrance the impious blasphemies which should have been a matter of shame
and detestation to themselves. For how sad was their ingratitude in rejecting
the proffered favor of deliverance, and in shutting the door against the
advances of God, in order that they might rot in their misery! True, that God
had pardoned this great depravity; but it was their part unceasingly to mourn,
and to be as it were overwhelmed with shame, that their crime might be blotted
out before God's judgment-seat. But now, as if God and Moses were accountable to
them, they boastfully and petulantly reproach them for not believing them, when
they would have prudently prevented the evil. Hence are we taught how far men's
passions will carry them, when fear has extinguished their hopes, and they wait
not patiently for God's aid.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses said unto the
people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although with his characteristic
kindness Moses courteously exhorts them to be of good hope, yet it is not
probable that he passed over in silence those wicked cries with which he saw
that God was atrociously assailed. I conceive, then, that he discharged the duty
of a faithful teacher by freely chastising their insolence, which was
intolerable; and since he spoke under the inspiration of the preventing Spirit
of God, there is no doubt but that God himself severely reproved their
blasphemies, lest, by indulgence, they should grow worse. But Moses omits the
reproof, and only shows that God's loving-kindness went beyond the execrable
impiety of the people, giving them consolation to assuage their grief and to
calm their troubled hearts. Moreover, by bidding them not to fear, and "to stand
still and see the salvation of the Lord," he implies that, as long as fear has
possession of our minds, they are blinded, and confounded in their stupidity so
as not to receive the help of God. By the expression, "stand still," he means
"keep quiet;" as much as to say, that there was no occasion for any one to move
a finger, because God alone would preserve them, though they were quiet and
unmoved; and this he confirms in the next verse, where God promises to conquer
for them whilst they hold their peace. But, in my opinion, it is not that he
exhorts them to be quiet; but intimates that in God alone there would be
strength enough to prevail, although they might be torpid like men entranced.:
Now the Israelites, when, though preserved by God's hand, they reject as much as
possible His proffered grace, are an example to us how many repeated salvations
are necessary for us, in order that God may bring us to perfect salvation;
because, by our ingratitude, we nullify whatever He has given us, and thus
should willfully perish, if God did not correct our apathy by the power of His
Spirit.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>

</i>I have used the praeter-pluperfect tense for the sake of avoiding ambiguity;
for the reason is here given why Moses so confidently reproved the hesitation of
the people, and promised that they should be safe under the present help of God;
viz., because he had already been assured by divine revelation that God was
willing to aid His people, and had in readiness a new means for their
preservation. For he could not have been the proclaimer and witness of their
safety if he had not received the promise. Therefore he relieves his confidence
from the imputation of rashness, since he advanced nothing which he had not
already heard from the mouth of God himself. These words, "Wherefore criest thou
unto me?" some interpreters extend to the whole people, whose representative
Moses was; but this sense is too far-fetched, and I have recently observed, that
the prayers of the people were by no means directed to God. I doubt not.,
therefore, that the holy man had prayed apart in the insurrection of the people.
Nor is this pious duty disapproved of in the passage; but rather shows that he
had not spent his labor in vain, nor poured forth his words into the air. The
sense, then, is, "Weary not yourself by crying any more; the event will prove
that you are heard. Lift up your rod, then, whereby you may divide the sea, so
that the children of Israel may go dry shod through the midst of it." This
passage shows that they are guilty of rashness who promise anything either to
themselves or others, as to particular blessings, without the special testimony
of God.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will harden.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">God once more affirms, for the greater
exaltation of His own power, that He will harden the Egyptians, so that, as if
devoted to destruction, they may cast themselves into the midst of the sea;
which they certainly would never have done, unless He had guided their hearts by
his secret influence; because it could not have escaped them that a passage for
the Israelites was opened by His special gift, from whence they might gather
that the elements were at war with them. Therefore they would never have dared
to enter the sea, which they saw to be armed against them, unless they had been
blinded by God. Whence it appears how unworthy is the imagination of those who
pretend that there was but a bare permission here, where God would make His
power conspicuous. It would have been enough that after the Israelites had
passed over to the opposite shore the sea should have returned to its place and
prevented the Egyptians from following; but God was willing, by a double
miracle, to consult for the security of His people for a long' time to come. And
this, indeed, came to pass; for the flower of the whole nation being destroyed,
the Egyptians were unable to recruit their army; especially when the heir to the
throne had already been slain, and the king himself was now taken away. On this
account it is said, that the Egyptians should know that the God of Israel was
the Lord; because in this last act they found that the power of rebellion was
altogether taken from them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

prevent a battle is here described; for the angel:, who used to go before the
Israelites to show the way: turned to the other side, that he might be
interposed between the two camps; and this, in two respects, because the pillar
of fire shone upon the Israelites to dissipate the darkness of the night, whilst
thick darkness held the Egyptians as it were in captivity, so that they were
unable to proceed further. Thus did God both prevent them from advancing, and
also held out a torch for His people all night to light them on their way. He,
who has been called "Jehovah" hitherto, is now designated by Moses "the Angel;"
not only because the angels who represent God often borrow His name, but because
this Leader of the people was God's only-begotten Son, who afterwards was
manifested in the flesh, as I have shown upon the authority of Paul.

Corinthians 10:4.) It may be remarked, also, that he is said to have moved here
and there, as He showed some token of His power and assistance. Most clearly,
too, does it appear, that the glory of God, whilst it enlightens the faithful,
overshadows the unbelievers, on the other hand, with darkness. No wonder, then,
if now-a-days the brightness of the Gospel should blind the reprobate. But we
should ask of God to make us able to behold His
glory.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses stretched
out.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We have already said that the
passage was free and convenient for the Israelites by night, since the pillar of
fire replenished their side with light: and certainly so great a multitude could
not reach the opposite shore in an hour or two. The Israelites then passed over
from evening even till dawn; and then the Egyptians having discovered that they
were gone, hastened to follow that they might fall upon their rear. Now, though
Moses uses no ornaments of language in celebrating this miracle, yet the bare
recital ought to be sufficient; and, therefore, is more emphatic to awaken our
admiration than any rhetorical coloring and magnificent eloquence. For who would
desire sounding exclamations, in order to be ravished to the highest admiration
of the divine power, when he is told simply and in a few words that the sea was
divided by the rod of Moses; that space enough for the passage of the people was
dry; that the mighty mass of waters stood like solid rocks on either side?
Designedly, then, has he set the whole matter before our eyes bare of all verbal
splendor; although it will both be celebrated soon after, in accordance with its
dignity, in the Canticle, and is everywhere more splendidly magnified by the
Prophets and in the Psalms. In this passage let us learn, just as if Moses were
leading us to the actual circumstance, to fix our eyes on the prospect of God's
inestimable power, which cannot be sufficiently expressed by any number or force
of words. But Moses is very careful not to arrogate more than enough for
himself, so as to detract from the praise of God. He had been before commanded
to divide the sea with his uplifted rod; he now changes the form of expression,
viz., that the waters went back by the command of God. Thus, content with the
character of a minister, he makes God alone, as was fit, the author of the
miracle. But although it was competent for God to dispel the waters without any
motion of the air, yet, that He might show that all nature was obedient to Him,
and governed at His will, He was pleased to raise the strong east wind.
Meanwhile it is to be remembered, that the sea could not be dried by arty wind,
however strong, unless it had been effected by the secret power of the Spirit,
beyond the ordinary operation of nature. On which point see my previous
annotations on chap. 10:13 and
19.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b><i>

And first, He opened their eyes, that too late they might see whither their mad
impetuosity had brought them; and also that they might perceive how they were
contending not with man only, but with God; and that thus, being overwhelmed
with sudden astonishment, they might not be able to escape to the shore in time;
for they were on this account overtaken in the midst of the sea, because terror
had thrown them into utter confusion, when they perceived that God was against
them. They saw that there was no greater hope of safety than to retreat, because
God fought for Israel; but being in complete disorder, they could make no way,
and whilst they rather proved hindrances to each other, the sea ingulfed them
all.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

in destroying the Egyptians, had no less obeyed God's command than when it
lately afforded a passage for His people, for it. was by the uplifting of the
rod of Moses that the waters came again into their place, as they had been
before gathered into heaps. The Egyptians now repented of their precipitate
madness, and determined, as conquered by God's power, to leave the children of
Israel, and to return home; but God, who willed their destruction, shut up the
way of escape at this very crisis. But, that we may know how evident a miracle
was here, Moses now adds the circumstance of time, for he says that the morning
then appeared, so that the broad daylight might show the whole transaction to
the eyes of the spectators. The waters, indeed, were heaped up in the night; but
the pillar of fire, which shone on the Egyptians, and pointed out their way, did
not allow God's blessing to be hidden from them. The case of the Egyptians was
otherwise: therefore it behooved that they should perish by day, and that the
sun itself should render their destruction visible. This also tends to prove
God's power, because, whilst they were endeavoring to fly, He openly urged them
on, as if they were intentionally drowning
themselves.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the waters
returned.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In these two verses also Moses
continues the same relation. It plainly appears from Josephus and Eusebius what
silly tales Manetho 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f158</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and others have invented about the Exodus of the people; for although Satan has
attempted by their falsehoods to overshadow the truth of sacred history, so
foolish and trifling are their accounts that they need not refutation. The time
itself, which they indicate, sufficiently convicts them of ignorance. But God
has admirably provided for our sakes, in choosing Moses His servant, who was the
minister of their deliverance, to be also the witness and historian of it; and
this, too, amongst those who had seen all with their own eyes, and who, in their
peculiar frowardness, would never have suffered one, who was so severe a
reprover of them, to make any false statements of fact. Since, then, his
authority is sure and unquestionable, let us only observe what his method was,
viz., briefly to relate in this place how there was not one left of Pharaoh's
mighty army; that the Israelites all to a man passed over in safety and
dry-shod; that, by the rod of Moses, the nature of the waters was changed, so
that they stood like solid walls; that by the same rod they were afterwards made
liquid, so as suddenly to overwhelm the Egyptians. This enumeration plainly
shows an extraordinary work of God to have been here, for as to the trifling of
certain profane writers 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f159</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
about the ebb and flow of the Arabian Gulf, it falls to nothing of itself. From
these things, therefore, he at last justly infers, that the Israelites had seen
the powerful hand of God then and there
exerted.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Israel
saw.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>After he has said that the

this spectacle God's hand, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f160</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
i.e., His power, appeared, because there was no difficulty in distinguishing
between God's wrath and His fatherly love, in preserving so miraculously an
unwarlike multitude, and in destroying in the depths of the sea an army
formidable on every account. Moses, therefore, does not unreasonably conclude
here that the Divine power was conspicuous in the deliverance of the people. He
afterwards adds, that, not without their profit, did the Israelites see God's
hand; because they feared Him, and believed Him, and His servant Moses. "Fear"
is here used for that reverence which kept the people in the way of duty, for
they were not only affected by dread, but also attracted to devote themselves to
God, whose goodness they had so sweetly and delightfully experienced. But
although this pious feeling was not durable, at any rate with the greater number
of them, it is still probable that it rooted itself in some few of them, because
some seed ever remained, nor was the recollection of this blessing entirely
destroyed. By the word "believed," I think that the principal part of fear is
marked, and I understand it to be added expositively, as if it were said, "that
they reverenced God, and testified this by faithfully embracing His doctrine and
obediently submitting themselves to Moses." I understand it that they were all
generally thus affected, because the recognition of God's hand bowed them to
obedience, that they should be more tractable and docile, and more inclined to
follow God. But this ardor soon passed away from the greater number of them, as
(hypocrites 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f161</font></sup><font face="Palatino">)
are wont to be only influenced by what is visible and present; although I hold
to what I have just said, that, in some small number, the fear of God, which
they had once conceived from a sense of His grace, still abode in rigor.
Meanwhile, let us learn from this passage that God is never truly and duly
worshipped without faith, because incredulity betrays gross contempt of Him; and
although hypocrites boast of their heaping all kinds of honor upon God, still
they inflict the greatest insult upon Him, by refusing to believe His
revelations. But Moses, who had been chosen God's minister for governing the
people, is not unreasonably here united with Him, for although God's majesty
manifested itself by conspicuous signs, still Moses was the mediator, out of
whose mouth God willed that His words should be heard, so that the holy man
could not be despised without God's own authority being rejected. A profitable
doctrine is gathered from hence, that whenever God propounds His word to us by
men, those who faithfully deliver His commands must be as much attended to as if
He himself openly descended from heaven. This recommendation of the ministry
ought to be more than sufficient to refute their folly, who set at naught the
outward preaching of the word. Let us, then, hold fast this principle, that only
those obey God who receive the prophets sent from Him, because it is not lawful
to put asunder what He has joined together. Christ has more clearly expressed
this in the words, &#8212;</font><br></div>

God's servant, from whence I wish he was not so far removed. For here the

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then sang
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Moses introduced this song not only in
testimony of his gratitude, but also in confirmation of the history; for the
song which he dictated to the Israelites was not concerning an unknown event,
but he brought them forward as eye-witnesses, that all ages might know that
nothing thus far had been written which had not openly been declared by 600,000
men, besides their wives and children. Moses, therefore, set the example in
accordance with his office, whilst the people, by singing with him, testified
their approbation in a manner which admits of no contradiction. For' to whom
could they have lied, since they were each other's witnesses, and the song was
listened to by no strangers? Moses seems to mark their confidence by the
repetition in the Hebrew, they "spoke, saying." On this account, too, their
confession, pronounced by all their mouths, deserves more credit, because the
greater part of them soon after yielded to ingratitude: from whence we gather
that it was only on compulsion that they gave God glory. But, although Moses was
the author of the song, yet he does not say "I will sing" in his own person, but
prescribes to all what each individual ought heartily to
do.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord is my
strength.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this expression they
acknowledge that they have a sufficient defense in God; and afterwards they add,
that His grace furnishes them with just ground for praise. The sum is, that they
were strong in God, and had not conquered their enemies by their own bravery;
and that, therefore, it is not lawful to glory save in God alone. But we must
observe that the help of God is conjoined with His praise, because this is the
end of all His benefits, that we should hold our salvation as received from Him,
which is here mentioned in the third place, for to say that God had "become
their salvation," was as much as to say that the people were saved by His grace.
In the second clause there is an antithesis between the true God and all false
ones; for there is much emphasis in the declaration, "he is my God," as by it
Moses excludes all that multitude of gods which then were everywhere worshipped
in the world. To the same effect he adds, "my father's God," thus distinguishing
the faith of Abraham from all the superstitions of the Gentiles. The faithful
then declare that it is safe for them to repose in this One God, and that His
praises are worthy of celebration. Isaiah imitates this figure.

him."</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What follows in the next verse &#8212; "The Lord is a
man of war," is to the same purpose, for although at first sight the phrase may
seem a harsh one, still it is not without beauty: that God is armed in military
attire, to contend with all the forces of His foes. Therefore, says Moses, the
name of the Lord belongs to Him alone, because His hand awaits to destroy
whatever lifts itself up against
Him.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pharaoh's

meant to assert, that the drowning of Pharaoh was manifestly God's work.
Therefore, he now illustrates in more glowing terms the transaction which he had
before simply narrated; as also when he compares the Egyptians to stones and
lead, as if he had said that they were hurled by God's mighty hand into the
deep, so that they had no power to swim out. On this score, he repeats twice the
mention of God's "right hand;" as much as to say that such a miracle could not
be ascribed either to fortune or to the efforts of man. We must take notice of
what he soon after says, that the Egyptians "rose up against" God; because they
had treated His people with injustice and cruelty. Thence we gather, that God's
majesty is violated by the wicked, whenever His Church, whose safety He has
undertaken to preserve by His faithful patronage, is assailed by them. "Thou
sentest forth thy wrath," and "with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were
gathered together," are to be read in conjunction; for their meaning is that
God, without any instrumentality, but by His simple volition, and in
manifestation of His wrath, had brought the enemy to.
destruction.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The enemy
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He relates the boast of Pharaoh
not merely in exultation over him, but to magnify the miracle, whereby God gives
over to destruction this wolf intent upon his prey. But there is more force in
the language when he introduces the Egyptians as speakers, than as if he had
described their plans; for thus does the marvelous catastrophe more strikingly
affect our minds, when the Egyptians, brought as it were on the stage, not only
trumpet forth their victory, but insolently give vent to their arrogance and
cruelty. But, presently, the Lord is introduced on the other side, dissipating
by a single blast their terrible audacity. For whence came this great confidence
to the Egyptians, promising themselves that they should be satisfied with the
spoils, and that they should have nothing more to do in order to put the people
to death than to draw their swords, but from the fact of their being very well
armed against this unwarlike multitude? Hence, then, God's power shone forth
more brightly, when He put them out of the way by "blowing with His
wind."</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is like unto
thee?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses concludes this song of
praise with an ejaculation, because the grandeur of the subject transcends the
power of words. The interrogation expresses more than as if he had simply
asserted that none can be compared with God; because it marks both admiration
and assured confidence in the truth of what he says; for he exclaims, as if
overwhelmed with astonishment, "Who is like unto thee, O Lord?" The notion of
some that by the word "gods" he means the angels, is more suitable to other
passages; for instance,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;198906&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
89:6,) "Who in heaven can be compared unto the Lord; who among the sons 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f162</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of the mighty can be likened unto the Lord?" for it immediately follows, "God is
greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence
of all them that are round about him." (Ver. 7, etc.) The meaning then is, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f163</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that, although there be excellence in the angels, still God is exalted far above
them all; but here it may be more properly referred to idols, for Moses (as has
been said) is professedly contrasting' the one true God, whose religion and
worship existed among the children of Abraham, with the delusions of the
Gentiles. The word "sanctitas," holiness, expresses that glory which separates
God from all His creatures; and therefore, in a manner, it degrades all the
other deities which the world has invented for itself; since the majesty of the
one only God is thus eminent and honorable. He adds, "fearful in praises;"
because He cannot be duly praised, without ravishing us with astonishment. Moses
afterwards explains himself, by saying that God's works are wonderful. In my
opinion, their explanation is a poor one, who think that He is said to be
"fearful in praises," because He is to be praised with fear; and theirs is
farfetched, who say that he is terrible, even when he is
praised.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou in thy mercy hast led
them forth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f164</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>The verb in Hebrew is indeed in the past tense; but, since it is plain from
the context that their hope for what was to come was founded on God's former
mercies, I have preferred making the meaning clearer by translating it in the
future. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f165</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Moses, therefore, exhorts the people to proceed to their promised land boldly
and joyfully; because God will not forsake His work in the midst of it. And on
this account he expressly mentions their redemption; as though he had said, that
the people were not in vain delivered from impending death, but that God, as He
had begun, would be their constant guide. David uses the same argument,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
31:5,)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Into thine hand I commit
my spirit; thou hast redeemed me,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">O
Lord God of truth."</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For, as the beginning of their redemption has
proceeded from God's mere mercy, so he says that for this same reason He will
lead them even to their promised inheritance. But, since the many obstacles
might impress them with alarm, he at the same time sets before them the
"strength" of God; for the whole praise is given to God, who had both been
freely gracious to His people, and, asking assistance from no other source, but
contented with His own power, had supplied what would have been otherwise
incredible.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The people shall
hear.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Again in this place I have not
scrupled to change the tenses; for it is plain that Moses is speaking of things
future; although I do not deny, that by verbs of the past tense he confirms the
certainty of the matter; which is a common figure with the Prophets. This boast
depends on the mention of God's "strength;" for it was impossible for the
Israelites to make their way through so many adverse nations into the land of
Canaan, unless God had, as it were, put forth His hand from heaven and fought
for them. Lest, then, their numerous difficulties should dishearten them, Moses
declares that, although many powerful enemies should endeavor to oppose them,
terror shall possess them all from heaven, so that, in their confusion and
astonishment, they shall have no power of
resistance.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fear and dread shall fall
upon them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some read this in the
optative mood, but with little probability, as it seems to me; for Moses is not
so much expressing wishes or prayers, as animating the Israelites to have a good
hope, and to be firmly convinced that God would not make an end until He had
finished the course of His grace. And this we may fairly apply to ourselves at
this time, viz., that God will continue His calling in the elect, until they are
brought on to the goal. For the heavenly inheritance, (to which we are called,)
answers to "the mountain" of His holiness. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f166</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The same reason, which was just before advanced, is again repeated, viz., that
God would not fail His people until the end, because He had "purchased" them to
Himself. For the translation "which thou hast possessed" is not so suitable;
because although Moses signifies that they are God's peculiar people, yet is
their deliverance undoubtedly alleged as the cause of their full redemption; as
if he had said, that the people whom God had once undertaken to protect would
always be dear to Him.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt bring them
in.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The metaphor of planting denotes a
firm habitation; as also in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;194402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
44:2, "Thou didst drive out the heathen with thine hand, and plantedst" our
fathers, and causedst them to take root. Moreover, by his commendatory allusion
to the temple, Moses excites in the people's hearts a desire for the land, which
was to be God's "Sanctuary;" and by this secret thought attracts them,
indifferent as they were, to seek the enjoyment of this great blessing. He also
prophesies of Mount Sion many ages before the temple was erected there; from
whence we gather that it was not chosen by man's will, but consecrated by the
eternal counsel and predestination of God. For it behooved that the gratuitous
favor of God should manifest itself as to this place, as well as to men's
persons. Thus, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197867&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
78:67, it is said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"He refused the
tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim; but chose the of
Judah," etc.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Elsewhere also,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
132:13, 14,)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"For the Lord hath
chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation: this is my rest for ever;
here will I dwell, for I have desired it."</font><br><font face="Palatino">But
the stability of the temple is also foretold; as in another passage, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f167</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
"Thy hand hath founded Zion."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;198701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
87:1.) And God himself declares by Isaiah that He will not suffer Jerusalem to
be laid waste,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233726&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
37:26,) because of ancient times He had formed it. But although the whole land
of Canaan is elsewhere called God's rest, and the people was never collected
into one city, yet, because God blessed the whole nation and land out c f His
sanctuary, therefore is special mention made of His holy mountain. But this
prophecy was very needful for the support of their minds, because Jerusalem only
came into their power at a late period; and doubtless their posterity would have
been still more slow to take possession of it had not their hearts been
stimulated by this promise. A short sentence follows concerning God's eternal
reign, on which the perpetuity of the Church is founded. Thus David,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A227&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
102:27,) after having said that God would always be the, same, and His years
would have no end, thus concludes, "The children of thy servants shall continue,
and their deed shall be established before thee." (Ver. 28.) Moses, then, would
extend the hope of the people to all ages, because of God's kingdom there is no
end.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the horse of Pharaoh went
in.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This verse does not; seem to be
suited to the song, and therefore I am rather of opinion that Moses returns here
to the history, and assigns the reason why the Israelites so magnificently
celebrated the praises of God. For the sake of avoiding ambiguity, it would
perhaps be better thus to render it, &#8212; "For the horse of Pharaoh had gone
in, and the Lord had brought again the waters of the sea upon them, but; the
children of Israel had gone on dry land."

such as were constantly used by the lyric poets. For God would have not only men
to be the proclaimers of this great miracle, but associated the women with them.
When, therefore, the men had finished their song, the women followed in order.
Although it is not certain whether the first verse was intercalary, (as the
sacred history testifies the following sentence to have been in a solemn hymn:
&#8212; "For his mercy endureth for ever,"
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;131634&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Chronicles 16:34, which is also intercalated in Psalm 136), or whether the women
repeated alternately what the men had sung. It little matters which opinion you
prefer, except that the former is more probable. But although Moses honors his
sister by the title of "prophetess," he does not say that she assumed to herself
the office of public teaching, but only that she was the leader and directress
of the others in praising God. The beating of timbrels may indeed appear absurd
to some, but the custom of the nation excuses it, which David witnesses to have
existed also in his time, where he enumerates, together with the singers, "the
damsels playing with timbrels,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;196825&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
68:25,) evidently in accordance with common and received custom. Yet must it be
observed, at the same time, that musical instruments were among the legal
ceremonies which Christ at His coming abolished; and therefore we, under the
Gospel, must maintain a greater simplicity.

the time, of their passage through the sea, they had been suffering for three

thence the name was given to the place. This was indeed no light temptation, to
suffer thirst for three days in a dry land, and nowhere to meet with relief or
remedy. No wonder, then, that they should have groaned with anxiety; but grief,
when it is full of contumacy, deserves no pardon. In such an emergency, they
should have directed their prayers to God; whereas they not only neglected to
pray, but violently assailed Moses, and demanded of him the drink which they
knew could only be given them by God. But because they had not yet learnt to
trust in Him, they fly not to Him for aid, except by imperiously commanding Him,
in the person of His servant, to obey their wishes; for this interrogation,
"What shall we drink?" is as much as to say, "Arrange with God to supply us with
drink." But they do not directly address God, of whose assistance they feel that
they have need, because unbelief is ever
proud.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b><i>

cried.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Hence we gather that Moses alone
duly prayed when the people tumultuously rose against him, and that they who
were not worthy of the common air itself were abundantly supplied with sweet
water. Herein shone forth the inestimable mercy of God, who deigned to change
the nature of the water for the purpose of supplying such wicked, and
rebellious, and ungrateful men. He might have given them sweet water to drink at
first, but He wished by the bitter to make prominent the bitterness which lurked
in their hearts. He might, too, have corrected by His mere will the evil in the
waters, so that they should have grown sweet spontaneously. It is not certain
why He preferred to apply the tree, except to reprove their foolish impiety by
showing that He has many remedies in His power for every evil. A question also
arises as to the tree, whether it inherently possessed the property which it
there exercised. But although probable arguments may be adduced on both sides, I
rather incline to the opinion that there was indeed a natural power concealed in
the tree, and yet that the taste of the water was miraculously corrected;
because it would have been difficult so speedily to collect a sufficient
quantity of the tree for purifying a river; for 600,000 men, together with their
wives and children and cattle, would not have been contented with a little
streamlet. But I am led by no trifling reason to think that this property was
previously existing in the tree; because it is plain that a particular species
was pointed out to Moses, yet does not that prevent us from believing that a
greater efficacy than usual was imparted to it, so that the waters should be
immediately sweetened by its being put into them. What follows in the second
part of the verse admits of a double signification, viz., either that, whereas
God had there ordained a statute, yet that He was tempted by the people; or,
because God was tempted by the people, therefore He had ordained the statute. If
the first sense be preferred, their crime will be augmented by the comparison;
for the impiety of the people was all the worse because, being taught by the
voice of God, <i>yet </i>in the very same place they gave the reins to their
rebellious spirit. But I rather embrace the latter sense, viz., that God
chastised the sin of the people by whom He had been tempted. It was in fact a
kind of tempting of God, because they not only doubtingly inquired who should
give them water, but in these words manifested their despair. But because in the
same context it is said, "there he made for them a statute, and there he tempted
(or proved) them," the name of God appears to be the subject in both clauses,
and it is predicated of the people that they received the ordinance and were
proved. Thus the meaning will be, that after God had tried His people, by the
want of water, He at the same time admonished them by His word, that hereafter
they should submit themselves more teachably and obediently to His
commands.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If thou wilt diligently
hearken.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses now unfolds what was the
statute or ordinance which God promulgated. For here the reference is not to the
whole law which was afterwards given on mount Sinai, but to the special
admonition which served to chastise the wickedness of the people. The sum of it
is, that if the Israelites were tractable and, obedient to God, He on the other
hand would be kind and. bountiful to them. And it is an implied rebuke, that
they might know whatever troubles they experienced to be, brought upon them by
their sins. He proposes the Egyptians to them as an example, whose rebellion
they had seen punished by God with such severe and heavy calamities. "I am the
Lord that healeth thee," is immediately added in confirmation, as if he had
said, that the Israelites were liable to the same plagues which had been
inflicted on the Egyptians, and were only exempt from them because God performed
the office of a healer. And truly whatsoever diseases afflict the human race, we
may see in them, as in so many mirrors, our own, miseries, that, we may perceive
that there is no health in us, except in so far as God spares us. We are also
taught in this verse that this is the rule of a good life, when we obey God's
voice and study to please Him. But because the will of God was soon after to be
proclaimed in the law, He expressly commands them to "give ear to His
commandments, and to keep His statutes."

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they took their
journey.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses relates, that, when after
a month the people came to the wilderness of Sin near Mount Sinai, and when
their provision failed, they rebelled against God and Moses, and manna, a new
and unusual kind of food, was given them from heaven. It is uncertain with what
foods they were sustained in the meantime. Some conjecture that they brought
sufficient flour from Egypt for their supply; but to me it seems probable that
other kinds of food were used in addition; for the barrenness of the country
through which they passed was not so great but that it produced at least fruits
and herbs. Besides, we may readily suppose, from the battle, in which it will
soon be related that they conquered the Amalekites, that they were not far from
an habitable territory. But, when they were carried away farther into the
desert, all their provision began to fail, because they had no more commerce
with the inhabitants. Hence their sedition was increased, because hunger pressed
upon them more than usual. For, although we shall afterwards be able to gather
from the context that there was some previous disturbance in the camp, still
famine, which now began to affect them more, because in these uncultivated and
miserable regions the barrenness on all sides alarmed them, gave strength to
their murmurs and impatience.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the whole
congregation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses says not that some
of the people only murmured, but that they were all gathered into mobs as in a
conspiracy, or, at any rate, as they were arranged by hundreds and thousands,
that they murmured with one consent. Yet the universal term admits of exception;
nor need we suppose that all to a man were comprehended in this impious
rebellion. The best remedy for their hunger would have been to pray to God, whom
they had found to be in all respects a bountiful Father, and whom they had heard
to have wonderfully provided for their parents, when the Egyptians and
inhabitants of Canaan were wasting with hunger in such rich and fertile places.
If they had only been persuaded that the earth is made fertile by God's
blessing, it would at the same time have occurred to them, that it is His
peculiar office to feed the hungry, and immediately they would have directed
their prayers to Him; now, their unbelief betrays itself in their turbulent
clamor. It is indeed astonishing that wretched men, whom their necessity should
have humiliated, rose insolently against God, and that their hunger, so far from
bending their hearts to gentleness, was the very incentive of their arrogance.
But this is too common with the wicked, (because they do not trust that God is
reconciled to them,) to neglect prayer, and to cry out in confusion, to utter
their curses, and to rush, like mad dogs, furiously here and there. This was the
case of the Israelites in the wilderness of Sin. The want of all things, which
presents itself to them, is an invitation to them from God, that they may feel
His power, by which He created the world out of nothing, to be independent of
all foreign assistance for the maintenance of mankind. But despair seizes upon
their faithless minds, so that they reject His aid and beneficence. And not only
so, but their malignity and ingratitude instigates them to quarrel with Moses;
and this is the sum of their complaint, that they were dragged away from
abundance of bread and meat, that they might perish in the desert of hunger.
Therefore they call Moses and Aaron, by whose hand and means they had been
delivered, their murderers.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then said the Lord unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is probable that Moses passes
over much in silence, because it is not consistent that the insolence of the
people was left without even a single word of chastisement. For, although God in
His extraordinary kindness gave food to these depraved and wicked men, who were
unworthy of the sunlight and the common air, still He was without doubt
unwilling to foster their sin by His silence, and, whilst He pardoned their
ingratitude, sharply reproved their forwardness. But Moses, passing over this,
proceeds to a history especially worthy of narration, how God fed this wretched
people with bread from heaven, when He made the manna to fall from the clouds
like dew. I call it "the bread of heaven," with the Prophet,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197824&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
78:24,) who honors it with this magnificent title, and extols God's bounty
towards His people, as if they had been admitted to the tables of angels. For
St. Paul calls the manna "spiritual meat,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461003&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:3,) in another sense, viz., because it was a type of the flesh of
Christ, which feeds our minds unto the hope of eternal life. The Prophet,
however, makes no allusion to that mystery, but alleges in this circumstance an
accusation against the people, because they not only despised the food which
springs from the earth, but also were disgusted with that bread, for which they
saw the heavens in a manner opened. But on this point somewhat must be hereafter
repeated. God now declares that He will give them daily their allowance, as it
were, that in this way He may prove the obedience of His people. Though on this
latter head interpreters are not agreed; for some understand it as if God, by
kindly providing food for the Israelites, would bind them to obedience by His
bounty; as though He should say, "I will try whether they are altogether
intractable or submissive; for nothing shall be wanting to retain them in the
way of duty." But others confine the meaning of the word to "their daily food;"
for that this was the proof of their fear and reverence, that they should not
desire more than was given them, but that they should he contented with their
daily provision, and thus depend on the providence of God. The former sense
pleases me best, and I have endeavored to explain it more clearly than it can be
understood from others. There is no occasion to enter into controversy about the
word "Law," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f171</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for (as we shall soon see) it is used to express the measure or rule of a pious
and just life. Therefore, He says, that He will know whether they are disposed
to honor Him, and to submit themselves to His command. But if any one prefer to
embrace the other sense, I leave him to enjoy his own
opinion.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall come to
pass.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Because mention is immediately
made of the Sabbath, some would confine to its observance what is said
respecting the law, and extract this sense from it, that God made the experiment
whether the people would faithfully observe the rest enjoined to them on each
seventh day. But there is a poorness in this explanation. The fact is, that
after God had promised daily supplies to His people, He now adds the exception,
viz., that on the sixth day they should collect a double quantity, and lay aside
half of it for the use of the Sabbath. Thus the seventh day was really hallowed
before the promulgation of the Law, although it is questionable whether it had
already been observed by the patriarchs. It appears probable that it was; but I
am unwilling to make it a matter of
contention.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses and Aaron
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The statement that the people
should know that their coming out of the land of Egypt was the Lord's work, is
opposed to their wicked taunt, in which they had complained of being betrayed by
Moses and Aaron, when they had been brought into the wilderness. They therefore
answer, that God would openly show that He was the author of their deliverance,
that they should make no more complaints against His ministers. But although a
sharp reproof is implied, still it is joined with a promise of God's continued
favor. They therefore admonish them, that by this event it would be proved that
God was the Leader and Deliverer of the Israelites, because he does not leave
the work of His hands unfinished.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
138:8.) The continuance, then, of His favor, shows that the same God, who
proceeds in the prosecution of His powerful work, had from the first begun what
He carries on even to the end. The knowledge, which they were to receive in the
evening, refers to the quails, in which God gave an instance of His power; but,
because it shone forth more brightly next day in the manna, Moses says, that in
the morning they should see the glory of the Lord. But, lest they should be
induced by this favor to think highly of themselves, and should flatter
themselves in their iniquity, he reminds them that this was not given them in
return for their sins, but that God contended after this manner with their
obstinate perversity; as much as to say that God would appear to them, so that,
beholding by the brightness of His countenance their own impiety, they might
altogether be filled with shame, and feel the profaneness of the rebellion with
which they had dared to insult Him. And, lest they should prevaricate, and say
that they had only made an attack upon Moses and Aaron, he gives the reason why
he declares them to have waged war against God Himself, viz., because neither he
nor his brother had acted of themselves, nor had personally assumed anything in
the matter; for this is the meaning of the words, "what are we, that ye murmur
against us?" as if he disclaimed any separation from God. Now, since by this
testimony he proves himself to have been a faithful servant; of God, we gather
that none may rightly claim honor for themselves in the Church, so as to be
accounted lawful pastors, but those who are divinely called, and thus have God.
as the authorizer of their office, and who advance nothing of themselves, but
only execute what is commanded them. Whilst such as these 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f172</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
may not be despised without dishonoring God, whose person they represent, so do
they, who exercise dominion with no authority but their own, vainly alarm the
simple in God's name, and 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f173</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
instead of the truth, are only wearing' an empty mask. The eighth verso merely
contains an exposition of the same sentiment, except that he goes on to say in
connection, that the Israelites, when in the evening they shall have been filled
with flesh, and when bread shall have been given them in the morning, would
perceive that God is their Deliverer. Then comes the <i>antithesis</i>, "Your

Nevertheless, he alludes also to the cloud, which was the visible symbol of
God's presence; and thus reproves their folly in not hesitating to provoke a
God, who was so near, and almost; before their very eyes. First, then, we must
remark, that they were in a manner drawn from their hiding-places, that their
pride might be broken; and, secondly, that their stupidity was rebuked, for not
reverencing God though present. And this is made more clear by the context,
where it is said, that the glory of the Lord appeared "toward the wilderness,"
by which word I imagine the less habitable region to be indicated. For, although
the country on all sides was barren, and uninhabited, yet on one side the
Amalekites were near, and other tribes, as we shall soon see. The glory of God I
suppose to mean, not that which they saw daily, but which was now manifested to
them in an unusual manner to inspire alarm; because they were hardened against
its ordinary manifestations.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>

done nothing without God's command, but had faithfully and modestly discharged
the office of a minister. And, surely, unless he had spoken according to God's

this is put last in order, though it happened first; and, consequently, I have
used 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f175</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the causal particle instead of the copula. The sum is, as before, that God will
vindicate His own glory, which the people had impiously impugned, and that He
would do good to them, unworthy as they were, in order to glorify His name; as
if He had said, After you shall have been convicted of ingratitude, you will
then be obliged to confess that I am really the only God, and at the same time
your Father.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to
pass.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We shall afterwards see, that,
when from weariness of the manna they began to desire meat, quails were again
given them; but, while they were yet in their mouths, a terrible punishment was
inflicted upon their gluttony. When here they had only complained of their want
of food, God for once satiated them with flesh, that He might show them that He
has in His hand all kinds and quantity of meats. Yet, it was His will that they
should be content with one single sort; for, although they had complained that
they were deprived of flesh, at the pots of which they had formerly sat, yet it
was not reasonable that He should comply altogether with their unholy desires.
Besides, it was profitable for them that certain bounds should be set, that they
might learn dependence on His
will.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when the dew that lay was
gone up.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The shape of the manna is here
briefly described, viz., that it was like the dew condensed into small round
grains. Its taste will be also mentioned elsewhere; but here it was sufficient
to show, that this fecundity was not natural, but miraculously given to the
clouds, so that they should daily rain manna. For as to the idle talk of certain
profane persons, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f176</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that the manna falls naturally in certain countries, who would thus display the
force of their genius, as if they convicted Moses of falsehood, because he
mightily extols a mere trifle, &#8212; it! is all an absurdity which may be
easily refuted. It is indeed true, that in certain parts of the world they
collect white grains, to which the name of manna has been vulgarly given, but 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f177</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which one of the Rabbins will have to be Arabic; but it is neither a food, nor
does it drop daily from the clouds, nor has it anything in common with this
food, which the Prophet properly dignifies with the title of "angels' food,"
because God, who opens the bowels of the earth for the ordinary food of man, at
that time made provision for the nourishment of His people from heaven. And that
it may appear beyond a doubt that this food was then created miraculously, and
contrary to the order of nature, these points are to be taken into
consideration. First, It did not appear in the wilderness before the hour
assigned by Moses in obedience to God's command. Secondly, No change of weather
prevented the manna from dropping in a regular measure; neither frost, nor rain,
nor heat, nor winter, nor summer, interrupted the course of its distillation.
Thirdly, A quantity sufficient for the immense multitude was found every day,
when they took up an omer for every individual. Again, on the sixth day, the
quantity was doubled, that they might lay by a second omer for their Sabbath
food. Fifthly, If they preserved any beyond their due allowance, it was subject
to putrefaction, whereas, on the Sabbath day, the second portion remained good.
Sixthly, Wherever they were, this blessing of God always accompanied them,
whilst the neighboring nations lived on corn, and the manna was only known in
their camp. Seventhly, As soon as they entered a fruitful and corn-growing
country, the manna ceased. Eighthly, That portion, which Moses was commanded to

which name means "something prepared;" but if any prefer their opinion who
expound it, "a part or portion," I do not debate the matter, although the former
is more correct. Yet, whichever you choose, by this word they confessed that
they were dealt with bountifully, because God presented them with food without
their having to labor for it; and, therefore, they indirectly condemn their own
perverse and wicked murmuring, since it is much better to gather food prepared
for them, than to acquire it by the laborious and troublesome culture of the
earth. For although this confession was extorted from them by the incredible
novelty of the thing, yet at that particular moment their intention was to
proclaim God's loving-kindness. But, since unbelief had clouded their senses, so
that they saw not clearly, Moses says that "they wist not what it was." In these
words he rebukes their slowness of heart, because, although previously
advertised of the miracle, they were astonished at the sight, as if they had
heard nothing of it before. We perceive, then, that they did but half
acknowledge God's mercy; for their gratitude was clouded with the darkness of
ignorance, and they were compelled to confess that they did not altogether
understand it; and therefore their stupidity is reproved not without bitterness,
when Moses tells them that this was the food promised them by God. For, if they
had recognized in it the fulfillment of the promise, there was no need of
recalling it to their recollection. As to the words themselves, the answer of
Moses has misled the Greek and Latin translators, into rendering them
interrogatively, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f179</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
"What is this?" But their difficulty is easily removed; for Moses does not
directly state that they inquired about it as of some unknown thing, but
expresses their knowledge mixed with ignorance, for the matter was partly
doubtful, partly clear; for the power of God was visibly manifest, but the veil
of unbelief prevented them from apprehending God's promised
bounty.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b><i>

thing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The exception 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f180</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
follows, that in gathering the food, they should take account of the Sabbath. A
certain daily measure is prescribed; but they are commanded on the day before
the Sabbath to lay up twice as much, that they may observe its rest. But,
unquestionably, God so far extended His liberality as abundantly to satisfy
them. It is well known that an omer is the tenth part of an ephah; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f181</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and perhaps we might discover its proportion to the measures which are now in
use amongst us; but I am unwilling to dispute respecting' an unnecessary point;
since it is enough to be sure, that not less was given than was amply sufficient
for them.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the children of Israel did

the people is here greatly praised; since soon afterwards Moses adds that some,
not contented with their due allowance, collected more than was permitted them,
and that others also transgressed what was enjoined them as to the Sabbath day.
But I thus paraphrase the passage, that, when they had applied themselves to the
gathering of it, the whole amount was found sufficient to fill an omer for every
individual. For they did not each of them collect a private store; but, when all
had assisted, at length. they took their prescribed portion from the common heap
Thus, as each was more especially diligent, the more he bone. flied his slower
and less industrious neighbor, without any loss to himself. This is aptly
applied by Paul to almsgiving,

Corinthians 8:14,) wherein every one bestows of what he possesses on his poor

figuratively; for though there be some likeness between the manna and our daily
food, yet there is a distinction between them to be observed, on which we shall
elsewhere remark. Since, then, the manna was a food differing from what we
commonly use, and was given daily without tillage or labor almost into their
hands, it is not to be wondered that God should have called each one of the
people to partake of it equally, and forbade any one to take more than another.
The case of ordinary food is different; for it is necessary 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f183</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for the preservation of human society that each should possess what is his own;
that some should acquire property by purchase, that to others it should come by
hereditary right, to others by the title of presentation, that each should
increase his means in proportion to his diligence, or bodily strength, or other
qualifications. In fine, political government requires, that each should enjoy
what belongs to him; and hence it would be absurd to prescribe, as to our common
food, the law which is here laid down as to the manna. And Paul, also, wisely
makes the distinction, in enjoining that there should be an equality, not
arising from a promiscuous and confused use of property, but by the rich
spontaneously and liberally relieving the wants of their brethren, and not
grudgingly or of necessity. In this way he reminds us, that whatever goods we
possess, flow from the bounty of God, like the manna; but, since each now
possesses privately and separately whatever is given them, the same law is not
in force for the mutual communication of property, whereby God bound His ancient
people. Thence it appears that the distribution of the manna, as it is related
by Moses, is properly applied to almsgiving. This doctrine, too, extends still
further; for Paul warns believers not to be over-anxious lest they should
exhaust themselves by their bounty, because no man's provision failed, when the
Israelites by God's command divided the manna among
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses said, Let no
man.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses here recounts that, when he
had commanded them all not to take more than enough for their daily food, and to
gather a double portion the day before the Sabbath, some were disobedient on
both points. As to the former, since God would supply their food to them just as
the breast is given to babes, it was a sign of perverse unbelief that they would
not depend on God's providence, but sought for a provision which would last them
many days. It was also a proof of their obstinacy that they would give credit to
no warnings until they were convinced by experience that they laid up in their
houses nothing' but a mass of corruption; for they were not induced to cease
from their insatiable greediness till they had received their just punishment.
Now, although the case of the manna and the food of our ordinary nourishment is
not; altogether similar, yet the comparison holds to a certain extent, for it is
so far lawful to keep our corn and wine laid up in granaries and cellars, as
that all should still ask truly their daily bread of God. And this will be, if
the rich do not greedily swallow up whatsoever they can get together; if they do
not avariciously scrape up here and there; if they do not gorge themselves upon
the hunger of the poor; if they do not, as far as in them lies, withhold the
blessing of God; in a word, if they do not immoderately accumulate large
possessions, but: are liberal out of their present abundance, are not too
anxious as to the future, and are not troubled, if needs be, that their wealth
should suffer diminution; nay, if they are ready to endure poverty, and glory
not in their abundance, but repose upon the paternal bounty of God. And surely
we often see that what misers collect by theft, rapine, fraud, cruelty,
trickery, or meanness, is often turned into corruption. When he adds that, after
they saw that their intemperate ardor profited them nothing, they submitted to
the command, he implies that their obedience was not voluntary, but extorted
from them, for fools are never wise except after adversity. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f184</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The melting of the manna when the sun waxed hot was a stimulus to correct their
idleness or laziness; for, if the manna had remained entire during the whole
day, they would not have been so intent upon their duty. Wherefore, by giving
them only a short time for its collection, God urged them to
diligence.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass on the sixth
day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The violation of the Sabbath is not yet
recounted, but only the stupidity or dense ignorance of their rulers is set
forth, for although they had heard from the mouth of Moses that God would on
that day give what would be sufficient for two days' provision, still they
marvel, and tell it to Moses as if it were something strange and incredible. It
is plain enough that they obeyed the command, and did not spare their labor in
gathering the double quantity; but their unbelief and folly betrays itself in
their astonishment when they see that God has really performed what he promised.
We may conjecture that they accurately observed what awakened in them so much
astonishment; so that it follows that they refused to credit God's word until
its truth was effectively proved. It came to pass, then, in God's admirable
wisdom, that their wicked and perverse doubting availed both for the
confirmation of the miracle and the observation of the Sabbath. Hence occasion
was given to Moses again to enjoin upon them what otherwise, perhaps, they would
have neglected, viz., that they should honor the seventh day by a holy
rest.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to
pass.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is the second transgression,
that by going out on the seventh day they trenched upon its religious
observance; and this monstrous greediness arose from their not believing to be
true what we have just heard Moses saying, for he had plainly declared to them
that they would not find the manna. They, therefore, accuse him of falsehood,
refusing' to believe anything but their own eyes. Meanwhile the obligation of
the Sabbath was set at naught by them, nay, they sought to profane the day which
God had hallowed, so that it should in no wise differ from other days. Therefore
does God justly inveigh against them with much bitterness, for, addressing
Moses, in his person He arraigns the obstinate wickedness of the whole people.
Assuredly Moses was not of the number of those who had refused to obey God's
laws, but by this general charge, the multitude, who had transgressed, were more
severely rebuked, and a greater obligation is laid on Moses to chastise the
people, when a part of the blame is transferred to himself. By the expression
"How long?" God implies the intolerableness of their perversity, because there
is no end of their offenses, but, by thus provoking greater vengeance by new
crimes, they prove themselves to be
incorrigible.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

question on so manifest a point, since the conspicuous nature of the thing had
extorted this name from people otherwise malicious and ungrateful. Its form is
mentioned to prove the certainty of the miracle, viz., that its grains were
round and like coriander-seed, because nothing like it had been seen before. Its

more confirms the fact that this food was then created for the people by God's
special bounty, because He desired an omer of it to be preserved as a memorial,
which, undergoing no putrefaction, handed down to posterity the gloriousness of
the miracle. And first, he propounds generally God's command, and then, in the
next verse, describes the manner in which it was done, viz., that Aaron put it
in a bottle or pot, and laid it up by the Ark of the Covenant. Whence, too, it
appears how high importance God would have attached to this His bounty, since he
wished its memorial to exist in the sanctuary together with the tables of His
covenant. The two expressions, conveying the same meaning, "before the Lord,"
and "before the Testimony," are used in commendation of the worship of the Law,
that the people might know God's power to be near them in the sanctuary, not as
if he were shut up in that place, or wished their minds to be fixed upon the
visible sign, but, desiring to provide against their weakness, He in a manner

of the people about the want of food set at rest when they again rebel on the
subject of drink. They ought, at least, to have learnt from the manna, that as
often as necessity pressed upon them, they should have humbly implored in prayer
and supplication God's help, in certain hope of relief. But such was their
character, that they were hurried by despair into secret murmurings and
impetuous cries. We have almost a precisely similar account in Numbers 20. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f186</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For the error of those who think it one and the same, is easily refuted by the
circumstances of the time and place; and in Numbers 33, it is very clearly shown
how great a distance there was between the one station and the other. Neither
does the tradition of some of the Rabbins appear probable, that this thirst did
not arise from natural appetite, because the manna was not only meat, but also
served for drink. For there is no reason why we should be compelled to imagine
this; and we gather from the text, that the commencement of their murmurings
arose from the fact that the water now began for the first time to fail them.
But it was God's will in two ways, and at two different times, to try the minds
of the Israelites, that they might more plainly show their natural
intractability. If they had required bread and water at the same time, they
would have been more excusable; but after they had experienced that a sweet and
wholesome kind of food was bountifully given them from heaven, because that
country produced no corn, it was an act of intolerable perversity immediately to
murmur against God when they had no supply of drink. Moreover, a double
accusation is here brought against them, for insulting God by quarrelling and
chiding with Him, and also for tempting Him. Both arose from unbelief, the cause
of which was ingratitude; for it was too vile of them so soon to bury in willful
forgetfulness what God had so recently given them. He had brought them supplies
when they were suffering from hunger; why do they not fly to Him when they are
oppressed by thirst? It is plain, then, that the former favor was ill bestowed
upon them, since it so directly vanished in their insensibility. Hence, too,
appears their unbelief, because they neither expect nor ask anything of God; and
with this, too, pride is conjoined, because they dare to proceed to chiding.
Indeed this almost always happens, that those who neither depend on His
providence nor rest; on His promises, provoke God to contend with them, and rush
impetuously against Him; because the brutal violence of our passions hurries us
on to madness, unless we are persuaded that God will in due time be our helper,
and are, submissive to His will. In the beginning of the chapter Moses briefly
indicates that the Israelites journeyed according to the commandment, or, as the
Hebrew expresses it, "the mouth" 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f187</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of God, as if he would praise their obedience. Whence we gather that, at the
first outset, they were sufficiently disposed to their duty, until a temptation
occurred, which interrupted them in the right way. By which example we are
warned that, whenever we undertake anything at God's bidding, we should
carefully beware that nothing should hinder our perseverance; and that none are
fitted to act rightly but those who are well prepared to endure the assaults of
temptation.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore the people did
chide with Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here now displays
itself both their impiety against God, since neglecting and despising Him they
make war against Moses, and also their malice and unkindness, because, forgetful
of so many benefits, they wantonly insult Moses. They know that fountains and
rivers cannot be created by mortal man; wherefore, then, do they quarrel with
him, and not call directly upon God, in whose hand are the waters as well as all
other elements? Certainly, if there had been a spark of faith in them, they
would have had recourse to prayer. Rightly, then, does Moses expostulate, that
in chiding with him, they tempt God Himself. What madness is there in their
accusing Moses of cruelty in bringing them with him out of Egypt, that he might
kill them, and their children, and cattle in the wilderness? But Moses chiefly
reproves them on this ground, because God Himself is affected by this rebellious
chiding. But the actual form of their tempting God is stated at the end, viz.,
because they had doubted "whether the Lord was among them or not?" Hence it
follows, that the root of the whole evil was their unbelief; because they
neither ascribed due honor to God's power nor believed Him to be true to his
promises.: For He had taken charge of them, and had promised that He would never
fail them; why then, now, when circumstances demand it, do they not assure

cried.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This cry seems not to have been
conformed to the true model of prayer, but to have been mixed with confused
complaint, to which Moses was impelled by the deep perturbation of his mind: for
excessive earnestness sometimes carries away the godly, so that they rather fret
in their prayer than duly and moderately express their requests. For there is
something in these words which sounds angry and obstreperous, "What shall I do
unto this people?" as if Moses, struck with indignation, complained that he was
weighed down with a heavy burden, which he would willingly shake off if he could
obtain permission and deliverance from God. Interpreters variously expound what
follows. Some thus render it, that "Unless God immediately came to his help, or
should He dissemble for ever so short a time, Moses must be stoned." Some, "It
is but little that they will rush upon me to stone me." Some, too, read it in
the past tense, but to this the particle

<i>gnod</i>, which relates to the future, is an objection. I am most pleased
with this sense; that if God delay His assistance but for a short time, the
people's rage could not be restrained from stoning
Moses.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He commands him to go out into
the midst, as if He would expose him to the danger of immediate death; but
because Moses is persuaded that it is in His power to calm the passion of men,
however fierce, as well as the waves and storms of the sea, he neither trembles
nor retreats. But, thus did God magnify His power, so as to brand them with
ignominy whilst He withheld the people from their previous attitude. In fact,
Moses passes before them all, but he only takes the elders with him, before whom
to bring the water from the rock, that they may be eye-witnesses of the miracle.
This middle course, whilst it does not permit the glory of God's bounty to be
obscured, still shows the multitude that they are unworthy of being admitted to
behold His power. To remind him that his rod would not be inefficient, He
recalls to his memory what he had already experienced; yet does he not recount
all the miracles; but only adduces what we saw at first, that, by its touch, the
waters of the Nile were turned into blood. The declaration of God, that he will
stand upon the rock, tends to remove all hesitation, lest Moses should be
anxious or doubtful as to the event; for otherwise the smiting of the rock would
be vain and illusory. Moses, therefore, is encouraged to be confident; since
God, whom he follows in the obedience of faith, will put forth His power by his
hand, so that he should undertake nothing vainly or ineffectually. Meanwhile,
although He employs the operation of His servant, still He claims to Himself the
honor of the work.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>

place.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The verb here might be taken
indefinitely, as if it were said, that this name was given to the place; but it
is more probable that Moses, at God's command, so called the place, in order
that the Israelites might be more ready to acknowledge their crime, when thus it
was marked with double infamy. Although it was not only His intention to impress
this feeling upon their minds, but also to hand down the memory of it to
posterity. The same reproof is afterward repeated at Cades, as we shall see;
because the former notice had been buried in oblivion by these foolish people.
The very name of the place

was as much as to say that the earth itself cried out, that the people, in their
perverse nature, were rebellious, and given to unbelief. Now, temptation is the
mother of contentions; for as soon as anything occurs contrary to the wishes of
one who distrusts God, he has recourse to murmuring and dispute. When Moses
relates that the Israelites "tempted the Lord, saying, Is the Lord among us or
not?" he does not mean that they openly spoke rims; but that this was the
tendency of their cries, when on account of the want of water they rose against
Moses, and complained that they were deceived by him, as though God had no power
to help them. But though God branded the people for their malignity and
perversity, with a lasting mark of ignominy, yet did He afford them an
extraordinary proof of His goodness, not only in bestowing on them the drink by
which their bodies might be refreshed, but by honoring their souls also with
spiritual drink, as Paul testifies,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:4,) "that rock was Christ," and therefore he compares the water
which flowed from it to the cup of the holy supper. So do we see how God's
immeasurable bounty surpasses all the wickedness of man, and how, by turning
their vices to salvation, He brings light out of darkness; so far is He from
giving them the reward of their deservings, when He confers upon them what is
profitable. But we must remember the warning which is here interposed, that it
availed many of them nothing to drink of that spiritual drink, because they
profaned by their crimes that excellent
gift.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

Amalek.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> These were the first enemies whom God
arrayed against Israel, after having delivered them from Egypt, and having kept
them for some time in peace and quietness. It was principally for two reasons
that He chose them now to be involved in war, either to punish them for their
recent sin, or as a correction of their idleness, lest it should ensnare them
into iniquity; for, as among soldiers sedition often arises from a cessation of
labor, so also the more God spared this people and indulged them, the more did
their forwardness increase. No wonder then that they were awakened by war, when
they had taken occasion from their state of tranquillity to wax wanton. But some
imagine that the Amalekites were impelled to take arms with this design; first,
to avenge 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f190</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the abdication of their ancestor; and secondly, because they were unwilling that
the posterity of Jacob should enjoy the inheritance of which Esau, the
grandfather of Amalek, the founder of their nation, had been deprived. And,
certainly, it is probable that the recollection of the injury which had been
inflicted on their ancestor still remained, and that they were instigated by the
devil, in order that the promise of God, whereby the right of primogeniture had
been transferred from Esau to Jacob, should be frustrated and fail of its
effect. This might, indeed, have been their reason for the war; but God had
another object, viz., to render the people more obedient to Him, by humbling
their pride. Perhaps it was on that account that He withdrew Moses from the
leadership, and substituted Joshua, as some token of His indignation; for
although the assistance He gave them was sufficiently manifest, and their
victory was obtained by His grace and the prayers of Moses, yet would He have
them reminded, by the absence of Moses, of their recent transgression, that,
being humiliated by their fear, they might submissively ask for pardon, and fly
more earnestly to Him for His aid. He orders chosen men to go forth, partly to
inspirit the whole people, and encourage them to hope for victory, because He
does not deign to employ the whole army to repel their enemies; and partly in
consideration of the cowardice of this unwarlike mob, lest they should faint
with terror if the enemies should make an incursion into the midst of their
camp. For Moses does nothing of himself, but occupies the station appointed him
by God on the top of the hill, to contend with the enemy from afar, but he sends
down the others to fight hand to hand before him, since it had pleased God thus
to order the battle. It is plain that he did not avoid the fight to spare
himself, but because God had given him a different employment; and this appears
from his wielding the rod of God, like their general and standard-bearer, and
promising the successful issue of the battle, of which he had been assured. For
that single rod was of more avail than as if they had gone into the field
preceded by a thousand banners. I have already observed that this is sometimes
called the rod of God, sometimes of Moses, sometimes of Aaron, according to
circumstances; because God used it as an instrument to exercise His power
through His ministers. So God does not detract from His own honor, when He works
effectually by His ministers. It is a prelude to Joshua's future call, which we
shall notice in its place, that. he should be appointed commander of the troops;
for he had not yet reached the dignity of next in command to Moses, unless an
extraordinary commission had been given him by
God.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So Joshua did
as.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although Joshua is by no means
backward, but diligently executes what he knows to be commanded him by God
Himself, and it is probable that the soldiers whom he had taken to accompany him
did their duty properly, yet is it expressly stated that they gained the victory
by no care, or striving, or courage of their own, but by the prayer of Moses, by
whose support their leader as well as the army was sustained. Yet does not Moses
here boastfully commend his own zeal in praying, but is rather the public
witness. and proclaimer of his weakness, that the glory might be entirely
attributed to the gratuitous favor of God. Nor is there any question, that,
conscious of the infirmity which he afterwards confesses, he associated with him
Aaron and Hur, who might assist him in his task. There 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f191</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is more acuteness than solidity in the notion which some have, that these two
men present a figure of the Old and New Testament, on which the prayers of the
saints must rest; and that the stone which they gave to Moses to sit upon was
offered him because our faith is only founded upon Christ. I know how plausible
such allegories are; but what I have just said is enough for me, that because
Moses mistrusted his own weakness, therefore he sought these two assistants. And
surely when they stayed his hands they also lifted up their minds, and prayed
together to God in common supplications; but Moses speaks chiefly of himself, to
show that this charge was entrusted to him by God. For he did not only offer his
prayers as a work of charity, but because God had chosen him as intercessor, to
conquer the enemies from afar by the stretching forth of the rod, and by his
secret earnestness in prayer; and in this respect he was a type of Christ;
although the similitude does not hold in all its parts. Doubtless his failure
arose from his extreme earnestness, and the extraordinary vehemence of his zeal,
and, therefore, praise is mixed up with blame, just as the saints, when they are
stirred to make great efforts in prayer, find that not only does their vigor
grow cold, but they fail from being almost consumed by their own
ardor.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joshua discomfited
Amalek.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The copula is here used instead
of the <i>illative particle</i>; for Moses here concludes that the Israelites
overcame their enemies, because he had continually persevered in prayer. There
is, too, an implied antithesis between the firmness of his hands and the
weakness of the enemy, that we may know that they were discomfited or conquered,
not so much by the sword as by the uplifting of the rod, and by the intercession
of the holy man.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto

of mouth, but which also was deserving of eternal glory with posterity; for
therefore did He command it to be written in a book, that its memory might never
perish. The dispute of commentators respecting this book seems to me to be
superfluous; for God simply wills that the memorial of this circumstance should
exist in all ages; and this was effected by the narration of Moses, for he
handed down in writing even to the end of the world the praise of this favor,
together with the perpetual and immortal doctrine of the Law. Yet God did not
only wish the memorable event of this battle to be written down, but also that
Joshua should be reminded of it, lest he should faint under the many
difficulties which awaited him. For nothing could better support him with
invincible firmness than the recollection of this history, from whence he might
be assured that the people would ever be victorious under the auspices of God.
But although this promise was not immediately fulfilled, yet the Amalekites were
a long time afterwards totally destroyed by Saul; but it was a great
encouragement to Joshua and the people to know that Amalek, who had first made
war upon them, was already condemned by the divine decree, and could not escape
the destruction to which he was
devoted.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>

erect a statue to God, nor to honor the altar by God's name, but he shows that
this was the object he proposed to himself, that the Israelites, being inflated
by their good success, should not boast of their own strength, but glory only in
God. I see not why some should translate it "miracle," for the word

</i>He confirms by repetition the same declaration which he had lately
pronounced from the mouth of God, viz., that God would be ever at war with the
Amalekites, until He should have utterly destroyed them. Translators do not
agree as to the meaning of the expression, "The hand is upon the throne of the
Lord." Some imagine it to be a form of oath, as though God swore by His throne.
Others understand by His throne the Church, which is the rest of God, in which
he is said to sit. But I have no doubt but that what was said as to destroying
and extinguishing the memory of Amalek is confirmed by this reason, viz., that
as God is omnipotent He will contend with this wicked nation. Therefore the hand
is said to be upon the throne of God, because he does not sit idly in heaven,
(as the Epicureans imagine,) but exercises His dominion in the government of the
world, as if he had said, that God, who rules in power, and who by His hand and
authority controls and moderates, sustains and overthrows all things, as long as
He shall reign upon His throne, endued with supreme and formidable might, will
never cease to pursue the Amalekites with His just vengeance. And, indeed, it
may have been the case, that He inflicted divers punishments upon them, though
their last great overthrow was delayed till the days of
Saul.</font><br><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When Jethro, the priest of
Midian.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This chapter consists of two
parts. First of all, the arrival of Jethro in the camp is related, and his
congratulation of Moses on account of the prosperity of his enterprise, together
with the praise and sacrifice rendered to God. Secondly, his proposed form of
government for the people is set forth, in consequence of which judges and
rulers were chosen, lest Moses should sink under his heavy task. The greater
number of commentators think that Zipporah, having been enraged on account of
her son's circumcision, had turned back on their journey, and gone to live with
her father; but to me this does not seem probable. For Moses would never have
allowed his sons to be deprived of the redemption of which he was the minister;
nor would it have been consistent that they should afterwards be appointed
priests, of whom God was not the Redeemer. Besides, if he had deposited his wife
and children in safety, and had advanced alone to the contest, he would have
been deservedly suspected of deceit, or of excessive cowardice. Wherefore I have
no doubt but that he underwent, together with his family, that miserable yoke of
bondage by which they were long oppressed, and by this proof evidenced his
faithfulness, so that greater authority might attend his vocation. The
statement, then, in the second verse, "after he had sent her back," I apply to
Moses, because he had sent back his wife from the wilderness to visit her
father, either having yielded to the desire which was natural to her as a woman,
or, induced by his own feelings of piety, he had wished to show respect in this
way to an old man nearly connected with him. There is something forced and cold
in the words, which some would supply, "after he had sent back gifts." The text
runs very well thus, After Moses had sent back his wife, she was brought again
by his father-in-law, thus returning and repaying his
kindness.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And her two
sons.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was remarked in its proper
place, how distinguished a proof not only of faith, but of magnanimity and
firmness Moses had manifested in giving these names to his sons. For we cannot
doubt, but that he brought on himself the ill-will of his connections, as if he
despised the country of his wife, by calling the one (Gershom) "a strange land;"
and the name of his son continually cried out, that though he inhabited Midian,
yet was he an alien in his heart, and though sojourning for a time, would
afterwards seek another habitation. Whence also we may conjecture that he took
them with him into Egypt, rather than banish from him these two pledges of his
piety on account of the sudden anger and reproaches of his wife; since by their
names he was daily reminded that God's covenant was to be, preferred to all
earthly advantages.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jethro, Moses'

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f195</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
bowed down with age, from his home into the wilderness; for it will hereafter
appear from the context, that he was not induced by ambition; because, after he
had offered sacrifice to God, and, in solemn thanksgiving, had testified that he
ascribed all the glory to God alone, he returned home again with the same
simplicity in which he had come. Moses, too, at the beginning of the chapter,
has stated the cause of his coming, for he does not say that he had heard of the
arrival of his son-in-law, but how wonderful had been God's goodness and power
in delivering Moses and the people. He desired, therefore, to be in some measure
a spectator of the things whereof he had heard, and not to neglect, by remaining
at home, such illustrious instances of God's bounty. I have already explained
why Mount Horeb is distinguished by the name of "the Mount of God." The vision,
indeed, which had been already vouchsafed to Moses there, rendered it worthy of
this honorable title; but here, as before, there is reference made rather to the
promulgation of the Law, whereby God consecrated the mountain to
Himself.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses went
out.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In the foregoing verse he had
related what happened last, viz., that Jethro said, I am come, and have brought
to thee thy wife and children; but this transposition is common in Hebrew. Now,
then, he adds, that Moses went to meet him, and to pay him honor; and that they
met each other with mutual kindness, and respectively performed the duties of
affection. "To ask each other of their peace," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f196</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is tantamount to inquiring whether things were well and prospering. But the main
point is, that Moses told him how gracious God had been to His people; for this
was the drift of the whole of his address, that, when he had left his
father-in-law, he had not yielded to the impulse of lightness, but had obeyed
the call of God, as had afterwards been proved by His extraordinary aids and by
heavenly prodigies.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jethro said,
Blessed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Hence it appears that although
the worship of God was then everywhere profaned by strange additions, yet Jethro
was not so devoted to superstition as not to acknowledge and honor the true God.
Nevertheless, the comparison which he subjoins, that "Jehovah is greater than
all gods," implies that he was not pure and free from all error. For, although
the Prophets often so speak, it is with a different import; for sometimes God is
exalted above the angels, that His sole eminence may appear, every heavenly
dignity being reduced to its due order; sometimes, too, He is improperly called
"Greater," not as if the false gods had any rank, but that the greatness which
is falsely and foolishly attributed to them in the world may be brought to
naught. But Jethro here imagines, in accordance with the common notion, that a
multitude of inferior gods are in subordination to the Most High. Thus, where
the pure truth of God does not shine, religion is never uncorrupt and clear, but
always has some dregs mixed with it. At the same time, Jethro seems to have made
some advance; for in affirming that he now knows the power of God, he implies
that he was more rightly informed than before; unless, perhaps, it might be
preferred to understand this of the experimental knowledge, which confirms even
believers, so that they more willingly submit themselves to God, whom they
already knew before. Meanwhile, there is no doubt that by the name of Jehovah he
designates the God of Israel; for, although they boasted everywhere that they
worshipped the eternal God, yet by asserting the true Deity of the One God, he
puts all others beneath Him. At any rate he confesses that, by the history of
their deliverance, he was assured of the immense power of God, who had
manifested himself in Israel; so as to despise, in comparison with Him, whatever
gods were honored elsewhere in the world. The latter clause 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f197</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of verse (11) is unfinished; for it stands thus, "According to the word (or
reason) wherein they dealt proudly against them;" thus the principal verb is
wanting to express that God repaid the Egyptians the just wages of their
cruelty; just as He denounces "judgment without mercy," upon all who proudly and
unmercifully mistreat their neighbors,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;590213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
2:13,) according to the declaration of our Lord Jesus Christ, "With what measure
ye mete," etc.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
7:2.) The exposition which some give seems too limited, viz., that the
Egyptians, who had drowned the infants in the river, were themselves drowned in
the Red Sea. I prefer, then, to extend it to every instance of punishment which
they received.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
Jethro.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although I do not think that
Jethro had previously sacrificed to idols, yet, because he worshipped an unknown
God, with but a confused and clouded faith, it appears that this was his first
sincere and legitimate sacrifice since the God of Israel had been more clearly
known to him. We may gather from hence that it was duly offered, because Moses,
and Aaron, and the elders openly professed them. selves his companions, and
partook with him; for it is not merely said that they came to eat bread with
him, but "before God;" which expression describes a sacred and solemn feast, a
part and adjunct of the offering and divine worship. But they never would have
willingly polluted themselves with the defilement's of the Gentiles for the sake
of gratifying an unholy man. It follows, then, that this was a token of his
piety, since they did not hesitate to become partakers with him. We ought,
indeed, to have God before our eyes, as often as we partake of his bounty; but
we shall hereafter see, that this expression is peculiarly applied to
sacrifices, wherein the faithful put themselves in the presence of God. Yet. do
I not admit that Jethro slew the victims in right of the priesthood which he
exercised in the land of Midian; but because there was more liberty, as will be
explained in its place, before the Law was prescribed by God. It is my decided
opinion that by the word "bread," the manna is incontestably
meant.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to
pass.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>A memorable circumstance, and one
well worth knowing, is here introduced. In that form of government over which
God presided, and which He honored with extraordinary manifestations of His
glory, there was something deserving of reprehension, which Jethro corrected;
and again, Moses himself, the mighty Prophet, and with whom alone God was thus
familiar, was deservedly reproved for inconsiderately wearing away both himself
and the people by excessive labor. It was a proof of his illustrious virtue and
mental heroism to undergo so many troubles, to endure so much fatigue, and not
to be subdued by weariness from daily exposing himself to new toils. It betrayed
also a magnanimity never sufficiently to be praised, that he should occupy
himself gratuitously for this perverse and wicked people, and never desist from
his purpose, although he experienced an unworthy return for his kind efforts.
For we have seen him to have been often assailed by reproaches and contumelies,
and assaulted by chidings and threats; so that it is more than marvelous that
his patience, so constantly abused, was not altogether worn out. In this,
assuredly, many virtues will be discovered worthy of the highest praise; yet
Jethro in these very praises finds occasion of fault. Whence we are warned that
in all the most excellent acts of men some defect is ever lurking, and that
scarcely any exists so perfect in every respect as to be free from any stain.
Let all those, then, who are called on to be rulers of mankind know, that
however diligently they may exercise their office, something still may be
wanting, if the best plan that they adopt be brought to examination. Therefore
let all, whether kings or magistrates, or pastors of the Church, know, that
whilst they strain every nerve to fulfill their duties, something will always
remain which may admit of correction and improvement. Here, too, it is worth
while to remark, that no single mortal can be sufficient to do everything,
however many and various may be the endowments wherein he excels. For who shall
equal Moses, whom we have still seen to be unequal to the burden, when he
undertook the whole care of governing the people? Let, then, God's servants
learn to measure carefully their powers, lest they should wear out, by
ambitiously embracing too many occupations. For this propensity to engage in too
many things
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">polupragmosu&gt;nh</font><font face="Palatino">)
is a very common malady, and numbers are so carried away by it as not to be
easily restrained. In order, therefore, that every one should confine himself
within his own bounds, let us learn that in the human race God has so arranged
our condition, that individuals are only endued with a certain measure of gifts,
on which the distribution of offices depends. For as one ray of the sun does not
illuminate the world, but all combine their operations as it were in one; so
God, that He may retain men by a sacred and indissoluble bond in mutual society
and good-will, unites one to another by variously dispensing His gifts, and not
raising up any out of measure by his entire perfection. Therefore Augustine 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f198</font></sup><font face="Palatino">truly
says that, God humbled His servant by this act; just as Paul reports, that
buffetings were inflicted on him by the messenger of Satan, lest the grandeur of
his revelations should exalt him too highly.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;471207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 12:7.)</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses said unto his
father-in-law.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses replies
ingenuously, as if on a very praiseworthy matter, like one unconscious of any
fault; for he declared himself to be the minister of God, and the organ of His
Spirit. Nor, indeed, could his faithfulness and integrity be called in question.
He only erred in overwhelming himself with too much labor, and not considering
himself privately, nor all the rest publicly. Yet a useful lesson may be
gathered from his words. He says that disputants come "to inquire of God," and
that he makes them to know the statutes of God and His laws. Hence it follows
that this is the object of political government, that God's tribunal should be
erected on earth, wherein He may exercise the judge's office, to the end that
judges and magistrates should not arrogate to themselves a power uncontrolled by
any laws, nor allow themselves to decide anything arbitrarily or wantonly, nor,
in a word, assume to themselves what belongs to God. Then, and then only, will
magistrates acquit themselves properly:. when they remember that they are the
representatives (<i>vicarios</i>) of God. An obligation is here also imposed
upon all private individuals, that they should not rashly appeal to the
authority or assistance of judges, but should approach them with pure hearts, as
if inquiring of God; for whosoever desires anything else except to learn from
the mouth of the magistrate what is right and just, boldly and sacrilegiously
violates the place which is dedicated to
God.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses' father-in-law
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He does not absolutely condemn the
whole system which Moses had before adopted, after the manner of morose, or
froward, or ambitious men who, by carping at some trifle, obscure the noble
deeds of others; but by seeking only to correct a part of it, he detracts not
from the just praise of Moses, and leaves the power which God had conferred upon
him untouched. Herein his moderation is worth observing, for he does not abuse
this pretext of a particular error, so as to upset the due order of things; but
only advises Moses how he may usefully execute the office which God had
conferred upon him.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will give thee
counsel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Jethro dares, indeed, to
promise success, if Moses will obey his counsel; yet does he not proudly boast
that this will be the fruit of his own prudence, but ascribes it to God's
blessing and grace, if he prospers even when nothing is established but on the
best system. For this is the import of the expression, that a counsel occurs to
him, which if Moses follows, God shall bless him. Nor yet does he reprove Moses,
as if God had not been thus far with his pious zeal and industry, but rather
hints that God is the author of this counsel, which He will follow up with His
grace. In sum, he does not state it to be his Object to diminish in the smallest
degree the grace which Moses had already experienced; but to point out a plan,
of which God will, by its result, show His approbation. Then follows the other
point to which I have alluded, viz., that he does not rob Moses of his
authority, so as to overturn his call from God, but rather by exhorting him to
proceed, desires that what God has once ordained should be firm and inviolable.
It is well also for us diligently to consider that counsel be taken according to
circumstances and expediency, so that there be no departure from the ordinance
of God; because it is sinful to entertain the question whether we should obey
God or not. Accursed, then, are the deliberations wherein it is proposed to
alter anything in God's Word, or to withdraw ourselves from the bounds of our
calling. We have said that the burden whereby Moses was weighed down was not of
God's imposing; but only had he been set over the people as their leader, as far
as his ability permitted. Jethro leaves this unaffected, and thus confirms by
subscribing, as it were, to the decree of heaven. Because he was chosen to be as
an interpreter, and God familiarly admitted him as the mediator between Him and
His people, Jethro enjoins him to continue in the discharge of these duties. But
because the possession of the supreme government did not interfere with the duty
of a Prophet, he desired also the greater matters to be referred to him; for I
so interpret the expressions, that Moses was to be "to God-ward," for the
delivery of the rule of piety, and for the performance of the prophetical
office, whilst the weightier causes were to be referred by the rulers to him,
that every one might have justice done
him.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Moreover, thou
shalt</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f199</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
provide out of all the people</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Literally
so, "thou shalt provide;" meaning, thou shalt choose out, and take the most
worthy, so that such an office be not entrusted rashly to any one that offers.
But this was most reasonable, among a free people, that the judges should not be
chosen for their wealth or rank, but for their superiority in virtue. Yet
although it be right that regard should be chiefly had to virtue, so that if any
one of the lower orders be found more suitable than others, he should be
preferred to the noble or the rich; still should any one choose to, lay this
down as a perpetual and necessary rule, he will be justly accounted contentious.
Jethro enumerates four qualifications which must be principally regarded in the
appointment of judges, viz., ability in business, the fear of God, integrity,
and the contempt, of riches, not to exclude others whereof, as we shall soon
see, mention is made in the first chapter of Deuteronomy, but to signify that
all are not qualified, nay, that extraordinary virtues are required which, by
synecdoche, he embraces in these four. The words which we translate "brave men,"
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f200</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(<i>viros fortes</i>,) are, in the Hebrew, "men of bravery," (<i>viros
fortitudinis</i>;) by which title some think that strong and laborious men are
described. But in my opinion, Moses rather designates strenuous and courageous
persons, whom he opposes not only to the inactive, but to the timid and cowardly
also. But because vigor of mind as well as of body is but frail without the fear
of God, he adds piety in the second place, in that they should exercise their
office as having an account to render to God. "Truth" is opposed not only to
deception and gross falsehoods, but to popularity-hunting, flattering promises,
and other crooked arts, which tend to corrupt justice. Lastly, hatred of
covetousness is demanded; because nothing is more antagonistic to justice than
eagerness for gain; and since snares are so constantly set for judges by the
offers of pecuniary advantage, they would not be duly fortified against this
mode of corruption, unless they earnestly detested
avarice.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If thou shalt do this
thing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>What immediately follows, "and
God command thee so," may be taken in connection with the beginning of the
verse, as if, in self-correction, Jethro made the limitation, that he did not
wish his counsel to be obeyed, unless God should approve of it. Others extend it
more widely, that if Moses followed God's commands in all things, this
moderation of his duties would be useful. However you take it, Jethro declares
that he would have nothing conceded to him, which should derogate from God's
supreme authority; but that there was nothing to prevent Moses from following,
as he had done, God as his leader, and still adopting the proposed plan. Yet he
signifies that this was to be but temporary, when he adds, that the people
should go in peace or prosperously into the land of Canaan. Jethro, then, had no
wish to establish a law for posterity; but points out a remedy for present
inconveniences, and a provisional arrangement, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f201</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
until the people should obtain a peaceful
resting-place.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So Moses
hearkened.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here is a. remarkable
instance of modesty, that Moses is not indisposed to submit himself to the
counsel of his father-in-law. For although Jethro was his superior in age and in
degree of affinity, in other respects he was far inferior to him. This yielding,
then, of Moses to his authority, lays down a rule for all the greatest and most
excellent Doctors, that they should not refuse lo receive the admonitions of
those whom they admit to teach rightly, although they are not of such high
dignity. For Cyprian 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f202</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
truly declares that none is a good doctor who is not also docile. It is probable
that the old man immediately returned home, not in contempt, or from his dislike
to labor or fatigue, but

tyrannically put over our heads; but which allows of election, so that no one
should rule except he be approved of by us. And this is further confirmed in the
next verse, wherein Moses recounts that he awaited the consent of the people,
and that nothing was attempted which did not please them all. Again, he does not
here mention the same virtues as in Exodus 18; but only distinguishes the judges
by three qualifications, viz., that they should be wise, and understanding, and
experienced, all of which are comprised under one head, that they should possess
acuteness of intellect and prudence, confirmed by experience and practice; for
neither the greatest probity nor diligence would be sufficient; for the office
of ruler, apart from skill and sagacity. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f204</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But the first epithet which the Hebrews often apply in a bad sense to the crafty
and deceitful, here means acute and perspicacious. The second I explain as
pointing out prudent persons, endued with sound judgment and discretion. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f205</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The third may be taken either actively or passively; some therefore translate it
known or tried; but here the active sense is most suitable. Thus, then,
experience and acquaintance with business is required in judges; because none
but the practiced are competent for the management of
business.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I charged your
judges.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This charge is not found in
Exodus 18, where the only object of Moses was to point out the origin of the
alteration; but now omitting the praise of his father-in-law, he merely recalls
to the recollection of the Israelites what he did with them. The sum, however,
of the exhortation is, that they should adjudicate impartially between their
brethren; which is more fully expressed in the next verse, where they are
forbidden to "acknowledge faces." 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f206</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For there can be no greater corruption than to judge from personal appearance,
which always draws away men's minds from the merits of the ease. Wherefore
Christ rightly opposes these two things to one another, to "judge righteous
judgment," and "according to the appearance."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430724&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
7:24.) This even philosophers have perceived, when they have advised that, as
far as possible, judges should be restrained by fixed laws, lest;, being left
free, they should be swayed this way or that by favor or ill will. And, in point
of fact, wherever there is a sufficient capacity of intellect, equity and
rectitude will prevail, unless respect to persons influences the judge. It, is
plain from the context, where Moses forbids the making a distinction between
small and great, what is meant by "acknowledging persons." But although judges
often inflict injury upon the poor and wretched out of contempt of them, yet
Moses adverts to the more common fault, when he charges them "to be afraid of no
man;" since it very often happens that those who are otherwise just, and
disposed to study what is equitable and right, are made to swerve through fear
of the threats of the powerful, and dare not; manfully encounter their ill will.
Moses, therefore, requires magnanimity in judges, so that they may not hesitate
to bring upon themselves the hatred of any, in their defense of a good cause.
But we must specially observe the reason whereby he corrects their fear and
alarm; for he says that they are to be afraid of no mortal man, because "the
judgment is God's." He does not here merely remind them, as it; appears to some,
that an account must be rendered to God; but shows how absurd it is to turn from
the right course out of the fear of man, because thus the majesty of God is
prostituted and exposed to scorn; as much as to say that this honor must be paid
to God, whose representatives they are, that they should look upon all men as
beneath them, and restrain the audacity of rite wicked with such inflexible
magnanimity, that God alone may have the preeminence. The same is the object of
Jehoshaphat's words:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Take heed what ye do:

<div><font face="Palatino">If this were thoroughly impressed upon the minds both
of magistrates and pastors, they would not vacillate so often; for relying on
God's aid, they would stand firmly against all the terrors by which they are so
pitifully agitated. Wherefore let all those who are called to any public office,
sustain themselves by this doctrine, that they are doing God's work, who is well
able to keep them safe from the violence as well as the craftiness of the whole
world. Yet, at the same time we are taught by these words that all posts of
command are sacred to God, so that whosoever are called to them should
reverently and diligently serve God, and ever reflect that His is the dominion

In the third month.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This chapter informs
us by what means God rendered the people attentive and teachable when He would
promulgate His laws. He had, indeed, previously delivered the rule of a just and
pious life, but by writing the Law on tables, and by then adding its exposition,
He not only embraced the perfect doctrine of piety and righteousness, but
ratified it by a solemn rite, so that the recognition of it might remain and
flourish in future times. And this is the main and principal thing which the
prophets celebrate in the redemption of the people; and in this, as in a mirror,
propose for consideration the image of the renewed Church, that God made known
His testimonies to His redeemed, and bound the people, whom He had purchased, to
Himself by a new covenant. He had indeed made with Abraham an eternal, and
inviolable covenant; but because it had grown into disregard from the lapse of
time, and the carelessness of mankind, it became needful that it should be again
renewed. To this end, then, it was engraved upon the tables of stone, and
written in a book, that the marvelous grace, which God had conferred on the race
of Abraham, should never sink into oblivion. But in the first place we must
observe that, although the Law is a testimony of God's gratuitous adoption, and
teaches that salvation is based upon His mercy, and invites men to call upon God
with sure confidence, yet it has this peculiar property, that it; covenants
conditionally. Therefore it is worth while to distinguish between the general
doctrine, which was delivered by Moses, and the special command which he
received. Moses everywhere exhorts men, by holding forth the hope of pardon, to
reconcile themselves to God; and, whenever he prescribes expiatory rites, he
doubtless encourages miserable sinners to have a good hope, and bears witness
that God will be merciful to them. Meanwhile this office was separately imposed
upon him, to demand perfect; righteousness of the people, and to promise them a
reward, as if by compact, upon no other condition than that they should fulfill
whatever was enjoined them, but to threaten and to denounce vengeance against
them if ever they wandered from the way. It is certain indeed that the same
covenant, of which Abraham had been the minister and keeper, was repeated to his
descendants by the instrumentality of Moses; and yet Paul declares, that the Law
"was added because of transgressions,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480319&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:19,) and opposes it to the promise given to Abraham; because, as he is
treating of the peculiar office, power, and end of the Law, he separates it from
the promises of grace. With the same import, he elsewhere calls it "the
ministration of death," and "the letter that killeth."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 3:6, 7.) Again, in another place, he states that it "worketh wrath,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:15;) as if by its arraignment it inflicted a deadly wound on the human race,
and left them no hope of salvation. In this preparation, then, wherein God
instructed the people to reverence and fear, a twofold object may be perceived;
for, since men's minds are partly swollen with pride and haughtiness, and partly
stupified by indifference, they must needs be either humbled or awakened, in
order to their reception of divine teaching with the attention it deserves; nor
can any be prepared to obey God, except he be bowed down and subdued by fear.
Moreover, they then begin to be afraid when God's majesty is displayed to
inspire them with terror. Thus, therefore, let the fact that the authority of
the Law was ratified by many signs and wonders, teach us that this is the
beginning of piety and faith in God's children. To this end also did God shake
the earth, to arouse men's hearts from their slumber, or to correct them by
taming their pride. This object is common to the Law, the Prophets, and the
Gospel, and to the whole sum of divine teaching, to which due honor is never
paid, unless God's majesty first shines forth, whereby He casts down all the
haughtiness of the world. But we must not pass over what I lately asserted to be
peculiar to the Law, via, to fill men's minds with fear, and by setting forth
its terrible curse, to cut off the hope of salvation; for, whilst it consists of
three parts, each of them tends to the same end, that all should acknowledge
themselves deserving of the judgment of eternal death, because in it God
sustains no other character than that of a Judge, who, after having rigidly
exacted what is due to Him, promises only a just reward, and threatens the
transgressors with vengeance. But who will be found to be a perfect keeper of
the Law? Nay, it is certain that all, from the least to the greatest, are guilty
of transgression, wherefore God's wrath overhangs them all This is what Paul
means, when he writes that believers</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"have not received the
spirit of bondage again to fear; but the spirit of adoption, whereby they cry,
Abba,
Father,"</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
8:15;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">showing how much better is our condition than that of
the old fathers, because the Law kept them enslaved in its bondage, whilst the
Gospel delivers us from anxiety, and frees us from the stings of conscience; for
all must necessarily tremble, and finally be overwhelmed by despair, who seek
for salvation by works; but peace and rest only exist in the mercy of God. The
author of the Epistle to the Hebrews pursues this idea at greater length, where
he says,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Ye are not come unto the
mount that must be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and
darkness, and tempest, and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words: which
voice they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any
more, etc., (<i>whence </i>Moses said I exceedingly fear and quake:) but ye are
come unto Mount Sion,"
etc.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hebrews
12:18-22.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">The <i>antithesis </i>here proves,
that what was entrusted to Moses is separate and distinct from the Gospel;
because God, who appeared in the Law as an avenger, now with fatherly kindness
gently invites us unto salvation, and soothes our troubled minds by offering us
the forgiveness of our sins. Now, Paul shows us that there is no contradiction
in this diversity, because the people were taught by the Law not to seek for
salvation anywhere but in the grace of Christ, and being convinced of the
horrible condemnation under which they lay, were driven by fear to implore God's
mercy; for, as men are apt to 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f207</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
allow themselves in sin, "sin (as Paul says,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
5:13) is not imputed, where there is no law;" but those, who delight themselves
in darkness, are by the teaching of the Law brought before God's tribunal, that
they may fully perceive their filthiness and be ashamed. Thus is Paul's saying
fulfilled, that the life of the Law is man's death.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450709&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
7:9.) Now we understand why the promulgation of the Law was ratified by so many
miracles; viz., because, in general, the authority of the divine teaching was to
be established among the dull and careless, or the proud and rebellious; and,
secondly, because the Law was propounded to men, who sought the means of
flattering themselves, as the mirror of the curse, so that, in themselves lost,
they might fly to the refuge of pardon. I have thought it advisable to say thus
much by way of preface, for the purpose of directing my readers to the proper
object of the history, which is here related. But Moses first recounts that the
people came, at a single march, from Rephidim into the region of Sinai; for so I
interpret it, that there was no intervening station; for their interpretation is
forced and unnatural, who take "the same day" for the beginning of the
month.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And Moses went up.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is probable that
Moses sought, as he was wont, retirement., in order to take counsel of God; for
he speaks not as of some new or unusual circumstance, but of a custom previously
observed; because he dared not stop anywhere, nor make any further advances,
except as far as was prescribed him by the mouth of God. His going up to God
signifies no more than that he went; out of the camp, that afar from the
multitude, and from all distractions he might in secrecy and quiet inquire of
God, what was His pleasure; for he did not, like the superstitious, choose a
lofty position, that he might be nearer to God; but he withdrew himself from
every disturbance, that he might engage all his senses in the occupation of
learning. Afterwards, however, he adds, that he had obtained more than he had
hoped for, because God, beyond what was customary with Him, addressed him
respecting the renewal of His covenant. And to this the opening words have
reference &#8212; "Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the
children of Israel;" wherein the repetition and diversity of expression is
emphatic, as though He would speak of a very serious matter, and would thus
awaken greater attention.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have
seen.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>With the view of gently inviting
the people to obedience, He first recalls to their recollection the blessing of
their deliverance, and then promises that the blessings of the future would be
not inferior, if they on their part honored their deliverer with the piety and
gratitude which belong to Him. He recounts the two parts of His loving-kindness,
first that He had exerted His tremendous power against the Egyptians, and
secondly, that He had marvelously brought His redeemed people through the sea,
and the mighty wilderness, as through the clouds and the air; for this was an
instance of His inestimable grace, that He had made war against a most powerful
king, had afflicted a most flourishing nation, and had devastated a land
remarkable for its extreme fertility, in order to succor a body of despised
slaves. For there was no dignity in them, who first of all were strangers, and
moreover abject herdsmen, and devoted to base and shameful slavery, whereby God
might be incited for their sakes to destroy the Egyptians, who were illustrious
in glory, in wealth, in the richness of their land, and in the splendor of their
empire. Wherefore it would have been detestable ingratitude not to acknowledge
their great obligations to God. What He adds in the second place, that He bare
them as eagles are wont to carry their young, has reference to the constant
course of His paternal care. Moses will hereafter use the same comparison in his
song, and it often occurs in the prophets. But He mentions the eagle rather than
other birds, in my opinion, that He may magnify their difficulties, and thus
commend His grace; for eagles lift up their young ones upon high places, and
accustom them to look at the sun; thus the people, as if carried above the
clouds on the wings of God, had surmounted every obstacle, however great. For
the notion which some have, that eagles are mentioned instead of other birds,
because they alone bear up their young ones on their wings, is a foolish and
truly Rabbinical gloss.

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,

would more exalt His grace, by comparing this one nation with the whole world,

Moses,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"When the Most High divided
to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the

earth is in God's dominion, yet the race of Israel has been chosen by Him to
excel all nations. Whence it is evident, that whereas the condition of all is
alike, some are not distinguished from others by nature, but by gratuitous
adoption; but, in order that they should abide in the possession of so great a
blessing, fidelity towards God is required on their part. And, first, they are
commanded to listen to his voice, (since no sacrifice is more pleasing to him
than obedience,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;091522&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 15:22;) and then a definition of obedience is added, viz., to keep His
covenant.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And ye shall be unto me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He points out
more clearly, and more at length, how the Israelites will be precious unto God;
viz., because they will be for "a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation." By
these words, he implies that they will be endowed with sacerdotal as well as
royal honors; as much as to say, that they would not only be free, but also like
kings, if they persevered in faith and obedience, since no kingdom is more
desirable, or more happy, than to be the subjects of God. Moreover, he calls
this "an holy kingdom," because all the kingdoms of the world were then in
heathenism; for the genitive, according to the usual idiom of the language, is
put for an adjective, as if he had said, that they would enjoy not merely an
earthly and transitory dominion, but also a sacred and heavenly one. Others
understand it passively, that God would be their king; whilst mortals, and for
the most part cruel tyrants, would rule over other nations. Though I do not
altogether reject this sense, yet I rather prefer the other, to which also St.
Peter leads us: for when the Jews, who by their refusal of Christ had departed
from the covenant, still improperly gloried in this title, he claims this honor
for the members of Christ only, saying, "Ye are a chosen generation, a royal
priesthood," etc.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 2:9.) But the passive sense would not accord with these words, viz., that
believers are subject to the priesthood of God, for the Apostle gracefully
applies the words to take away the unacceptableness of novelty; as if he had
said, God formerly promised to our fathers that they should be to Him for a
royal priesthood. This privilege all, who separate themselves from Christ the
Head, falsely lay claim to, since He alone makes us a royal priesthood.
Meanwhile he teaches, by this apparent adaptation of the words, that what had
been spoken by Moses is actually fulfilled. And, in fact, Christ appeared
invested with the kingdom and the priesthood, that He might confer both of these
privileges upon His members; whence it follows, that whosoever divorce
themselves from Him, are unworthy of either honor, and are justly deprived of
them. The nation is here called holy, not with reference to their piety or
personal holiness, but as set apart from others by God by special privilege. Yet
on this kind of sanctification the other depends, viz., that they who are
exalted by God's favor should cultivate holiness, and thus on their part
sanctify God.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And all the people
answered.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We shall see in its proper
place why God employed Moses as a messenger to carry backwards and forwards the
commands and replies; now he merely relates what all the people answered, viz.,
that they would be obedient in all things. It was not a part, but the whole of
the people who promised this, and the reply was unreserved, declaring that they
would do whatsoever God required. Yet soon after they relapsed into their
natural mind, and kept not their promise even in the smallest degree. Still we
may believe that they spoke without dissembling; but that, although without any
intention of deceiving God, they were carried away by a kind of headlong zeal,
and deceived themselves. Nor was it the object of Moses to tell them in reproach
that they had lied to God, or deceitfully boasted with their lips what they did
not feel in their hearts; but, by stating how ready they were to obey, he
deprives them hereafter of all pretense of ignorance. Nor is there any doubt
that God inclined their minds to this docility, in order to establish the
doctrine of His law. Meanwhile, let us learn from their example, that we must
not merely obey God's word by some earnest impulse; and that a hasty feeling is
of no use, unless it be followed by constant perseverance; and, therefore, let
us learn to sift; ourselves well, lest: we rashly promise, without serious
self-examination, more, than we are able to perform. Yet we must not forget
what. I have already said, that they were all made willing by the secret
inspiration of God, in order that they might be witnesses both to themselves and
others of the many signs, by which the truth and faithfulness of the

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God here proclaims, that by a
manifest symbol of His glory, He will make it evident that the Law proceeded not
from Moses, but that he merely delivered faithfully what he received from
heaven; for God was so covered with the cloud, as with a veil that He still
upraised their minds as by a certain sign of His presence. On this was the
authority of Moses founded, that the Israelites knew God to be the author of the
doctrine, of which he was the minister. And this is especially worth remarking,
because we gather from hence that there is no other mode of proving a doctrine,
except by the assurance that it comes not from elsewhere, but from God alone;
and thus is every mortal brought down to his level, lest any one, however
excellent in wisdom, should dare to advance his own imaginations. For if the
mightiest of prophets, Moses, obtained credit in the Church on no other grounds
than because he bore the commands of God, and only taught what he had heard, how
foolish and impudent will it be in teachers, who sink down far beneath him, to
endeavor to attain a higher point! In fine, this passage shows that we must
believe in God alone, but that at the same time we must listen to the prophets,
who spoke out of His mouth. Besides this, it appears that God did not wish to
obtain credit for His servant Moses during a short period of time, but that
posterity should pay him the same reverence even after his death. The call of
some is temporary; and it may happen that God takes away the spirit of prophecy
from those to whom He has given it; but so did He appear to Moses, as to ratify,
and, as it were, consecrate the truth of his doctrine in all ages. Thence it
follows, that the brightness of God's glory, which was shown to his ancient
people in the thick cloud, is not yet extinct, but that it ought to illuminate
the minds of all the godly, reverently to submit themselves to Moses. What
follows at the end of the verse is a repetition from the last; for there was no
intervening reply of the people which Moses could report. The meaning is, that
although the Israelites had voluntarily promised to abide in the path of duty,
yet that this confirmation was added, like a spur to those who are running, that
they may proceed more nimbly.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Before propounding His law, it is
not unreasonable that God should command the people to be sanctified, lest He
should cast pearls before swine, or give that which is holy unto dogs; for
although by right of adoption they were holy, yet, as regarded themselves, the
filthiness of their nature unfitted them for participating in so great a
blessing. It was by no means right or just that the inestimable treasure should
be polluted by foul and stinking vessels. Therefore, in the injunction that they
should be sanctified, two things were pointed out, &#8212; that the sacred
doctrine of God was not to be handled by unwashen hands, and that the whole
human race is impure and polluted, and, consequently, that none can duly enter
God's school save those who are cleansed from their filthiness. And, doubtless,
it is the just reward of their unworthy profanation that so many readers or
hearers profit not by heavenly doctrine, because they rush in without fear or
reverence, as to some ridiculous stage play. This preparation, then, is
seasonably commanded, to make ready God's scholars and render them fit to be
taught. But while the inward purity of the heart is chiefly demanded, this
ceremony was not without its use to accustom an ignorant people to meditate upon
true holiness. That they should wash their clothes and abstain from the nuptial
bed were things of naught in themselves; but when external rites are referred to
their proper end, viz., to be exercises unto spiritual worship, they are useful
aids to piety; and we know that God, in consideration of the times, before
Christ's coming, employed such figures which now have no place under the
brightness of the Gospel. But although the use of them be grown obsolete, yet
the truth, which I spoke of, still remains, viz., that if we desire to be
admitted to a participation in heavenly doctrine, we should</font><br></div>

all filthiness of the flesh and
spirit."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 7:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here a question arises; for if, as Peter bears
witness, faith purifies the heart,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;441509&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
15:9,) and understanding of the doctrine goes before faith, since Paul declares
that it "cometh by hearing,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451017&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:17,) the consequence is, that the order of things is inverted if the people
are to be sanctified before they hear the Law, because in this way the means of
sanctification is wanting. My reply is, that albeit faith, in so far as it
embraces the offer of reconciliation and the Spirit of regeneration, can alone
truly purify us; yet this by no means prevents the fear of God from going before
to prepare a place for the word in our minds. And, properly speaking, a pious
desire of learning, humility, and reverence should be accounted the commencement
of faith, since it is from these elements that God begins to perfect faith in us
by certain progressive steps. On this account James exhorts us to "receive with
meekness the engrafted word," because the door of the entrance is shut against
it by pride, and obstinacy, and profane contempt. As to the meaning of the
passage, to be "sanctified," and to "wash their clothes," are not spoken of as
different things, but the second is added as the symbol 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f213</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of the first; for under the Law the rite of ablution reminded the ancient people
that no one can please God, except he both seek for expiation in the blood of
Christ, and labor to purify himself from the pollution's of the flesh.
Abstinence from cohabitation had the same object; for although there is nothing
polluting or contaminating in the marriage bed, yet the Israelites were to be
reminded that all earthly cares were, as much as possible, to be renounced, and
all carnal affections to be put away, that they might give their entire
attention to the hearing of the Law. The sanctity of marriage veils and covers
whatever of sin there is in the cohabitation of man and wife; yet it is certain
that it in some degree distracts them from having their whole minds occupied by
spiritual affections. Therefore Paul makes this exception in the mutual
obligation of the marriage bed, that couples may be separated for "fasting and
prayer."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 7:5.) Yet the moderation which God prescribed is to be observed; for
God did not enjoin perpetual celibacy, but so arranged the time that the
Israelites might be disengaged from all earthly preoccupations, and might more
freely apply their whole minds to the reverent reception of the
Law.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt set
bounds.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this symbol the Israelites
were admonished to restrain their natural inquisitiveness, that they may be
sober in their desires after knowledge, because God, by the teaching of His Law,
only enlightens those who are as "little children." We know how great is men's
natural curiosity, how forwardly they seek to penetrate the secrets of God, how
daringly they indulge themselves, and how, by their irreverence, all religion
and fear of God is extinguished in them; wherefore there was good cause why He
should set these bounds, and restrain this perverse longing after unlawful
knowledge. All would have wished to come, like Moses, to familiar converse with
God; but they are commanded to stand within the boundaries, that they may obey
God speaking to them by an interpreter. Thus are their modesty and docility
proved, when they desire no more than is permitted them, and keep themselves
within the bounds of revelation. What was then enjoined upon His ancient people
is extended also to us, that in reading and hearing we should not overpass the
limits which God assigns us, but, content with the form of doctrine which He
delivers to us, should let alone what He would have concealed from us; and,
although He speaks to us from afar, should not be offended by the distance. Yet
does He not prohibit the people from ascending, as though he grudged them a
nearer prospect of His glory; but because it is expedient that the proud and
improperly arrogant should be kept within His narrow limit, that they may be
reminded of their weakness. To alarm them yet more, He commands that the men
themselves, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f214</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and even beasts, though harmless, should be killed if they passed over the
borders. We have just before explained what is meant by God's descending, viz.,
the manifestation of His power; since His essence which fills heaven and earth
moves not from its place.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall not a hand touch
it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f215</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>They ignorantly pervert the meaning who resolve the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">,
be, into the adversative else; as if Moses forbade them to touch the mountain
with the hand, under penalty of stoning. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f216</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Those also are far from the truth who think that what is ordained is, that one
should not follow the other, or that none should stretch forth his hand to the
transgressors for their help. Moses referred to something altogether different;
for in order to render more detestable those who, by rash advances, should
violate the limits placed by God, he commanded them to be killed afar off by
stones or darts; as if whosoever should touch them, even with a finger, would
contract pollution. It is, then, as if he commanded them to be avoided as being
accursed, lest they should infect others by their contagion. Therefore there is
an antithesis between different kinds of death, viz., to smite with the sword or
to shoot through with darts, and to strike with the hand. But lest the people
should consider themselves rejected, and thus being offended by the ignominy of
their repulse, should abandon their love and desire for the Law, He permits
their ascent conditionally, viz., when the sound of the trumpet shall have been
protracted for a long time, or it shall have done sounding. Thus there was no
ground for complaining of the limitation which God had appointed for their
safety.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass on the third

already adverted to, that this terrible spectacle was partly to set the presence
of God before their eyes, that His majesty might urge the beholders to
obedience, and vindicate His doctrine from contempt, and partly to express the
nature of the Law, which in itself produces nothing but mere terror. The air was
disturbed by thunder and lightning's, and the sound of the trumpet; the mountain
was wrapped in smoke and darkness, that the people might humbly prostrate
themselves before God, and solemnly embrace the covenant proposed to them; since
religion never penetrates the mind so that it seriously receives God's word
until its vices are cleansed and corrected, and it is really subdued. And this
fear is common also to the Gospel; for as in the promulgation of the Law God
shook the earth, so when He speaks by the Prophet of the coming of Christ, and
the restoration of His Church, He says, "Yet once, it is a little while, and I
will shake the heavens and the earth," etc.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;370206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Haggai

describes Him under this image; for no doubt when, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191807&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
18:7-9, he says, "Then the earth shook and trembled, the foundations also of the
hills moved and were shaken, &#8212; there went up a smoke out of his nostrils,
and fire out of his mouth devoured; he bowed the heavens also, and came down;
and darkness was under his feet," he alludes to the history which Moses here
relates.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;350303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
3:3 yet more plainly does so, &#8212; "God came from Teman, and the Holy One
from Mount Paran." Meanwhile the other point remains, that the awful prodigies,
at which the people needs must tremble, were added as seals to the promulgation
of the Law, because the Law was given to cite slumbering consciences to the
judgment-seat, that, through fear of eternal death, they might flee for refuge
to God's mercy.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses brought forth the
people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We learn from these words that
the prodigies were not intended to drive the people from God's sight, and that
they were not smitten with fear to exasperate and disgust them with the
doctrine, but that God's covenant was no less lovely than alarming; for they are
commanded to go and "meet God," presenting themselves with minds ready unto
obedience. But this could not be unless they heard in the Law something besides
precepts and threatenings. Yet in the smoke and fire, and other signs, some fear
was added, in accordance with the office of the Law, because the sinner will
never be capable of pardon until he learns to tremble from consciousness of his
guilt, nay, until confounded with dread he lies like one dead before the
tribunal of God. In the two following verses, Moses explains what he had briefly
touched upon respecting the meeting with God; for he shows that God was near,
since His majesty appeared upon the top of Sinai. He adds that he stood within
the bounds, because he went up by himself alone, and that by invitation; for he
clears himself from the accusation of temerity, by expressly stating that he
passed over the limits assigned to the people, not voluntarily, but at the
command and call of God.

It appears from the context itself that the order of the narration is inverted,
which the old translator does not perceive, and perverts the sense. God's
answering him "by a voice," means that He spoke aloud and clearly, viz., so that
the people might hear, as we shall see hereafter in Deuteronomy
4.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Exodus

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto

repeated, that the people should not pass over the bounds, because, without
doubt, it was not enough to have forbidden them once, as we may gather from the
reply of Moses; for he thought that since they were all admonished, there was no
necessity for a new prohibition. But God insists with greater vehemence, and
again with threatenings, orders them to be charged that they take diligent heed
to themselves. He knew, forsooth, that He had to do with the rebellious, for
whose subjugation a sorer dread of punishment would be necessary. Now, since we
are no better than they, let us not be surprised if God often spurs us on by the
application of many exhortations, and redoubles His threats, for else
forgetfulness of all which He has once enjoined would creep over us. This
passage also confirms the fact, that the curiosity which influences men's minds
is greatly displeasing to God; for He expressly commands that they should not
break through to gaze, &#8212; not because He would have anything concealed or
hidden which it was profitable for them to know, but because their inquiries
ought to be sober; and this is the legitimate limit of knowledge, humbly to
learn at God's mouth what He voluntarily teaches, &#8212; not to advance with
too anxious longings, but to follow Him as He leads
us.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses said unto the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Because Moses was persuaded that
the people would be obedient, he rejoins that the decree which had already been
pronounced would be sufficient, and that the repetition of it would be in some
degree supererogatory; for when he says that "the people cannot come up," he
replies that he puts himself forward in the name of all as their surety. And
this he does honestly, and in accordance with the rule of charity; yet it
appears from God's reply that he was deceived, whilst judging of others by his
own feelings. Whilst, however, he unhesitatingly executes the task allotted to
him, it is plain that he preferred the command of God to his own preconceived
opinion; and thus taught us by his example, that whatever may be the
imaginations which come into our minds, they must still be submitted to this
yoke, that God's authority alone may have the pre-eminence. A doubt may arise
because He names "the priests;" since the priestly office was not yet committed
to the Levites. Some, therefore, understand it to mean all the first-born,
because, by ancient and common consent, it is allowed that they were always
invested with the honor of the priesthood. But although I readily admit that
they were chosen from the first-born, yet I do not think it probable that out of
that immense multitude there were special priests for every house. In the
meantime we may conjecture that since no heathen nations were then without
priests, there was no less method amongst the chosen people; for what common
sense dictated to the blind, assuredly a purer religion more clearly showed,
viz., that God's worship should not be separated from the
priesthood.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">EXODUS

Moses more largely pursues what he here only touches upon briefly, I shall also
defer my full exposition of it. If he had been the only spectator of God's
glory, the credit of his testimony would be lighter; after having, then,
reported the ten commandments, which God Himself spoke with His own sacred lips
in the hearing of the people, he adds, at the same time, that the lightning's
shone openly, the mountain smoked, the trumpets sounded, and the thunder rolled.
It follows, therefore, that by these conspicuous and illustrious signs, the law
was ratified before all the people, from the greatest even to the least. The
confession of the whole people is added; when, overwhelmed with alarm, they
supplicate God to go on speaking no more. For no longer could they now despise
the voice of the man, whom they had of their own accord desired to be given them
as their mediator, lest they should be consumed by the awful voice of God. He
lays before them the object, for which those signs had appeared to terrify them,
viz., that God might subdue them to obedience. They were terrified, then, not
that they might be stupified with astonishment, but only that they might be
humbled and submit themselves to God. And this is a peculiar privilege, that the

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These words the Lord
spoke.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>That there may be no doubt about
the authority of the law, and that it may not be depreciated by the people,
Moses recalls to their memory that the presence of God, as He spoke it, was
manifested by sure tokens; for this was the object of the fire, the clouds, and
the darkness, whereby God's voice was signalized, lest its source might be
obscure. He adds, that it was "a great voice," i.e., a voice which had, in an
unwonted manner, penetrated far and wide. Nor are the witnesses few, whom he
cites, but all that vast multitude, which for the most part would have been more
disposed to extinguish the glory of God, unless it had been there made known by
manifest proofs. The sum is, that there is no question as to who was the
Lawgiver, whose majesty was then proclaimed by tremendous prodigies, and
presented before the eyes of an immense multitude. It will be more convenient to
speak elsewhere of the two tables. When Moses states that God "added no more,"
he signifies that a perfect rule of life is contained in the ten commandments,
and that, when their instruction is fully received, the whole body of wisdom is
attained to, so that the people need seek to know no more; when God, then, made
an end of speaking, he Himself laid down the bounds of legitimate
inquiry.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass, when ye
heard.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Lest the Israelites should
undervalue his teaching, because he had been put between them by God as their
minister, Moses meets the objection, (by reminding them) that it was done at
their petition and request. We know how proudly they were wont to reject him; as
if they saw in him nothing but what was earthly and human; it was needful, then,
that God Himself should speak to rescue His servant from the contempt of
posterity. For the people themselves, being convicted of their foolish and
preposterous request, could never afterwards have any pretext for rejecting
Moses, as if he had not evidenced the truth of his calling. And here their
astonishing perverseness betrayed itself, in not being ashamed to refuse credit
to the holy Prophet, after he had been approved by so many miracles. Assuredly,
if they had been just and honest judges, it would have been sufficiently
notorious, and certain to them, that Moses did not speak of himself, or of his
own impulse, but that he was the organ of the Spirit; yet the doctrine of God
was scorned by these proud, and perverse, and fretful beings, because it was
brought to them by the hands of a mortal man. They, therefore, by their
importunate desires, draw down God from heaven, to speak Himself; but
immediately terror seizes on their minds, so that they flee from His voice. Thus
experience taught them that there was nothing better for them than to hear God
speaking to them by the mouth of Moses; and they were instructed by the just
reward of their temerity to choose and prefer that mode of teaching which they
had spurned; for, if in future they refused to give credit to Moses, whom they
had themselves chosen as their mediator with God, they brought themselves in
guilty of gross and wicked contumacy; and this is what he now reproaches them
with. It would have been worse than unseemly in them, when God had yielded to
their prayers, to reject that blessing which they had besought of Him. On this
account he reminds them, that, after they had been eye-witnesses of God's
fearful power, they had voluntarily asked that He should not speak to them any
more; and, lest they should object that this was done only by a few, or
inconsiderately, or in tumult, he expressly testifies that these requests were
presented by the heads of their tribes, and their
elders.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Behold, the Lord our God hath showed us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>They are urged by their own confession no more to dare oppose themselves to
the ministry of Moses. For, when they confess that they saw the glory and the
greatness of God, they oblige themselves to the necessity of obedience, unless
they choose avowedly to make war against God. At the end of the verse, where
they say that "God doth talk with man," etc., not only do they mean that there
are men surviving on earth who have heard with their ears the voice of God come
down from heaven, but they express their astonishment at what was scarcely to be
believed. For, although it was sufficiently notorious to them that God had
formerly spoken with their fathers; yet, because a long period had elapsed since
these revelations had ceased, they are amazed as at a new thing. We see, too, a
long time afterwards, that as often as God appeared to His servants, they were
overwhelmed with the fear of death, and it was like a proverb with them, "We
shall die, because we have seen God."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;071322&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Judges
13:22.) Good reason, then, is there why they should celebrate this extraordinary
privilege, that they had not been swallowed up by the glory of God; for, if at
the sight of Him the mountains melt, and all that is most durable is
annihilated, and all that is strongest is broken to pieces, how should man stand
than whom nothing is more frail or perishable? If by His secret will the
troubled air causes not only animals but trees and rocks to tremble; how shall
it be when God displays His might not in the elements alone, but when descending
from heaven He speaks by the voice of His mouth? It is not unreasonable, then,
that the Israelites should account it miraculous that they had heard God's
voice, and were not brought to annihilation. Herein they indirectly rebuke their
own folly, because, by their inconsiderate desire, they would have drawn
destruction upon themselves, if they had not been aided by God's mercy. The two
following verses appear to contradict each other; for, when they had experienced
that those to whom God manifests Himself, are not always destroyed and perish,
why do they say that they shall die if He continues to speak to them? They seem,
indeed, in so saying to show some inconsistency; yet is there cause for them to
fear for the future that danger from which they had escaped by the marvelous
indulgence of God. It is, then, as if they had said, It is more than enough for
us once to have provoked God against us; it is of His inestimable
loving-kindness that He has thus far pardoned us; meanwhile, we must beware lest
our perversity bring upon us heavier punishment, unless we speedily correct our
folly. Hence may a useful admonition be drawn; for, although the voice of God
has not sounded in our ears, yet the experience of His ancient people ought to
be sufficient to persuade us assuredly that, when God sets teachers over us, He
makes the best provision for our salvation; because, if He Himself should
thunder from heaven, His majesty would be intolerable to us. And this should
avail to repress their destructive itching, who desire God daily to descend from
heaven, or at least to send His revelations by angels; and who thus despise the
ministers of mortal race whom He employs. In a word, this history is an
illustrious proof that God governs His Church by the external preaching of the
word, because this is most expedient for
us.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For who is there of all.
flesh?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The word "flesh" is used in
contempt, as often elsewhere, for the human race; for, although we consist of
body and soul, yet when the frailty of men, and their perishing and transitory
condition is referred to, Scripture calls them "flesh." In this sense Zechariah
calls upon "all flesh to be silent before the Lord,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;380213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
2:13,) and Isaiah says that "all flesh is grass,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
40:6,) and elsewhere, that "the horses of the Egyptians are flesh, and not
spirit,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
31:3.) In these words, then, the reason is given why the Israelites should
wonder that they were not killed and consumed after hearing God's voice. Still
they were not ignorant that God had formerly spoken in the burning bush; but in
their agony of fear they do not reflect on what had previously happened, but
only express their own feeling that God's voice is deadly to the flesh, unless
it is softened by some interposing remedy. For the notion of the Rabbins, that
the Prophets are not to be counted amongst men, is a foolish fancy, except in so
far as God supports and strengthens them by His Spirit, that they may be equal
to the reception of visions. The Israelites were fully aware that Moses also was
himself a mere mortal; yet, because they knew that he was God's chosen
interpreter, they do not doubt but that he will be inspired with power from
heaven, to endure the speaking of God. Nor is there any question that this
confession was forced from them, that they may at length learn to fall back to
their proper place, and to submit themselves to Moses, against whom they had
been so often rebellious. Now, therefore, they willingly subscribe to that
distinction, which before they would not bear. Their promise, that they would do
all things which God should command, undoubtedly proceeded from the fervor of
their zeal; and therefore, God soon afterwards praises their answer. Their words
were to the same effect., as if they had said that they would value whatever
Moses might set before them, as if God Himself should thunder from heaven.
Meanwhile: as to themselves, their levity and inconsistency was soon discovered.
Thus do men often hastily and rashly consent to promise what they are not able
to perform, although they do not intentionally desire to deceive, from
neglecting to examine their own powers. God, therefore, pronounces what they
said to be right, viz., that they would be obedient to Moses, and content with
his teaching. And this sentiment has reference to us also, who are commanded to
hear Moses and the Prophets, but especially God's only Son; lest our vague
speculations should hurry us away further than becomes
us.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O that there were such an
heart in them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God signifies that they
would not be so firm and faithful in keeping their promises, as they were ready
and willing to make them; and thus that hypocrisy was not altogether banished,
or purged from their minds. Moreover, He figuratively (improprie) assumes a
human feeling, because it would be vain and absurd for Him to desire what it was
in His power to confer. Certainly He has the power of bending and directing
men's hearts whithersoever He pleases. Why, then, does He wish that it were
given to the people from some other quarter, that they should be always kept in
the path of duty, except that, speaking in the character of a man, He shows that
it was rather to be wished than hoped that the people would constantly persevere
in their fidelity? Wherefore this and similar passages have been ignorantly
abused by some, to establish man's free will.  
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f220</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
They understand this passage, as if man's will were capable of bending either
way, and that he possessed the power of doing right, whilst God without
interfering looked on at the event; as if God's secret counsel, and not rather
the end and use of external teaching, were referred to here. But we, taught by
innumerable testimonies of Scripture, maintain, that it is the attribute of God
alone to give what He here requires. So also immediately afterwards He says,
that he wishes it may be well with the Israelites and their children, viz.,
because it is certain that it depends on men whether they are happy or not, as
often as God invites them, when they refuse the grace offered to them; yet does
it not therefore follow, that it depends on every man's free will to attain
happiness for himself. But here we must consider God's will as it is set before
us in His word, not as it is hidden in Himself; for, while by His word He
invites all promiscuously to (eternal 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f221</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
) life, He only quickens by His secret inspiration those whom He has elected. In
sum, although God approves of the people's answer, he says that there will be
too much difficulty in the performance of it, for the event to accord with
it.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go say to

consent to the people's prayer; as much as to say, that what they had asked was
ratified by God's decree; whence it follows that, if they refuse to obey Moses,
they will not be only guilty of perverseness and levity, but will violate a
divine decree. I have before shown why God honors the doctrines of the law by
various titles, viz., that the Israelites may more willingly acquiesce in them.
But, lest they should think that what was enjoined them was only to remain in
force, and to be observed for a short time, He expressly refers to the
perpetuity of the Law; for this is the import of the words, in which He declares
Himself to teach them what they were to do in the land which He should give
them.</font><br><br></div>

reading this verse and the next in connection with each other, and thus making
them together the first of the ten commandments. Others taking them separately,
consider the affirmation to stand in the place of one entire commandment; but
since God neither forbids nor commands anything here, but only comes forth
before them in His dignity, to devote the people to Himself, and to claim the
authority He deserves, which also He would have extended to the whole Law, I
make no doubt but that it is a general preface, whereby He prepares their minds
for obedience. And surely it was necessary that, first of all, the right of the
legislator should be established, lest what He chose to command should be
despised, or contemptuously received. In these words, then, God seeks to procure
reverence to Himself, before He prescribes the rule of a holy and righteous
life. Moreover, He not merely declares Himself to be Jehovah, the only God to
whom men are bound by the right of creation, who has given them their existence,
and who preserves their life, nay, who is Himself the life of all; but He adds,
that He is the peculiar God of the Israelites; for it was expedient, not only
that the people should be alarmed by the majesty of God, but also that they
should be gently attracted, so that the law might be more precious than gold and
silver, and at the same time "sweeter than honey,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B972&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
119:72, 103;) for it would not be enough for men to be compelled by servile fear
to bear its yoke, unless they were also attracted by its sweetness, and
willingly endured it. He afterwards recounts that special blessing, wherewith He
had honored the people, and by which He had testified that they were not elected
by Him in vain; for their redemption was the sure pledge of their adoption. But,
in order to bind them the better to Himself, He reminds them also of their
former condition; for Egypt was like a house of bondage, from whence the
Israelites were delivered. Wherefore, they were no more their own masters, since
God had purchased them unto Himself. This does not indeed literally apply to us;
but He has bound us to Himself with a holier tie, by the hand of His
only-be-gotten Son; whom Paul teaches to have died, and risen again, "that He
might be Lord both of the dead and the living."

exposition which I have adopted required that this same preface, as it is
repeated word. for word in Deuteronomy, should here also be read together, I
have thought fit also to insert the five verses, which in this place precede it.
In the first verse, Moses exhorts the people to hear the judgments and statutes
of God, which he sets before them. He likewise states the object of this, that
they should keep 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f222</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to do them; as much as to say, that he was not offering them mere empty
speculations, which it was enough to understand with the mind, and to talk
about, but that the rule for the ordering of their lives was also contained in
his teaching; and, therefore, that it demands imperatively their serious
meditation.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord our
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In these words he commends the Law;
because it must be accounted a peculiar blessing, and a very high honor to be
taken into covenant by God. Wherefore, that they may anxiously prepare
themselves to embrace the Law, he says that what was above all things to be
desired had been freely offered to them, viz., that they should be united in
covenant with God. In the next verse he still further magnifies this advantage
by comparison; because God had given more to them than to their fathers. Thence
is all excuse taken from them, unless, for the sake of manifesting their
gratitude, they give themselves up entirely to God, and in return worship with
sincere affection Him whom they have experienced to be so bountiful a Father.
Those who would paraphrase this sentence, "Not only with our fathers, but also
with us," pervert its proper meaning; the grounds of their mistake being, that
God had formerly made a covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But this may be
easily refuted; because the name of "fathers"<i> </i>does not refer to these,
but he means by it such as had died in Egypt during the last 200 years; to whose
case he justly prefers that of the surviving people, with whom the ancient
covenant had been renewed. Now, this reference to time was in no slight degree
calculated to stimulate and arouse them to obedience; for it would have been
disgraceful in them not to acknowledge that they were honored more than their
fathers by this especial privilege, in order that they should excel them in
their earnest zeal for God's service. Christ uses the same argument with His
disciples, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see: and the ears
which hear the things that ye hear, etc., 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f223</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

more bountifully God deals with us, the more heinous and intolerable is the
crime of ingratitude, unless we willingly come to Him when He calls us, and
submit ourselves to His
instruction.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Face to face.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Again he commends the Law
by mentioning their certainty about it; for, when God openly manifested Himself,
there could be no doubt of the author from whom it proceeded. To speak "face to
face," is equivalent to discoursing openly and familiarly; and in point of fact
God had spoken with them, as mortals and friends communicate with each other in
their mutual dealings. Moreover, lest any doubt should still remain, God set
before their eyes a visible manifestation of His glory, by appearing in the
fire; for no other voice but that of God Himself could proceed out of fire. In
the next verse a kind of explanation is added, when he says that he was the
interpreter, who laid before them the commands he received from God. And thus he
reconciles two things which seem at first sight to be contradictory, viz., that
God spoke in person, and yet by a mediator; since they themselves having heard
God's voice petitioned in their fear that He should not continue to speak in the
same way. Hence it follows that they were convinced, by a sense of the divine
glory and majesty, that it was not allowable for them to doubt the authority of
the law. But I only slightly glance at this, because it has been more fully
treated of before.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>Deuteronomy 4:20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the Lord hath taken
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He argues that, from the period of
their deliverance, they have been wholly devoted to God, since He has purchased
them for His own peculiar possession. Hence it follows that they are under His
jurisdiction and dominion; because it would be foul and wicked ingratitude in
them to shake off the yoke of their redeemer. And, in order to strengthen the
obligation, he extols the greatness of the favor, because nothing could be more
wretched than they were, when God stretched forth His hand to deliver them.
Their bondage is therefore called metaphorically, a "furnace,"<i> </i>nay, an
"iron"<i> </i>one; and, then, their present far different condition is compared
with it; for this was solid and most desirable happiness, that they should be
translated into God's peculiar
inheritance.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">LEVITICUS

treats of the same points which we have observed in the preface to the Law; for
he reasons partly from God's authority, that the law should be reverently
obeyed, because the Creator of heaven and earth justly claims supreme dominion;
and, partly, he sets before them the blessing of redemption, that they may
willingly submit themselves to His law, from whom they have obtained their
safety. For, whenever God calls Himself Jehovah, it should suggest His majesty,
before which all ought to be humbled; whilst redemption should of itself produce
voluntary submission. At the beginning he repeats the same words which he had
lately used; and thence exhorts them to observe His statutes and judgments,
<i>i.e., </i>treasure them diligently in their minds. Afterwards he reminds them
wherefore they ought attentively to observe the Law, viz, that they may perform
the works which God therein requires. Nor is it without a reason that at the end
of the second verse He declares Himself to be Jehovah, because it is not easy
either to subdue rebellious minds or to retain fickle ones in the fear of God.
In the next verse, the qualification "which<i> </i>sanctify you" is added, to
arouse them earnestly to prove their gratitude to God, who has by peculiar
privilege separated them from the rest of
mankind.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">leviticus

of His name, He confirms in other words the foregoing sentiment; guarding by
them His worship from all corruptions, that it may be maintained in purity and
integrity. The same, too, is the object of the clause in apposition, which
immediately follows; for they hallow God's name who turn not away from its
rightful and sincere worship. Let this be carefully observed, that whatever
fancies men devise, are so many profanations of God's name; for although the
superstitious may please themselves by their imaginations, yet is all their
religion full of sacrilege, whereby God complains that His holiness is profaned.
Mark, also, the mutual relation, when God requires Himself to be hallowed, even
as he hallows the people; for nothing can be more unseemly than for the
Israelites to mix up with idols Him by whose blessing they excel all other
nations. It is as though He commanded them to reflect from whence their
superiority proceeded, that they may pay their debt of gratitude to Him who is
its author. In sum, forasmuch as He had separated them from heathen nations, He
condemns all wicked blending with them, whereby the integrity of religion is
corrupted, so that He may alone have the pre-eminence, and all idols may be
repudiated.

teachable, in order that they may learn to serve God; for the beginning of a
good and upright life is to know what is pleasing to God. From hence, then, does
Moses commence<i> </i>commanding them to be attentive in seeking direction from
the Law; and then admonishing them to prove by their whole life that they have
duly profited in the Law. The promise which is here inserted, only invites them
to unreserved obedience through hope of the inheritance. The main point is, that
they should neither add to nor diminish from the pure doctrine of the Law; and
this cannot be the case, unless men first renounce their own private feelings,
and then shut their ears against all the imaginations of others. For none are to
be accounted (true) disciples of the Law, but those who obtain their wisdom from
it alone. It is, then, as if God commanded them to be content with His precepts;
because in no other way would they keep His law, except by giving themselves
wholly to its teaching. Hence it follows, that they only obey God who depend on
His authority alone; and that they only pay the Law its rightful honor, who
receive nothing which is opposed to its natural meaning. The passage is a
remarkable one, openly condemning whatsoever man's ingenuity may invent for the

enjoins them to be content with its unadulterated teaching; and, in fact, to
receive as just and right whatever God has commanded, is only to be half
obedient, unless men also put this restraint upon themselves, not to import
anything else, (in addition to His Law.) So, also, in another passage, which I
have subjoined, God no less severely forbids additions to it than taking away
from it; and this is a declaration deserving our especial observation, because,
in its preposterous wilfulness, the whole world almost is carried away into
false religions; which, nevertheless, God has briefly condemned in a single
word, when He commands His people so to acquiesce in His appointed Law that they
may not seek to be more righteous than they are taught to be. There is a similar
passage at the end of

on the preceding passage, it will be more conveniently reserved for

may be more disposed to obedience, he gently attracts them by subjoining the

themselves more cheerfully about the keeping of the Law, and may proceed more
steadily in this endeavor, he reminds them that nothing is better or more
desirable for themselves. For God is not duly honored, except with ready minds
and volutary obedience, to which we are rather attracted by pleasure than forced
by rigor and violence. Now, since all desire to excel, he says, that this is the
chief excellence of Israel, that they have God for their Lawgiver and Master. If
any object that what he says may be refuted by two arguments, namely, because
the Law of God was unknown to heathen nations; and because the form of God's
worship prescribed in it, and the whole Jewish religion, was not only despised
but hated by them; I reply, that other nations are not here absolutely stated to
be the judges or arbitrators, but that the words must be thus understood, viz.,
that there will be no nation, if it should come to a right understanding, which
will dare to compare itself, much less to prefer itself to you; for by the very
comparison it will acknowledge to what a height of dignity God has raised you.
Wherefore, although the doctrine of the Law should remain neglected, nay,
detested, by almost all the world, still Moses with truth declares, that since
God has deigned to deliver to the Jews a rule of life, a stage had been erected
before other nations, whereon the nobility of that one people would be
conspicuous. For it was unreasonable that the glory of God should be tarnished
or extinguished by the ignorance of the blind. But we gather from this passage
that we then are truly wise, when we depend on God's words, and submit our
feeling to His revelations. Where I have rendered the words, "Surely<i> (certo)
</i>this people," the Hebrew particle,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qr</font><font face="Palatino">, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f226</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

would appropriately bear this meaning: <i>"Only </i>this people," etc.

gracious privileges, is referred
to.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For what nation is there so
great?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses now repeats in his own name
what he had stated in the person of others, as if to shew by additional reasons,
that not without cause would the Jews be celebrated in the whole world, because
it would actually appear that none were equal to them. He mentions two points,
first, because God would be ready to afford them help, as often as they call
upon Him; secondly, because He had instructed them in perfect righteousness,
beyond which nothing could be desired; for, when he says that God is "nigh unto
them," I refer it to the presence of His power, which had been abundantly
manifested by many miracles. Justly does he deny that the Gentiles had ever
experienced such aid from their gods, since their prayers and cries were offered
to deaf and dead idols.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>

<i>rak, </i>of which I have just spoken, is used here, and its meaning in this
place is, as if Moses had said, that this <i>only </i>remained; unless it is
preferred to translate it <i>nevertheless. </i>What follows means literally
"Guard <i>(custodi) </i>thyself, and guard thy soul;"<i> </i>wherein Moses
advances by degrees, reminding them that they needed no common heedfulness, but
that they must beware with extreme vigilance and diligence lest they should fail
through the want of them; for the slothfulness of the flesh must be spurred on
by such instigations as these, and at the same time our weakness must be
fortified, and we must take measures against our unsteadfastness; for nothing is
more easy than that all our zeal should suddenly be forgotten, or should
gradually grow cold. God had established the certainty of His law, as far as was
necessary, for the grateful and attentive, yet not without reason does He desire
the people to remember how great is the carelessness of men. Nor does he command
those only to remember who were eye-witnesses, but also to hand down (what they
had seen) to their sons and grandsons, that the memory of such remarkable things
might be preserved.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>

</i>might be taken in the accusative, as if in apposition. It is, at any rate,
clear that he explains more fully what he had briefly alluded to before, for he
summons the people as eye-witnesses, lest, perchance, they should object that
they were not sure from whence Moses had derived what he professes to be
enjoined him by God. For they were all well aware that he had undertaken nothing
without the express command of God. Finally, he proves, from the end and object
itself of the doctrine, that God was its author, since it tended to nothing else
but that God should be purely served, and that His people might be obedient,
than which nothing can be imagined more just and
right.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

explanatory narrative is intended to prove the same thing, viz., that Moses was
only the ambassador and minister of God, because the mountain burned in the
sight of all the people, that God might be manifested, speaking from the midst
of the fire. His statement that they only heard the voice, but saw no
similitude, may be understood as a kind of admission, <i>(concessionis.)
</i>Thus the two clauses would be read adversatively, "Although no similitude
appeared, yet a voice penetrated even to your ears." But I conceive that this
was expressly stated more clearly to shew that it was the voice of God, and not
proceeding from a human being; for no man could have so concealed himself by
artifice as to prevent himself from being seen to speak, whereas they beheld the
voice come out of the fire without any external

pronounces magnificent praises upon the miracles which he had before more simply
related to have taken place at the promulgation of the Law, his object being to
produce a fuller conviction of its dignity. He magnifies, too, by comparison,
the testimonies whereby its authority had been ratified, viz., because nothing
like it had ever occurred; for if any such instance had previously taken place,
some portion of its preciousness or honor would have been taken from it. But
since from the beginning of the world only one such illustrious manifestation of
His power had been given by God, it afforded the greater sanction to the Law. He
adds, too, that if they were to search over the whole world they would nowhere
find anything similar. For I do not approve of the more refined exposition which
some give of this clause, as if he said that all creatures above and below were
witnesses that God's might had never been manifested by so many and such
illustrious miracles; as also the sense appears too restricted which others
give, understanding "the days that are past" to mean annals or chronicles; for I
make no question that Moses simply desires them to inquire and to examine
whether from the creation of the world, or in any most remote region, any such
thing had come to pass.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>33.</b>

old by many apparitions, yet amongst the portents which wretched men have
imagined for their willing self-deception, there is nothing approaching to this
miracle. Many have individually lied, and their false and foolish tales have
been rashly believed; but here we have not to do with unfounded and scattered
rumors, nor with the dreams of some single person, but Moses produces more than
700,000 witnesses, to whom God's glory had clearly and certainly appeared; he
subjoins, therefore, that God had never assayed to do the same, but had afforded
this solitary instance to render His Law illustrious in all ages.

Yet in this verse he not only alludes to the promulgation of the Law, but to the
whole course of their deliverance, since he names in general His "temptations<i>
</i>and signs." He says that God "took him a nation from the midst of <i>another
</i>nation," for by His incomparable power He rescued the descendants of
Abraham, who, though dispersed through Egypt, and, as it were, enclosed in its
bowels, were yet an obscure and ignoble part of a most famous nation; whereof no
similar example is to be found.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Unto thee it was
shewed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He first says that God had so
proved His divinity by miracles and prodigies, that the Israelites might know
certainly that He was God. Whence, too, he concludes<i> </i>that He is the only
God; for although God's holy name be torn in pieces by various opinions, whilst
each one manufactures his own gods for himself, yet is it still sure that the
power and dominion of God cannot be withdrawn from Him, but reside in a single
<i>subject, </i>as the logicians say. Therefore the essence of the one God
overthrows and annihilates all the other deities which we foolishly invent for
ourselves. And this we must carefully remark, for this has been the common error
of all ages, to seek for a mixture of many gods, whereas all these imaginations
should vanish before the brightness of the true God. In the following verse he
confirms this declaration, because God instructed His people out of heaven, and
in the fire. Is it, however, asked how these two points accord which seem to be
opposed to each other, that God's voice was heard from heaven and from the midst
of the fire? I reply, that Moses simply means that the voice which flowed out of
the fire into the people's ears was distinguished by plain indications which
proved it to be heavenly.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>37.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And because he
loved.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>These words admit of two
meanings; for the copulative conjunction stands at the beginning of the verse,
&#8212; "<i>And </i>because he loved thy fathers," and also before the next
clause, "and he chose their seed;" the reasons here assigned might, therefore,
be taken in connection with the previous sentence, viz., that so many miracles
were wrought because God had chosen Abraham and his seed. Others understand it
differently, that this people was honored with so many blessings by God because
He loved their fathers. In this case they omit the <i>copula </i>in the middle
of the verse, as must be often done. In the main, there is little discrepancy;
for Moses desires to shew that whatever good things God has conferred upon His
people are gratuitous, by which circumstance he commends God's grace the more.
He had said that by unusual favor this nation was taken from the midst of
another; and he now adds that this was done on no other account but because God
had embraced Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with His love, and persevered in the same
love towards their posterity. But we must remark that by the word <i>"love"
</i>is expressed that favor which springs of mere generosity, so as to exclude
all worthiness in the person beloved, as may be more clearly gathered from other
passages, viz.,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050708&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
7:8, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197868&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
78:68, and as is pretty plain from the context here, wherein he attributes the
election of the people to the love with which God had honored their fathers. If
any object that God's election is eternal, the objection is readily solved, for
the seed of Abraham was separated from all nations, because God had gratuitously
adopted their father. We now understand the meaning of Moses, that the
deliverance of the people was only to be ascribed to God's goodness. He thus
amplifies this blessing by another circumstance, viz., that God had preferred to
great and mighty nations this ignoble people, whose own proper worthiness could
not have acquired His favor.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>39.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Know therefore this day.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He again inculcates what we have lately spoken
of, that the glory of the one true God was proved by the miracles, but he does
so by way of exhortation. For he desires them carefully and attentively to
consider what God had shewn them, because in so plain a matter there would be no
excuse for error or ignorance. He therefore infers from what had gone before,
that the people must beware of shutting their eyes against the clear revelation
of God's power, and therefore urges them to keep it in memory, because man's
ingratitude is but too prone to forgetfulness. He afterwards reminds them
wherefore God would be known, viz., that they might keep His Law and obey His
statutes. The sum is, that they would be inexcusable if they did not obediently
receive the Law, which they knew to have come from God; for they must needs be
worse than stupid if the majesty of God, known and understood by so many proofs,
did not awaken them to reverence. And lest they should undervalue the doctrine
as proceeding from a mortal man, he expressly confesses, indeed, that he is the
minister, and yet that he had set before them nothing which he had not received
from God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">DEUTERONOMY

we have lately seen respecting God's gratuitous love; for the comparison of the
fewness of the people with the whole world and all nations, illustrates in no
trifling degree the greatness of God's grace; and this subject is considerably
enlarged upon. Almost the same expressions will very soon be repeated, and also
in the Song of Moses; but there by way of reproof, whilst here it is directed to
a different object, as is plain from the context, viz., that they might be, by
so great a blessing, laid under obligation to devote themselves and their
services to God. He begins by declaring the end of their election, viz., that
God had deigned to bestow this peculiar honor upon them that He might acquire
unto Himself a holy people, pure from all pollutions, and then, by adding the
circumstance I have adverted to, he magnifies the excellence of the benefit.
From his argument drawn from their dignity, that they ought therefore to labor
after holiness, we gather, that in proportion to the abundance of grace with
which any one is endued, he is solemnly bound to live piously and justly. For
God does not wish the gifts he bestows upon us to lie idle, but to produce their
appropriate fruits; and we must especially remember that when He adopts us, and
gathers us into His Church, we are not "called to uncleanness," but to purity of
life, and to shew forth the praises of him who hath called us out of darkness
into his marvellous light."

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlgs</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>segullah, </i>which we translate <i>"peculiaris," special, </i>some
understand to mean a <i>"treasure," </i>or a precious and desirable thing, as
was stated on Exodus 19. Undoubtedly it appears from many passages that gold,
silver, pearls, and the like, are designated by this word; but substantially it
is agreed that this title is given to the elect people, because God delights
Himself in them; and herein His incomparable goodness shines forth, that He so
highly esteems such miserable and worthless creatures, <i>(homunciones.)
</i>Hence, too, it appears that by His holy calling He, as it were, creates out
of nothing "things which are not,"<i> </i>that they may excel every earthly
being.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord did not set his love
upon you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He proves it to be of God's
gratuitous favor, that He has exalted them to such high honor, because He had
passed over all other nations, and deigned to embrace them alone. For an equal
distribution of God's gifts generally casts obscurity upon them in our eyes;
thus the light of the sun, our common food, and other things, which all equally
enjoy, either lose their value, or, at any rate, do not obtain their due honor;
whilst what is peculiar is more conspicuous. Moreover, Moses takes it for
granted, that there was nothing naturally in the people to cause their condition
to be better or more distinguished; and hence infers, that there was no other
reason why God should choose them, except His mere choice of them. We have
elsewhere observed, that by this His love, whatever men would bring of their own
is excluded or annihilated. It follows, therefore, that the Israelites could
never be sufficiently grateful to God, since they had been thus liberally dealt
with by Him, without any desert of their
own.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because he would keep the

back from the children to the fathers; for he addressed the men of his own
generation, when he said that they were therefore God's treasure, because He
loved them; now he adds that God had not just begun to love them for the first
time, but that He had originally loved their fathers, when He chose to adopt
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But although he more clearly proves that the
descendants of Abraham had deserved nothing of the kind, because they are God's
peculiar people only by right of inheritance, still it must be remarked that God
was induced to be kind to Abraham by no other cause than mere generosity. A
little further on, therefore, he will say that those who then survived were dear
to God, because He had already loved their fathers. But now he still further
commends the goodness of God, because He had handed down His covenant from the
fathers to the children, to shew that He is faithful and true to His promises.
At the end of the verse, he teaches that the deliverance of the people was both
an effect and a testimony of that
grace.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">deuteronomy

account of which we have seen that the people were under obligation to God;
because this was the most effectual observation for moving them to submit
themselves to their deliverer, to whom they were reminded that they owed
altogether themselves and all that they had. First, then, he admonishes them
that they differed from others, not by their personal dignity, nor the
excellency of their race, but because it pleased God to prefer them, when He
ruled equally over all. Literally it is, "Jehovah coveted to love your fathers,"
by which expression, as may be gathered from many passages, the feeling of
inclination to love them is undoubtedly marked. Jerome, therefore, has not aptly
used the word "adhere."

</i>Now, this desire, whereby God was freely and liberally induced, Moses
opposes to all other causes, lest Israel should arrogate anything to themselves
or their fathers. We must also remark the comparison<i> </i>between the less and
the greater; for this was inestimable condescension, that he should in a manner
pass by the heaven and earth with all their beauty and abundance, and set His
heart upon a few obscure men. To this the limitation refers, that of all people
He chose the seed of Abraham alone; for the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rak, </i>is here used <i>exclusively, </i>therefore, I have translated it
"tantummodo," only; unless it should be thought better to render it "But," or
"And yet." The meaning, however, is clear, that God, having disregarded all the
nations of the earth, had gratuitously adopted Abraham and his race. For he says
that not only were their fathers loved, but all their descendants in their
persons; since otherwise the exhortation which follows would not be
suitable.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Circumcise,
therefore.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>From this inference it
appears wherefore mention was made of this adoption,. viz., that the <i>Jews
</i>should more earnestly and solemnly serve God, whom they had known from
experience to be so gracious. He requires, then, a reciprocal love; for nothing
could be more base than not to testify their gratitude by a pious and righteous
life. But, because men are by no means inclined or disposed to obey God, Moses
exhorts them to self-renunciation, and to subdue and correct their carnal
affections; for to circumcise the heart is equivalent to cleansing it from
wicked lusts. Meanwhile, he reproves their former perverseness, when he desires
them to be no more stiff-necked; as much as to say, that now at last they should
put off that depravity of mind, wherein they had too long hardened themselves.
We now perceive the design of Moses. He would have his fellow-Israelites
submissive and obedient to God, who, by His great goodness, had furnished them
with the motive. But, because hitherto they had repaid His kindnesses with
ingratitude, at the same time, he enjoins them to amend their conduct. In the
first clause, he alludes to the rite appointed by the Law; for circumcision is,
as it were, the solemn consecration, whereby the children of Abraham were
initiated unto the worship of God and true piety, and at the same time were
separated from heathen nations, to be His holy and peculiar people; and they
were to be admitted to this elementary rite in their infancy, that by its
visible sign they might learn that the defilements of the flesh and the world
were to be renounced. There were also other objects in circumcision, but here
reference is only made to newness of life, or repentance <i>(resipiscentia).
</i>Wherefore, the conclusion is, that since God had chosen them as His people,
and by an external sign had devoted them to the cultivation of holiness, they
ought sincerely and really to prove that they differed from heathen nations, and
that they were circumcised in spirit, no less than in the flesh. For Paul
declares, that they alone are truly Jews who are circumcised "inwardly," as he
says, and not those who only have to boast of "the letter" of circumcision.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450228&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
2:28, 29.) Wherefore, the Prophets frequently taunt the transgressors of the Law
by calling them uncircumcised, although they bore the visible sign in their
flesh. In fine, when he desires to exhort them to sanctify themselves to God, he
reasons from the nature and use of the sign, whereby they professed themselves
to be His chosen people. In the second clause, there is an elegant metaphor, of
frequent occurrence, taken from oxen; for, since the oxen which quietly offer
their necks to the yoke are easily subdued to obedience, those are said to be
"stiff-necked" <i>(durae cervicis) </i>which are fierce and obstinate in their
nature.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b><i>

indifference.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">DEUTERONOMY

gratuitous kindness with which He had prevented them. Although, at the same
time, they were admonished in these words of the object for which they were
separated from other nations; for the conclusion he draws is, that because they
were received by God as His people, they, therefore, lay under an obligation to
keep His statutes; as Paul more plainly teaches us that we are redeemed from all
iniquity, that Christ might purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of
good works.

undoubtedly, God indirectly rebukes the people's indifference, by so often
calling them to obedience. By the words "with all thy soul" is meant serious
apprehension, and carefulness<i>, </i>as well as sincerity, free from all

desirable for them than to embrace God's Law; for nothing can be more honorable

due preeminence. Moses declares that, if the Israelites submit themselves to the
Law, this will be, as it were, to place Him in His rightful dignity; and he
promises that the fruit of it will return to them, for that God, on his part,
will exalt them, so that they shall far excel all other nations; as it is said

them to receive the Law, because their solid happiness consists in this pious
duty, if they altogether devote themselves to obedience. But this excellency of

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when thy son asketh
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The sole point which Moses urges
in these verses is, that the people should testify their gratitude by obeying
the Law, and that the same religion, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f232</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which he commands the fathers to teach, should descend<i> </i>to their
posterity. The sum is, that there was good reason why all the precepts<i> </i>of
the Law should be observed, since by them it was that God desired His people,
after their deliverance, to shew forth their sense of His loving-kindness.
Again, therefore, in this passage, he commends the Law by reminding them of
their redemption, that the people might more willingly and more earnestly
reverence it; for its authority has stronger claims upon them, because it was
not imposed before God had laid them under obligation to Himself; and it would
have been too base and absurd in them to refuse God as their Lawgiver, when they
knew that by Him they had been purchased to Himself. In the next place He
reminds them that for the same object they had been constituted the heirs of the
land of Canaan, that they should honor God as the author of this special favor;
thus he concludes that they are bound by a two-fold tie, for God had devoted
them to Himself not once only, but had confirmed His dominion over them by their
continued possession of the land. But there is nothing inconsistent in his
saying that the land was promised by oath to their fathers before the Law was
given; for, although God bestowed this gift gratuitously, yet did He justly
claim the testimony of their gratitude; just as now-a-days, although He invites
us to the hope of an eternal inheritance of His own free bounty, yet the end of
our calling is, that we on our part should celebrate His glory all our life
long. When in verse 24 he uses the words "to fear the Lord our God,"<i> </i>he
briefly defines the sum of the Law; for it would not suffice for us to perform
whatever is there commanded, unless our obedience had reference to the fear and
worship of God. Integrity and uprightness, indeed, give God delight; but none
will say that men's life is duly ordered, if, whilst they exercise equity one
towards another, they defraud God of His right. But it is well known that
legitimate honor and worship are comprehended under the name of fear. Just
afterwards, he commends the Law on account of its profitableness; for God
provided for their own good, in delivering to them the rule of a just and pious
life. In these words he intimates that they would be doubly ungrateful if they
rejected what God meant for their own advantage. For this expression, "for<i>
</i>our good," is equivalent to saying that God not only had respect and care
for His own rights in enacting the Law, but at the same time regarded what would
be useful to them; and this he more clearly states in the next verse, where he
says that "this<i> </i>shall be their righteousness if they observe" the Law;
otherwise, that the rule of a righteous life, which would please God, was
prescribed to them, than which nothing better could be desired. But it will be
elsewhere shewn at greater length how the keeping of the Law is in itself
righteousness, and yet that no man is justified by the Law; for, that the Law
brings only wrath and condemnation, does not arise from any defect or faultiness
in its doctrine, but must be imputed to our own guilt, as being far removed,
nay, aliens from the righteousness

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Speak unto the children of
Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>A<i> </i>little farther on I
will explain the object of this precept more fully: although it is plain from
the next verse that God had no other object but to exercise the Jews in constant
meditation upon the Law. For there was no religion contained in the fringes
themselves, nor had that material texture any value in itself; but since men are
lazy and forgetful in the cultivation of piety, God would by this aid make a
provision for their infirmity. For when He says that they should "look upon it
and remember," He hints that they have need of these coarse rudiments, which may
strike even their outward senses; and again, that, unless their memory was kept
awake, nothing was more likely than that forgetfulness should steal upon them.
But he presently adds, that God has no satisfaction in mere empty knowledge, but
that He demands serious affections and practical performance. In the latter part
of the verse he points out another requirement, viz., not only that their
sluggishness should be stimulated, but also their wantonness restrained; for
when he says "that ye seek not after your own heart," he intimates that, unless
God should restrain their wandering senses, they would be too much inclined to
all kinds of superstitions and errors. And, first of all, by contrasting "the
hearts and eyes" of men with His Law, he shews that He would have His people
contented with that one rule which He prescribes, without the admixture of any
of their own imaginations; and again, He denounces the vanity of whatever men
invent for themselves, and however pleasing any human scheme may appear to them,
He still repudiates and condemns it. And this is still more clearly expressed in
the last word, when he says that men "go a whoring" whenever they are governed
by their own counsels. This declaration is deserving of our especial
observation, for whilst they have much self-satisfaction who worship God
according to their own will, and whilst they account their zeal to be very good
and very right, they do nothing else but pollute themselves by spiritual
adultery. For what by the world is considered to be the holiest devotion, God
with his own mouth pronounces to be fornication. By the word "eyes"<i> </i>he
unquestionably means man's power of
discernment.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>41</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am the Lord your
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Having at the end of the last verse
commanded them to be holy unto their God, he now confirms this command by a
reason, viz., that it was for this end that God redeemed them, that he might be
their God, <i>i.e., </i>that He might be solemnly honored. He asserts God's
right, then, as founded upon the blessing of their deliverance, which would have
been misplaced unless they devoted themselves to His service. The repetition at
the conclusion is intended for
confirmation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">deuteronomy

again commands (as before) the study of His Law. And first, indeed, He would
have it implanted in their hearts, lest forgetfulness of it should ever steal
over them; and by the word "heart" He designates the memory and other faculties
of the mind; as though He had said that this was so great a treasure, that there
was good cause why they should hide it in their hearts, or so fix this doctrine
deeply in their minds that it should never escape. Afterwards He enjoins that
constant conversation should be held about it with their children, in order that

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f234</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
shanan, </i>which Moses uses, means properly "to<i> </i>whet." Commentators
think that it is employed metaphorically for "to<i> </i>reiterate," or "to
repeat constantly," because, when the heavenly doctrine is inculcated, it will
scarcely even thus be duly impressed on their hearts; but, since it is here used
in the conjugation <i>Piel, </i>its signification may be transitive, viz., that
they should cause it to penetrate their minds, as if they should prick them with
the point of a sword; for the other translation does not seem consistent. But it
is sufficient for me to state my opinion, lest any should be offended by its
novelty. Lastly, he exhorts them to exercise themselves in its meditation both
publicly and privately, in order to stimulate their want of energy. But,
although he may seem to speak hyperbolically, yet if any one will carefully
consider how slow and careless men are in learning, and how forgetful they are
when they seem to have made some progress, he will readily acknowledge that
Moses does not urge them so strongly on insufficient grounds, but that it was
highly necessary for him to be thus rigid in exacting their attention. For this
reason the Prophet in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;190102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
1:2, pronounces them to be blessed who meditate in God's law "day and night." He
leaves, then, no portion of time unoccupied with meditation on the Law; whether
they are at home, or abroad, or when they retire to rest, or when they rise in
the morning. To this precept David appears to allude in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B962&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
119:62, where he says, "At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because
of thy righteous judgments;" and again, Psalm 119:148, "Mine<i> </i>eyes prevent
the night-watches, that I might meditate in thy word." But still, by the
expression "talk of them," Moses does not urge the people to empty
talkativeness, to which many are too much inclined, but he would have them
severally thus establish themselves and be teachers of each other. He enumerates
these various engagements, lest that change of occupation by which the mind is
wont to be distracted should withdraw the godly from the right path, as though
he commanded them to make this their chief aim in whatever business they might
be engaged. For the same reason he desires bracelets and frontlets to be made of
the precepts of the Law, contrasting doubtless this spiritual ornament with
chains 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f235</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of gold, as much as to say that they would more properly take delight in the
pious recollection of the Law, than in those trifling ornaments which attract
men's senses. The Jews understanding this literally, accounted this external
ostentation a mark of holiness, so as to think that they had almost done all
they needed, when they wore the Law on their arms and foreheads. Thence their
mistaken zeal proceeded still further, so that, as each desired to be thought
better than others, they widened their phylacteries in proportion, for so they
denominated the borders of their garments, on which were written certain
sentences of the Law, as safeguards. This error our Lord severely reproves in
the Scribes and Pharisees,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
23:5,) because it was a mere mockery of this admonition, and a profanation of
its doctrine. The intention of God sufficiently appears in the passage from
Exodus, which I have subjoined, and in which they are simply commanded to be
diligent in keeping the Law. But there is good reason why diligence should be
required, not only on account of the matter being highly important, but because,
through our vanity, we are apt to relax our exertions, unless our slowness of
heart is
stimulated.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">deuteronomy

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore shall ye lay up these
my words.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He again demands their serious
attention, lest if the doctrine he propounds should be only lightly and
carelessly received, it should speedily be let slip; for to lay up in, or on,
the heart, is the same as to hide deeply in it; although, where the word
"soul"<i> </i>is added, the "heart"<i> </i>refers to the mind, or the
intellectual faculties. In fine, he commands them to have the Law not only
impressed on the mind, but embraced with sincere affection. In the next place,
he commands that aid to the memory which we have just considered, viz., that
they should wear the precepts on the arms and foreheads; as if God should
constantly meet them, to arouse their senses. For (as has been said) God had no
regard to the bands themselves, but would have them seen on their arms and
foreheads for another object, viz., 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f236</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to suggest and renew their care for religion. Again, He appointed them to occupy
the place of ornaments, in order to accustom the people to take their chief
delight in meditating on the Law. Thus that foolish ambition is sufficiently
refuted, when hypocrites sought after a reputation for holiness by their fringes
and other fopperies, as well as that gross error of the whole people, in
thinking that they discharged their duty to God by their outward dress. What
follows afterwards, that the precepts should be written on the gates of their
cities, and on their private houses, tends to the same thing; for we have said,
that since men's minds are prone to vanity, and are easily distracted by
innumerable allurements, they have need of such stays to hold them back. And
this object is plainly expressed, when He commands them severally to speak of
the precepts of the Law, whether they are sitting at home, or going abroad, or
lying down, or rising up; because without diligent exercise, it usually happens
that whatever men have once learnt is soon lost. He adds, also, another effect
of this diligence, viz., that not only should each of them consult their own
individual advantage, but also teach their children, whereby God's Law would
ever be maintained in rigor by perpetual
succession.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">DEUTERONOMY

the very entrance of their land, from which the people might learn that they
dwelt in it, in order that they might worship God purely. Wherefore, lest by the
people's carelessness the knowledge of the Law should be obscured, or in any way
obliterated, God would have its sum inscribed in a conspicuous place. Hence may
be gathered the similarity I have adverted to between the private houses of
individuals and the whole land. When the precepts were written on the doors,
every one was admonished that his house was sacred to God, and the same was the
case with the whole land, so that whosoever entered it might know that it was,
as it were, the sanctuary of heavenly doctrine, and thus their zeal might be
stirred up to the pure worship of God. The object of the plain and distinct

) represented, and constantly kept before their eyes;<i> </i>now He commands
that it should also be recited every seventh year, lest the knowledge of it
should ever depart. But let us follow the order of the words. First of all,
Moses says that "he<i> </i>wrote" the Law. Before this, the doctrines of
religion had only been expressed by word of mouth, for their fathers had handed
down traditionally to their children whatever had been declared to them from
heaven. Thus the religion and faith of the people in Egypt was only founded on
ancient revelations <i>(oraculis) </i>and the traditions of their fathers. But,
forasmuch as nothing is more easy than for men's minds, in their vanity,
speedily to forget true doctrine, and to involve themselves in manifold errors,
God, willing to provide against this evil, consigned the rule of piety to public
records, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f238</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
so that there might be no pretense of ignorance if their posterity should
decline from it. Behold, then, the reason why the Law was written down, that
God's truth might be witnessed in the continued lapse of ages. He does not mean
that the Law was so "delivered" to the Levites, that they should suppress it, or
should be its only keepers; but if he had exhorted them all indifferently to
read it, scarcely any would have applied themselves to its study; for so it is
wont to happen, that individuals neglect what is enjoined generally upon all.
Wherefore the Levites are appointed to be the guardians of the Law
<i>(nomophylaces), </i>to watch diligently, amidst the neglect and contempt of
others, lest the knowledge of God should fail. Nor is there any question that
the Law was therefore entrusted to their hands, that they might be its
interpreters. And to this that passage of Malachi refers,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
2:7,) "For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the Law
at his mouth; for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts." For what is added
immediately afterwards, that they should read over the Law every seventh year,
cannot properly be taken, as if, during the rest of the time, it should remain
hidden among themselves; for God would have them to teach daily, and constantly
to remind the people of their duty. But lest this practice should become
obsolete, either by the aversion of the people or the laziness of the priests,
this solemn rite was added, that every seventh year when the most numerous
assembly of the people took place, the promulgation of the Law should be
renewed. Whence it appears that nothing is too sacred nor too abundantly
fortified by precautions to escape violation and infraction from man's
wickedness; for when the recitation of the Law was thus precisely enjoined<i>
</i>upon the Levites, it was surely astonishing and detestable that it should
be, as it were, discovered in the time of Josiah, and that all were aroused by
its novelty, as if they had never heard of it before.

bishops desired to domineer and tyrannize, they used the artifice of declaring
it unlawful to inquire into the mysteries of Scripture. Hence it was brought
about that they might securely addict themselves to their ridiculous follies,
and that the monks, their emissaries, might vent with impunity whatever fables
came into their heads. But, in fine, the intention of God was that every seventh
year the people should be reminded to meditate diligently on the
law.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>

</i>etc., in the infinitive mood; and although this is sometimes taken for the
imperative, yet, in this passage some improperly translate it "Gather,"<i>
</i>etc., as if Moses commanded them to give these injunctions once only to the
people of their own generation, whereas he is rather continuing with the
foregoing sentence. This verse, then, is connected with what went before, viz.,
that the Law should be promulgated anew, in the years in which they were to hold
their greatest assembly; because the people was then called to the Jubilee by
the sound of the trumpet. The word "gather," therefore, extends to all these
septennial assemblies, of which mention will be elsewhere made. Nor certainly
would what he says of the people that are "within their gates," accord with the
times of Moses, since in those days there were none. Consequently he more fully
explains why he pointed out the seventh year, viz., because the whole people
then came "to appear before God." He specially mentions the "women<i> </i>and
children," lest their age or sex might be an excuse; and this heightens the
villany and dishonesty of those 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f242</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
who would debar not children only, but women also, from religious learning;
since God invites all from the least to the greatest to His school, and would
have them to be His disciples. With respect to "the strangers," we must
understand not those who had come into the land of Canaan on business, and were
soon to return home, but those who had chosen to take up their abode there, and
from their long residence had coalesced into the same body with the Israelites.
The fruit and utility (of this recitation 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f243</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
) is added, that by hearing they might learn to fear God. Whence we infer, that
true religion has its origin in knowledge, and that whatever piety men not
instructed by God's word may appear to have, is mere pretense. "To<i>
</i>observe to do,"<i> </i>is equivalent to applying themselves diligently and
zealously to obey the precepts of the
Law.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>

that their present assembly is not referred to, but that which was to be
repeated every seven years, in order that their posterity might be retained in
the path of duty. Another use, then, of this recitation is adduced; that many
who, from their age, could not be witnesses of the first promulgation, might
thence learn how God was to be served. The possession of the land is again set
before them, that God's bounty may attract them to
obedience.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">DEUTERONOMY

and industry, so would their impiety be the more detestable in neglecting Him,
when He daily set Himself before them in this abundant store of blessing. Let us
learn, therefore, from this passage, that we are invited by God's liberality to
honor Him, and that whenever He deals kindly by us, He places His glory before
our eyes; but, on the other hand, we should remember, that what ought to be as
it were vehicles, to lift up our minds on high, are, by our own fault, converted
into obstacles and clogs, and that therefore we ought to be the more upon our
guard. At the end of verse 12, he reproves their folly by another argument, if
being thus suddenly enriched, they should give way to intemperance; as if he had
said, that their absurdity would be insupportable, if, when uplifted by God's
bounty, they should not remember their origin; for nothing should have served

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou art to pass over Jordan
this day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The whole of this passage
contains an eulogy on the gratuitous liberality of God, whereby He had bound the
people to Himself unto the obedience of the Law. But this (as we have already
seen) ought to have been a most pressing stimulus to incite the people, and
altogether to ravish them to the worship and love of God, to whom they were
under so great obligation. The design of Moses, then, was to shew that the
Israelites, for no merit of their own, but by the signal bounty of God, would be
heirs of the land of Canaan; and that this entirely flowed from the covenant and
their gratuitous adoption; in order that, on their part, they should persevere
in the faithful observation of the covenant, and so should be the more disposed
to honor Him. For it would be too disgraceful that they, whom God had prevented
by His grace, should not meet Him, as it were, by voluntarily submitting to His
dominion. Moreover, lest they should arrogate anything to themselves, he
commends the greatness of God's power, in that they could not be victorious over
so many nations, unless by the miraculous aid of heaven. With this view, he
states that these nations excelled not only in greatness and multitude, but also
in military valor. He adds that their cities were great and impregnable; and,
finally, that in them were the children of the giants, formidable from their
enormous stature. For Anak (as is related in Joshua 15. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f245</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
) was a celebrated giant, whose descendants were called Anakim. And, to take
away all doubt about this, he cites themselves as witnesses, that they were so
terrified by their appearance as to wish to turn back again. We now understand
the object of all these details, viz., that God's glory may shine forth in the
victories and success of the people. The words "whom thou knowest, and of whom
thou hast heard," have reference<i> </i>to the spies; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f246</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for these giants had not yet become openly known to the people; but he transfers
the case of a few to them all, because, by the account the spies had given,
terror had invaded the whole camp, as though they had actually come into
conflict with them. Since, then, they had been persuaded of their inferiority to
their enemies, and utterly disheartened by the report they received, Moses
convicts them on their own evidence, lest, perchance, they might hereafter
assume to themselves the praise which was due to God alone. But we are<i>
</i>taught in these words, that such is the ingratitude of mankind, that they
obscure, as much as they can, God's bounties, and never yield, except when
driven to conviction.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Understand therefore this
day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He concludes from what has
preceded<i> </i>that the Israelites<i> </i>would be too perverse, unless they
acknowledge that their enemies were overcome<i> </i>by the hand of God; and,
still more to heighten the miracle, he uses a similitude, comparing God to a
fire, which consumes so many nations in an unwonted and incredible<i>
</i>manner. It is as if he had said, that it could not be effected by human or
ordinary means that so many and such warlike peoples could thus quickly perish.
Elsewhere God is called "a consuming fire" in a different sense, that we may
fear his wrath and power; but here Moses only means that the destruction of the
Canaanitish nations was His wonderful
work.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Speak not thou in thine
heart.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now more plainly warns the
people not to exalt themselves in proud and foolish boasting. If they had not
been naturally so depraved and malignant, it would have been sufficient to point
out God's grace in a single word; but he could not induce them to gratitude
except by correcting and destroying their pride. He therefore takes away this
stumblingblock, in order that God's generosity might be conspicuous among them.
"To<i> </i>speak in the heart" is equivalent to reflecting or conceiving an
opinion. Wherefore Moses not only reproves the boasting of the lips, but that
hidden arrogance, wherewith men are puffed up, when they take to themselves the
praise which is due to God. Moreover, he not only prohibits them from ascribing
it to their own valor, that they had routed their enemies, and gained possession
of the land, but also from imagining that this was the just recompense of their
merits. For God is not less defrauded of His glory when men oppose their
righteousness to His liberality, than when they boast that whatever blessings
they have are obtained by their own industry. To make this more 'clear, I will
repeat it. Moses does not forbid the people from thinking that they had
themselves acquired the land without God's aid; nay, he takes it for granted
that they themselves will acknowledge that it was by God's help that they were
victorious; but he is not contented with this limited gratitude unless they at
the same time acknowledge that they had deserved nothing of the kind, and
therefore that it was a mere and gratuitous act of His bounty. The reason given
in the second clause does not appear sufficiently 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f247</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
conclusive, viz., that the nations were driven out on account of their own
wickedness; for it might have been that what God took away from these wicked
reprobates He transferred to those who were more worthy; but. it appears to be
an indirect admonition, that the Israelites should compare themselves with these
nations; because it was evidently to be gathered by them from thence, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f248</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that they had not acquired this foreign land, from which the former inhabitants
had been ejected, by their own righteousness. And this is still more clearly
expressed in the two next
verses.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not for thy
righteousness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>First of all, he would
have the punishment inflicted upon these nations awaken the Israelites to fear,
and thus that they should attribute nothing to themselves; because it was God's
design not to reward their merits, but to shew the severity of His judgment.
Secondly, he confirms this by two arguments; viz., because God thus had
performed what He promised Abraham; (which promise, as has been already seen,
was founded on mere grace;) and, again, because the people itself was naturally
perverse and rebellious. Hence, it sufficiently appears that there was no room
for merits, since by them God's covenant would have been nullified, nor, if
there were, could any such be found in so depraved and contumacious a nation.
And besides, God had made His covenant with Abraham almost four centuries before
they were born. Hence it follows that this benefit proceeded from some other
source. But he still further represses their pride, by reproaching them with
being "stiff-necked;" for it would have been too absurd to imagine that God,
whom they had not ceased to provoke with their sins, was under obligation to
them, as if they had duly discharged their duty. This metaphor is taken from
oxen, which are useless until they are accustomed to bend their necks; it is
then the same as saying that they were not only unsubmissive, but that in their
obstinacy they shook off the yoke. By his impressing on them, for the third
time, that the Israelites had not deserved the land by their righteousness, we
learn that nothing is more difficult than for men to strip themselves of their
blind arrogance, whereby they detract some portion of the praise from God's
mercies. Now, if in regard to an earthly inheritance God so greatly exalts His
mercy, what must we think of the heavenly inheritance? 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f249</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He would have it attributed to Himself alone, that the children of Israel
possess the land of Canaan; how much less, then, will He tolerate the obtrusion
of men's merits in order to the acquisition of heaven? Nor is there anything in
the pretense of the Papists that they attribute the first place to God's bounty;
because He claims altogether for Himself what they would share with Him. But if
any object that this was only said to His ancient people, I reply, that we are
no better than they. Let each retire into himself, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f250</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and he will not excuse the hardness of his neck. But they who are regenerated by
God's Spirit, know that they are not naturally formed unto obedience; and thus
that it is only mercy which makes them to differ from the worst of
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">DEUTERONOMY

</i></font><font face="Palatino">That he may the more easily persuade his
countrymen that nothing is better, or more desirable for them than to devote
themselves to God's service, Moses reminds them that they have nothing to boast
of out of Him; as if he had said, that they were happy in this one respect, that
God had taken them under His charge; but that if this glory were to be taken
away, they would be miserable and ruined. For God is called "the<i> </i>praise"
of His people, as being their honor and their ornament. Consequently, if they
desire to enjoy true and solid blessedness, they must take care to keep
themselves under His guardianship; for, if they should be deprived of this,
nothing would remain to them but ignominy and shame. To the same effect, he
adds, that He is their God; because nothing can be more perverse and absurd than
not to receive the Creator of the world Himself, when He freely offers Himself
as our God. In proof of this, he subjoins, that He has exerted His power in many
miracles for His people's safety; and, in order that they might be rendered the
more inexcusable, he cites their own eyes as witnesses of so many mighty acts
which had been wrought in their favor. Thence he goes a step higher, (reminding

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore thou shalt love the

scope, that the people should testify their gratitude by their obedience, and
thus being allured by God's bounties, should reverently embrace His Law. On this
account also, he requires them to love God, before he exhorts them to obey the
Law itself. For, although he might have imperiously and menacingly commanded
them, he preferred to lead them gently to obedience, by setting before them the
sweetness of His grace. In sum, he exhorts them that, being invited by God's
love, they should love him in return. Meanwhile, it is well to observe that free
affection is the foundation and beginning of duly obeying the Law, for what is
drawn forth by constraint, or servile fear, cannot please God. He designates the
precepts of the Law by various names, in order that they may zealously and
attentively apply themselves to listen to God, who has omitted nothing
calculated to regulate their life; for, by this variety of words, he signifies
that God had familiarly and perfectly taught whatever was required. As to the
three latter words, "his statutes, and judgments, and commandments,"<i> </i>what
I have observed in Genesis and in the Psalms may be referred to. The word

spoken in commendation of the Law on this ground, that it fences in our life, as
it were, with rails, lest it should be exposed to errors on the right hand and
on the left,. At the end of the verse he exhorts them to perseverance, because
it was not allowable for the recollection<i> </i>of their deliverance ever to
cease.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And know ye this
day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He again confirms the preceding sentence;
because they<i> </i>had been more than sufficiently taught by the illustrious
acts of God, how great was His power and how remarkable His mercy toward
themselves. Two meanings may be given to the words; for some connect them thus,
"Know<i> </i>ye this day the chastisement of the Lord," and include in a
parenthesis the clause, "for I speak not with your children, which have not
known, and have not seen;"<i> </i>but others read the word of exhortation "know
ye" separately, and 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f254</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
without any connection. The latter view pleases me best; although it little
affects the substance of the matter which exposition we follow. For Moses
admonishes them, that, if they only pay attention to the works of God, His
glory, which may instruct them to fear Him, may be clearly beheld in them. In
order, however, to urge them more vehemently, he adds, that he does not speak to
posterity, to which the fame of these miracles would reach, but that he
addresses eye-witnesses, who need no proof of them, having been assured of them
by certain experience. He celebrates in many expressions of eulogy these
miracles, whereby God had testified to them His power and goodness, lest they
should lightly pass by what was worthy of their most earnest attention, and
constant meditation. I forbear now to speak of other points, which I have
elsewhere commented on. The word

musar, </i>which stands first, is general, and extends to all the specific terms
that follow; some, therefore, improperly render it "chastisement." Where it is
said at the end of verse 4, that the Egyptians were "destroyed<i> </i>unto that

destroyed them, were felt as if still

their proper place in the regular course of the history, from which my method of
teaching has compelled me to wander a little. For Moses, to heighten the
authority of the Law, sets before them compendiously the circumstances which had
occurred in the desert, partly in order that God's judgments might alarm them by
their severity, and partly that His mercies might draw their minds towards Him
by their graciousness. Finally, he concludes by saying that he does not speak of
unknown things, but that he merely recalled to their recollection the works of
God whereof they had been themselves

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All the
commandments.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although the first verse
might have been included among the promises, whereby, as we shall hereafter see,
the Law was ratified by Moses, because he here exhorts and incites the
Israelites to obedience by proposing to them the hope of reward; still it
appeared to<i> </i>me that I might conveniently insert it here, since the design
of Moses was simply this, to attract them by the sweetness of the promised
inheritance to receive the doctrines of the Law. This sentence, then, may be
justly counted among those whereby their minds were prepared to submit
themselves to God with the gentleness and docility that became them; as though
he had said, because the land of Canaan is now not far from you, its very
nearness ought to encourage you to take upon you God's yoke more cheerfully; for
the same God, who this day declares to you His law, invites you to the enjoyment
of that land, which He promised with an oath to your fathers. And certainly it
is evident from this latter clause of the verse, that Moses did not simply
promise them a reward if they should keep the law; but rather set before them
the previous favor, wherewith God had gratuitously prevented them, in order that
they might, on their part, shew themselves grateful for it Moses calls the
commandments <i>his, </i>not (as we have already seen) because he had invented
them himself, but because he faithfully handed them down from the dictation of
God's own mouth. And this we may also more fully gather from the following
verse, wherein he recounts the mercies of the time past, and at the same time
calls to their recollection by how many proofs God had instructed them, to form
and accustom them to obedience. In the first place, he bids them remember
generally the dealings of God, which they had seen for forty years, and then
descends to particulars, viz., that God had proved them by afflictions, "to know
what was in their heart;" for thus may the expressions be paraphrased, "to<i>
</i>humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart;" in which
words he admonishes them, that they were painfully tried by many troubles and
difficulties not without very good reason, viz., because they had need of such
trial. Yet, at the same time, he indirectly reproves their obstinacy, which was
then detected; since otherwise, if all things had gone prosperously with them,
it would have been easy for them to pretend great fear of God, though, as was
actually discovered, it did not really
exist.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he humbled thee, and
suffered thee to hunger.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Inasmuch as
they were sometimes made to suffer hunger in the wilderness, he proves the
advantage of this discipline, because they thus learnt that the human race does
not live by bread and wine alone, but by the secret power of God. For though all
confess that it is through God's goodness that the earth is fruitful, still
their senses are so tied to the meat and drink, that they rise no higher, and do
not acknowledge God as their Father and nourisher, but rather bind Him down to
the outward means to which they are attached, as if His hand, of itself, and
without instruments, could not effect or supply anything. Their perception,
therefore, that the fruits of the earth are produced by God, is but a cold
notion, which speedily vanishes, and does not cling to their memory. The power
of God, as well as His goodness, is indeed abundantly manifested in the use of
His creatures, which we naturally enjoy; but the depravity of the human mind
causes that the testimonies of it act like a veil to obscure that bright light.
Besides, the majority of mankind think of God as if banished afar off, and
dwelling in inactivity as if He had resigned His office in heaven and earth; and
hence it arises, that trusting in their present abundance, they implore not His
favor, nay, that they pass it by as needless; and, when deprived of their
accustomed supplies, they altogether despair, as if God's hand alone were
insufficient for their succor. Since, then, men do not sufficiently profit by
the guidance and instruction of nature, but rather are blinded in their view of
God's works, it was desirable that in this miracle (of the manna) a standing and
manifest proof should be given, that men do not only live upon God's bounty,
when they eat bread and drink wine, but even when all supplies fail them.
Although there be some harshness in the words, yet the sense is clear, that
men's life consists not in their food, but that God's inspiration suffices for
their nourishment. And we must remember, that the eternal life of the soul is
not here referred to, but that we are simply and solely taught that although
bread and wine fail, our bodies may be sustained and invigorated by God's will
alone. Let it then be regarded as settled, that this is improperly, however
acutely, referred to the spiritual life, and a relation imagined in its doctrine
to faith; as if the grace, which is offered in the promises, and received by
faith, gave life to our souls; since it is simply stated, that the animating
principle <i>(vigor), </i>which is diffused by the spirit of God for sustenance,
proceeds out of His mouth. In
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A430&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
104:30, there is an exact repetition of what was before said here by Moses,
"Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of
the earth." The word translated "not<i> </i>only," seems to have been expressly
added, lest, if Moses had altogether excluded the bread which is destined for
our food, he should not do justice to God. Thus, then, does he guard his words,
as much as to say, that although bread sustains man's life, still this support
would be too weak, unless the hidden power of God occupied the first place; and
that this intrinsic virtue, as it is called, which He of Himself inspires, would
suffice, even although all other aids should fail. And this doctrine, first of
all, arouses us to gratitude, referring to God Himself whatever by His creatures
He supplies to us for the nourishment and preservation of our lives, whilst it
teaches us that although all the instruments of this world should fail, still we
may hope for life from Himself alone. There is no ordinary wisdom in
recollecting both these points. Christ admirably applied this passage to its
true and genuine practical use; for when the devil would persuade him to command
the stones to be made bread for the satisfaction of His hunger, He answered,
"Man shall not live by bread alone," etc.,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
4:4,) as if he had said, There is in God's hands another remedy, for even
although He supply not food, He is still able to keep men in life by His will
alone. But I touch upon this the more briefly, because I have more fully treated
it in my Commentaries on "the Harmony of the Gospels."

With the same object he adds, that their raiment was not worn out in so long a
time, and that their shoes remained whole; viz., that they might be fully
convinced, that whatever concerns the preservation of human life and man's daily
wants is so entirely in God's hands, that not only its enjoyment, but even its
continuance and being, depend upon His
blessing.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>

<i>yasar, </i>is taken by some in too restricted a sense for "to chastise,"
whereas it comprehends the whole process of a proper education; as if he had
said, that unless they were hereafter submissive, and disposed to be dutiful,
they would be something more than intractable, since they had been duly taught
and kept under the best discipline, and that God had omitted nothing which could
be required from the father of a family. Hence it follows, that long ago, and by
much instruction, they were accustomed to embrace the teaching of the Law, just
as it becomes children to be obedient to their father's voice. And this he
explains more clearly in the next verse; again concluding, that therefore they
were to observe the Law, and to walk in the commandments of God. Whereon also we
may shortly observe, that the fear of God, as I have already stated elsewhere,
is the foundation of due obedience to the Law. The passage which I have
interwoven from Deuteronomy 11 may also be counted among the promises, for God
allures in it His people to obedience<i> </i>by the hope of His blessing; and
since the possession of the land, which was then in sight, is set before them,
the words appeared to me to fit in not badly here; because God had no other
intention in this eulogium of it, but to prepare the minds of the people for
keeping the

referred to the preface of the Law, since its tendency is to recommend it, and
to instruct and prepare the people's minds to be teachable. It takes its
commencement from the divine blessings, which they had experienced as well in
their exodus as in their forty years' wanderings; for it would have been the
height of baseness and ingratitude not to devote themselves to a Deliverer who
had dealt so graciously with them. And surely it was an inestimable sign of His
paternal love towards them, that He should have arrayed Himself against so
very<i> </i>powerful a king for His servants' sake. Finally, lest there should
be any question as to their deliverance<i>, </i>he enlarges upon the power which
God displayed therein, in magnificent terms of praise according with its
dignity.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet the Lord hath not
given.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By reproaching them with their
past stupidity, he stirs up their desire for a better understanding, as if he
had said, that they had been too long indifferent to so many miracles, and
therefore they should no longer delay to rouse themselves, etc., to give greater
heed to God; not because they had been so senseless that His acts had altogether
escaped their notice, but because all acknowledgment of them had immediately
come to an end. For, just as the drunken man, or one suffering from lethargy,
when he hears a cry, raises his head for a moment, and opens his eyes, and then
relapses into a state of torpor, so the people had never seriously applied their
minds to consider God's works; and when they had been aroused by some miracle,
had immediately sunk back into forgetfulness, wherefore there is good cause why
Moses should seek to awaken them from their dulness and stupidity by various
methods. But he does not merely condemn their senselessness, and blindness, and
deafness, but declares that they were thus senseless, and blind, and deaf,
because they were not inspired with grace from above to profit duly by so many
lessons. Thence we learn that a clear and powerful understanding is a special
gift of the Spirit, since men are ever blind even in the brightest light, until
they have been enlightened by God. What Moses relates of the Israelites, is
unquestionably common to us all. He declares, then, that they were not induced
by the conspicuous glory of God to fear and worship Him, because He had not
given them either mind, or eyes, or ears. It is true that at man's creation He
had naturally bestowed upon him a mind, and ears, and eyes; but Moses means,
that whatever innate light we have, is either hidden or lost, so that, as far as
regards the highest point of wisdom, all our senses lie useless. True that in
nature's corruption, <i>the light </i>still <i>shineth in darkness, </i>but it
is light which is soon obscured; therefore, the entire understanding and faculty
of reason, in which men glory and pique themselves, is nought but smoke and
darkness. Well then may David ask that his eyes may be opened to behold the
secrets of the Law.

which He had continually visited His people during the course of forty years.
Yet he does not recount them all, but contents himself with a few of the most
remarkable instances, viz., that their clothes had not been worn out by age, and
that they had been fed from heaven, when no sustenance was to be obtained from
the fruits of the earth. He reminds them that God's glory had been manifested by
these testimonies, in order that they might submit themselves to His
rule.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>

impede their passage, and thus had already begun to bring them into a place of
rest. For inasmuch as the two tribes and a half had here chosen their home, they
might behold as in a mirror that the possession of the promised land awaited
them. Hence, then, Moses concludes that they were under obligation to keep the

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the Lord thy
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We may shortly sum up the words and
the matter. He almost sets before their eyes a habitation full of wealth and
various advantages, in order that they there may worship God more cheerfully,
and study to repay by their gratitude so signal a benefit. In chapter 8 he
commends the goodness of the land, because it is watered by the streams which
flow through its valleys and mountains, and because it produces all kinds of
fruits to supply them with nourishment; and not only so, but because it contains
also mines of iron and brass. In chapter 11 he expresses the same thing more
plainly and in greater detail, by the addition of a comparison with the land of
Egypt; the fruitfulness of which, although it is marvellous from the yearly
inundation of the Nile, and is renowned as an extraordinary miracle, yet
requires much labor and cultivation, since it is irrigated by means of drains by
the hand and industry of men. But the land of Canaan depends on God's blessing,
and waits for the rain from heaven. Moreover Moses extols in glowing words the
peculiar privilege of the land, saying, that it is ever looked upon by God, in
order that, on their part, the Israelites might attentively, and constantly
also, look to Him. For this is the force of the words, "always, from the
beginning of the year, even unto the end of the year;" as if he had said, that
they would be ungrateful to God, unless they constantly and zealously directed
their regards to Him, since He never ceased daily to look on them. It is true,
indeed, that there is no corner of the earth which does not experience God's
blessing, witness the fact that the Nile fertilizes the whole of Egypt; but,
because that only happens once a year, and since its waters are conducted hither
and thither by drains artificially made by man, Moses, therefore, not improperly
makes it the ground of his exhortation that they should constantly give
themselves to meditation on the Law; for not only at a particular season of the
year, but almost at every moment, their necessity would compel them to ask for
God's aid, when they saw that the land was ever requiring from Him the remedy of
its dryness. The question however arises, how Moses could declare in such
magnificent terms the richness of the land of Canaan, when now-a-days it is
scarcely counted among those that are fertile; and thus 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f261</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the ungodly wantonly deride him, since all whom business or any other cause have
taken there contradict his encomiums. Yet I do not doubt that it was always
distinguished by the abundance of its various fruits, as we shall presently see
in its proper place, where its fertility was proved by the bunch of grapes; but,
at the same time, it is to be observed that its abundance was increased in a new
and unwonted manner by the arrival of the people, that God might shew that He
had blessed that country above all others for the liberal supply of His
children. As long, therefore, as that land was granted as the inheritance of the
race of Abraham, it was remarkable for that fertility which God had promised by
Moses. But now, so far from wondering that it is to a great extent desert and
barren, we ought rather to be surprised that some small vestiges of its ancient
fruitfulness exist; since what God Himself had so often threatened against it
must needs be fulfilled. The barrenness, therefore, of the land as it now
appears, instead of derogating from the testimony of Moses, rather gives ocular
demonstration of the judgment of God, which, as we shall see elsewhere, was
denounced against it. In sum, as God for His people's sake still further
enriched a land already fruitful, so, for the punishment of the sins of this
same people, He sowed it with salt, that it might afford a sad spectacle of His
curse.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When thou hast eaten and art

that they would be too senseless, unless God's great bounty should attract them
to obedience, since nothing is more unreasonable, than, when we have eaten and
are full, not to acknowledge from whence our food has come. Fitly, then, does
Moses require gratitude from the people, when they shall enjoy both the land
promised to them and an abundance of all good
things.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">Deuteronomy

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now these are the
commandments.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In these three verses he
repeats what we have already seen in many previous passages; since God deals so
liberally with the Israelites, they would be too perverse, unless such great
kindness should allure them to love the law. We must remember too what I have
already touched on, that, although I have postponed to another place the
promises, whereby Moses urged the people to endeavor to keep the Law, still I
have designedly put before my exposition of the Law those passages, in which, by
setting the promised land as it were before the people's eyes, he prepares their
minds for submission, and renders the rule of so bountiful a Father pleasant and
delightful. Since, then, they were appointed to inherit the land, Moses, when he
invites them to its enjoyment, commands them gladly to embrace the doctrine, for
the sake of which they were adopted; and to devote themselves, on their side, to
obedience to God, by whose gratuitous goodness they had been prevented. As in
chapters 8 and 11 he praised the richness of the land, so does he now confirm
the same statement; or rather afterwards more fully explains what he slightly
touches upon here. They all agree in this, that the happy state of life which
was before their eyes ought to awaken the people's gratitude, lest such notable
beneficence should be expended on them in vain. Moses therefore declares, that
he had presented to them laws and statutes, by which they might be instructed in
the fear of God; at the same time, he reminds them how base in them it would be
not to be ravished to the love of God and of His law by the delightfulness and
abundance of the land. I pass over what I have already explained, viz., that he
taught nothing of himself, but was the faithful interpreter of God; and also
that he commands the doctrine to be handed down to their posterity, so that it
may never be lost. Whence it appears how difficult it is for men to be duly
prepared for keeping the law, since God does not in vain so often stimulate
their indolence; for there is a silent reproof conveyed either of their
indolence or instability, when God does not cease to insist on what it would
have been sufficient to have pointed out in a single word. We must also remark
the definition of righteousness, that they should <i>do what is right in the
sight of the Lord; </i>in opposition to the reason and judgment of the
flesh.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">Deuteronomy

We may easily estimable the necessity of this admonition from the common
corruption of human nature, which is even yet only too general and too
influential; for scarcely shall we find one person in a hundred in whom satiety
does not generate headiness. Moses will hereafter speak in his Song of the

<div><font face="Palatino">It was needful, then, that a restraint should be put
on such refractory beings, nay, that they should have their wantonness still
more tightly repressed in their prosperity. But we may, and it is well to,
extend this doctrine to ourselves also, since prosperity intoxicates almost all
of us, so that we intemperately grow wanton against God, and forget ourselves
and Him. Therefore Moses not only commands the Israelites not to be ungrateful
to God, but warns them to <i>guard </i>themselves (for he uses this word for to
<i>beware) </i>from that impious ingratitude. He immediately after uses this
same word for the keeping of the Law. But this is the sum, that they needed the
utmost care and attention to beware lest forgetfulness of God should steal over
them in happy circumstances, and thus they should shake off His fear, and cast
away His yoke, and indulge themselves in the lusts of their flesh. For he shews
that contempt of the Law would be a token of ingratitude; because it could not
be but that they would submit themselves to God, and keep His Law, if they only
reflected that it was to nothing but His blessing that they owed their
prosperity. We have already observed elsewhere that his designation of the Law
by various terms amounts to a commendation of its perfect doctrine; as much as
to say, that no part of right conduct is omitted in it. He also asserts here (as
often elsewhere) the faithfulness of his ministry, lest they should shufflingly
contend that, whilst they refuse the commands of a mortal man, they are not
therefore rebellious against God. He says, then, that their piety will not be
acceptable to God, unless they keep the Law propounded by
Him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest when thou hast eaten and art
full. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He more fully explains what we have
already observed, viz., that it might happen, in the gradual course of time,
that they should fail in their fear of God and honor for His Law, and therefore
should take the greater care lest continual peace and joy should bring this
callousness upon them. We should diligently remark the cause of departure which
he points out, viz., the pride whereby riches and abundance ordinarily puff up
men's minds. The examples of moderation in prosperity are rare; rather, as soon
as men perceive themselves to be in a flourishing estate, they begin to swell
with arrogance, and so admire their exaltation that they despise even God
Himself. On this ground Paul charges</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"the<i> </i>rich in this
world that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540617&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Timothy 6:17.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We ought., indeed, the more kindly we are dealt with
by God, to submit ourselves the more meekly to His rule; but, as I have said,
the depravity of our nature hurries us quite the other way, so that we grow
insolent under God's indulgence, which should bend us to submission. And if this
does not happen immediately, yet whenever prosperity flows on uninterruptedly,
its delights gradually corrupt even the best of us, so that they at last
degenerate from themselves. If, then, we desire to steer a straight course, we
ought to strive after the healing of this most deadly disease of pride. Again,
since by the wiles of Satan continued prosperity softens and ensnares us, let us
learn to beware not only for a day, but to keep watch through the whole course
of our lives. Moses wisely anticipates their pride by recalling to the
Israelites' recollection what was their original condition. For whence does it
arise that those who seem to themselves and others to be happy in the world are
puffed up with self-confidence and pride, except because they reflect not on
their origin, but despise all but themselves, just as if they had come down from
the clouds? For there are few like Codrus, who, after gaining a kingdom, always
ingenuously confessed that his father had been a potter. God here presents a
remedy to this vice, (which reigns too extensively,) by representing to the
Israelites their former state, and commanding them to reflect that they were
rescued from it by His especial blessing. Nothing but the recollection of their
deliverance could tame their arrogance; for what could be more unreasonable than
that <i>they </i>should be insolent who were formerly the slaves of a most
haughty nation, and who had not acquired their liberty by their own efforts, but
contrary to their hope and deserts had obtained it by God's mere favor, who then
had wandered in exile through the wilderness, and at length, under God's
guidance, had entered the land promised them? In a word, God deals with them
just as if one should reproach<i> </i>a man (who, having become suddenly rich,
bore himself intemperately) with his former beggary and want. Moreover, since
they were too slow of heart to receive<i> </i>this admonition promptly and
cheerfully, Moses enlarges on the Divine benefits which they had experienced in
the wilderness. For this was incredible, that this mixed multitude of men, and
women, and children, and slaves should have lived so many years, not only
amongst wild beasts, but amongst scorpions and vipers, and all that is most
venomous in the serpent tribe. God's goodness shone forth, too, still more
brightly in that sudden miracle whereby He supplied water to them in their
thirst from what was before an and rock.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f264</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But since he reminds them in the next verse how they had manna for their bread
or food, I will join these two things
together.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who fed thee in the
wilderness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He had said that water was
brought forth from the rock of flint when the people were suffering from thirst;
now, he adds that they had manna instead of bread; as if he had said that when
meat and drink failed them they must have perished of want unless God had
preternaturally given them both, causing the hard rock to flow down in water,
and sending bread from heaven. Moreover he repeats what he had said before, that
the people were afflicted with this need as a trial of their faith and patience;
yet in this trial both their incredulity and intemperance<i> </i>were
discovered, whilst God's goodness and power were eventually more clearly
displayed, since He pardoned their ingratitude, and, notwithstanding it, aided
their necessity. For if they had not suffered from hunger, God's bounty in
supplying them with their daily food would have been neglectfully received. This
is the meaning of the conclusion, "to<i> </i>do thee good at thy latter end."<i>
</i>From which words let us also learn that we are often deprived of our
necessary supplies, in order that our senses may awaken to acknowledge God's aid
which appears in our extremity. For whilst abundance covers our eyes with a
veil, or dims their sight, so, on the other hand, deprivation and want purge and
remove this dimness that we may more clearly perceive the benefits afforded us
by God.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou say in, thy
heart.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He describes that kind of pride
of which we have lately spoken, viz., when men attribute to their own industry,
or labor, or foresight, what they ought to refer to the blessing of God. It has
indeed been said, that our hearts are uplifted in other ways also; but this is
the principal ground of pride, to assume and assign to ourselves what belongs to
God. For nothing so greatly confines us within the boundaries of humility and
modesty as the acknowledgment of God's grace; for it is madness and temerity to
raise our crests against Him on whom we depend, and to whom we owe ourselves and
all we possess. Rightly, then, does Moses reprove the pride of the human heart
which arises from forgetfulness of God, if they think that they have gained by
their own exertions <i>(marte suo) </i>what God has given them of His own
pleasure, in order to lay them under obligation to Himself. "To say in the
heart," is a Hebraism for thinking in one's self, or reflecting in one's self.
He does not, therefore, only require the outward expression of the lips, whereby
men profess that they are grateful to God's bounty, (for in this there is often
nothing more than hypocrisy and vanity;) but he would have them seriously
persuaded that whatever they possess is derived from His sheer beneficence. He
has already said, that although when they entered the land they would be fed
with bread and other foods, still the manna wherewith God had supported them in
the wilderness would be a perpetual proof that man is not sustained by bread
only, but by the secret virtue of God, which inspires the principle of life.
Another lesson is now added, viz., that because God formerly fed and clothed
them gratuitously, and without any act of their own, they thence are taught
that, even whilst they strenuously labor and strive, whatever they acquire is
not so much the reward of their own industry as the fruit of God's blessing. For
he not only affirms that at their first entrance into the land they were
enriched, because God dealt with them liberally, but He extends this to the
whole course of human life, that men obtain nothing by their own vigilance and
diligence, except in so far as God blesses them from above. And this he more
fully explains immediately afterwards, where he commands them to remember
therefore that "it is God who giveth them power,"<i> </i>etc. For although God
would not have us slumber in inactivity, yet what Paul says of the preaching of
the Gospel, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f265</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
holds good also in the most trifling matters, viz., that "neither is he that
planteth anything, neither he that watereth," but all things are in the power of
God, by whose only influence it is that the earth brings forth fruit.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460307&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 3:7.) We must then recollect that although God reproves man's
slothfulness, and punishes it with want and hunger, still they who are active in
labor do not get wealth by their own diligence, but by the blessing of God
alone. On this doctrine the prayer which Christ dictated to us is founded, in
which we ask to have our daily bread given us. But although this relates alike
to all mankind, yet Moses appropriates it especially to God's chosen people, in
whom God's blessing shines forth most brightly, and at the same time admonishes
them that the fact of His supplying them with food depends on the covenant
whereby He adopted the race of Abraham to
Himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">Exodus

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I send an Angel before
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God here reminds the Israelites
that their wellbeing is so connected with the keeping of the Law, that, by
neglecting it, they would sorely suffer. For He says that He will be their
leader by the hand of an angel, which was a token of His fatherly love for them;
but, on the other hand, He threatens that they would not be unpunished if they
should despise such great mercy and follow their own lusts, because they will
not escape the sight of the angel whom He had appointed to be their guardian.
Almost all the Hebrew rabbins, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f266</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
with whom many others agree, too hastily think that this is spoken of Joshua,
but the statements, which we shall consider more fully just beyond, by no means
are reconcilable with his person. But their mistake is more than sufficiently
refuted by this, first of all, that if we understand it of Joshua, the people
would have been without the angel as their leader as long as they wandered in
the desert; and, besides, it was afterwards said to Moses, "Mine Angel shall go
before <i>thee,"
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;023234&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
32:34;) and again, "And<i> </i>I will send an Angel before thee,"<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;023302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
33:2.) Moses, too, elsewhere enlarges on this act of God's goodness, that He
should have led forth His people by the hand of an angel.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;042016&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
20:16.) But what need is there of a long discussion, since already mention has
been so often made of the angel of their deliverance? This point ought now to be
deemed established, that there is no reference here to a mortal man; and what we
have already said should be remembered, that no common angel is designated, but
the chief of all angels, who has always been also the Head of the Church. In
which matter the authority of Paul should be sufficient for us, when he
admonishes the Corinthians not to tempt Christ as their fathers tempted Him in
the desert.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461009&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:9.) We gather this, too, from the magnificent attribute which
Moses immediately afterwards assigns to Him, that "the<i> </i>name of God should
be in him."<i> </i>I deem this to be of great importance, although it is
generally passed over lightly. But let us consider it particularly. When God
declares that He will send His angel "to keep them in the way," He makes a
demand upon them for their willing obedience, for it would be too base of them
to set at nought, or to forget Him whose paternal care towards them they
experience. But in the next verse, He seeks by terror to arouse them from their
listlessness, where He commands them to beware of His presence, since He would
take vengeance on their transgressions;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f267</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
wherein, also, there is a delicate allusion to be observed in the ambiguous
meaning of the word employed. For, since
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rm&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shamar, </i>in Hebrew signifies "to<i> </i>guard," after He has said that an
angel shall be their guardian, He warns them, on the other hand, that they
should guard themselves. Herein the Angel is exalted above the rank of a human
being, since He is appointed to be their judge, if the Israelites should offend
in any respect; not in the way that judgment is deputed to the Prophets with
reference to their doctrine, the power of which is supreme, but because nothing
shall be hidden from Him. For Scripture assigns to God alone as His peculiar
attribute, that we should walk<i> </i>before His face. What follows is to the
same effect, "provoke him not," which is everywhere spoken<i> </i>of God. But,
as I have just said, this seems to me to be of most importance, that the name of
God was to be in Him, or in the midst of Him, which is equivalent to this, that
in Him shall reside my majesty and glory; and, therefore, He shall possess both
the knowledge of hearts, as well as dominion, and the power of judgment.
Besides, we have already said that there is no absurdity in designating Christ
by the name of the Angel, because He was not yet the Incarnate Mediator, but as
often as He appeared to the ancient people He gave an indication of His future
mission.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if thou shalt indeed
obey.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He moderates the terror with which
He had inspired them for two reasons, &#8212; <i>first, </i>that He may rather
gently attract them than force them by the fear of punishment; <i>secondly,
</i>lest, if they imagine that the Angel is formidable to them, the anxiety
conceived in their minds should deaden their perception of His mercy and layout.
Now, although I postpone to another place the promises whereby their obedience
to the Law was confirmed, I have thought it right to include this among the
exhortations or eulogiums whereby the dignity of the Law is enhanced, because it
relates to the time past, for thus is the expression to be paraphrased, "Take<i>
</i>heed that ye respond to God who deals so liberally with you. The promises
which He made to your fathers as to the inheritance of the land, He is now ready
to perform, unless your iniquity should stand in the way. Make room, then, for
His grace, that, by the hand of the Angel, He may lead you into His rest." In
order to stimulate them still more, He points out to them their need of His aid,
as though He had said that nothing, could be more miserable than their case,
unless they were protected from so many enemies by His defense, for He
enumerates several most important nations to which they would be by no means a
match unless they should fight under the guidance of the Angel. He says,
therefore, that if they only obey His Law,<i> </i>there is no occasion for them
to be afraid, for that He will destroy by His own power alone all that shall
rise against them to resist them.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye shall serve the Lord your
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is true that this promise is
very similar to others, to which I have assigned a peculiar place, but it has
this difference, that, in inviting the people to be zealous in keeping the Law,
it sets before their eyes the effect of the covenant already made with their
fathers, in order that they may more cheerfully receive the Law. Therefore there
was good reason for my saying just before that the promises which refer to the
past have their appropriate place here, where their minds are prepared to obey
God and keep His Law, because the race of Abraham God had chosen to Himself,
that tie may continually visit them with His favor. He therefore promises them
His blessing on their bread and water and bodily health, for on these three
things depend the condition of our present life. Two other things He adds
&#8212; fecundity in generation, and length of days. The sum is, that they had
been prevented by God's loving-kindness, in order that they might willingly
honor Him, and that now all He had promised them was close at hand, if only they
responded to His grace. But, although the fertility of the land was great, and
its productions various and abundant, no mention is here made, as in other
places, of wine or oil, but only of simple food, as if He had said that the
necessary supports of life should not be wanting to
them.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will send my fear before
thee. </i></font><font face="Palatino">It is very clear from these words that
God's fatherly love towards the people is magnified, to prepare their minds to
submit themselves to the yoke of the Law. Therefore their reward, if they should
keep the Law, is not so much set before them here, as shame is denounced upon
them if they<i> </i>should be ungrateful to God their deliverer, who was soon
after about to give them the enjoyment of the promised land. Moreover, God is
said to sent forth His fear, when by His secret inspiration He depresses men's
hearts. Whence we gather that fear, as well as courage, is in His hand. Of this
no doubtful examples exist in every history, if only God obtained His due rights
amongst men. It will often happen that the courage of brave men gives way to
alarm, and on the other hand, that the timid and cowardly awake to sudden
bravery. Where the cause is not discovered, the profane have recourse to the
hidden dominion of fortune to account for it, or imagine that men's minds have
been stupified by Pan or the Satyrs. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f268</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Let us however learn, that it is in God's power to bend men's hearts either way,
so as both to cast down the courageous with terror, as well as to animate the
timid. From this passage what we read in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;194402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
44:2, 3, is taken, &#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Thou
didst drive out the heathen with thine hand, and plantedst them, <i>(our
fathers.) </i>For they got not the land in possession by their own sword,
neither did their own arm save them,"
etc.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moreover, Rahab, who was both a harlot and
belonged to an unbelieving nation, still acknowledged this, when she said to the
spies,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"our hearts did melt; for
the Lord your God is God in heaven above, and in the earth beneath."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;060211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Joshua
2:11.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">She does not, indeed, express what we have here, that
they were smitten from heaven with internal fear, but only says that their
terror came from a sense of God's power; still she admits that it is no human
cause which makes them thus to tremble. Moses ascends higher, that God puts to
flight or routs their enemies not only by setting before them external objects
of terror, but that He works also inwardly in their hearts, that they may fly in
confusion and alarm; as it follows in the end of the verse, "I will make them
turn their backs," as much as to say, that He would cause them immediately to
retreat, and not even to sustain the sight of the
people.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will send
hornets.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although that secret terror, of
which He had made mention, would be sufficient to put their enemies to flight,
He states that there would also be other ready means, to rout them without any
danger, or much difficulty to His people. Yet He does not threaten to send great
and powerful warriors, but only insects and hornets; as much as to say, that God
would be so entirely propitious to His people that He would prepare and arm even
the smallest animals to destroy their enemies. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f269</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Thus is the easiness of their victory shewn; because, without the use of the
sword, hornets alone would suffice to rout and exterminate their enemies. He
adds, however, an exception, lest the Israelites should complain, if the land
should not immediately lie open to them empty and cleared of its old
inhabitants; and He reminds them that it would be advantageous to them that He
should consume their enemies by degrees. Although, therefore, God might at first
sight seem to perform less than He had promised, and thus to retract or diminish
somewhat from His grace; yet Moses shews that in this respect also He was
considering their welfare, lest the wild beasts should rush in upon the bare and
desert land, and prove more troublesome than the enemies themselves. It came to
pass indeed, through the people's slackness, that they were long mixed with
their enemies, because they executed with too little energy the vengeance of
God; yea, His menace against them by the mouth of Joshua was then
fulfilled,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"if<i> </i>ye cleave
unto the remnant of these nations, know for a certainty that the Lord your God
will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be
snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes,
until ye perish from off this good land, which the Lord your God hath given
you."<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;062312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Joshua
23:12, 13.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">The fact, therefore, that it was
later and at the end of David's reign that these wicked and heathen nations were
exterminated so as to deliver up to the people the quiet possession of the land,
must be attributed to their own fault, since unbelief and ingratitude rendered
them inactive, and disposed to indulge their ease. But, if no such inactivity
had delayed the fulfillment of the promise, they would have found that the final
destruction of the nations by God would have been delayed no longer than was
good for them.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will set thy
bounds.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There is no question that He
confirms here the covenant which he had made with Abraham in somewhat different
words. More briefly had it been said to Abraham,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Unto thy seed have I
given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river
Euphrates."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011518&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the four cardinal points of the compass are
enumerated, and, instead of the Nile, the other sea is mentioned, which is
opposite to the sea of Tarshish. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f270</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Nor is it anything new which the Israelites are commanded to expect; but they
are reminded of what they had heard of by tradition even from the time of
Abraham. Hence what I have already said is more clearly perceived, viz., that
the ancient covenant is set before them, in order that they may respond to God's
gratuitous favor, and on their part honor and worship Him, who had already
anticipated them with His mercy. Furthermore, when they had robbed themselves of
this blessing, God applied a remedy to their iniquity, by raising up a new
condition of things under David, to whom this promise is repeated, as is seen in
Psalm 72. Therefore, although even up to that time their inheritance was in a
measure incomplete <i>(truncata),</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f271</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
yet, under this renovated condition, they reached its full and solid enjoyment.
But since that prosperity and extension of the kingdom was not lasting, but
after Solomon's death began to fail, and at last its dignity was destroyed;
therefore Zechariah uses the same words in declaring its ultimate and perfect
restoration.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;380910&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
9:10.) Thence we gather that by the coming of Christ this prophecy at length
obtained its perfect accomplishment; not that the race of Abraham then began to
bear rule within the bounds here laid down, but inasmuch as Christ embraced the
four quarters of the globe under His dominion, from the east even to the west,
and from the north even to the south. Meanwhile the power of David was the
prototype of this boundless reign, when he acquired the sovereignty of the
promised land. We ought not to think it unreasonable that the ancient people
should be kept out of some portion of that inheritance which was to be expected
by them in accordance with the covenant; but rather does God's incredible
goodness display itself, in that, when they had altogether disinherited
themselves, He still combated their iniquity, and failed not to shew practically
His faithfulness. We may see the same thing in the calling of the Gentiles; for,
if the Jews had continued faithful, the Gentiles would have been joined with
them, as it had been said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"In those days it shall
come to pass that ten men shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;380823&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Zechariah
8:23;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">but their rebellion brought it about, that God only
gathered from among them the first-fruits of His Church, and afterwards the
Gentiles were substituted in the place which they had left empty. In this way
neither did this people retain their right of primogeniture, neither did God's
truth cease to stand firm, as Paul more fully explains in the eleventh chapter
of Romans.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">Deuteronomy

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The secret things
belong.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The conciseness and brevity of
this passage has rendered its meaning ambiguous; still there is no necessity for
discussing the various expositions of it. I will only shortly touch upon those
most generally accepted, lest they should lead to error. The meaning is forced
which some of the Hebrews 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f272</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
give it, viz., that God is the sole avenger of hidden crimes, whilst those
transgressions, which come to the knowledge of men, should be punished by
earthly judges; for here the execution of punishment is not the subject in
discussion, but Moses is simply commending the use of the doctrine of the Law.
The opinion of those who conceive that the excellency of the Law is maintained,
because God has manifested by it His secret things, would be more probable, if
the rules of grammar did not oppose it; for the words are not to be read
connectedly." The<i> </i>secret things of God are revealed unto us,"<i>
</i>since the
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h</font><font face="Palatino">,
or demonstrative pronoun, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f273</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which is adjoined to both, does not permit this any more than the copula which
stands between them. To me there appears no doubt that, by <i>antithesis,
</i>there is a comparison here made between the doctrine openly set forth in the
Law, and the hidden and incomprehensible counsel of God, concerning which it is
not lawful to inquire. In my opinion, therefore, the copula is used for the
adversative particle; as though it were said, "God indeed retains to Himself
secret things, which it neither concerns nor profits us to know, and which
surpass our comprehension; but these things, which He has declared to us, belong
to us and to our children." It is a remarkable passage, and especially deserving
of our observation, for by it audacity and excessive curiosity are condemned,
whilst pious minds are aroused to be zealous in seeking instruction. We<i>
</i>know how anxious men are to understand things, the knowledge of which is
altogether unprofitable, and even the investigation of them injurious. All of
them would desire to be God's counsellors, and to penetrate into the deepest
recesses of heaven, nay, they would search into its very cabinets. Hence a
heathen poet truly says, &#8212; </font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>"Nil mortalibus
arduum est: </i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Coelum

<div><font face="Palatino">On the other hand, what God plainly sets before us,
and would have familiarly known, is either neglected, or turned from in disgust,
or put far away from us, as if it were too obscure. In the first clause, then,
Moses briefly reproves and restrains that temerity which leaps beyond the bounds
imposed by God; and in the latter, exhorts us to embrace the doctrine of the
Law, in which God's will is declared to us, as if He were openly speaking to us;
and thus he encounters the folly of those who fly from the light presented to
them, and wrongfully accuse of obscurity that doctrine, wherein God has let
Himself down to the measure of our understanding. In sum, he declares that God
is the best master to all who come to Him as disciples, because He faithfully
and clearly explains to them all that it is useful for them to knew. The
perpetuity of the doctrine is also asserted, and that it never is to be let go,
or to become obsolete by the lapse of ages. How far the Law is perpetual I have
more fully discussed in the Second Book of the Institutes, chap. 11. The rule of
just and pious living even now retains its force, although we are delivered from
the yoke of bondage and from the curse; but the coming of Christ has put an end
to its ceremonies in such a way as to prove more certainly that they were not
mere vain and empty shadows. Lastly, Moses requires obedience of the people, and
reminds them that the Law was not only given that the Israelites might know what
was right, but that they might do all that God taught. True is it indeed that
all His precepts cannot be fully obeyed; but the perfection which is required,
compels those to ask for pardon who otherwise feel themselves to be exposed to
God's judgment, as will be hereafter explained. Besides, we must observe that
the doctrine that we must keep the whole Law has this object, that men should
not separate one commandment from the others, and think that they have done
their duty by performing only a part of it; since God admits no such divorce,
having forbidden us to steal no less than to kill

the preceding, and tends to the same end; for Moses commends in it the Law, on
account of its easiness; because God does not propound to us obscure enigmas to
keep our minds in suspense, and to torment us with difficulties, but teaches
familiarly whatever is necessary, according to the capacity, and consequently
the ignorance of the people. Therefore, in

<i>to the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me. </i>But Moses here invites them to learn,
because they had an easy<i> </i>and clear method of instruction set before their
eyes, and would not lose their labor; for we know that it is very often made an
excuse for idleness, if great labor without much profit is to be applied to deep
and difficult studies. Moses, therefore, declares that the Law is not hard to be
understood, so as to demand inordinate fatigue in its study; but that God there
speaks distinctly and explicitly, and that nothing is required of them but
diligent application. More-over, he thus takes away from them every pretext for
ignorance, since, with so much light, they cannot err, except by wilfully
blinding themselves, or shutting their eyes. Whence, also, we gather, how
impious are the babblings of the Papists that the Scripture is beset by thick
darkness, and how wicked is their driving away the people from approaching it,
as if it were some labyrinth. Surely they thus must needs accuse the Holy Spirit
of falsehood, who so abundantly asserts its comprehensibleness, <i>(claritatem,)
</i>or else they malign itself by their blasphemous taunts. But if the ancient
people were left without excuse<i>, </i>unless they kept in the right way, when
they had the Law for their mistress and director, our stupidity must be worthy
of double and triple condemnation, if we do not make progress in the Gospel,
wherein God has opened all the treasures of His wisdom, as far as is sufficient
for salvation. The Sophists 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f275</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
improperly and ignorantly wrest this passage to prove the freedom of the will.
(They allege
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f276</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
) that Moses here declares the precepts of the Law not to be above our reach.
What? Does he state that the keeping of them is within the compass of our
strength? Surely the words convey nothing of the sort; neither can this sense be
elicited from them, if his intention be duly weighed. For he merely encourages
the Jews, and commands them to be diligent disciples of the Law, because they
will easily understand whatever is enjoined by God therein. But the power of
performance is a very different thing from understanding. Besides, Paul, with
very good reason, accommodates this passage to the Gospel,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451008&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:8;) because it would profit nothing to comprehend the doctrine itself in the
mind, unless reverence and a serious disposition to obey be superadded. But he
takes it for granted, that to have a good will is so far from being in our own
power, that we are not even competent to think aright. Hence it follows, that
what is here stated falls to the ground as frivolous, and spoken to no purpose,
if it be applied simply to the Law. Paul also considers another thing, viz.,
that because the Law requires a perfect righteousness, it cannot be received by
any mortal fruitfully; for however any one may study to obey God, yet he will
still be far from perfection; and, therefore, it is necessary to come to the
Gospel, wherein that rigorous requirement is relaxed, because, through the
interposition of pardon, the will to obey is pleasing to God instead of perfect
obedience. For Paul insists on the latter verse, "The<i> </i>word is nigh in the
mouth, and in the heart, that the people may do it." Now, it is clear that men's
hearts are strongly and obstinately opposed to the Law; and that in the Law
itself is contained only a dead and deadly letter; how then could the literal
doctrine have a place in the heart? But if God, by the Spirit of regeneration,
corrects the depravity of the heart and softens its hardness, this is not the
property of the Law,<i> </i>but of the Gospel. Again, because in the children of
God, even after they are regenerated, there always abide the remainders of
carnal desires, no mortal will be found who can perform the Law. But in the
Gospel God receives, with fatherly indulgence, what is not absolutely perfect.
The word of God, therefore, does not begin to penetrate into the heart, and to
produce its proper fruit in the lips, until Christ shines upon us with His
Spirit and gratuitous pardon. Wherefore Paul most truly concludes that this is
<i>the word of faith </i>which is preached in the Gospel; both because the Law
does not efficaciously lead men to God, and because the keeping of it is
impossible, on account of its extreme rigor. But this is the peculiar blessing
of the new covenant, that the Law is written on men's hearts, and engraven on
their inward parts; whilst that severe requirement is relaxed, so that the vices
under which believers still labor are no obstacle to their partial and imperfect
obedience being pleasant to
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">Leviticus

brevity should render it obscure to an ignorant and slow-hearted people. For God
did not, like earthly kings, learn from experience to enrich His law by new
precepts, but considered the people's dull and weak understanding. The particle
of exception, "beside," does not, therefore, designate anything additional, but
only signifies that God had again repeated His covenant, that it might be more
distinctly and certainly understood. In which respect He gave an extraordinary
proof of His indulgence, that previous to their entering the land, He renewed
His covenant about forty years after its first promulgation, and added a clear

conquest of the Amorites, obtained a resting-place and a home; for this is the
reason why their habitation is mentioned, because the taste of the favor already
received ought to stir up their zeal to proceed more cheerfully. We shall
elsewhere remark on the country and names of places. It is sufficient here to
recollect, that the memory of the Law was renewed, after their inheritance<i>
</i>without the promised land had been obtained by the sons of Reuben and Gad,
and half the tribe of Manasseh, and when their assured possession was before the
eyes of the rest. But Moses shews that, although he might explain the Law at
fuller length, still nothing had been added to that summary which was originally
promulgated; but he rather indicates, that whatever he had taught them during
the forty years, had had no other object than that they might more faithfully

enjoins that He alone should be worshipped, and requires a worship free from all
superstition. For although it seems to be a simple prohibition, yet must we
deduce an affirmation from the negative, as will be more apparent from the
following words. Therefore does He set Himself before them, in order that the
Israelites may look to Him alone; and claims His own just right, in order that
it may not be transferred elsewhere. All do not agree in the exposition of the
words, for some construe the word

panim,</i> "anger,"<i> </i>as if it were said, "Thou shalt not make to thyself
other gods to provoke my anger;"<i> </i>and I admit that the Hebrew word is
often used in this sense. The other interpretation, however, seems to me the
more correct, "Make not to thyself gods before my face." Yet still there remains
a difference of opinion, for people are not agreed as to the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gnel. </i>Some explain it, "Make<i> </i>not to thyself gods <i>above </i>me,

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;052115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
21:15-17,<i> </i>wherein God forbids a man, if he have two wives, and children
by both, to transfer the rights of primogeniture to the second <i>before the
face </i>of the first-born. But though we admit that a comparison is there made
between the elder and the younger, still it would be too frigid an
interpretation here to say that God demands nothing more than that other gods
should not obtain the higher place; whereas He neither suffers them to be
likened to Him, nor even to be joined with Him as companions; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f278</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for religion is defiled and corrupted as soon as God's glory is diminished in
the very least degree. And we know that when the Israelites worshipped their
Baalim, they did not so substitute them in the place of God as to put Him
altogether aside, and assign to them the supreme power; nevertheless, this was
an intolerable profanation of God's worship, and moreover an impious
transgression of this precept,<i> </i>to choose for themselves patrons in whom
some part of the Deity should be lodged; because if God <i>have not alone
</i>the pre-eminence, His majesty is so far obscured. I consider,therefore, the
genuine sense to be, that the Israelites should not make to themselves any gods,
whom they might oppose to the true and only God. For in Hebrew the expression,
<i>before the face, </i>generally means <i>over against; </i>therefore God would
not have companions obtruded upon Him, and placed as it were in His sight.
Meanwhile, it seems probable to me that He alludes to that manifestation of
Himself which ought to have retained His people in sincere piety; for true and
pure religion was so revealed in the Law, that God's face in a manner shone
forth therein. The case was different with the Gentiles, who, although they
might rashly make to themselves false gods, still would not do so before the
face of God, which was unknown to them. Let us then understand, after all, that
those alone are accounted the legitimate worshippers of God who bid adieu to all
figments, and cleave to Him alone. Nor can it be doubted that these words
comprehend the inward worship of God, since this commandment differs from the
next, whereby external idolatry will be seen to be condemned. It is sufficiently
notorious, that men may make to themselves gods in other ways besides in
statues, and pictures, and in visible forms. If any should adore the angels
instead of God, or should foolishly imagine any other secret divinity, none will
deny that he would offend against this Law. God, therefore, calls for the
affections of the heart, that He alone may be spiritually worshipped; and the
expression "before my face," may be not inaptly referred to this; because,
although their impiety, who secretly turn aside to false worship, and cherish
their errors within their own bosoms, may be able to evade the eyes of men, yet
their hypocrisy and treachery will not escape the notice of God. Hence, again,
it follows, that the one God is not rightly worshipped, unless He be separated
from all figments. Wherefore it is not enough to make use of His name, unless
all corruptions opposed to His word be laid aside; and thence we arrive at the
distinction between true religion and false superstitions; for since God has
prescribed to us how He would be worshipped by us, whenever we turn away in the
very smallest degree from this rule, we make<i> </i>to ourselves other gods, and
degrade Him from His right
place.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">PASSAGES WHICH

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear, O
Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>When Moses proclaims that God is
One, the statement is not confined to His sole essence, which is
incomprehensible, but must be also understood of His power and glory, which had
been manifested to the people; as though he had said, that they would be guilty
of rebellion unless they abode in the One God, who had laid them under such
obligations to Himself. Therefore he not only calls him Jehovah, but at the same
time infers that He is the God of that people whom he addresses, "Thy<i>
</i>God." Thus all other deities are brought to nought, and the people are
commanded to fly and detest whatever withdraws their minds from the pure
knowledge of Him; for although His name may be left to Him, still He is stripped
of His majesty, as soon as He is mixed up with a multitude of others. Thus He
says by Ezekiel,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;262039&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
20:39,) "Go<i> </i>ye, serve ye every one his idols;"<i> </i>in which words He
not only repudiates all mixed worship, but testifies that He would rather be
accounted nothing than not be worshipped undividedly. The orthodox Fathers aptly
used this passage against the Arians; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f279</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because, since Christ is everywhere called God, He is undoubtedly the same
Jehovah who declares Himself to be the One God; and this is asserted with the
same force respecting the Holy
Spirit.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt fear the Lord thy
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Hence it is more evident why He has
just declared that there is One God, viz., that He alone may be undividedly
worshipped; for unless our minds are fixed on Him alone, religion is torn, as it
were, into divers parts, and this is soon followed by a labyrinth of errors.
But, first, he calls for reverence, and then for the worship which may testify
and demonstrate it. "Fear"<i> </i>contains in it the idea of subjection, when
men devote themselves to God, because His terrible majesty keeps them in their
proper place. Hence results worship, which is the proof of piety. But we must
observe that the fear enjoined in this passage is voluntary, so that men
influenced by it desire nothing more than to obey God. When I stated, therefore,
that God brings us under the yoke by a sense of His power and greatness, I did
not understand that a violent and servile obedience is extorted from us; I only
wished to affirm that men cannot be induced to obey God, before they have been
subdued by fear; because their innate corruption always carries with it a
contempt for religion, and a spirit of licentiousness. Therefore, in Jeremiah
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240522&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
5:22), in order to exhort men to fear, He sets forth His terrible power in
restraining the strength of the sea; but this fear leads on His true worshippers
further. In the other passage which we have subjoined from Deuteronomy 10, the
word <i>cleave </i>again confirms the truth, that as soon as men decline from
God in the least degree, His worship is corrupted. For this is the meaning of
that union with Himself to which He calls His worshippers, that they should be,
as it were, glued to Him, and should not look
elsewhere.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall not tempt the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Since the doctrine here should
undoubtedly be referred to the First Commandment, we gather from it that this is
the main foundation of piety, to give to Him what is His own, and to diminish
nothing from the prerogative which He claims. As we have already seen, unbelief
was the fountain and cause of the tempting in Massah, for when the people
neither relied on God's providence nor rested on His paternal love, they burst
forth into impatience, and at length advanced so far as to think that God was
not with them, unless He complied with their wicked lusts. We perceive, then,
that God cannot be rightly worshipped unless when He has His peculiar attributes
acknowledged. Whence, also, it appears that true piety cannot be dissevered from
faith, because, if we confess that every desirable good dwells in Him, we shall
expect and seek for all things from Him; we shall also patiently and contentedly
allow ourselves to be governed by His will, and, in a word, give up ourselves
and our lives into His
hands.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">Leviticus

carnal affections to prepare for imitating God. Besides, they willingly lie
slumbering in their own filthiness, and seek to cloak it by the outward
appearance of religion. Here, then, they are recalled to the imitation of God,
who, in adopting them, desired that they should bear His image, just as good and
undegenerate children resemble their father. If any should pretend to equal God,
his emulation would be madness; but although the most perfect come very far
short even of the angels, yet the weakness of the very humblest does not prevent
him from aspiring after the example of God. To this point did all the
ceremonies<i> </i>tend, whereby God exercised His ancient people unto holiness,

these various forms of worship were so many temptations to forsake the right
way, it was needful to provide against the danger betimes, and so to establish
the authority of the One God, that the Jews might have courage to despise the
common belief of all the Gentiles. A threat is added, that vengeance would not
be far off if they should fall away into these superstitions, since <i>God is a
jealous God, </i>and dwelling <i>among them. </i>As to the former epithet, I am
about to say more under the Second Commandment. Meanwhile, let my readers
observe that God is called jealous, because He permits no rivalry which may
detract from His glory, nor does He suffer the service which is due to Him alone
to be transferred elsewhere. When He reminds the people that he dwells among
them, it is partly to inspire terror by reason of His presence, and partly to
reprove indirectly their ingratitude, if they should forsake Him, and seek for
themselves gods who are afar
of.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">Deuteronomy

experience how eagerly the human race lays hold of bad examples, and how prone
it is to imitate them. Especially those who come into a foreign land, accustom
themselves readily to its manners and customs. This is the reason why God
expressly commands the Israelites to beware, lest, when they come into the land
of Canaan, they should catch any infection from its inhabitants. The doctrine,
indeed, is universal in its application; but there was a necessity for providing
against the danger which immediately impended. Moreover, Moses explains clearly
in this passage what it is to have other gods, viz., to mix up the worship of
God with things profane, since its purity is only thus maintained by banishing
from it all uncongenial superstitions. The sum, therefore, is, that the people
of God should abstain from all the inventions of men, whereby pure and simple
religion is adulterated. In general, God wished to deter His worshippers from
every fallacy whereby, from the beginning, Satan has deluded and fascinated
miserable men; but He enumerates certain particular points, which by usage and
custom had obtained the greatest prevalence. But in order that God's purpose may
be more apparent, it is expedient to observe what it is that displeases Him in
these vices which He condemns. Since men have a natural desire after knowledge,
even in the superstitious this has always proceeded from a good principle,
inasmuch as God has implanted it in the minds of all, when He would distinguish
our race from the lower animals. Neither in this was there anything to be
reprehended, that men, being conscious of their own ignorance, conceived that
they were to obtain knowledge in no other way than by consulting God. Now this
was the sole object of the Gentiles when they inquired of their magicians and
sorcerers, to seek from heaven that knowledge of which they perceived themselves
to be destitute. Thus they undoubtedly confessed themselves to be overwhelmed
with darkness, and that the light of understanding was the special gift of God.
Whence also came the name of divination, because they were persuaded that secret
things were not within the compass of human apprehension, but that this
knowledge must come from divine inspiration. But since by his machinations the
devil perverts what is right in itself, these principles implanted in us, as I
have said, by nature, have been corrupted by two errors, for both an immoderate
desire of knowing more than is lawful has crept into our minds, and then we have
had recourse to illicit means of knowledge. From these sources, viz., foolish
curiosity and unrestrained temerity or audacity, all the superstitions and
errors have flowed whereby the world has been assailed. Therefore does God, by
forbidding magical arts, introduce a remedy for these two diseases, which arts
were perversely invented that they might search out and bring to light things
which He had chosen to conceal. For the best rule of knowledge is sobriety, that
it may suffice us to know as much as is expedient for us. The lust of men has
carried them deeper, so that they have desired to penetrate into all the most
profound secrets. But the second error on which I have touched is much worse,
that they should have sought by improper means to discover hidden things. We
shall soon see that God also has foretold things to come by his servants; but no
further than He knew to be profitable, and only with this object, to make it
manifest that He exercises special care for His church. But since men's
curiosity is insatiable, they do not consider what is useful for them, but, like
Adam, desire to "be as gods," and to know all things without exception. When God
indulges not these improper desires, they address themselves to the devil, the
father of lies, still, however, as I have stated, under the false disguise of
God's name. This is the origin of all the vanities whereby the world has ever
been entangled. I now descend to
particulars.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall not be found among
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This horrible and altogether
monstrous infatuation, whereby the Gentiles had been possessed, afterwards
invaded the Jews<i> </i>also, that they should immolate and even burn their
children in honor of the gods to which they had devoted themselves; although it
is probable that the greater part of them were not inflamed by such an excess of
madness, but satisfied their superstition more easily, by merely making their
children to pass through the fire. This was with them a kind of lustration to
purge away all filthiness. But their cruel zeal impelled many of them even to
murder, so as not even to spare their own flesh and blood. Yet in this they
pleaded the example of Abraham, as if there were any similarity between the
obedience of that holy man who, led by God's command, was ready to slay his son
Isaac, and this barbarous act of violence in people who, though God prohibited
and gainsaid, murdered their children. Yet in this horrible spectacle we
perceive how much more fervently men engage in impious rites which their own
temerity has dictated, than in efforts to worship God aright, when He openly and
expressly enjoins them the thing that is good. This, indeed, ought to be the
first care of parents to consecrate their children to God; but the only rite of
initiation for the Jews was circumcision, and with this they should have been
content. Moses then enumerates the various kinds of divination to which the
heathen nations were addicted, in order to satisfy their foolish desire to know
more than was lawful. I do not, however, disapprove of the view which some
prefer,

I shall explain these briefly, and not waste time in refuting particular
opinions, although it is evident that even some of the rabbis are grossly
mistaken about them. The word

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f282</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
magnonen, </i>I willingly admit to be derived from (a word signifying)
<i>clouds</i>; and therefore it may properly mean <i>augurs, </i>or judicial
astrologers. There are some who are rather of opinion that its root is
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wgm</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
magnon, </i>which in Hebrew means <i>a place; </i>and this etymology would not
badly suit the fanatics who divine all things from the position of the stars,
and assign their stations both to the planets and the signs of the zodiac for
their respective aspects. At any rate this is fully agreed, that auguries, as
well as frivolous observations of the stars, are here condemned, when men, in
their preposterous curiosity, suppose all events and circumstances to be under
the dominion of the stars. The word which follows

44:5, where Joseph pretends that he divined by his cup, because it was commonly

term, which I have translated <i>"tying knots," (colligans colligationes,)
</i>whereby some understand enchanters, who by magic arts gather together
serpents into one place. But this, in my judgment, is a poor explanation, and I,
therefore, rather agree with those who conceive the calling together of evil
spirits to be alluded to. But since it may be correctly translated "collecting,
or gathering an assembly," I do not altogether reject the opinion of others,
that it relates to those imaginary assemblies, to which unhappy men, whom the
devil has bewitched, fancy themselves to be transported to feast and dance
together, and to join in wicked conspiracies, and which are commonly called
"synagogues." In the sixth word there is no ambiguity, whereby the people are
forbidden to consult a spirit of Python; for thus may we properly render the

make no doubt that they adopted this honorable name for purposes of deceit,
which is by no means an uncommon practice with impostors. Thus the Genethliacs,
and others like them, vaunted themselves to be mathematicians. This is the craft
of Satan to steal the respectable names of virtues and good things, and to make
them a covering for his lies, as, for instance, he gave the name of wise men to
the Chaldean and Egyptian impostors; and thus, since the Prophets are called
seers, he set against them the vain prognostications of false prophets, to
astonish the minds of the simple.

For to derive, as some do, this word from a certain bird, is too childish a
conjecture; and I wonder that in such a plain matter they have been led so
utterly astray, whilst they waste their acuteness upon nothing. Finally,
necromancy 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f289</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is condemned, <i>i.e., </i>the deceitful and delusive science of prophesying
upon the answers of the dead, which some improperly restrict to those who sleep
among tombs, in order to hear in their sleep the dead speaking, because foolish
men have in many ways endeavored to obtain communications from the dead. But,
let us learn from this passage, with how many monstrous and ridiculous
fascinations Satan, whenever God loosens the chain by which he is bound, is able
to bewitch unhappy men; and how great, power to deceive the father of lies
obtains from the just vengeance of God, for the purpose of blinding unbelievers.
As to the notion which some conceited persons entertain, that all these things
are fabulous and absurd, it arises from inconsideration and presumption, because
they do not reflect how severe a judgment is merited by those who wilfully
extinguish the light and enwrap themselves in darkness. For God's truth is too
precious to Him, for Him to suffer it to be rejected with impunity. Certainly it
would be an impudent blasphemy to deny that magical arras were ever practiced,
since thus would God be accused of inadvertency, as though He had legislated 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f290</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
respecting things which did not exist. The objection that is made of its being
absurd thus too highly to extol the power of Satan, as if he had the control of
prophecies, which God claims for Himself alone, and as if he could cause the
living to converse with the dead and change the forms of things, admits of an
easy solution. With respect to vaticinations, there is no necessity for a subtle
discussion as to how Satan can foreknow secret things, (on which point, as it
seems to me, Augustine troubled himself too anxiously,) for this is a labor of
supererogation, if we recollect that by God's just judgment a certain kind of
vaticination is permitted to the devils, in order more and more to deceive
unbelievers, as will be more fully treated of elsewhere. Meanwhile, we know that
unbelievers were mocked with 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f291</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
ambiguous responses by all the oracles of false gods, and at length discovered
from the event that they had been beguiled by deadly artifices; and, therefore,
in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234123&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
41:23, God justly charges every idol with ignorance of futurity. Yet this does
not prevent Satan from revealing certain hidden matters, by the prediction of
which he may ensnare, as by a bait, the reprobate. I admit, indeed, that in
progress of time the Roman augurs abandoned the study of their art, and abused
the credulity of the lower orders by nothing but gross fictions; but if in
former times Satan had not led even the most sharp-sighted into error by this
artifice, Xenophon, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f292</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the disciple of Socrates, would not have so often mentioned among the chief
praises of Cyrus, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f293</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that he was devoted to augury, and had learnt to be so from his father. Finally,
the experience of all ages teaches us that men of depraved curiosity have often
received from Satan, by means of magicians, a knowledge of things which could
not have been obtained naturally. As to the actual operations of Satan, whether
he raises the dead, or bewitches men and beasts, or invests any substances with
new forms through enchantment, we must consider that whatever miracles he
appears to work are mere delusions; and, since he is the father of darkness, it
is clear he has no power except upon unbelievers, whose minds are darkened, so
as not to distinguish black from white. Yet we have already seen how Pharaoh's
magicians rivalled Moses in their miracles. Wherefore we need not wonder if, by
God's permission, he should disturb the elements, or afflict the reprobate with
diseases and other evils, or present phantoms to their sight. On this account we
should more earnestly implore of God to restrain from us an enemy armed against
us with so many destructive arts.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>

authority of God act as a rein to guide them; and then sets before them that
vengeance which they were soon about to see inflicted upon the heathen, nay, of
which they were themselves to be the executioners and ministers. For since it
could not be a matter of the slightest doubt, but that the inhabitants of the
land of Canaan were rooted out from their peaceful habitations only by God's
hand, he assigns as the cause of this destruction that they had polluted
themselves and their country by these blasphemous and abominable superstitions.
By this striking example, then, he deters them from imitating the sins which
facts themselves shewed to be thus severely punished. Thus Paul admonishes
believers to seek diligently to avoid the sins which provoke God's wrath against
the disobedient.

obligation of that holy covenant whereby as on the one side He had pledged
Himself to the Jews, so on the other He had made them His debtors, not to
prostitute themselves to idols, or to hanker after strange religions, whereby
men's minds are led astray. This <i>perfectness, </i>then, is opposed to all
those mixtures or corruptions which withdraw us from the sincere worship of the
one true God; because the simplicity which retains us in obedience to heavenly
teaching, is that spiritual chastity which God requires in His Church. The
context of the passage proves this with sufficient clearness, viz., that God
would restrain the Jews from all licentiousness, so that being devoted to His
service, they should not look this way or that way, nor be carried away by
vanity and instability, but constantly abide<i> </i>in the pure worship which He
had prescribed to them. For this reason Paul declares that he is jealous for
Christ; and because<i> </i>he had "espoused" the Corinthians to Christ, he
feared "lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve, through his subtlety,"
so being ensnared by the wiles of impostors, they should fall "from the
simplicity that is in Christ."

setting before them the punishment He was about to inflict upon these nations,
in order to alarm and warn them, so now does he admonish them that the
inheritance was handed over to them on this condition, that they should be
mindful of so great a benefit, and beware of all pollutions; and that they
succeeded the former inhabitants of the land, with a view to their being
separate from them; for whence was this change, except that God might acquire to
Himself a new people, and purify the land from all its defilements? Although He
only mentions two classes of superstitions, yet thus, by <i>synecdoche, </i>He
indicates them all. The sum is, that they should not be like the nations in
vices and corruptions, which had been the cause of their destruction; since God
had not only exterminated the men themselves, but their abominable rites also.

the Israelites should object that they were more hardly dealt with than the rest
of the nations of the world; for it was always most justly considered an
extraordinary blessing to hold communication with God; and indeed there can be
nothing more to be desired. But an opinion had obtained currency, that men
approached more closely to God by means of magical arts, by the oracles of
Pythonic spirits, and by the study of augury. The people of Israel, then, would
have complained of being badly treated, if they had been shut out from all
prophecies and revelations. Moses meets this complaint or objection by
announcing, that their access to God would be not less familiar than as if He
should Himself openly come down from heaven; if only they kept the right way,
and were contented with that rule which He deemed best for them. He, therefore,
commands that, instead of all the imaginations of the Gentiles, the doctrine of
the Prophets should alone have force among them. Thus He signifies that although
God should not openly come down from heaven, yet that His will, as far as was
expedient, should be surely and clearly made known to them, since He would
faithfully teach them by His servants the Prophets. On this ground when, in
Isaiah, He has mocked at the prophecies of false gods, He calls the Israelites
His "witnesses,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
43:1-10,) as having made them the depositaries of His secrets and of the
treasures of divine wisdom. We see, then, the way pointed out in which God would
have His people inquire concerning the things necessary to salvation; and this
is more plainly declared in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230819&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
8:19, 20,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"And when they shall say
unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep
and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the
dead? To the law and to the testimony."</font><br><font face="Palatino">Nor is
there any doubt that Isaiah took this doctrine from the passage before us, when
he first condemns the errors which men by their curiosity invent for themselves,
and then enjoins the faithful simply to give attention to the Law, and to be
content with this form of instruction, unless they desired to be miserably
misled. Hence we conclude that the expression, "a Prophet," is used by
<i>enallage </i>for a number of Prophets. For it is altogether absurd, as some
do, to restrict it to Joshua or Jeremiah; since Moses is here treating of the
continual manner of the Church's government, and is not speaking of what God
would do within a short time. Not at all more correct is their opinion, who
apply it strictly to Christ alone; for it is well to bear in mind what I have
said respecting God's intention, viz., that no excuse should be left for the
Jews, if they turned aside to familiar spirits <i>(Pythones) </i>or magicians,
since God would never leave them without Prophets and teachers. But if He had
referred them to Christ alone, the objection would naturally arise that it was
hard for them to have neither Prophets nor revelations for two thousand years.
Nor is there any strength in those two arguments on which some insist, that the
Prophet, of whom Moses bears witness, must be more excellent than him who
proclaimed him; and that the eulogium that he should be "like unto" Moses could
not be applied to the ancient Prophets, since it is said elsewhere that "there
arose not a Prophet since like unto" him.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
34:10.) For he does not at all detract from his own dignity, by recommending
that whosoever might be sent by God should be hearkened to, whether they were
his equals or his inferiors; and, as to the comparison, this particle translated
<i>like (sicut) </i>does not always denote equality. Therefore it is true that
there was no Prophet like Moses, that is to say, similar to him in every
respect, or in whom so many gifts were displayed; yet it is no less true, that
they were all like Moses; because God set over His Church a continual succession
of teachers, to execute the same office as he did. This is referred to in the
words, "For<i> </i>all the prophets and the law prophesied until John,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
11:13, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;421616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
16:16,) where we see others united as colleagues with Moses in the government of
the Church, until the coming of Christ. Yet Peter aptly and elegantly
accommodates this testimony to Christ,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440322&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
3:22,) not to the exclusion of others of God's servants, but in order to warn
the Jews that in rejecting Christ they are at the same time refusing this
inestimable benefit of God; for the gift of prophecy had so flourished among His
ancient people, and teachers had so been constantly appointed to succeed each
other, that nevertheless there should be some interruption before the coming of
Christ. Hence, in that sad dispersion which followed the return from the
Babylonish captivity, the faithful complain in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197409&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
74:9, "We see not our signs; there is no more any prophet." On this account
Malachi exhorts the people to remember the Law given in Horeb; and immediately
after adds, "Behold<i> </i>I send you Elijah the prophet," etc.,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
4:4, 5;) as much as to say, that the time was at hand in which a more perfect
doctrine should be manifested, and a fuller light should shine. For the Apostle
says truly, that</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"God,<i> </i>who
at sundry times and in divers manners spake unto the fathers by the prophets,
hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son," (Hebrew 1:1,
2;)</font><br><font face="Palatino">and, in fact, by the appearing of the
doctrine of the Gospel, the course of the prophetic doctrine was completed;
because God thus fully exhibited what was promised by the latter. And this was
so generally understood that even the Samaritan woman said that Messias was
coming, who would tell all things.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430425&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
4:25.) To this, then, what I have lately quoted as to the transition from the
Law and the Prophets to the Gospel refers; and hence it is made out, that this
passage was most appropriately expounded by Peter as relating to Christ; for
unless the Jews chose to accuse God of falsehood, it was incumbent upon them to
look to Christ, at whose hand was promised both the confirmation of doctrine and
the restoration of all things. They had been for a long time destitute of
Prophets, of whom Moses had testified that they should never be wanting to them,
and whom he had promised as the 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f294</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
lawful ministers for retaining the people in allegiance, so that they should not
turn aside to superstitions; they had, therefore, either no religion, or else
that greatest of Teachers was to be expected, who in his own person <i>(unus)
</i>would present the perfection of the prophetic office. But we must remark the
peculiar circumstances whereby God restrains the evil affections of the Jews. It
was no common act of His indulgence, that He should take to himself Prophets
from among that people, so that they should have no need to run about to a
distance in search of revelations, and at the same time that they might be
taught familiarly according to their capacity. But with regard to the comparison
which Moses makes between himself and other prophets, its effect is to raise
their teaching in men's estimation. They had been long accustomed to this mode
of instruction, viz., to hear God speaking to them by the mouth of a man; and
the authority of Moses was so fully established, that they were firmly persuaded
that they were under the divine government, and that all things necessary to
salvation were revealed to them.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to all that thou
desiredst.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He pronounces them to be
guilty of ingratitude if they did not quietly submit themselves to their
Prophets, since on this point God had complied with their own request. For in
order that the prophetic office might be more reverenced<i> </i>and beloved by
them, and lest it should fall into disrepute through their beholding the Prophet
to be but a mortal, God had extracted the confession from them that nothing
could be better than that He should make choice of human interpreters. At the
promulgation of the Law, the visible majesty of God had shone forth, and the
people, terrified at the sight, had voluntarily desired that Moses should be
given to them as a teacher, and as the proclaimer of the heavenly voice. We have
already seen how useful was this terror to recommend the teaching which is
delivered by the mouth of man. We have abundant experience that our minds are
often carried away by vain speculations. Thus we should wish to bring down God
from heaven as often as any doubt creeps into them. It was necessary, therefore,
that the Israelites should be convinced of their weakness, lest they should go
beyond their due bounds, and that they might be led to ask for that as a great
blessing which God had foreseen to be for their good, and at the same time might
abandon that proud curiosity which would always have been exciting them, had it
not been corrected betimes by the application of this remedy. But it would have
been anything but excusable in them to have grown weary of that gift which they
had judged to be so good for themselves. The sum is, that God had appeared once
to obtain credit and authority for His Prophets; but that He had established
that order for the government of His Church, and for the declaration of His
will, which the people themselves had known by experience to be most highly
advantageous to themselves.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have well

the people was approved by the judgment and the voice of God. Not as if whatever
the foolish caprice of men may have urged them absurdly to ask, ought therefore
to be immediately granted; but when God's consent and, so to speak, His vote
coincides with it, then whatever He shews to be pleasing to Him ought to stand
firm and inviolable. Hence it follows that God, in sending the Prophets,
provided for the salvation of men as was most expedient. Moreover, He asserts
that when pious teachers arise, who faithfully shew the way of salvation, it is
an extraordinary proof of His favor, and He takes to Himself the praise when He
repeats it again,

His presence, declares His favor towards us as often as He enlightens with the
gifts of His Spirit, and raises up faithful and true teachers. Moses afterwards
reminds them that God so governs His Church by the hands and the operation of
men as not to derogate from Himself; for He retains this as His attribute, to
suggest to the mouth, as it were, of His Prophets what they are to say; neither
does He permit them to say or advance more than He has commanded. We perceive,
then, that pastors were from the first appointed, not that they should
themselves rule, or subject the Church to their imaginations, but only to be the
organs of the Holy Spirit. And those who in these days usurp a greater power,
ought to be altogether deposed from their sacrilegious

Israelites from the strange delusions of the Gentiles, Moses now forbids them
from being too credulous if false teachers should arise from among themselves,
and warns them diligently to beware of all novel inventions, and not to turn
aside in the very least degree from the Law, at the instigation of any one. For
there is peril to be apprehended, not only from professed and manifest enemies,
or from foreign superstitions, but Satan plots also by means of intestine
deceits, and abuses the holy name of God in order to betray us. Therefore it
behoves that the faith of the godly should not only be externally fortified and
protected by the ramparts of the word, lest corruption should creep in from
without, but also that it should be garrisoned within by the same word, lest
novel imaginations should secretly insinuate themselves and destroy the purity
of doctrine. Moreover, we gather from this prohibition that there is such
certainty in the divine doctrines as to prevent our faith from being undermined
or shaken, provided it has put forth into them living roots, and is firmly
grounded upon them. For it would be vain for God to warn us against giving
admission to false teachers, unless He, at the same time, shewed the means by
which they were to be guarded against. And assuredly nothing can be more
improbable than that religion should be ambiguous; and since the rule and
definition of it is faithfully prescribed and set forth in the Law, justly does
God require of His people that they should not waver, but constantly persist in
the truth delivered to them. For truly does Isaiah declare respecting the Law,
that in it it has not been said in vain to the seed of Jacob, that they should
seek God's face. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f296</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234519&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
45:19.) But, in seeking God, it would not be sufficient to teach what is right,
unless men's minds are established in it; it is requisite, therefore, that
religion should be sure and firm, or it will not be duly ordered. Nor is there
any doubt that what Paul witnesses of the Gospel was true also of the Law, viz.,
that it armed its disciples against all the storms of temptation, that they
"should<i> </i>be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with
every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men," etc.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:14.) But the words before us, when examined more closely and regularly, will
shew, with greater clearness, the aim of the
matter.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If there arise among
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We already perceive that the
question is not respecting the falsities and errors which Satan had spread
throughout the world, but respecting those which were to appear in the very
bosom of the Church, as if it had been said that the Law was not only given in
order to separate the Israelites from heathen nations, but to keep themselves in
the purity and integrity of the faith; for just as now-a-days Christ betroths
the Church to Himself by the preachers of the Gospel,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;471102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 11:2,) that she may devote herself as a chaste virgin to His
obedience, and not allow herself to be withdrawn from the simplicity of the
faith by any seductions; so of old God espoused His ancient people to Himself,
and bade them close their ears against impostors, who are, as it were, the
seducers of Satan tempting them to violate that sacred and special bond of
marriage whereby God would be united with His people. We shall speedily see
wherefore God would have His Church exposed to this evil. Meanwhile it is useful
to admonish believers of their danger, that they may be constantly watching
against the snares of Satan; for this abomination did not only prevail in that
particular age, but it will have its evil influence even to the end of the
world. We must remember what Peter says, that "as there were false prophets
among" the Jews of old, so also in the kingdom of Christ</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"there<i> </i>shall be

Peter 2:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moses, however, does not merely speak of domestic
enemies, but, of such as shall assume the title of Prophets in order that they
may deceive with greater license and impunity. From hence we infer that it is
not enough to have an honorable position, or a plausible name, whether pastor,
or prophet, or priest, unless it be allied to sincerity in accordance with our
calling; for who are the persons whom God here commands to be avoided and held
in abomination? Just those who boasted themselves to be Prophets, but who, when
carefully inquired into, were obliged to drop their mask, and driven to
confusion. A particular appellation is subjoined to their general one, since the
same individual is spoken of as "a dreamer of dreams," because God of old time
manifested Himself to the Prophets sometimes in visions and sometimes in dreams.
Either of these, then, was an honorable pretext for conciliating favor. But the
temptation which follows was still more dangerous, viz., if such an one should
have commended himself by a successful prediction; for who would despise a
prophecy authenticated by events, especially when Isaiah declares this to be the
attribute of God alone?
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234521&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
45:21.) And the difficulty here is still increased, because in chap. 18, God
appears to distinguish false Prophets from true ones by this very test. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f297</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Thus I resolve the difficulty, God's claiming to Himself the glory of
foretelling events does not prevent Him from occasionally conferring even on the
ministers of Satan the power of prophecy respecting some particular point.
Balaam was worse than any hireling crier, wishing as he did to frustrate the
eternal decrees of God, and yet we know that his tongue was directed by the
divine inspiration of the Spirit so as to be the proclaimer of that grace which
he had been hired to quench. There is, therefore, no inconsistency in this, that
a man should be a perfidious impostor, and still endowed at the same time with a
particular gift of prophecy, not so as always to deliver true revelations, (as,
for instance, Caiaphas, who prophesied correctly once, was not always
veracious,) but in so far as by God's permission it shall be given him to
foreknow this or that, so that one example of truth-telling may be the cloak for
many falsehoods. Fitly, then, and properly, in the other passage, does God, by
Moses, reprove the vanity of those rash spirits who promise what is not
fulfilled. For we must take into consideration His intention. Many are there who
bring themselves into notice by clandestine acts, and at length boldly burst
forth and boast themselves to be prophets, whilst the people are in doubt
whether they ought so to consider them. But since it most frequently happens
that the folly of such men is betrayed by marks of infamy and disgrace inflicted
upon them from above, so that the world may see that they have spoken falsely,
justly does God declare that the event of their predictions is to be regarded,
lest the Israelites should promiscuously and unreflectingly receive whatever
they may hear. The principle, therefore, is established, that those speak in
God's name who predict what really comes to pass; for they could not declare the
truth respecting things unknown to man unless God Himself should dictate it to
them. This is the tendency of the answer of Jeremiah to Hananiah,
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The prophets that have
been before me and before thee of old, prophesied both against many countries,
and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. The prophet
which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass,
then shall the prophet be known, that the Lord hath truly sent him."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;242808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
28:8, 9.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hananiah promised that the war should
end prosperously; but Jeremiah,<i> </i>knowing that he lied, brings him to an
experimental proof of his falsehood, in case the facts should not correspond
with what he had said. Thus far there is no inconsistency in our statement, that
all true prophesies must proceed from God, and yet that the same Prophet who has
predicted the truth may, in other points, be a deceiver<i>. </i>And
especially<i> </i>let us remark the admonition of Paul,
that</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"because they (the reprobate)
receive not the love of the truth, that they may be saved; for this cause God
sends them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie; that they all might
be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in
unrighteousness."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;530210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Thessalonians 2:10-12,)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we are taught that
not only are the reins of Satan loosed in order that he may do injury, but that
he is armed with power effectively to drag on the reprobate to final tied
struction. Moses here teaches the same thing, for there are no reasonable
grounds for the differences between Hebrew commentators as to the word
<i>sign.</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f298</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>It is unquestionable that signs were sometimes used in order to obtain
credit for prophesies, as when Isaiah walked naked,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232002&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
20:2,) and Jeremiah wore a yoke on his neck,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;241810&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
18:10;) it is also unquestionable that Satan often deceives by magical
incantations; but I have no doubt that by the words signifying <i>the sign and
the wonder, </i>Moses here means anything incredible and unexpected, for the
purpose of vaticination. The Hebrews use the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ytpwm</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
mophethim, </i>to express miracles whereby God portends anything future, as if
He spoke from heaven. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twa</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
oth, </i>is more general, and is sometimes used for a banner, or a watchword, or
signal, <i>(symbolum.) </i>Both are here put for extraordinary signs which
testify the power of God, as if it were present; in this sense, Christ warns His
disciples to beware of signs and lying prodigies.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
24:11.) But although Satan dazzles the eyes with his illusions, so as in his
false rivalry to win to himself the glory of God, yet have we shewn from St.
Paul, and Moses has before declared, that impostors in their working of miracles
are the ministers of God's vengeance, in order that the reprobate may be taken
in their snares. Should any object that signs would be useless, which may be as
well dangerous deceptions as confirmations of the truth, I reply, that such
license has never been accorded to the devil, as that the light of God should
not in the end shine forth from the midst of the darkness. It will happen,
therefore, that the true power of God may be obscured for a time, (as we have
seen before in the history of the magicians,) but that it will never be
overwhelmed. Thus in the miracles, whereby the Law was ratified, the glory of
God so shone forth that they might obtain credit without any hesitation from the
godly. Such, without controversy, are the miracles which authenticate the
Gospel, because they present evidences inscribed upon them by God by which all
suspicion of deceit is fully removed. And, indeed, since men's minds are
involved in dull stupidity, and are blind even to the ordinary course of God's
dealings, so also they are almost always mistaken with respect to miracles,
unless His word enlightens them to dispel the darkness. In order, therefore,
that we may duly profit by signs, an inseparable connection must be established
between them and doctrine; and Moses rightly teaches that they must be
repudiated who shall endeavor to pervert piety under the pretext of signs,
because they impiously and wickedly divide things which God has joined together,
and improperly divert to a contrary use the signs which only serve as aids to
righteous doctrine. But after the religion of the Jews had been sealed by sure
and evident signs, it was wrong for them to attend to accidental signs, and not
altogether without base ingratitude. We now arrive at the sum of this passage,
viz., that they must persevere in the worship of the one God, so that not even
prodigies should have any force to shake the people's minds. The clause,
therefore, "which thou hast not known," must be observed; whereby Moses
signifies that the glory of the God which they serve was so certainly testified
that their levity in turning this way or that would be inexcusable; and thus the
knowledge which ought to be firmly implanted in their hearts, and to abide
therein, is opposed to all the artifices of the devil, which only affect
unstable minds.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the Lord your God proveth
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>(Latin, <i>tentat vos.)
</i>Whenever this word, which means <i>to tempt, </i>is applied to God, it is
not used in a bad sense, for "to take by guile," or, "to lay snares of deceit to
entrap the unwary," but only for "to prove or examine." Now, God proves men's
hearts, not that He may learn what was before unknown, but to lay open what was
before concealed. The expression, "to know," therefore, refers to experimental
knowledge only. The explanation of Augustine is tame and involved, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f299</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
"That He may know, <i>i.e., </i>that He may cause you to know." But, since it is
so very common for human feelings to be attributed to God, where is the use of
twisting words, which signify no more than that God makes trial, so that what
might have been otherwise doubtful, should be actually displayed? Thus God
tempted Abraham, when in an important matter He made trial of his faith or
obedience.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
22:1.) Nor is what I have lately touched upon, and which we often read of, at
all contradictory to this, viz., that God uses the instrumentality of Satan and
of wicked men, in order to tempt men; because we must take into consideration
the object<i> </i>to which He directs these trials, whereby it will be manifest
that His design is very<i> </i>different from the malice and wiles of Satan. The
reason here given is worthy of remark, because it removes the difficulty by
which weak minds might have been easily disturbed. For nothing is less probable
than that Satan should insult God and involve heaven and hell in war, or that he
should assume to himself with impunity an attribute of God. Lest, then, such a
discussion should trouble and weary the good, or keep them in perplexity, Moses
thus anticipates it, by reminding them, that God does not meanwhile lie idle or
asleep, having abandoned the care of His Church; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f300</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but that He designedly brings the truly pious to the proof, in order to
distinguish them from the hypocrites; and this takes place, when they constantly
persevere in the true faith against the assaults of their temptations, and do
not fall from their standing. The Apostle declares the same thing also with
regard to heresies, that they must needs arise in the Church, "that they which
are<i> </i>approved may be made manifest."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 11:19.) Wherefore we must not be impatient, nor murmur against God,
if He chooses that the firmness of our faith, which is more precious than silver
or gold, should be tried in the fiery furnace; but it behoves us humbly to
acquiesce in His justice and wisdom. If any should still object, that, since the
weakness of mankind is only too notorious, God deals with them somewhat
unkindly, when He subjects them to these dangerous temptations, an answer may be
readily given. I acknowledge indeed that, since our carnal sense is tender, this
may seem hard, and inconsistent with the fatherly kindness of God; for, surely,
when a miracle presents itself before our eyes, it is difficult not to submit to
it. But, since the temptation injures none but those whose impiety, which it
lays bare, was already convicted and condemned, whilst the sincere worshippers
of God are preserved free from injury, how unjust would it be to take away from
God this liberty of plucking the mask from treachery and deceit? Whosoever loves
God with a pure heart is armed with the invincible power of the Divine Spirit,
that he should not be ensnared by falsehoods; God thus rewards true and not
fictitious piety, so that whosoever are of a true heart, should be protected by
his faithful guardianship, and never feel the deadly wound. Meanwhile, why
should He not devote to just destruction those who wilfully desire to perish?
Nor need we be surprised at what He elsewhere declares, that it is He who
deceives false prophets, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f301</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that by them he may inflict just vengeance on the reprobate, who eagerly go in
search of their destructive deceits. Since, then, all the good are sure to
overcome, so that the wiles of Satan are to them nothing but the exercises of
their virtue; why should God be blamed, because the malice of Satan and of the
wicked prepares for them the grounds of their victory and triumph? Only<i>
</i>let us cleave to this axiom, that all, who heartily love and reverence God,
will always be sure and safe under the protection of God. It is true, I confess,
that integrity of heart is a peculiar gift of God and the fruit of His secret
election; but, since their own consciences reproach the reprobate with their
contempt of God, their hypocrisy, pride, or depravity, the blame of the iniquity
that dwells in them is unjustly laid upon God. This, then, is sufficient to
refute all carnal and perverse reasonings and blasphemies, viz., that whosoever
are right in heart are guarded by the aid of the Spirit from the poisonous
influence of Satan, and that no one perishes against his will. And thus we come
to the conclusion, that all who, having once seemed to embrace the doctrines of
salvation, afterwards reject and deny them, had never possessed anything more
than the disguise of a false profession, because, if they sincerely loved God,
they would remain firm in heart in the midst of all things tending to disturb
them. It will indeed sometimes happen that the pious also will fall into errors,
and will be seduced by the wicked; but it will only be in some respects and for
a time; so that they never fall from the foundation, and presently recover
themselves, <i>(resipiscant.) </i>And then, it must also be observed, they pay
the penalty of their negligence, or instability, because they have not been
sufficiently attentive to God's Word, or have not sufficiently devoted
themselves to religious pursuits. Hence we further gather, that whilst many turn
away professedly from the doctrines of religion, on the ground of their seeing
so many contentions and disputes to distract them, it is a mere vain excuse to
cover their profane neglect or hatred of God. It is true that there are great
discrepancies of opinion, and very warm contentions; but whosoever in a
teachable and gentle spirit shall seek after truth, and shall give himself over
and submit himself as the disciple of God, he will never be without the spirit
of judgment and discretion. But, since some listen disdainfully, some supremely
despise it, some wish that God's Word were altogether destroyed, others think
lightly of it, the saying of the Prophet holds good, "that<i> </i>that dieth,
let it die;"<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;381109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
11:9;) and what Paul after him declares, "But if any man be ignorant, let him be
ignorant." (l Corinthians 14:38.) Since it has always been the case that God's
truth was never hidden from anybody, except him whose mind the God of this world
has blinded.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 4:4.) And this especially takes place 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f302</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
when light has shone from heaven, which suffers none to go astray but those who
shut their eyes. The remedy, therefore, is immediately subjoined, "Ye shall walk
after the Lord your God;" as if Moses had said, it was sufficient for their
preservation, that they had God to guide them in the right way, who had already
prevented them by His gratuitous bounty. But, since numbers respond not to God's
call, and regard Him not when He points out the way to them, the words "and fear
him" are added; because "the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
111:10.) Finally, Moses again inculcates that, if men are only resolved to obey
God, they will be sufficiently taught by His voice what they ought to do. By the
word "cleave," perseverance is denoted, and titus he indirectly reproves the
instability of those who forsake and forget God, and go astray after empty
imaginations.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">Deuteronomy

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if thou say in thy
heart.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This exception has reference to
the prohibition, which we have already noticed in this same chapter. God, in His
appointment of Prophets to be His substitutes in teaching the people, had
invested them with no common authority, enjoining obedience to be paid to their
precepts. But those, upon whom the office of teaching is conferred, do not
alwayduly fulfill it; and hence the doubt naturally arises, how the people shall
determine when they are addressed as by Gods mouth, so as to distinguish the
true from the false. There is, therefore, no question expressed in words, but
God anticipates the secret scruples which might otherwise keep men's minds in
suspense; for to "say<i> </i>in the heart" is equivalent to doubting in one's
self when any danger is perceived. Now, to remove this difficulty, He does not
enumerate all the marks of distinction; because He does not indeed allude to
doctrine, but only to prophecies. But, speaking popularly, as to evil and
ignorant persons, He commands them to observe whether those, who pretend to the
name of Prophet, foretell the truth. But although, as we have lately seen, false
teachers also rival in this respect the servants of God, and are found to be
veracious in some particular prophecy; yet it is sufficient as the touchstone of
their truth, to set down what happens for the most part,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpi&lt; to&lt;
polu&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">;) just as God himself chooses to be
distinguished and separated from idols by the same test. Nor does Moses
affirmatively pronounce that credit must be given to prophets, whenever events
correspond with their predictions; but only admonishes them, that, if they
consider attentively, they cannot be deceived, because God will speedily expose
the false prophets to ridicule, and will confound their folly. Thus Jeremiah
prudently accommodates this passage to the circumstances of his own times, in
order that it may be manifested how rashly and falsely Hananiah spoke in
promising impunity for those sins over which God's vengeance impended.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;242806&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
28:6.) In sum, Moses means nothing more than that the people would not be
exposed to the danger of going astray, if they endeavored heartily to obey God;
because it would come to pass by His just judgment, that the temerity of all who
have falsely abused His holy name should be made to appear, and thus they should
be unmasked.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The prophet hath spoken it
presumptuously.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He not only condemns the
folly and vanity of those who advance their own inventions in the place of God's
commands, but also their arrogance; since doubtless, this is impious and
intolerable audacity, to set forth the offspring of man's earthly brain as if it
were a divine revelation. And on this ground it is that their impiety is
detestable, who fill the air with the fumes of their revelations in order to
alarm the simple. Wherefore, he adds, that they should "not be afraid" of such a
prophet; because, as nothing can be more arrogant than the ministers of Satan,
they confidently utter their boastings, by which we may be easily moved and even
overwhelmed, unless we had this buckler to protect us, viz., that their terrific
noise may be safely despised. This doctrine is now-a-days very useful for us. We
know how insolently the Papists boast of the Catholic Church; of the Apostolic
See; how fiercely they rage in Peter's name; how impetuously they fulminate
their curses and anathemas; but, when it is ascertained that whatever they put
forward as revelations of the Spirit are but the empty figments of men, it will
be easy to dispel those terrors which flow from this same fountain of
presumption.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">Leviticus

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt not let any of thy

lightly touches on what we have lately seen set forth at greater length in
Deuteronomy; for there he condemns impious offerings, as well as the responses
of familiar spirits, magical arts, and enchantments. He now in the first place
adverts to adulterous sacrifices, especially to that impure and detestable
service of consecrating their children to Moloch, as they called him, the idol
of the Gentiles; and then adds a prohibition, that they should give no heed to
false revelations. But in these two passages of Leviticus he only enumerates two
classes, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f303</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
viz., to use auguries and divinations, and to seek responses from familiar
spirits, and to consult magicians or enchanters; yet he includes all the others
of which we have previously spoken. And,<i> </i>lest they should think the crime
a light one, he says that all they are "defiled"<i> </i>who devote themselves to
this kind of curiosity. The confirmation, which is added at the end of both
clauses, has relation to the sum of the First Commandment; for when God declares
Himself to be "Jehovah,<i> </i>and the God of Israel," he both claims the
worship which is due to Him alone, and also condemns all the superstitions
whereby pure religion is adulterated. There is also an <i>antithesis
</i>implied, in which God contrasts Himself with all fictitious idols; and
therefore the words may be thus paraphrased, &#8212; Since I am the eternal God,
and separated from all others which the Gentiles foolishly make to themselves,
and since I have chosen you to myself as my peculiar people, I would have you,
as you ought to be, pure and separated from all

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When the Lord thy God shall cut
off.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This passage has some affinity to
that in the eighteenth chapter of Deuteronomy, which we have already remarked
on. For inasmuch as it was easy for the people to lapse into the imitation of
the Gentiles, and to worship their false gods, under whose protection the
inhabitants boasted their land to be, all inquiry respecting them is also
strictly forbidden. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f304</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For this is the origin of idolatry, when the genuine simplicity of God's worship
is known, that people begin to be dissatisfied with it, and curiously to inquire
whether there is anything worthy of belief in the figments of men; for men's
minds are soon attracted by the snares of novelty, so as to pollute, with
various kinds of leaven, what has been delivered in God's word. Nor does he only
withdraw and restrain them from the desire of inquiry, but expressly commands
them to "take heed to" themselves, or to keep themselves; because men are
naturally disposed to this wanton curiosity, and take much delight in it.
Therefore God encloses His people with barriers, which may keep them back from
all hurtful desires; nay, He would have them so abominate the practice of
superstitions, as to fly even from the infection of hearing of them. We must
briefly observe respecting the words, which we have translated "to<i>
</i>possess the nations," that Moses does not mean that they were to become<i>
</i>their prey, so as to be their slaves by right of capture, but that he refers
to the land. Therefore he says, "thou shalt possess them before thy face;"
<i>i.e., </i>when they are destroyed, the land will be vacant for you to possess
it. In the <i>Hiphil </i>conjugation this word signifies to expel, as we have
already seen; and to this meaning Moses perhaps makes allusion. The word 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f305</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which I have translated <i>"illa-queare," </i>to snare, some interpreters render
to <i>stumble, </i>and others to be <i>carried away, </i>which would be more
agreeable to the construction, "lest you should be carried away after them;" yet
I have been unwilling to depart from the generally received opinion, when the
metaphor of "ensnaring" is very appropriate; as if he had said, that all the
perversities of the Gentiles were so many nets or snares to entrap men, if they
come too near them; for it presently follows, "after that they be destroyed,"<i>
</i>which some also thus render, "lest you should perish after them," as if He
would awaken their fears by holding forth the example of their
destruction.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt not do
so.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>From these words we may gather what
it is not to make to one's self the gods of others, viz., to bid farewell to all
the inventions of men, and to pay attention to this one thing &#8212; what God
commands. For why does God desire to be worshipped by His elect<i> </i>people,
otherwise than the nations were in the habit of serving their gods, except
because there ought to be a notable distinction, so that religion may not be
confused? And surely unless men cleave to God's word, so as resolutely to
determine that nothing else is permitted to them except what is there taught,
they will not only be vacillating, but. they will receive indiscriminately
whatever comes in their way. We must then hold fast to this, "Thou shalt not do
so;" and our minds must be restrained by this curb, lest any superstition which
may defile the service of God should insinuate or establish itself. He adds,
that God not only repudiates these strange worships, but even abominates them;
and in order to impress this the more, he adduces one form of superstition, in
which its absurdity was unusually manifest; for it is a foul barbarity that
innocent children should be burnt by their
parents.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>32.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What thing soever I

that no other service of God is lawful, except that of which He has testified
His approval in His word, and that obedience is as it were the mother of piety;
as if he had said that all modes of devotion are absurd and infected with
superstition, which are not directed by this rule. Hence we gather, that in
order to the keeping of the First Commandment, a knowledge of the true God is
required, derived from His word, and mixed with faith. By forbidding the
addition, or diminishing of anything, he plainly condemns as illegitimate
whatever men invent of their own imagination; whence it follows that they, who
in worshipping God are guided by any rule save that which He Himself has
prescribed, make to themselves false gods; and, therefore, horrible vengeance is
denounced by Him against those who are guilty of this temerity, through
Isaiah,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Forasmuch as this people

the Israelites might learn that they should never turn away from Him, by whose
kindness and hand they were redeemed. For by these means He had purchased them
to Himself as His peculiar people; and, therefore, whenever<i> </i>He reproves
them for declining from His pure worship, He complains that they were forgetful
of this great favor, the memory of which ought to have been sufficient to retain
them. In effect, then, the celebration of the Passover taught the Israelites
that it was not lawful for them to have regard to any other God besides their
Redeemer; and also that it was just and right for them to consecrate themselves
to His service, since He had restored them from death to life; and thus, as in a
glass or picture, He represented to their eyes His grace; and desired that they
should on every succeeding year recognize what they had formerly experienced,
lest it should ever depart from their memory. First, let us define what the
Passover <i>(Pascha) </i>is; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f308</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I use its trite and ordinary name. In its etymology there is no difficulty,
except that the passage <i>(transitus) </i>of God, is equivalent to His leaping
over, <i>(transilitio) </i>whereby it came to pass that the houses of the
Israelites remained untouched; for Isaiah, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f309</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
speaking of the second redemption, unquestionably alludes to this place, when he
says, I will leap over Jerusalem. The reason, then, for this expression being
used is, that God's vengeance passed over the Israelites, so as to leave them
uninjured. With respect to the twofold mention by Moses of a passing-over,
observe that the same word is not used in both places; but <i>Pesah
</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f310</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>refers to the chosen people, and <i>Abar </i>to the Egyptians; as if he had
said, my vengeance shall pass through the midst of your enemies, and shall
everywhere destroy them; but you I will pass over untouched. Since, then, God
was willing to spare His Israel, He awakened the minds of the faithful to the
hope of this salvation, by the interposition of a sign; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f311</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
whilst He instituted a perpetual memorial of His grace, that the Passover might
every year renew the recollection of their deliverance. For the first Passover
was celebrated in the very presence of the thing itself, to be a pledge to
strengthen their terrified minds; but the annual repetition was a sacrifice of
thanksgiving, whereby their posterity might be reminded that they were God's
rightful and peculiar dependents <i>(clientes). </i>Yet both the original
institution and the perpetual law had a higher reference; for God did not once
redeem His ancient people, that they might remain safely and quietly in the
land, but He wished to bring them onward even to the inheritance of eternal
life, wherefore the Passover was no less than Circumcision a sign of spiritual
grace; and so it has an analogy and resemblance to the Holy Supper, because it
both contained the same promises, which Christ now seals to us in that, and also
taught that God could only be propitiated towards His people by the expiation of
blood. In sum, it was the sign of the future redemption as well as of that which
was past. For this reason Paul writes, that "Christ our Passover is slain,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 5:7;) which would be unsuitable, if the ancients had only been
reminded in it of their temporal benefit. Yet let us first establish this, that
the observation of the Passover was commanded by God in the Law, that He might
demand the gratitude of His people and devote to Himself those who were redeemed
by His power and grace. I now descend to particulars. God commands the
Israelites to begin the year with the month in which they had come out of Egypt,
as if it had been the day of their birth, since that exodus was in fact a kind
of new birth; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f312</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for, whereas they had been buried in Egypt, the liberty given them by God was
the beginning of a new life and the rising of a new light. For though their
adoption had gone before, yet, since in the mean time it had almost vanished
from the hearts of many, it was necessary that they should be in a manner
re-begotten, that they might begin to acknowledge more certainly that God was
their Father. Wherefore He says in Hosea,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"I am the Lord thy God
from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no God but me,"<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;281209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hosea
12:9, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;281304&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hosea
13:4;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">because He had then especially acquired them to
Himself as His peculiar people; and He speaks even more clearly a little
before,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"when Israel was a child,
then I loved him,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and called my son
out of Egypt."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;281101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hosea
11:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, although it was common to the race of Abraham
with other nations to begin the year with the month of March; yet in this
respect the reason for it was different, for it was only to the elect people
that their resurrection was annually put before their eyes. But, up to that
time, the Hebrews themselves had begun their year with the month of September,
which is called in Chaldee <i>Tisri, </i>and in which many suppose that the
world was created; because immediately on its creation the earth produced ripe
fruits, so that its fecundity was in perfection. And still there remains among
the Jews a twofold manner of dating and counting their years; for, in all
matters which relate to the common business of life, they retain the old and
natural computation, so that the first month is the beginning of Autumn; but, in
religious matters and festivals, they follow the injunctions of Moses; and this
is the legal year, beginning nearly with our month of March, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f313</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
yet not precisely<i>, </i>because we have not their ancient <i>embolisms;
</i>for, since twelve circuits of the moon would not equal the sun's course,
they were obliged to make an intercalation, lest, in progress of years, an
absurd and enormous diversity should arise. Thence it happens that the month
<i>Nisan, </i>in which they celebrated the Passover, begins among the Jews
sometimes earlier, and sometimes later, according as the intercalation retards
it.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Speak ye unto
all.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>A question is asked on this
passage, why, when one Lamb alone was offered in sacrifice for the
reconciliation of the Church, and God was propitiated by the blood of one Christ
alone, He should have commanded a lamb to be slain in every house, as if there
were to be a special sacrifice for every one apart? The reply is easy; because,
although all were protected from destruction by the same blood, and the general
rite united them altogether into fellowship in the same expiation, yet still it
was not unreasonable that, by that special application, so to speak, God would
have every family separately reminded, so as to feel the grace more peculiarly
conferred on itself. Thus now-a-days we have all the same baptism, whereby we
are ingrafted in common into the body of Christ; yet His baptism is conferred on
every individual, that they may more surely acknowledge that they are partakers
in the adoption, and therefore members of the Church. God, then, in commanding
them to slay a lamb in every house, did not wish to draw away the people to
different grounds of hope, but only to shew them in a familiar way, that all
houses were under obligation to Him, and that not only the salvation of the
whole people ought to be confessed to come from Him, but that His singular
blessing ought to shine forth in every family. The cause of his desiring the
neighbors to be added if the number of people in one house were not, sufficient
to eat the Passover, was that nothing might be left of it; and this amongst
others appears to have been the chief reason why the whole lamb was to be
consumed, viz., lest they should mix this sacred feast with their daily food,
and also lest its dignity should be diminished by appearing in the form of
tainted meat. Perhaps, too, God provided this, lest any superstition should
creep in from the preservation of the remnants; and therefore commanded the very
bones to be burnt.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Your lamb shall be without
blemish.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We<i> </i>shall see elsewhere,
that in all their sacrifices prescribed by the Law they were diligently to
beware, lest there should be any spot or fault in them; and by this the people
were reminded, that the expiation was not legitimate, unless it possessed the
utmost perfection, such as is never to be found in men. It is not to be
wondered, therefore, that God should now require the Passover to be of one year
old, and without blemish, that the Israelites might know that in order to
propitiate God, a more excellent price was required than could be discovered in
the whole human race; and since such excellency could much less exist in a
beast, the celestial perfection and purity of Christ was shewn forth by this
visible perfection of the lamb, or kid. It was with reference to this also that;
they were commanded to keep it up separate from the rest; of the flock, from the
tenth until the fourteenth day of the month. As to God's will, that the
side-posts and lintel should be sprinkled with blood, by this sign He plainly
taught them, that the sacrifice would profit none but those who were stained and
marked with Christ's blood; for this sprinkling was equivalent to their bearing
each one the mark: of His blood upon their forehead. And, in effect, Christ,
by<i> </i>the outpouring of His blood, has not delivered all, but only the
faithful, who sanctify themselves with it. That internal sprinkling indeed holds
the first place, which Peter teaches us to be effected by the power of the
Spirit,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 1:2;) yet by this external sign the Israelites were instructed that they
could not be protected from God's wrath, except by holding up against it the
shield of the blood. And this corresponds with the lesson learnt above, that the
same universal sacrifice was offered particularly in every house, in order that
thus its peculiar instruction might affect them more seriously, when generally
it would have been uninteresting and ineffectual. I prefer to be ignorant as to
why He required the flesh to be roasted and not boiled, rather than to invent
such unfounded subtleties, as that Christ was, in a manner, roasted on the
Cross. A nearer approach to the truth appears to me to be, that God desired thus
to mark their haste, because, when their implements were all packed up, the meat
would be more easily roasted on a spit than cooked in the pot. And this also is
the tendency of the precept respecting the manner of eating it, in which three
things are to be observed, the unleavened bread, the sauce of bitter herbs, and
the girded loins, together with the rest of the costume of travelers.
Undoubtedly God commanded the bread to be made without leaven on account of
their sudden departure, because He would snatch his people out of Egypt, as it
were, in a moment; and, therefore, they baked unleavened loaves out of flour
hurriedly kneaded. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f314</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It was required that the remembrance of this should be renewed every year, in
order that their posterity might know that their deliverance was afforded them
from above, since their fathers hastily took flight without having made any
preparation for their journey; for any greater preparation would have thrown
some shade upon the divine grace, which shone forth more brightly on account of
their want of food. God would have them content with bitter herbs, because hasty
travelers, and especially in an enemy's<i> </i>country, are satisfied without
delicacies, and whatever sauce they meet with is very grateful to their taste,
nor does its bitterness seem offensive to them, as it does in seasons of
abundance and ease. Possibly too they were reminded of their former condition;
for under so dire and bitter a tyranny nothing could be sweet or pleasant. But
their haste was still more plainly represented by their eating the lamb
hurriedly with their shoes on their feet, and their loins girded, and leaning on
their staves. Men pass from their suppers to bed and to repose; and therefore
the ancients used both to take off their shoes and to lie down to it; but the
people's necessity inverts this order, since they were compelled to fly
immediately from their supper. And hence the reason is subjoined, "it is the
Lord's passover;" since they escaped in safety amidst the confusion, and when
the sword of God was raging. We must, however, bear in mind what we have already
said, that the use of this sacrament was twofold, both to exercise the people in
the recollection of their past deliverance, and to nourish in them the hope of
future redemption; and therefore the passover not only reminded them of what God
had already done for His people, but also of what they were hereafter to expect
from Him. Consequently there is no doubt that the Israelites ought to have
learnt from this rite that they were redeemed from the tyranny of Egypt on these
terms, viz, that a much more excellent salvation still awaited them. But this
spiritual mystery was more clearly laid open by the coming of Christ; and
therefore Paul, accommodating this, ancient figure to us, commands us,
because</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Christ<i> </i>our passover
is sacrificed for us," to "keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the
leaven of malice, and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and
truth."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 5:7, 8.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">God therefore formerly
wished the houses, in which the Passover was celebrated, to be free from all
corruption; and far more does it become us now to take care of this, lest the
sacrifice wherewith Christ has redeemed us from eternal death, should be
polluted by any leaven of wickedness. To the same effect 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f315</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is what follows, warning us lest we should be devoted to the attractions of the
world, and lest our course should be delayed by the enticements of pleasure; but
that we are pilgrims on earth, and should be ever girt and ready to make haste;
and that although the cross of Christ be bitter, yet we should not refuse to
taste it.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I will pass through the
land.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This refers to the first passover,
the night in which they were to be delivered from Egypt; and God expressly
declares that He will be the judge against the false gods, because it then
especially appeared how utterly unable they were to help, and how vain and
fallacious was their service. The absurd commentary of some of the Rabbins 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f316</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is tame and far-fetched, that the idols should be cast down, because by the
single miracle of their redemption, all superstitions were magnificently
overturned, and whatsoever men believed about idols was condemned as folly and
delusion. God therefore affirms, that he would not only conquer the nation
itself, but its very<i> </i>gods. Perhaps Isaiah alludes to this passage when he
says,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Behold, the Lord rideth upon
a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt; and the idols of Egypt shall be moved

but only such as would exist until the renovation of the Church; and the same
explanation will apply to circumcision, as well as to the whole ceremonial of
the Law; for although by Christ's coming it was abolished as concerns its use,
yet did it only then attain its true solidity; and therefore the difference
between ourselves and the ancient people detracts nothing from this perpetual
statute; just in the same way as the new Covenant does not destroy the old in
substance, but only in form. A little further on, where he says, "save that
which every man must eat, that only may be done of you,"<i> </i>verse 18; the

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye shall observe this
thing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He again repeats the precept as
to its annual celebration, and expressly says, that, when they have come into
the land, the recollection of their deliverance is yearly to be revived by this
rite. He adds, however, what he had not before touched upon, that they should
also teach their children, since, without the aid of this teaching, it would
have been an unmeaning and useless spectacle. For doctrine may justly be called
the life of sacraments, without which no rigor remains in them, so far are they
from imparting to us any life. Lest, then, the passover should be a lifeless
ceremony, God in this place enjoins that it shall not be mute; for in these
words, "when<i> </i>your children shall say unto you," Moses does not mean that
they are to wait until their children make inquiry of their own accord, and
anticipate the zeal of their parents; but he only indicates the age when they
are capable of being taught. Yet, at the same time, he indirectly exhorts the
children to teachableness, when their age admits of their understanding what the
passover signifies, and enjoins them diligently to inquire into the use of the
ceremony; that thus religion may be handed down, and may ever flourish amongst
the people. Since, then, the Paschal Lamb corresponds with the Holy Supper, we
may gather from hence, that none can be duly admitted to receive it, but those
who are capable of being taught.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>43.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is the ordinance of the
passover.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Since the passover was the
sacred bond whereby God would hold the elect people in obligation to Himself, He
forbids all strangers from partaking of it; because a promiscuous permission to
eat of it would have been an unworthy profanation. And in fact, since this is a
supplement to the First Commandment, it only addresses itself to those unto whom
is directed the preface of the Law, "Hear,<i> </i>O Israel; The Lord our God is
one Lord." We know that among the Gentiles none but the initiated 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f317</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
were admitted to their sacred rites. This was an absurd imitation 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f318</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of this true and lawful ordinance; because such a condition is only applicable
to the institution of God, lest strangers should promiscuously usurp the
testimonies of His grace, with which He honors His Church alone. For
circumcision was then like a hedge, which should distinguish heathen nations
from the holy race of Abraham; if, then, any should wish to celebrate the
passover together with the elect people, it was necessary that he should be
circumcised, so as to attach himself to the true God; though God did not merely
refer to the outward sign, but to the object, viz., that all who were
circumcised should promise to study sincere piety. Moses, therefore, first of
all, excludes all strangers who were unclean through their uncircumcision; and
then he adds two exceptions, viz., that servants bought with money should be
circumcised, (which was a necessary requirement;) and that free and independent
persons, if they chose to embrace the same alternative, should also be received
to the passover. Hence it appears that this rite was not only peculiar to God's
people, but that it was a sign of the future redemption. For strangers could not
testify that they were sharers in that redemption which had been promised to the
race of Abraham alone; and, therefore, the ceremony of the sacred feast would
have been vain and useless to them. Nor does Moses refer only to that mixed
multitude which had followed the Israelites out of Egypt; but prescribes a law
respecting all strangers, who for many succeeding ages should come on business
into the land. No doubt but that, in celebrating the passover, they would have
expected another redemption; since that which was already vouchsafed to the
children of Abraham had not extended to them. For although they might be
reckoned among the people, yet did no portion of the land in consequence fall to
their lot, nor was their condition improved as to temporal rights; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f319</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but it was only that they might become members of the Church. From the analogy
between the Holy Supper and the Passover, this law remains in force now, viz.,
that no polluted or impure person should intrude himself at the Lord's table,
but that only the faithful should be received, after they have professed
themselves to be followers of Christ. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f320</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And this is expressed also in the words, "One law shall be to him that is
homeborn, and unto the stranger," etc., ver. 49; viz., that the ordinance of the
sacrament should be solemnly observed by all, and that thus they should equally
participate in the grace offered to them in common, and that in this respect the
condition of all should be equal, though it differed as to their inheritance of
the land.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>46.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Neither shall ye break a bone
thereof.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I am not certain why God
desired no bone to be broken; unless that this might also be a sign of haste;
because people at table seldom partake of the marrow, unless when their
entertainment is protracted. For I fear there is too much subtlety in the
explanation which some give, that the virtue of Christ, which is represented by
the bones, is not diminished whilst we feed on His flesh. But the former opinion
which I have glanced at above, as it is the simplest, so also it is by no means
unsuitable here; that they were commanded, when they were standing in readiness
for their journey, and eating hurriedly, to burn the bones in order to prevent
all delay. What God commanded as to the lamb, He chose to have openly fulfilled
in the person of His only-begotten Son; that the truth corresponding with its
type, and the substance with its shadow, might shew that God would be reconciled
to His people by no other blood than Christ's. Whence it is again clear that the
ancients under the Law were instructed by the Paschal Lamb as to the future
redemption, for otherwise this passage could not have been properly accommodated
to Christ. But when the Evangelist quotes it,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431933&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
19:33,) he takes it for granted that thus was typically shewn what God would
bestow by His Son. Hence it came to pass that He was distinguished by this
visible mark, which proved Him to be the true Passover. But, in order that no
bone of Christ's should be broken, God's providence wonderfully interfered. The
soldiers were commanded to hasten the death of Christ, no less than that of the
robbers, by breaking their bones. They execute their intention on the robbers,
but lest they should attempt the same on Christ, it is certain that they were
restrained by a divine power, so that the wholeness of His bones might be a
presage of the approaching
redemption.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">Exodus

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses said unto the
people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He repeats what he had said more at
length in the foregoing chapter, respecting<i> </i>the unleavened bread, not so
much to instruct as to exhort them; for he had already expressed the matter with
so much clearness, that there was no need of further explanation; but it was
useful to stimulate them, that they might devote themselves with greater zeal to
their duty, and especially lest, after a longer lapse of time, their ardor
should, as usual, gradually abate. He therefore exhorts them, that after they
cane into the land, they should diligently observe what he had before commanded.
And from the context here, it is plain that the two commands as to the
sanctifying the first-born, and celebrating the passover, had the same object,
viz., that their deliverance should retain the elect<i> </i>people in the
special service of the true
God.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
This day came ye out.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He compares the
day of their coming out with the whole time of their sojourning in the land of
Canaan; as if he had said that they were redeemed not to enjoy a mere transient
joy, but that they might be<i> </i>mindful of their blessing throughout all
ages. He proceeds to eulogize the extent and the fertility of the land again,
principally for two reasons. The first is, lest after such glorious victories
pride should possess their minds, and in the abundance of their good things
their eyes should be closed by fatness;the second, that by the very multitude of
their possessions they might be the more incited to the duty of gratitude, and
to the service of God. For it might be that the conquerors of so many nations,
and the lords of so rich and extensive a territory would wax wanton, so as to be
less devoted to God's service, unless they had been reminded that they owed it
to God alone that they had conquered so many peoples, and had obtained dominion
over them. But Moses shews them that, in proportion to God's goodness to them,
so would they be the more inexcusable, if they did not earnestly labor to
testify heir gratitude. With this object he repeats the names of the nations, by
the destruction of which they were to become inheritors of the land; and then
adds, "a<i> </i>land flowing with milk and honey," in order to arouse them still
more and more to piety by the great profusion of the blessings which would be<i>
</i>ever before their eyes. Those are entirely mistaken who suppose that the
month <i>Abib
</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f321</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is the same as <i>Ab, </i>which corresponds with our July. For it is evident
that the Israelites came out of Egypt in the month <i>Nisan, </i>about the
vernal equinox; of which circumstance, the keeping of Easter, handed down by
tradition from our forefathers, is an unquestionable proof. Now, since the
Hebrews borrowed from the Chaldeans all the names of their months, which were in
use two thousand years after, it would be absurd in this place to regard <i>Abib
</i>as a proper name, especially when, in Scripture, we nowhere find the months
designated by proper names. Since, then, reason demonstrates that this word is
applied appellatively, we must inquire why it is applied to March or the
beginning of April. Those who translate <i>A bib</i> "ripening<i> </i>fruits,"
have no ground for it, since the word simply means "anything which grows;" hence
it is applied to the stalks of corn; and because in those warm climates the corn
rises to its height about the vernal equinox, from this fact, <i>Nisan </i>is
called the month of stalks. It is also a probable conjecture, (as we have
already said,) that the beginning of the year was changed, in order that the
nativity of the Church might receive more distinction; as if the world were then
renewed. The opinion of some that Noah came out of the ark in the same month, so
that the temperature of spring might receive him in his new birth, as well as
the other animals, I leave undecided as I have done on Genesis 8. But if this
opinion be accepted, there will be an anticipation <i>(prolepsis) </i>in the
name of the months; and in this there will be an absurdity, because it was
useful for the people to be accustomed to the rites of the Law. But I do not
enter into controversy about
uncertainties.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt shew thy son
in that day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He repeats what we have
already remarked, viz., an injunction to parents to teach their children, that
they may thus transmit the service of God to their descendants. In the preceding
chapter it was said, "when your children shall say unto you,"<i> </i>etc.;<i>
</i>and now he more briefly commands that God's goodness should be proclaimed,
although none should make inquiry respecting it; because parents ought to be
voluntarily disposed to educate their children in the fear of God. He also
repeats, as we have seen above, that the memory of their deliverance should be
annually renewed lest it should ever fade away, since religion is easily
neglected unless men are diligently exercised in its study, tie uses a
comparison when he says, "it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and
for a memorial between thine eyes;" as though it had been said that their
redemption should be set before their eyes in the passover, just as the ring
which is on the finger, or the ornament which is bound upon the forehead are
constantly seen. For which purpose also he had before desired that the precepts
of the Law should be inscribed both on the head, and on the hands, and fringes
of their garments. The sum is, that in the passover a monument of God's grace
should exist, so that it might never sink into oblivion; just as ornaments which
appear on the forehead and on the fingers awaken the attention by their being
constantly beheld. But, if any should rather be of opinion that Moses alludes to
those who, conscious of their own faithlessness, contrive means to assist their
memory, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f322</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I offer them no opposition; as if he had said that, since they were disposed to
forgetfulness, they should use this remedy, to awaken themselves to gratitude.
He will soon afterwards repeat the same injunction, in connection with the
offering of the first-born. The following words, "that<i> </i>the Lord's Law may
be in thy mouth," confirm the opinion that the passover has reference to the
First Commandment. They intimate that it is not enough to perform the external
rite, unless it be associated with its proper object, viz., that they should
devote themselves to God and to His doctrine. He mentions the mouth, not because
the main thing is, to speak or discourse of the Law, for if piety lay in the
tongue, hypocrites would be the best worshippers of God; but he expressly
requires that, when each one shall have privately applied himself to the study
of the Law, they shall also mutually teach and exhort each
other.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">Deuteronomy

reminded of their having escaped in haste, as it were from the very flames;
therefore does Moses so often enforce the prohibition of leaven. And here this
reason for it is alleged, viz., that their recollection should be recalled to
the affliction from which they were rescued; for they must needs have been
involved in the greatest straits, when there was no time even for baking bread.
Unleavened bread is therefore called "the bread of affliction," that the manner
of their deliverance may the more enhance God's grace. He repeats what we have
seen before, that none of the flesh of the Lamb should be reserved to the
following day. In the former passage from the Book of Exodus, because Moses
speaks generally, the command may at first sight be referred to the perpetual
sacrifice; but the latter passage takes away all obscurity, by the express
mention of the passover. We need not wonder that in one place the word "fat"<i>
</i>is used for the whole carcase, or any part of the lamb, either by
<i>synecdoche, </i>or that God might commend the superior sanctity of the fat,
of which they were not permitted to eat, and which was burnt in all
sacrifices.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">Numbers

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord spake unto
Moses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We may infer how great was the
carelessness, nay, even the ingratitude of the people, from the fact that God
recalls to their recollection the celebration of the passover, before a year had
elapsed. For what would they do fifty years hence, if there was any danger of
their falling into forgetfulness of it in so short a time? If they had been
voluntarily assiduous in their duty, it would have been unnecessary to repeat
what had been so severely enjoined even with threats. But now God, as the year
came to a close, reminds them that the day approaches on which He had fixed the
passover to be held; that the Israelites might more surely learn that this
solemn sacrifice is of yearly recurrence, and thus that it was sinful to omit
it. He then commands that all the ceremonies should be diligently observed, and
that they should not corrupt the pure institution with any strange leaven.
Finally, their obedience is praised, because they had neither added anything to,
nor diminished anything from, God's
command.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And there were certain
men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>A question is here introduced
incidentally, viz., what must be done, if any sudden defilement should prevent
any persons from celebrating the passover with the rest; since God would expunge
from amongst His people whosoever should not observe this memorial of their
redemption? Although the history is here touched upon, yet because the doctrine
as to the just and pure observance of the passover is its main subject, nay,
because this passage is a kind of supplement to the general command, I have
thought it proper to connect them here. Moses says that certain men were found
defiled over the soul of a man, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f323</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
viz., either because they had touched a dead body, or had gone into a house of
mourning, or had been present at the funeral of a dead man; for the Law
accounted such to be polluted, as will be seen elsewhere. Hence arose a kind of
discrepancy; because, whilst the unclean were not permitted to approach the
sacred feast, it was sinful to neglect this exercise of religion. Even Moses
confessed that he was perplexed as to this matter, since he sought for time to
inquire of God. The extraordinary modesty of the Prophet here displays itself,
in not daring to pronounce on a doubtful matter, although he was their lawgiver.
But he thus more clearly shewed that he by no means gave the Law out of his own
head, since he did not dare even to interpret it, except after receiving a new
command. God, therefore, by laying down a special exception, takes away the
contradiction
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajntinomi&gt;an</font><font face="Palatino">).
For to those, whom just necessity excused, He assigns the second month, that
they too might be partakers of the passover, though they might not change the
day at their own option. By this privilege He not only relieves the unclean, but
also those who might be at a distance 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f324</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
from the society of their fellows, concerning whom the same question might be
raised. For it was not suitable that any one should eat the passover by himself;
and even if a family were too small, the neighbors were called in, that the
number might be sufficient to eat the whole lamb; and therefore, the traveler
abroad, or even at home, if he was far from his friends, had need of some remedy
to preserve him from punishment. Moreover, we must remember that this was not a
concession to despisers, nor was profane carelessness encouraged by this
indulgence; but it was only a provision for the necessity of those who had
inadvertently contracted defilement, or who could not escape<i> </i>it, or who
were unexpectedly<i> </i>delayed on their journey. For they are said to have
complained of their own accord to Moses that, on account of their uncleanness,
they were prevented from eating the paschal lamb; and hence we infer their pious
solicitude. For such, then, another passover is permitted; that, in the second
month, they might recover what they had lost without their fault. Meanwhile it
is strictly enjoined on them that they should change nothing in the whole
ceremony; and on this account, what we have already seen is again repeated,
viz., that they should eat it with bitter herbs, that they should not break a
bone of it, and the like. But, that the permission might not be extended too
far, the penalty is again denounced, if any, except for these two causes, should
have neglected to celebrate the passover. For we know how men, unless they are
restrained, permit themselves too great license in searching out excuses. It is
more clearly expressed here than before, that the paschal lamb was a victim; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f325</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for it is said in verse 7, "wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an
offering?" and in ver. 13, "because he brought not the offering of the Lord." I
call attention to this, because there are some who think that the paschal lamb
was so slain as not to be the offering of a sacrifice; whereas Paul distinctly
teaches that a victim was offered in it, and then the feast annexed to it; for
such is the meaning of his words, "Christ our Passover is sacrificed<i> </i>for
us; therefore let us keep the feast," etc<i>.

First Commandment, because God asserts His right over the first-born, lest the
recollection<i> </i>of their redemption should ever be lost. For thus were the
Israelites admonished that they must honor that God by whose grace<i> </i>they
had escaped in safety from the common destruction of Egypt, and, moreover, that
they were rescued by His special blessing, in order that they should
consecrate<i> </i>themselves to God their Deliverer. For the offering which He

The first-born is called the opening of the womb, because<i> </i>it is the
beginning of generation. The expression, "among<i> </i>the children of Israel,"
when he is speaking of brutes, as well as of their own offspring and children,
is meant to distinguish the wild beasts from the tame and domestic animals. But
although He commands only the first-born of the race of Abraham to be offered to
Him, still this must undoubtedly be extended to the sanctification of the whole
people; for whilst He says, that the first-born were His, because they
especially owed their preservation to His mercy, yet for the same reason he
signifies that all were His own.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall be when the Lord

to the consecration of the first-born, that in this way they should bear witness

be brought to Him, in order that they should be slain in the tabernacle. It is a

placed in God's sight when they entered the tabernacle. I conceive that they
were ordered, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;022230&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
22:30, to keep the first-born seven days, in order to prevent deceptions,
because<i> </i>if the young had been earlier torn from the teats of their dams,
and immediately delivered to the priests, the offering would have been useless.
Yet I doubt not that the eighth day was chosen because it was the one prescribed
for circumcision. An exception is added, that a price should be paid for an ass,
the offering of which would have been unclean. With regard to their children, it
was requisite that they should be redeemed, because they could not be offered in
sacrifice, nor made
priests.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">Exodus

was to be, viz., that they should redeem their children as well as the unclean

to Him, because He had chosen the tribe of Levi, as we shall see elsewhere; they
were therefore to remain free and in their own power after a pecuniary
compensation. In the same way, unclean animals might be applied to domestic
purposes, viz., after God's price had been paid, since to Him they belonged, and
He claimed them for Himself. But if any should not put so high a value on an ass
or other unclean animal, the Law commanded that its neck should be broken; for
otherwise it would have been sacrilege to reap profit from God's property, or,
what is the same, to transfer to their private use what God had adjudged to
Himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">Leviticus

provides against this sin by forbidding the first-born to be offered to Him,

not, by consecrating to God what is already due to Him, steal from Him in their
fictitious liberality what is consecrated and not their own. Nor let us be
surprised at this law, because this ambition is<b> </b>almost natural to us all,

therefore to seek for various grounds of boasting of religious duties, which,
after all, are nought. And, undoubtedly, if this restraint had not been put upon
the Jews, they would have aimed at the reputation of double zeal by this

to deprive God of what was His

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When thou takest the sum of the
children of Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The tribute which
God here demands at the taking of the census, is very fitly annexed to the First
Commandment; for God, in making them tributary to Himself, shews that they were
under His jurisdiction and power; and because He had purchased them to Himself,
He willed that this voluntary gift of acknowledgment should be paid to Him.
Princes, in numbering their subjects, make an estimate of their power; but God,
who needs not the aid and assistance of men, would have the Israelites testify,
at least by some sign, that they live in subjection to Him by whom they were
redeemed. Therefore, when David numbered the people,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;102402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 24:2,) it was a kind of emancipation of them from their subjection to
God; and hence this pride, or temerity, or ingratitude, was so severely
punished. But because it was useful and right that the people should be
numbered, it is permitted upon this condition, that by paying a <i>ransom
</i>for every individual, they should acknowledge God as their sole King. The
word is not badly rendered by some an <i>atonement </i>or <i>expiation,
</i>because, whilst they confessed that they owed their life to God, He was
appeased towards them on the score of this testimony of their gratitude. But it
may be derived from a word meaning <i>to cover; </i>for when they voluntarily
subjected themselves to God, and fled beneath the shelter of his wings, they
were protected and secure, under this <i>covering. </i>Therefore it is said
below, that this gift was offered to God as "an atonement for their souls;" and
this is expressed in other words, that there should "be no plague" or
destruction among them, because their safety rested in God's protection alone,
that they should not be exposed to any evils. And since they had been Pharaoh's
servants, their freedom would have been unlawful unless God had authorized and
maintained it. Wherefore it was just. that they should ascribe their deliverance
by a solemn rite to God, lest they should suffer the punishment of fugitive
slaves. But He appointed the same sum for all, that every one, of whatever rank,
from the least, to the greatest, might know that they were altogether His. Nor
need we wonder, that since this was a personal due, (as it is commonly phrased,)
their condition was not taken into account, so that the rich should pay more
than the poor, but that the same price should be paid for every soul. The shekel
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f329</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of the sanctuary was equivalent to an Attic <i>tetra-drachma, </i>which Budaeus
estimates at 14 sols French, or thereabouts; for the <i>didrachma </i>amounts to
seven sols, and the common <i>drachma </i>to three and a half sols, <i>minus a
denier Tournois. </i>This is the didrachma of which mention is made in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401724&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
17:24; for when the Jews were conquered by the Romans, it is probable that, in
order to make their yoke more galling, this right of tribute was transferred to
their conquerors. For this divinely prescribed offering being the symbol of
their freedom, exempted the Jews from all heathen dominion, as if free or only
belonging to God. But. since by their own rebellion they had shaken off God's
yoke, He purposely suffered them to be despoiled of their right, in order to
subject them to the tyranny of strangers. And this occurred just before Christ's
coming, that this new and unwonted oppression might increase their longing for
Him. But inasmuch as this tribute was paid by command of the Law, the Jews were
reminded that they were a people consecrated to
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">Another

appointed a tribute for every soul, whereby the Israelites were to acknowledge
that they were His children. By that profession, then, he bound them all to
Himself from the least to the greatest. A closer tie of obligation is now
treated of, when any should voluntarily devote himself to God for a season.
These were called Nazarites, which is equivalent to <i>separate </i>or
<i>select, </i>because there was greater dignity or excellence in them than in
the common people. For they were as ornaments to the Church, and God willed that
His peculiar glory should shine brightly in them. When, therefore, Amos
expostulates with them
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;300211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos
2:11) because they had prevented the prophets from exercising their office, and
had corrupted the Nazarites with wine, he says, in amplification of their crime,
that they bad been honored with a special blessing, when God had created of
their sons Nazarites and prophets. And when Jeremiah deplores the desolation of
the Church, he insists on this corruption, that their Nazarites no longer
appeared as of old, "purer than snow," etc.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;250407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Lamentations
4:7.) Nor is it to be doubted, that when Jacob distinguished Joseph his son by
the title of a Nazarite 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f330</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
among his brethren,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014926&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
49:26,) he alluded in the spirit of prophecy to that degree of honor in which
afterwards, under the Law, they stood who separated themselves unto God, as the
lights of the Church. Therefore, although this consecration pertained not to the
whole people, yet it should be deservedly reckoned amongst the exercises of
piety, because the Nazarites were like standard-bearers to shew others the way;
and though they did not attract all to follow their example, yet the ardor of
their zeal was of no little advantage to the weak and inexperienced, exciting
them forwards according to their capacity.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now,
because God abominates all fictitious worship, he put a restraint on their
licentiousness, by giving them a clear and certain rule. And, from the testimony
of Amos which I have just quoted, it is gathered that God alone was the
appointer of the Nazarite vow. We must remember, then, that the Nazarites shone
among the people of God like precious jewels, and although few imitated them,
yet that they were as standard-bearers and leaders to awaken zeal amongst the
multitude for the service of God. We must observe, by the way, that Samson was a
Nazarite of another kind, because he did not take the vow upon him only for a
season, but was sanctified from the womb for his whole life, and separated from
the rest of the people; in which respect, too, he was a type of Christ, and
represented Him, as it were. And surely whatever is here taught should be
referred to the sole Fountain of sanctity, as if the image of Christ had been
set before the eyes of the Jews in a mirror. For the nearer any one under the
Law approached to God, the more did Christ shine forth in him. We know that the
whole priesthood of the Law was nothing but His image. The same may be said of
the Nazarites, whose purity and abstinence ornamented them with peculiar
dignity.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shall separate himself
from wine.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The first injunction is, that
they should not only abstain from wine, but that they should not even taste
grapes or anything connected with wine. The simple observance was, that they
should not drink wine or anything inebriating; but, because men are crafty in
inventing subterfuges, it was necessary to express specifically the means
whereby the Law might be defrauded. Thus, in abstaining from wine, they would
not have deprived themselves of luxuries, either by indulging in fresh or dried
grapes, or by mixing water with grapes and expressing their juice, or by
imitating the sweetness of wine by other delicate preparations. Hence<i> </i>it
appears how many secret recesses and lurking-places are possessed by man's
hypocrisy, whilst it shamelessly imagines stupid means of deception for cheating
God himself. But, at the same time, we must remark that this subtlety was
intolerable to God, who is pleased by nothing so much as sincerity. We shall
also see elsewhere that the priests, when they were executing their office by
turns in the Temple, were forbidden the use of wine. This similarity proves what
I have already said, that the Nazarites were thus separated from the multitude,
that they might approach to the honor of the priesthood. But abstinence from
wine was enjoined not only that they might avoid drunkenness, but that their
whole mode of living might be more temperate and frugal; for the drinking of
wine is well known to be among the chief pleasures of the table, and those who
are not abstentious will rather content themselves with moderate and common food
than bear to be deprived of wine. We may, then, learn from hence, that a sober
use of wine is a most important part of temperate living; and in all gluttony
and intemperance, this is most to be condemned, when men have too great a love
of excess in wine-drinking. It is then astonishing that when the monks under the
Papacy boast of their angelical perfection, they should with one accord refuse
to abstain from wine. With many 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f331</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
it is sinful to touch during their whole life a bit of beef or pork, and they
would glory in being martyrs, if they obstinately preferred to die rather than
to eat meat in a case of necessity; but their temperance is so inconsistent,
that this austerity as to food acquires for them the greater license in
drinking, as if they purposely avenged themselves in this way. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f332</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Wherefore nothing can be more insufferable than their boasting, since this
abstinence in eating alone is a mere mockery of
God.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall no razor come
upon his head.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It cannot be certainly
determined why God would have the Nazarites let their hair grow, except that by
this present mark of their consecration, they might be more and more reminded of
their vow. Some think that it was a mark of honor, as if they wore a crown on
their heads. In this the Popish clergy are more than ridiculous, comparing
themselves to the Nazarites by their circular tonsure. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f333</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But this reason satisfies myself, that God would constantly exercise them in the
faithful performance of their vow by this visible sign. It is a mark of manhood
to cut the hair, and this, as Paul says, a natural feeling dictates.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461114&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 11:14.) Therefore, the dedication of the Nazarites was shewn
conspicuously by their heads, lest they should fail in their own vows through
carelessness or forgetfulness. A question arises respecting the women, for whom
this command appears superfluous; but this is easily answered, that they were
thus bound to let their hair grow, so as to have it long not only from custom,
but in accordance with their vow. Yet there will be nothing absurd in the
<i>synecdoche, </i>whereby that is spoken of both the sexes which applies only
to the males. Here also the devil formerly played his game, when he persuaded
certain monks, as Augustine relates, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f334</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to make a shew of sanctity by wearing long hair; for, in order that the celibacy
which they had vowed might be more conspicuous, they would not allow themselves
to be men, having "made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake;"<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401912&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
19:12;) and, therefore, their long hair was a sign of their virginity. This
example teaches us to beware of the wiles of Satan, lest our
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kakozhli&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>make us rather the apes than the imitators of the
ancients.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shall come at no dead
body.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This, too, they had in common with
the high-priest, that they were not even to mourn for their relations. Although
Moses enjoins two things, that the Nazarites should make themselves unclean
neither by entering the house of mourning, nor by mourning themselves, it was
indeed a duty of humanity to bury the dead; but if any of the people had touched
a dead body, or had come near a death-bed or bier, they were polluted. But God
demands more of the Nazarites, lest, they should contract uncleanness; for it
was not sufficient for them (as will be seen again presently)to purify
themselves according to the accustomed means, but it behoved them to be far
removed from all things that would pollute them. But why the touch of a dead
body was a pollution, we shall consider more at large in its proper place. Now
it must be briefly concluded, that because by death is represented God's curse,
the wages of sin, the Israelites were thus admonished to beware of dead works. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f335</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
As to the mourning, the reason of the prohibition was different, viz., that
those who professed the special service of God, should set, an example to others
of magnanimity and submission. If it were sinful to weep and lament when our
friends are taken from us, Christ would not, have wept. at the tomb of Lazarus;
but because perturbation is always associated with grief, and men in their
mourning are too apt to give way to ambition and pomp, and voluntarily and
purposely provoke themselves to excess, as though nature did not already carry
them further than is right, the Nazarites could not give an example of
moderation, if they had mixed themselves with mourners. Wherefore, as they were
before restrained from daintiness, so now a remedy is applied to the opposite
disease, viz., to sorrow. But, although all ought, to seek to indulge it
moderately, yet something more is prescribed to the Nazarites, that, as if
disentangled and stripped from earthly affections, they should go further than
the rest of the people; as we shall see hereafter with respect to the
priests.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if any man die very
suddenly.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here is prescribed what must
be done, if a defilement should have been contracted which no precaution could
have prevented. If a Nazarite should have willingly and knowingly entered a
house of mourning, or should have come near a dead body, his consecration would
have been violated not without, sin; but, in the case of a sudden death, the
error was excusable, though God commands that it should be expiated; for
whatever time of the vow had passed He counts for nothing, nor will it be taken
into account. This was no light punishment, that he, who had been guilty of no
fault, should begin to pay his vow altogether afresh. Besides the loss of the
time, a sacrifice is also added, whereby he who was polluted should prepare
himself for a new consecration. But, because this consecration was voluntary,
none could complain of the immoderate rigor to which he had subjected himself of
his own accord. Meanwhile, it was shewn how precious to God is the purity of His
worship.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f336</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Two Hebrew words from different roots, though they are of kindred signification,
are used, by which mode of speaking Moses wished more fully to express the
unexpected nature of the death. For, in my opinion, it is puerile of the Jews to
understand the first of a bloody murder, the other of a sudden
death.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And this is the law of the
Nazarites.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses now shews at last how,
after the full period of the vow, the Nazarites must return to their common
life. And, first, he commands them to place themselves at the door of the
tabernacle; then, to offer there a lamb without spot for a burnt-offering, a
ewe-lamb for a sin-offering, and a ram for peace-offerings, with cakes of fine
flour mingled with oil, wafers, and unleavened bread, and meat-offering, and
drink-offerings. As to the peace-offering, because it was presented in
thanksgiving, it was by no means inappropriate; nor the burnt-offering either,
because they might justly congratulate themselves, and celebrate God's goodness,
when they had discharged their pious duty, since God had vouchsafed them no
ordinary honor. But what was meant by the sin-offering may be questioned, since
expiation was needless for the pure and holy. Here we clearly perceive, that
however cheerfully and earnestly men endeavor to offer themselves altogether to
God, yet they never attain to the goal of perfection, nor arrive at what they
desire, but are always exposed to God's judgment, unless He should pardon their
sins. Whence it appears how base is the Papists' folly, when they dream of
appeasing God by works of supererogation. For, if ever any supererogation were
pleasing to God, the holiness of the Nazarites, being testified to by the Law,
was worthy of this honor; yet God, when the work is complete, commands them to
confess their guilt, and suffers not this service to intrude into the place of
merit, but requires of them a sacrifice, that they may borrow from elsewhere
what belongs not to themselves, though they appear to be the most perfect of all
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">Another

offer their first-fruits, for the same reason that they were to pay the tribute
for every soul; viz., that they might confess that they themselves, and all that
they had, belonged to God. This was the only distinction, that the tribute was a
symbol of their emancipation, that they might acknowledge themselves to be free,
as having been redeemed by the special mercy of God; but by the firstfruits they
testified that the land was tributary to God, and that they were masters of it
by no other title than as tenants at will, so that the direct sovereignty and
property of it remained with God alone. This, then, was the object of the
first-fruits, that they might renew every year the recollection of their
adoption; because the land of Canaan was given to them as their peculiar
inheritance, in which they were to worship God in piety and holiness, and at the
same time reflect that they were not fed promiscuously, like the Gentiles, by
God, but like children; whence also their food was sacred. But we shall have to
speak again elsewhere of the first-fruits, in as much as they were a part of the
oblations; yet it was necessary to insert here their main object, that we might
know that they were appointed to be offered by the people, in pious
acknowledgment that their food was received from God, and to shew that, being
separated from other nations, they were dependent upon the God of Israel
alone.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That thou shalt take of the

therefore, bore in them a testimony of their piety to Him, whom they daily
experienced to be their preserver, and the giver of their food. This typical
rite has now, indeed, ceased, but Paul tells us that the true observation of it
still remains, where he exhorts us, whether we eat or drink, to do all to the
glory of God.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461031&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:31.) As to the place where the first-fruits were to be offered,
and why God is said to have placed His name there, we shall hereafter consider,
when we come to the sacrifices; I now only briefly touch upon what concerns the
present subject.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I profess
this day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In these words the Israelites
confess that they had not gained dominion of the land either by their own
strength or good fortune, but by the free gift of God, and that according to His
promise. There are, therefore, two clauses in this sentence; <i>first, </i>that
God had gratuitously promised to grant that land to Abraham as the inheritance
of his descendants; and, <i>secondly, </i>that He had performed His promise, not
only when He had brought the children of Abraham into possession, but by adding'
to His grace by their peaceful enjoyment of it. He pursues the same point more
fully immediately afterwards, where the Israelites are commanded to declare how
wretched was the condition of their fathers, before the Lord embraced them with
His favor, and vouchsafed unto them His mercy. The original word in verse 5,
meaning to <i>answer, </i>I translate simply, according to the Hebrew idiom, to
<i>speak </i>or <i>say; </i>unless to <i>testify </i>be thought better, which
would be very suitable; for the solemn profession is here described, whereby
they bound themselves every year to God. They do not count their origin from
Abraham, but from Jacob, in whose person God's grace shone forth more brightly;
for being compelled to fly from the land of Canaan, he had spent a good part of
his life in Syria, (for he did not return home, till he was old,) and then,
being again driven into Egypt by the famine, he had at length died there. The
land had not, therefore, fallen to them by hereditary right, nor by their own
efforts; their father Jacob not having been permitted even to sojourn there.
They call him a Syrian, because when he had married Laban's daughters, and had
begotten children, and was stricken in years before he had returned home, he
might seem to have renounced the land of Canaan. Since then he had been content
for many years with the dwelling which he chose for himself in Syria, his
descendants justly confessed that he was a pilgrim and stranger, because of his
long exile; and for the same reason that they also might be counted foreigners.
They add that their father Jacob again abandoned the land of Canaan when he was
forced by the famine to go down into Egypt; and whilst they recount that he
sojourned there with a few, and afterwards grew into a mighty nation, they thus
acknowledge that they were Egyptians, since they had sprung from thence, where
was the beginning of their name and race. In the rest of the passage they
further confirm the fact that they were led into the land of Canaan by the hand
of God; because when they were oppressed by tyranny, they cried unto Him, and
were heard. They are commanded also to celebrate the signs and wonders whereby
their redemption was more clearly manifested, in order that they should
unhesitatingly give thanks to God, and contrast His pure worship with all the
imaginations of the heathen: otherwise, this would have been but a cold exercise
of piety. What follows in the last verse, "And thou shalt rejoice," etc., seems
indeed to have been a promise, as if God, by setting before them the assurance
of His blessing, added a stimulus to arouse the people<i> </i>to more cheerful
affection; but the sense would appear more clear and natural if the <i>copula
</i>were changed into the temporal adverb <i>then; </i>for this is the main
thing in the use of our meat and drink, with a glad and joyful conscience to
accept it as a testimony of God's paternal favor. Nothing is more wretched than
doubt; and therefore Paul especially requires of us this confidence, bidding us
eat not without faith.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451423&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
14:23.) In order, then, to render the Israelites more prompt in their duty,
Moses reminds them that they would only be able to rejoice freely in the use of
God's gifts, if they should have expressed their gratitude as He
commanded.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">Numbers

lively in the bread itself; and, consequently, God would have them present
tokens of their gratitude, not only from the barn, but from the mill, and the
oven, so that whilst they eat their bread also, they might have Him before their
eyes.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">Exodus

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt not

that the first-fruits were offered, to the end that the Israelites should devote
themselves and their possessions to God; for Moses enjoins these two things in
conjunction, that they should not delay to consecrate to God of the abundance of
their fresh fruits, and their first-born. But we know that, in offering the
first-born, the recollection of their deliverance was revived, by the
acknowledgment of the preservation of their race, and of their cattle. And there
was, moreover, added to the grace of their redemption, the continual supply of
food to them from day to day. I do not assent to their opinion who restrict the
word <i>fullness</i>
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f338</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to wine, because it flows more abundantly from the press, and take the word
<i>tear
</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f338a</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to mean oil, because it runs less freely; nor do I approve of their notion
who apply<i> fullness </i>only to dry fruits. It seems to me more proper to take
<i>fullness </i>as the generic term, whilst <i>tear </i>is taken to denote
liquids, as if Moses commanded them not only to offer grapes, and olive-berries,
but the very drops which were expressed from the fruit. The other passages
confirm this command, that they should not defraud God of the first-fruits, and
so bury the remembrance of their redemption, and profane themselves in their
very eating and drinking, but rather by this portion of the fruits sanctify the
food of the whole year. Nor is it causelessly that Moses so often inculcates a
point by no means obscure, since all these admonitions were despised and
neglected by the Jews, as soon as they had returned from the Babylonish
captivity, as Malachi complains in his third

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If a woman have conceived
seed. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This ceremony had reference to two
points; for, first, the Jews were reminded by it of the common corruption of our
nature; and <i>secondly, </i>the remedy of the evil was set before them. There
is little difficulty in understanding why a woman who has conceived and given
birth to a child, should be pronounced unclean; viz., because the whole race of
Adam is polluted and defiled, so that the woman already contracts uncleanness
from the offspring which she bears in the womb, and is further contaminated by
giving it birth. Hence it appears how foul and disgusting in God's sight is our
condition, since at our birth, and even before it, we infect our mothers. It has
been almost universally, but very absurdly, considered that nothing is here
condemned but libidinous intercourse between male and female; whereas the
purification is not required except there be offspring; and to this the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[yrzt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>thazriang, </i>refers, which can only be properly translated by
<i>insemination, </i>and therefore it must be carefully observed that impurity
in intercourse is not generally condemned here, but in generation. For the
cohabitation of man and woman in itself, without reference to offspring, is a
matter of shame and indecency; but here the procreation of children, which
should remove this indecency, is accounted the cause of pollution, because the
whole race of Adam is full of contagion. Hence the error of Pelagius 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f339</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is clearly refuted, who denied that the sin of Adam was propagated among his
descendants, and pretended that we contracted sin from our parents not by
origin, but by imitation. For the mother would not be unclean if the children
were pure and free from all defilement. Therefore God would by this rite teach
His ancient, people that all men are born accursed, and bring into the world
with them an hereditary corruption which pollutes their very mothers. If any
object that holy matrimony is thus brought into disgrace and disrepute, the
reply is easy, that if the marriage couch is free from stain, it is due to the
indulgence of God. When therefore the husband and wife procreate children in
lawful wedlock, it is not to be considered simply permitted, as if the
generation were altogether without impurity, but by special privilege and
indulgence; because the sanctity of marriage covers what otherwise might be
imputed to blame, and purifies the very defilements of our guilty nature. Whence
it is plain that marriage, through which the procreation of children becomes<i>
</i>lawful, has nothing disgraceful about it. Yet it does not follow that the
children who are thus engendered are holy and free from stain; for those who are
born to unbelievers, remain under the guilt of the curse; and those who owe
their birth to believers, are delivered from the common perdition by
supernatural grace, and special adoption. And this God desired openly and
distinctly to testify, by requiring a sacrifice for their purification. For
although Moses seems only to speak of the mother, St. Luke, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">f340</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
his faithful interpreter, includes also the infant. If it be asked whether
circumcision would not suffice to remove the stain of corrupt nature, I reply
that hence it more clearly appears how great is our impurity, since God was not
content with one symbol for its expurgation, but in order that He might exercise
His people in continual meditation upon it, added another subsidiary sign, and
did this especially because<i> </i>He knew how profound is men's hypocrisy, with
what self-complacency they flatter themselves in vice, how difficult it is to
humble their pride, and, when they are forced to acknowledge their miseries, how
easily forgetfulness creeps over them. Wherefore, when circumcision is expressly
mentioned here, I presume it is by anticipation, lest the Israelites should
object that circumcision was given them for the very purpose of altogether
removing the curse; and therefore God signifies that, although circumcision
should precede<i> </i>it, still the purification which He here enjoins would not
be superfluous. The foolish comments of the Rabbins on this passage respecting
seed, are both ridiculous in themselves, and unfitted by their filthiness for
modest ears; since, as we have said, the simple intention of Moses was that the
woman should undergo purification, if offspring should follow her intercourse.
Now, since the Son of God, although He was not only pure, but purity itself,
still was the representative of the human race, He subjected himself to the Law;
and (as Paul teaches) submitted Himself to the Law, "to<i> </i>redeem them that
were under the Law." (Galatians 3:13, and 4:5.) And, by this His voluntary
submission to it, He abrogated the old rite; so that it is not now necessary to
bring infants to the visible tabernacle with the sacrifices, but all purity is
to be sought in Himself.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And she shall then
continue.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The uncleanness of seven days
in the case of a male, and fourteen days for a female, has reference to the
hemorrhage, as we shall also see elsewhere of the menstrual discharge. For the
remainder of the time she is forbidden to take part in religious services, and
to approach the sanctuary, (by which word the court is here meant,) and thus is
accounted unholy, not only that she should herself lament her condition, but
that her husband also, admonished by the sight, should learn to abhor and detest
original sin. For this was a serious exhortation to repentance, when they
acknowledged that they were contaminated in their offspring, wherein otherwise
God:s blessing manifests itself. The question now arises, why the time of
purification is double for a female child? Some ascribe this to a natural cause,
viz., because the hemorrhage is then of longer continuance; and in truth it was
a part of chastity and continence, that husbands should not then come near their
wives. But inasmuch as the object of this ceremony was different, viz., as an
indication of the curse on the whole human race, we must look more attentively
in this direction. I know not whether the view is sound which some take, that
the mother is more defiled by female offspring, because there is more
disposition to vice in this sex. Perhaps, it is more probable, as some think,
that it was because the woman was the beginning of the rebellion, when, being
deceived by the serpent, she destroyed her husband with her, and drew her
posterity into the same ruin. But it seems more correct to me that the
punishment in regard to males was lightened and diminished by circumcision. For
although in that symbol God consecrated both sexes, yet He honored males with
special favor, by engraving His covenant on their
flesh.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Wherefore, also, He expressly mentions
their circumcision, whereby a dignity was imparted to them, which rendered them
superior to females. At the end of the chapter; regard is had to the poor, lest,
being burdened by too great an expense, they might be rendered less ready to
obey the Law: whence we gather that God has no care for outward pomp and wealth,
since the humble sacrifice of the poor, according to the measure of their
poverty, is no less grateful to Him than the more valuable one of the
rich.</font><br></div>

It may he noticed, once for all, that Calvin's references to Rabbinical
expositions of supposed difficulties are generally references to what Sebastian
Munster had inserted at the close of each chapter of his version of the Old
Testament, which is described as follows in the title-page to its second
edition, Basle, 1546:<i> &#8212; </i>"En tibi Lector Hebraica Biblia, Latina
planeque nova Sebast. Munsteri tralatione, post omnes omnium hactenus ubivis
gentium editiones evulgata, et quoad fieri potuit Hebraicae veritati conformata:
adjectis insuper e Rabbinorum commentariis annotationibus." The notion that
Jochebed was included in the enumeration, is mentioned by <i>S.M</i>. in the
annotations on
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014627&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hakh</font><font face="Palatino">.
The persons of that house properly of Jacob's own blood were seventy in number,
as appears from the enumeration in that chapter, including a daughter (v. 15)
and a granddaughter, (v. 17.) The number in Stephen's speech is supposed by many
to be taken from the Septuagint, which says that nine souls were born to Joseph
in Egypt, and so makes the whole amount seventy-five, both in Genesis 46 and in
Exodus 1. But Stephen spoke of the number of his kindred whom Joseph sent for,
and may reasonably be supposed to have meant thereby Jacob and his eleven sons,
with their wives and fifty-three male children, which would amount to
seventy-five souls. &#8212;

Horeb appears to have been the general name of the whole mountainous district,
of which Sinai formed a part. This solution fully meets the objection of certain
modern cavillers, who have argued, at least, against the identity of the author
of the Pentateuch, if not against its inspiration, on the ground that the same
events are recorded as having taken place sometimes on Horeb, sometimes on
Sinai. <i>Vide </i>Hengstenberg on the Genuineness of the Pentateuch, Ryland's

Prof. Hengstenberg quotes this passage from <i>C</i>., and calls it "the
traditional vindication," &#8212; "which leaves quite untouched the point in
which the difficulty peculiarly lies." He also notices the solution of
Michaelis, viz., that the Israelites borrowed with the intention of returning
the goods; as well as other no less unsatisfactory explanations. His own is,
that the idea of a <i>gift</i>,<i> </i>and not a <i>loan</i>,<i> </i>is the only
one which either the circumstances of the case or the language itself admits.
"They, (the Israelites,)" he says, "asked," and this reference leads to a
contest of <i>asking </i>and <i>giving</i>,<i> </i>in which the latter gains the
upper hand. It is immediately connected with "the Lord gave the people favor in
the sight of the Egyptians," and is marked as a consequence of it. The liberal
giving of the Egyptians proceeded from the love and good-will which the Lord
awakened in their hearts towards Israel. He traces the misapprehension to "an
error in the very faulty Alexandrian version, which substitutes <i>lending
</i>for <i>giving</i>.<i> </i>Jerome, who commonly follows it, was led by it to
a similar mistake, and, through him, Luther, who alludes mostly to his
translation &#8212; the Vulgate." <i>&#8212; Hengstenberg</i>,<i> </i>vol. 2.

Calvin's own comment on 2 Thessalonians 2:9, may explain this somewhat obscure
passage, "He gives the names of <i>miracles of falsehood </i>(lying wonders) not
merely to such as are falsely and deceptively contrived by cunning men with a
view to impose upon the simple &#8212; but takes falsehood as consisting in
this, that Satan draws to a contrary end works which otherwise are truly works
of God, and abuses miracles so as to obscure God's glory. In the meantime,
however, there can be no doubt that he deceives by means of enchantments, an
example of which we have in Pharaoh's magicians.

The document called the <i>Interim, </i>drawn up at the suggestion of Charles
V., and published at the Diet of Augsburg in 1548, was professedly a measure of
mutual concession, prescribing what was to be believed in the <i>interim,
</i>"until all could be established by a general council." In reality, however,
it was opposed to the Reformation on all the main points of dispute; and
conceded nothing but that married priests should retain their cures, and that,
where the cup had been again given to the laity, it might be continued. It is
printed at length in <i>Osiander, </i>Ecc. Hist., cent. 16, lib. 2 c. 72; and a

to this we may leave it undecided how far this statement should be connected
with the residence of the Hyksos, a conclusion which there is much to favor;
here we have only to do with the striking rite mentioned in the notice, which
was certainly an ancient mode of expiation, indicating purification, which in
antiquity was often symbolized by ashes. (<i>V. Spencer, De legg</i>,
<i>rituall</i>., s. 3. diss. 3, c. 1.) We shall thus understand the entire
significance, which the procedure had for the Egyptians, inasmuch as a rite
which they regarded as sacred in the sense referred to, was here followed by the
contrary effect, pollution, as is so expressively indicated by our text."

There has been much discussion as to the plant to which this name is given. "In
no instance," says the Illustrated Commentary, "has any plant been suggested,
that at the same time had a sufficient length of stem, to answer the purpose of
a wand or pole, and such detergent qualities, as to render it a fit emblem of
purification." The author himself has no question but. that it was of the genus
<i>Phytolacca</i>; which combines, in a remarkable manner, these two qualities.
Dr. Royle, however, considers it to have been the caper-plant, (<i>Capparis

"Artapanus, an ancient heathen historian, informs us that this was what the more
ignorant Menophites, who lived at a great distance, pretended, though he
confesses that the more learned Heliopolitans, who lived much nearer, owned the
destruction of the Egyptians and the deliverance of the Israelites to have been
miraculous." &#8212; <i>Whiston's Josephus, Notes on Jew. Ant.</i>, 2:16. "At an
early period, historians (particularly in Egypt) hostile to the Jews, asserted
that Moses, well acquainted with the tides of the Red Sea, took advantage of the
ebb, and passed over his army, while the incautious Egyptians, attempting to
follow, were surprised by the flood and perished. Yet, after every concession,
it seems quite evident that, without one particular wind, the ebb-tide, even in
the narrowest part of the channel, could not be kept back long enough to allow a
number of people to cross in safety. We have thus the alternative of supposing
that a man of the consummate prudence and sagacity, and the local knowledge
attributed to Moses, altered, suspended, or at least did not hasten his march,
and thus deliberately involved the people whom he had rescued at so much pains
and risk, in the danger of being overtaken by the enemy, led back as slaves, or
massacred, on the chance that an unusually strong wind would blow at a
particular hour, for a given time, so as to keep back the flood, then die away,
and allow the tide to return at the precise instant when the Egyptians were in
the middle of the passage." &#8212; <i>Milman's Hist. of the Jews</i>, b. 2. Dr.
Kitto says that, in those regions, the blowing of an easterly wind would be in
itself a

<i>C.'s</i> opinion on this subject will be found at greater length in his
<i>Commetary on the Psalms, </i>(Calvin Society's Translation,) vol. 1:539;
3:98, 312, 495; 4:72, 73; 5:312, 320. Perhaps the following note on Psalm 81:2,
may most conveniently embody his sentiments: &#8212; "With respect to the
tabret, harp, and psaltery, we have formerly observed, and shall find it
necessary afterwards to repeat the same remark, that the Levites, under the law,
were justified in making use of instrumental music in the worship of God; it
having been His will to train His people, while they were as yet tender and like
children, by such rudiments, until the coming of Christ. But now, when the clear
light of the Gospel has dissipated the shadows of the law, and taught us that
God is to be served in a simpler form, it would be to act a foolish and mistaken
part to imitate that which the Prophet enjoined only upon those of his own time.
From this it is apparent that the Papists have shown themselves to be very apes
in transferring it to themselves." &#8212; Vol 3, p. 312. Elsewhere he says,
"Paul allows us to bless God in the public assembly of the saints only in a
known tongue.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461416&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 14:16.) The voice of man, although not understood by the generality,
assuredly excels all inanimate instruments of music; and yet we see what St.
Paul determines concerning speaking in an unknown tongue." &#8212; <i>Commentary

<i>S. M.</i> says, in his note on this verse, "Some of the Hebrews understand by
that Prophet, Joshua, who succeeded Moses as ruler; others think Jeremiah must
be meant, who rebuked the people in the same terms as Moses had done. But
Christians who devoutly assert that this passage speaks of Christ, confute the
Jews by referring to what is said in the last chap. of Deut., &#8212; 'There
arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses,' etc. This passage must be
prophetic of some other remarkable Prophet who should not be inferior to Moses,
especially as the text says, <i>like thee,</i> 'that as thou didst deliver the
people from corporal bondage, so shall the prophet whom I will raise up for them
deliver them from the bondage of sin.'" &#8212;

I am indebted to an anonymous writer in that useful little publication, "Notes
and Queries," vol. 5:p. 325, for the following note. Having given a translation
almost identical with that in the text, he adds, "which is as much as to say,
that the sickle (or shekel) equalled 14 solidi, less four deniers; or 13.67
solidi. But owing to the rapid declension in the value of French coin after the
tenth century, it is manifestly impossible to assign a value to these solidi,
unless the precise date of their coinage were known. A writer may, of course,
allude to coin indefinitely precedent to his own time. In the present ease,
however, we may, as a matter of curiosity, <i>analytically </i>approximate to a
result in this way: &#8212; The drachm, is now known to have contained about 65
grains of pure silver, consequently the tetradrachma contained 260 grains. The
present franc contains about 70 grains of pure silver, and consequently the sol,
or 20th part, is 3.5 grains. This last multiplied by 13.67 produces about 48
grains. But the weight of the tetradrachma is 260 grains; therefore the sol with
which the comparison was made, must have contained upwards of fivefold its
present value in pure silver. Now, according to the depreciation tables of M.
Dennis, this condition obtained in 1483, under Charles VIII., at which time
Budaeus was actually living, having been born in 1467; but from other
circumstances I am induced to believe that the solidus Gallicus mentioned by him
was coined by Louis XII. in 1498, at which time the quantity of pure silver was
fourfold and a half that of the present day." Dean Prideaux, <i>Connexion
</i>1:3, says, "Every Jew annually paid a half shekel, <i>i.e., </i>about
eighteenpence of our
money."</font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">ft330</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
