</i></b>PREFACE</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This Volume completes CALVIN&#8217;S COMMENTARIES on
the TWELVE MINOR PROPHETS, &#8212; a Work which, had he written no ether, would
have been sufficient to have rendered him illustrious as a faithful, lucid, and
practical expounder. In course of time, when his Comments shall be carefully
read, his high merits will no doubt be duly acknowledged. The Translator can
bear this testimony, that before he read CALVIN on the Minor Prophets, it was to
him one of the least interesting and the least instructive portions of the
ancient Scriptures; but that he finds it now one of the most interesting. It
practically exhibits to us especially two things, which it greatly concerns us
all to know, &#8212; what God is, and what man is. It sets before us manifest
facts which prove the wonderful mercy and forbearance of God, and also the
amazing tendency of man to superstition, and his persistency in his course
notwithstanding all the powerful means adopted for his
restoration.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">ZECHARIAH began to prophesy two months after HAGGAI,
as we find by comparing
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;370115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Haggai
1:15, with
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;380101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
1:1. Ezra mentions them as the two Prophets who encouraged the rebuilding of the
Temple.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;150501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezra
5:1; 6:14.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The greatest part of ZECHARIAH was written, according
to <i>Lowth, </i>in prose; but he adds that &#8220;some parts about the end of
his Prophecy (Zechariah 9, 10. and the beginning of 11.) are<b> </b>poetical and
highly embellished, and that they are sufficiently perspicuous, though written
by a Prophet, who of all is perhaps the most
obscure.&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm2a</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The testimony of <i>Jerome, </i>as to his obscurity, is the same; he says that
he is &#8220;the most obscure as well as the longest of the Twelve Minor
Prophets.&#8221; <i>Marckius </i>concedes a majestic elegance to his diction,
and says, that &#8220;his enigmatical symbols may be fitly compared with those
of AMOS, EZEKIEL, DANIEL, and of JOHN, the Prophet of the New Testament.&#8221;
&#8220;His prose,&#8221; according to <i>Henderson, </i>&#8220;resembles most
that of EZEKIEL; it is diffuse, uniform and repetitious. His prophetic poetry
possesses much of the elevation and dignity to be found in the earlier Prophets,
with whose writings he appears to have<b> </b>been
familiar.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Book contains <i>four </i>parts: the <i>first
</i>is a short message to the Jews,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;380101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
1:1-6; the <i>second </i>includes the rest of the first six chapters, which
record a series of eight visions confined to one single night, and vouchsafed to
the Prophet three months after the first message; the <i>third </i>contains two
chapters, the seventh and the eighth; and the <i>fourth, </i>the six remaining
chapters.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since the days of CALVIN a dispute has arisen,
originated by <i>Mede, </i>respecting this last portion. Owing especially to a
quotation in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402709&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
27:9, 10, where JEREMIAH, and not ZECHARIAH, is mentioned, many since the time
of <i>Mede, </i>such as <i>Hammond, Newcome, </i>and several German divines,
have adopted the notion, that these chapters have somehow been misplaced, and
that they belong to the book of JEREMIAH. This view has been strongly opposed by
<i>Blayney </i>and others, who, together with <i>Scott, Adam Clarke, </i>and
<i>Henderson, </i>consider that there is no sufficient ground for such a
supposition, and who for various reasons think that there is a typographical
mistake in Matthew.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm2b</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>&#8220;It </i>is alleged,&#8221; observes
<i>Blayney, </i>&#8220;that the Evangelist St. Matthew,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402709&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
27:9, cites a passage found in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;381113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
11:13, as spoken, not by Zechariah, but by the Prophet Jeremiah. But is it not
possible, nay, is it not much more probable, that the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Ieremiou</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>may have been written by mistake by some transcribers of MATTHEW&#8217;S
Gospel, than that those of the Jewish Church, who settled the Canon of
Scripture, of whom ZECHARIAH himself is supposed to have been one, should have
been so grossly ignorant of the right author of those chapters as to place them
under a wrong name? It is not, I think, pretended that these chapters have been
found in any copy of the Old Testament otherwise placed than as they now stand.
But in the New Testament there are not wanting authorities for omitting the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Ieremiou</font><font face="Palatino"><i>.&#8221;</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The other arguments urged by <i>Mede </i>and others
are successfully combated by <i>Blayney </i>as well as by
<i>Henderson.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The first is, that many things are mentioned in these
chapters which correspond not with ZECHARIAH&#8217;S time; the second, that the
prophecy in Zechariah 11:concerning the destruction of the Temple and of the
people, is not suitable to the scope of ZECHARIAH&#8217;S commission, which was
to encourage the people to build the Temple; and the third, that the style of
these chapters is different from that of the preceding ones. These reasons,
especially the two last, are justly said to be easily accounted for by the
supposition that ZECHARIAH wrote the former portions while he was young,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;380204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
2:4,) and these chapters in his advanced years. And <i>Blayney </i>thinks that
he is the ZECHARIAH mentioned by our Savior in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402335&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
23:35, and that he was slain by the Jews on account of these prophecies which he
announced in his old
age.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm2c</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The last of the Old Testament Prophets, as admitted
by all, was MALACHI. Who and what he was, we are left without any knowledge.
Some have supposed him to have been EZRA under another name, or under the name
of his office, as MALACHI means a messenger. But most think that he lived near a
century after HAGGAI and ZECHARIAH. <i>Usher </i>places him in the year 416
before Christ, and <i>Blair </i>in 436. It appears certain from
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;390310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
3:10, that his time was after the building of the Temple. It is most probable
that he was contemporary with NEHEMIAH, especially after his second return from
Persia, as the same things are condemned by both, &#8212; foreign marriages and
the neglect of paying tythes. The Jews are wont to call him the seal
(</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;twj</font><font face="Palatino">)
of the Prophets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is observed by <i>Lowth </i>that MALACHI wrote
&#8220;in a middle sort of style, and evidently in such a style as seems to
prove that Hebrew poetry had declined since the Babylonian exile, and that being
now in advanced age it was somewhat verging towards
senility.&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm2d</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But <i>Henderson </i>speaks in a higher strain, &#8220;Considering the late age
in which he lived, the language of Malachi is pure; his style possesses much in
common with the old Prophets, but is distinguished more by its animation than by
its rhythmus or grandeur.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The interesting character of the COMMENTARY will be
found to be in no degree diminished in this Volume, but on the contrary
increased, ,though some of the subjects had been before discussed. The same
thoughts, no doubt, sometimes occur, but their different connections ever
introduce some variety. The Commentator follows his text, and very seldom
deviates from what it strictly requires, and the application of it to present
circumstances is generally natural and obvious, and for the most part confined
to a few sentences; so the reader&#8217;s attention is not diverted from the
passage that is explained. The main object throughout seems to be to interpret
God&#8217;s Word and to impress it on the mind and heart, and so to apply it as
to render it the rule of our life and the support of our hopes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The curious reader, fond of novelties, and enamoured
with speculative and fanciful notions, or one whose chief delight is in dry
criticisms, will not find much in CALVIN to gratify him: but those who possess a
taste for Divine Truth, who seek to understand what they read, and desire to be
fed by &#8220;the sincere milk of the Word,&#8221; will, through a blessing from
above, be abundantly compensated by a careful perusal of his Comments. This is
not said merely as a matter of inference from the character of their contents,
but as the result of personal experience. The testimony which the Translator can
fully bear is similar to that of Bishop Horne, when he finished his Commentary
on the Psalms, that the labor has been attended with so much pleasure and
enjoyment, that the completion of his work occasions regret as well as joy; for
the time during which he has been engaged in translating CALVIN has been the
happiest period of his life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the INDICES, added to this Volume, the most
important is that to the subjects: and it is more useful than general readers
may perhaps consider it to be. The very reading of it may convey no small
measure of information. The variety of subjects handled in these Volumes is very
great, so that they include almost everything in the wide range of Theology, not
indeed discussed at large, but briefly touched upon and
explained.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as an illustration of the usefulness of this
Index, let the word <i>Faith </i>be taken; and almost everything connected with
it will be found mentioned and referred to. Turn again to the word <i>Faithful,
(Fideles,) </i>which some of my co-workers have rendered <i>Believers, </i>and
perhaps in some instances more appropriately; and hardly anything belonging to
the character, spirit, life, and trials of God&#8217;s people, will be found
wanting. If there be a wish to know what Popery is, what is found under the word
<i>Papists </i>will disclose almost the whole character of the system; and by
referring to the Comment all its main lineaments will be found clearly exhibited
in the character of the superstitions and idolatries of the Jews. The real
features of errors are the same in every age, only somewhat modified by a change
of circumstances: but an enlightened observer can read Popery in the history of
the ancient Jews as clearly as in its own history. This of course cannot be done
by the spiritually blind and the deluded; and yet so striking and palpable is
the likeness in not a few instances, that it is impossible for any not to see
it, except they be totally blind, and their judgment wholly
perverted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There have been many Commentators before and after
the time of CALVIN, but it may be doubted whether any of them possessed his
combined excellencies, especially the capacity of being so plain as to be
understood by common readers, and of being at the same time so profound as to be
interesting and instructive to the most learned; so that his Comments do in this
respect retain, in a measure, the character of the book he interprets and
explains. Of his superiority over his predecessors we have the striking
testimony of the learned <i>Arminius, who, </i>as he differed from him on
several points of no small importance, may justly be considered to have been an
impartial witness. His words are remarkable, &#8212; &#8220;Next to the reading
of Scripture, which I strongly recommend, I advise you to read the Commentaries
of Calvin, on whom I bestow higher eulogies than Helmichius did; for I consider
that he is <i>incomparable </i>in interpreting Scripture, and that his
Commentaries are of more value than all that the library of the Fathers
transmits to us; so that I concede to him even a spirit of prophecy superior to
that of most, yea, of all
others.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm2e</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to posterior Commentators, his comparative merits
cannot indeed be rated so high, as there have been in later years Writers in
this department of no ordinary character. Not to mention Foreign Divines, our
own might with advantage be referred <i>to, </i>such as <i>Henry, Lowth, Whitby,
Doddridge, Scott, </i>and <i>Adam Clarke. </i>And yet none of these can be
regarded as in all respects equal to CALVIN as a Commentator. Some of them excel
him as Critics, and others in the number of their practical deductions; but he
surpasses them all in pointing out and illustrating the main drift of a passage,
in catching as it were its very spirit, and in the power he possessed of
impressing on the mind in a few words both its meaning and its practical
lessons. The Comment never diverts us from the Text, it never occupies as it
were its place; but the Text itself, expounded and illustrated, is left fixed
and riveted on the mind.</font><br></div>

ZECHARIAH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE PROPHECIES of ZECHARIAH come next. He was a
fellow-helper and colleague Of HAGGAI, and also of MALACHI, as it will presently
appear. These three, then, were sent by God nearly at the same time, that they
might assist one another, and that they might thus by one consent and one mouth
confirm what God had committed to them. It was indeed of great service that
several bore their testimony: their prophecies gained thus greater authority;
and this was needful, for the people had to contend with various and most
grievous trials. Satan had already raised up great opposition to them; but there
were still greater evils at hand. Hence, to prevent them from despairing, it was
necessary to encourage them; by many testimonies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what our Prophet had especially in view was, to
remind the Jews why it was that God dealt so severely with their fathers, and
also to animate them with hope, provided they really repented, and elevated
their minds to the hope of true and complete deliverance. He at the same time
severely reproves them; for there was need of much cleansing, as they still
continued in their filth. For though the recollection of their exile ought to
have restrained them, and to have made them careful to fear and obey God, yet it
seemed to have been otherwise; and it will appear more fully as we proceed, that
being not conscious of having been punished for their sins, they were so secure,
that there was among them hardly and fear of God, or hardly any religion. It was
therefore needful to blend strong and sharp reproofs with promises of favor,
that they might thus be prepared to receive Christ. This is the substance of the
whole  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm1</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE here learn what we have already stated, &#8212;
that Haggai and Zechariah were by God joined together, that they might confirm
each other&#8217;s doctrine, for they had to do with a refractory people:
besides, the people had to endure hard and arduous trials, so that they needed
more than a common testimony to confirm them. Haggai commenced the work of his
office in the <i>sixth </i>month; Zechariah shortly followed him, in the
<i>eighth </i>month of the same year. It has already been shown who was the
Darius mentioned here; though some interpreters dissent, we may yet learn from
certain and indubitable proofs, that he was the son of Hystaspes. We shall again
speak of this Darius, when a better occasion will offer itself: I wished only in
passing to say thus much.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The word of Jehovah came to
Zechariah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We have already said that the word
of God comes in two ways to men. God addresses all from the least to the
greatest; but in the first place he sends his word especially to his Prophets,
to whom he commits the office of teaching. The word of God thus comes to private
individuals, and it comes also to teachers, who sustain a public character, and
become God&#8217;s interpreters or messengers. It was thus that God&#8217;s word
came to Zechariah, not that he might keep to himself what God had said, but that
he might be a faithful dispenser of his truth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to Zechariah, they are mistaken who
regard him as the son of Jehoiadah, they are mistaken by Christ in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402335&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
23:35. Zechariah is indeed said there to have been killed between the temple and
the altar, and he is called the son of Barachiah: 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm4</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but the
counting of years will easily prove their mistake, who would have him to be the
same Zechariah. The former, who is called in sacred history the son of Jehoiadah
the priest, was slain under Joash. Let us now see how many kings succeeded him,
and also how many years he reigned. That Zechariah must have been almost two
hundred years old at the Babylonian exile, if he was alive, had be been a boy
when he was stoned. Now this Zechariah, of whom we now speak, performed the
office of a Prophet after the return of the people from exile. He must then have
been not only more than a hundred and fifty years of age, but must have exceeded
two hundred years when he died. The idea respecting the renascence of men, being
a reverie of the Jews, is not worthy of a record, much less of a refutation. He
is however called the son of Barachiah; but the probable conjecture is that
Jehoiadah the priest had two names, and it does not appear that he was a
prophet. However this may be, the Zechariah who was stoned in the temple by the
order of the king, was the son of the high priest, and died more than a hundred
years before the Babylonian exile. For we have said that this Darius was not the
Mede who reigned with Cyrus, but the son of Hystaspes, who reigned a long time
after, that is, after Cambyses and the Magi. Their want of knowledge is easily
proved, who think that these Prophets were sent by God before the completion of
the time mentioned by Jeremiah. As then the seventy years had elapsed, this
Prophet was no doubt born after the time when the city was destroyed, the temple
pulled-down, and the people led captive into Babylon. I come now to the doctrine
itself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Angry was Jehovah with anger
against your fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
Prophet here refers to the severity of the punishment with which the Jews had
been visited, in order that posterity might know that God, who so rigidly
punishes the despisers of his word and instruction, ought not to be provoked.
For by saying that God was angry with anger, he means, that God was in no common
measure offended with the Jews, and that the very grievousness of their
punishment was a clear evidence how displeased God was with them. But the object
of the Prophet was to rouse the Jews, that they might begin seriously to fear
God on seeing how dreadful is his wrath. The Apostle states it as a general
truth, that it is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581030&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
10:30:) so also the Scripture speaks everywhere. But Zechariah mentions here to
his own people a signal evidence of God&#8217;s wrath, which ought to justly to
have smitten all of them with terror. He does not then speak here of a thing
unknown, but reminds them seriously to consider how terrible is God&#8217;s
vengeance; as a proof of this, their fathers had been deprived of their
perpetual inheritance, they had suffered many degradations, and had also been
harassed and oppressed by tyrants; in short, they had been nearly sunk in the
lowest depths. Since then God has so severely dealt with their fathers, the
Prophet bids them to know that God ought to be feared, lest they should grow
wanton or indulge themselves in their usual manner, but that they might from the
heart repent, and not designedly provoke God&#8217;s wrath, of which their
fathers had so severe an experience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt say to them, Return ye
to me, and I will return to you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm6</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
Prophet now expresses more clearly for what purpose he had spoken of God&#8217;s
vengeance, with which he had visited his chosen people, even that their
posterity might take heed to themselves; for the common proverb, &#8220;Fools by
adversity become wise,&#8221; ought in this case to have been verified. For
where there is really a teachable spirit, men become instantly attentive to what
God says: but even when they are sluggish and slothful, it is a wonder, that
when they are smitten, the strokes which they feel do not shake off at least in
some degree their torpor. Hence the Prophet, after having spoken of the
punishments which God had inflicted, exhorts the Jews to
repentance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It ought however to be observed, that our Prophet not
only speaks of repentance, but shows also its true character, that the Jews
might not seek carelessly to please God, as is commonly the case, but that they
might sincerely repent; for he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>return ye to me, and I will
return to you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And this was not said without
reason, when we consider in what sort of delusions the Jews indulged themselves
immediately after their return. We have seen that they became devoted to their
private concerns, while the temple remained desolate; and we also know what
sacred history relates, that they married heathen women, and also that many
corruptions prevailed among them, so that religion almost disappeared. They
indeed retained the name of God, but their impiety showed itself by clear signs.
It is then no wonder that the Prophet sharply stimulates them to
repentance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must at the same time be noticed, that we cannot
enjoy the favor of God, even when he kindly offers to be reconciled to us,
except we from the heart repent. However graciously, then, God may invite us to
himself, and be ready to remit our sins, we yet cannot embrace his offered
favor, except our sins become hateful to us; for God ceases not to be our judge,
except we anticipate him, and condemn ourselves, and deprecate the punishment of
our sins. Hence we then pacify God when real grief wounds us, and we thus really
turn to God, without dissimulation or falsehood. Now the experience of
God&#8217;s wrath ought to lead us to this; for extremely heedless are they who,
having found God to be a Judge, do carelessly disregard his wrath, which ought
to have filled their hearts with fear. &#8220;Let no one deceive you with vain
words,&#8221; says Paul, &#8220;for on account of these things comes the wrath
of God on the children of unbelief,&#8221; or on all the unbelieving.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
5:6.) Paul bids us to consider all the evidences which God gives of his wrath in
the world, that they may instruct us as to the fear of God; how much more then
should domestic examples be noticed by us? For the Prophet speaks not here of
foreign nations; but says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>angry
has God been with anger against your fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
Since, then, it appeared evident that God had not spared even his chosen people,
they ought, unless they were in the extreme refractory, to have carefully
continued in obedience to the law. Hence the Prophet here condemns their
tardiness, inasmuch as they had made so little progress under the chastisements
of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We thus see that no excuse can be brought before God,
if we do not make a right use of all the punishments by which he designs to
recover us from our sins. We have referred to that general truth announced by
Paul, that God&#8217;s judgment, executed on the unbelieving, ought to be
feared; it hence follows that our insensibility is extreme, if we are not
thoroughly moved when God teaches us by our own experience, or at least when he
sets domestic examples before us, as when he punishes our fathers and others
connected with us; for this mode of teaching comes much nearer to
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But when the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>return ye to me, and I will
return to you</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he means, as I have before
stated, that though God meets sinners, and is ready with extended arms to
embrace them, his favor cannot come to those to whom it is offered, except a
real feeling of penitence leads them to God. In short, the Prophet means, that
though they had returned from exile, they could not expect a permanent state of
safety, except they turned from the heart to him; for if they imitated their
fathers, God had in readiness far severer scourges to chastise them; and they
might also be again driven into exile. he then briefly reminds them, that if
they wished to enjoy the incomparable kindness with which God had favored them,
it was necessary for them seriously to return to him. Though, then God had
already in part returned to them, that is, he had really proved that he was
pacified and propitious to them, yet he had begun by many evidences to show that
he was again offended with them; for their fruit had either withered through
heat, or had been smitten by hail, as we have found elsewhere;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;370217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Haggai
2:17;) so that they had already labored for several years under want and other
evils. God then had not so blessed them, that they could in every way recognize
his paternal favor. This is the reason why the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will return to you
</i></font><font face="Palatino">when ye return to me.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet to be,
that though God had delivered his people, they ought yet to have feared lest his
wrath should suddenly burn against the ungrateful and the wicked, and that being
not in full favor, they ought also to have known that God was still offended
with them. So the Prophet shortly reminded them, that it was no wonder that God
treated them with no great kindness, for they allowed no place for his favor,
but provoked his wrath, like their fathers, inasmuch as they did not from the
hear repent.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Papists allege this passage in defense of
free-will; but it is a most puerile sophistry. They say that the turning of God
to men is the same as their turning to him, as though God promised the grace of
his Spirit as a help, when men anticipate him. They imagine then that free-will
precedes, and then that the help of the Spirit follows. But this is very gross
and absurd. The Prophet indeed means that God would return to the Jews; for he
shows that God would in every respect be a father to them, when they showed
themselves to be dutiful and respectful children. We must therefore remember
that God does not here promise the aid of his Spirit to assist free-will, and to
help the efforts of man, as these foolish and senseless teachers imagine, but
that he promises to return to the Jews to bless them. Hence the return of God
here is nothing else than the prosperity which they desired; as though he had
said &#8212; &#8220;Fear me from the heart, and ye shall not labor under hunger
and thirst; for I shall satisfy you, as neither your fields nor your vines shall
hereafter disappoint your hopes. Ye shall find me most bountiful, when ye deal
with me in a faithful manner.&#8221; This is the meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must further bear in mind, that, according to the
common usage of Scripture, whenever God exhorts us to repentance, he does not
regard what our capacity is, but demands what is justly his right. Hence the
Papists adopt what is absurd when they deduce the power of free-will from the
command or exhortation to repent: God, they say, would not have commanded what
is not in our power to do. It is a foolish and most puerile mode of reasoning;
for if everything which God requires were in our power, the grace of the Holy
Spirit would be superfluous; it would not only be as they say a waiting-mind,
but it would be wholly unnecessary; but if men need the aid of the Spirit, it
follows that they cannot do what God requires of them. But it seems strange that
God should bid men to do more than what they can. It seems so indeed, I allow,
when we form our judgment according to the common perception of the flesh; but
when we understand these truths &#8212; that the law works wrath &#8212; that it
increases sin &#8212; that it was given that transgression might be made more
evident, then the false notion &#8212; that God requires nothing but what men
can perform, comes to nothing. But it is enough for us to know, that God in
exhorting us to repentance requires nothing but what nature dictates ought to be
done by us. Since it is so, however short we are in the performance, it is not
right to charge God with too much strictness, that he demands what is beyond our
power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The frequent repetition of God&#8217;s name by the
Prophet is emphatical; it was done, that what he taught might more sharply goad
the hearts of the people. Had he simply said, that he had a commission from
above to remind the people of the punishments which their fathers had endured,
and also to call them to repentance, this mode of teaching would not have so
penetrated into their hearts, as when the name of God is so often brought before
them &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shalt
say</i></font><font face="Palatino">,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Return to me,
saith</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah of hosts, and I will
return to you, saith Jehovah of hosts</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It
surely behoved the Jews, when they heard God&#8217;s name pronounced three
times, to awake and to consider with whom they had to do. For what can be more
base or more disgraceful than for men, when God anticipates them and desires to
be united to them, to refuse to respond and to devote themselves to his
service?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is at the same time evident, that the Prophet
adopted a mode of speaking then in use: and we know that the language of the
Jews underwent a change after their Babylonian exile. It lost that clearness and
elegance which it possessed before: as it clearly appears from the style of
those who wrote after the exile. I allow also that previously the Prophets
exhibited not the same degree of eloquence; for Isaiah differs greatly from
Jeremiah and from Amos. It is yet quite evident from the writings of the last
Prophets, that the language had become somewhat muddy after the return of the
people from exile. Let us now proceed &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">In order to correct and to subdue the obstinacy of
the people, he here upbraids them with having descended from wicked and perverse
parents. The Jews, we know, too much flattered themselves; and we know that they
were especially inflated with the vain boasting that they derived their origin
from the holy fathers. But the Prophets had something else in view. We indeed
know that when anything becomes customary, almost all become hardened and
flatter themselves in their vice; for immorality is then counted almost as the
law, and what is sanctioned by public consent seems lawful. Since then they had
not ceased for many years to provoke the wrath of God, it was necessary to add
this reproof, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be not like your
fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino">: for they no doubt imagined that God
approved of them, as they were not worse than their fathers. But God shows that
their fathers had been very wicked and perverse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us learn from this passage, that the examples
which are wont to be set up as a shield are so far from being of any weight
before God, that they enhance our guilt: and yet we see that this folly
infatuates many; for at this day the religion of the Papists seems to them holy
and irreprehensible, because it has been handed down to them by their fathers.
Hence, whenever they bring forward the fathers, they think it a sufficient
defense against the charge of any errors. But nothing occurs more frequently in
the Prophets than the truth, that examples tend more to kindle the wrath of God,
when some men become the occasion of sin to others, and when posterity think
that whatever has proceeded from their fathers is lawful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must at the same time bear in mind the design
of the Prophet, for he did not intend simply to show, that the Jews in vain
alleged the examples of the ancient; but, as I have said, he intended to shake
off their self-flatteries by which they lulled themselves asleep; and he
intended especially to put down those evil practices, which by long use had
prevailed among them. This then is the reason why he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be not like your
fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Spirit employs the same sentiment
in many other places, especially in the ninety- fifth Psalm
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;199501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
95:1), and also in other Psalms.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
who had been sent by God, had cried to their fathers, but that they did not
attend. As then contempt of the truth had for so many ages prevailed among the
Jews, and as this impiety was not duly abhorred by them, since they thought
themselves to be as it were in perpetual possession &#8212; these are the
reasons why the Prophet expressly upbraids them with this, that God&#8217;s word
had been formerly despised by their nation &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cry</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>did the former
Prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He also exaggerates again their crime
and their sin, because God had often recalled them to himself but without
success. Had the Prophets been silent, and had God applied no remedy for their
defection, their ingratitude would not indeed have been excusable; but since
Prophets had often been sent to them, in succession, one after the other, and
each had endeavored to restore the wretched men to a state of safety, not to
attend to their holy and serious admonitions, by which God manifested his care
for their well-being, was a much more atrocious crime.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence learn, that when we find any people prone to
this or that vice, it ought to be resisted with greater diligence; for Satan
almost always employs this artifice &#8212; that when he finds us prone to this
or that vice, he directs all his efforts to drive us headlong into
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As then the Prophets had been for a long time
despised by the Jews, Zechariah designedly brings before them that perverseness
which had been too long known.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cry</i></font><font face="Palatino">

not nor attended</i></font><font face="Palatino">. After having spoken of
God&#8217;s kind invitation, which was a singular pledge of his love, since he
thus manifested his concern for their safety, he shows on the other hand how
unworthily the Jews had conducted themselves, for they obstinately rejected this
favor of God. They were indeed more than sufficiently proved guilty; for by
saying, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Return ye, I pray, from
your evil ways and from your evil works</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he
assumes it as a fact that the reproofs given were just. And he farther says,
that they refused to hear. Hence their perverseness was less endurable; for
though they were self-condemned, they did not yet repent, nor deigned to hearken
to God. And he subjoins the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nor did they
attend</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for by this repetition 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm8</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is more
fully expressed, not only their stupidity, but their strange madness, inasmuch
as they had so rejected God, and closed up the door of his favor, as though they
sought designedly to drive him far from them, lest he should come to
them.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">In what we considered yesterday Zechariah reminded
the Jews of the conduct of their fathers, in order that they might not, by their
continued sins, bring on themselves new punishments. Many interpreters think
that the sentiment contained at the beginning of the fourth verse is now
confirmed, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>your fathers, where
are they?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> for it seems t them that God is here
exulting over the Jews &#8212; &#8220;Think now what has happened to your
fathers; are they not all gone and destroyed?&#8221; They suppose also that the
Jews answer, taking the latter clause as spoken by them, &#8220;The Prophets
also, have they not perished? Why do you mention to us the fathers? There is no
difference between them and the Prophets; it is not therefore a suitable
argument.&#8221; And then in the third place, they consider that God refutes the
answer given by the Jews, &#8220;But my word and my statutes, what I had
entrusted to the Prophets, have not been without their effect.&#8221; This view
of the passage has been adopted by many, and by all of the most ancient
interpreters; and those who followed them have been disposed to subscribe to it.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm9</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But more
probable is the opinion of Jerome, who understands the latter clause of false
Prophets, &#8212; &#8220;Your fathers and your Prophets, where are they?&#8221;
as though God thus reproved the Jews: &#8220;See now, have not your fathers
miserably perished, and also the Prophets by whom they were deceived?&#8221;
Thus Jerome thinks that the object in both clauses is to shake off the delusions
of the Jews, that they might not harden themselves against God&#8217;s
judgments, or give ear to flatterers. This interpretation comes nearer to the
design of the Prophet, though he seems to me to have something else in
view.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I join the two clauses together, as they may be most
fitly united &#8212; &#8220;Your fathers and my Prophets have both perished; but
after their death, the memory of the doctrine, which has not only been published
by my servants, but has also been fully confirmed, is to continue, so that it
ought justly to terrify you; for it is very foolish in you to enquire whether or
not the Prophets are still alive; they performed their office to the end of
life, but the truth they declared is immortal. Though then the Prophets are
dead, they have not yet carried away with them what they taught, for it never
perishes, nor can it at any age be extinguished. The ungodly are also dead, but
their death ought not to obliterate the memory of God&#8217;s judgments; but
after their death these judgments ought to be known among men, and serve to
teach them, in order that posterity may understand that they are not
presumptuously to provoke God.&#8221; This seems to be the real meaning of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Your fathers where are they? and
the Prophets do they live for ever?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he makes a
concession, as though he had said, &#8220;I allow that both your fathers and my
Prophets are dead; but my words are they dead?&#8221; God, in a word,
distinguishes between the character of his word and the condition of men, as
though he had said, that the life of men is frail and limited to a few years,
but that his truth never perishes. And rightly does he mention the ungodly as
well as the Prophets; for we know that whenever God punishes the despisers of
his word, he gives perpetual examples, which may keep men in all ages within the
boundaries of duty. Hence, though many ages have passed away since God overthrew
Sodom and Gomorrah, yet that example remains, and retains its use to this day;
for the ruin of Sodom is a mirror in which we may see at this time that God is
the perpetual judge of the world. Since then the ungodly have perished, the
punishment with which God visited their sins ought not to be buried with them,
but to be ever remembered by men. This is the reason why he says, &#8220;your
fathers are dead: this you must admit; but as they had been severely chastised,
ought ye not at this day to profit by such examples?&#8221; Then he says,
&#8220;my Prophets also are dead; but it was my will that they should be the
preachers of my truth, and for this end, that after their death posterity might
know that I had once spoken through them.&#8221; To the same purpose are the
words of Peter, who says, that he labored that the memory of what he taught
might continue after he was removed from his tabernacle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;As then,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;the time of my dissolution is at hand, I endeavor as far as I can, that
you may remember what I teach after my death.&#8221;

your fathers, why do ye not consider, that as I am always the same, my words
cannot possibly be in vain at the present day, or be without effect?&#8221; We
now see how clearly the Prophet distinguishes between the word of God and the
condition of men; for God does not declare what is empty, nor give utterance to
words which produce no effect; but he executes whatever he has committed to his
Prophets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They returned and
said,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm12</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
As Jehovah of hosts had purposed to do to us on account of our ways and our
works, so he hath done</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Added here is a
confession, which ought to have perpetually stimulated the Jews, while they saw
that the obstinacy of their fathers had been subdued by the scourges of God. It
is indeed true, that though they been sharply chastised, many of them did not
yet really repent. God however extorted from them the confession that they were
justly punished. Even the ungodly then had been constrained to give glory to
God, and to confess that they were justly treated as guilty; but their children
became immediately forgetful &#8212; was this a stupidity capable of being
excused? He at the same time indirectly warns posterity that they might not
imitate the negligence of their fathers, who would not have repented had they
not been severely chastised; but that they might, on the contrary anticipate the
judgment of God. We then see why the Prophet mentions that the Jews, who had
been severely treated, freely confessed that they had been chastised by the hand
of God; but we must notice the words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, that the fathers had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>returned</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
Though their repentance was not sincere, yet God intimates that such was their
punishment that it drew from them the confession that is here mentioned. What
then could their posterity mean? or how could they become so audaciously mad
against God, when they saw that their fathers and their obstinacy had been, as
it were, broken down by the severe strokes by which God had smitten them? He
then subjoins, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and
said</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As Jehovah hath prepared to
do</i></font><font face="Palatino">. They confessed that they suffered evils not
through chance, but that the purpose of God was thus fulfilled, which they had
previously despised and almost derided. They further confessed, that they justly
suffered; and they referred to their works and to their course of life. Since,
then, the father had made this confession, who had hardened themselves long in
their sins, their posterity were wholly without excuse in going on still to
their own ruin, in containing impenitent, though warned by examples so
memorable. This is the import of the passage. It now follows

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here is related a second prophecy, connected with a
vision. At the beginning God alone spoke and gave commission to his Prophet to
reprove the Jews: he now confirms the prediction as to the reduction of the
city; for to the word is added a vision, which is, as we have seen elsewhere, a
sort of seal. As the vision is obscure it may be variously explained, but I
shall endeavor to accommodate it, without any refinements, to our use; and so no
ambiguity will remain, provided we seek to be soberly and moderately wise, that
is, provided we aim at no more than what edification requires.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet says, that a vision was given him; and he
saw a horseman among the myrtles sitting on a red horse; and with him there were
horses red, variegated 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm13</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
white, and having no doubt riders. So I understand the passage; for extremely
gross is the idea that the horses spoke. There were then, as it were, a troop of
horsemen; but the Prophet says, that one appeared as the chief leader, who was
accompanied by others. In the meantime an angel stood at the side of the
Prophet, who led him, and showed to him his concern for the holy city and the
chosen people. He then adds, that these horsemen had returned from an
expedition; for they had been sent to review the whole world and its different
parts. He therefore says, that they had returned from their journey, and also
that the whole earth was quiet, that men enjoyed peace and tranquillity
everywhere. At length he adds, that the angel of God cried out,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How long, Jehovah, wilt thou not
show mercy to Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>For the angel,
touched with grief on hearing that all the heathens were enjoying rest,
expostulates with God; for it seemed a very unbecoming and strange thing that
the faithful alone should be oppressed with adversities, while others lived in
peace and enjoyed their pleasures. There follows at length an answer from God,
as we shall presently see.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But let us now enquire the Prophet&#8217;s design. I
regard this as the object &#8212; that horsemen were presented to the Prophet,
that he might know that God does not remain shut up in heaven and neglect the
affairs of men; but that he has, as it were, swift horses, so that he knows what
things are everywhere carried on. As then kings having horses at command, send
their riders here and there, and bid them soon to return to them that they may
know what to do; so the Prophet ascribes here to God the character of a chief
sovereign, who inquires respecting all the affairs of men. It is indeed certain,
that God receives no information from angels, for nothing is hid from him: nay,
all things were fully known to him before he created angels. God, therefore,
needs no such helps in order to know what is going on from the rising to the
setting sun; but such a mode of speaking often occurs in scripture; and it is a
common thing, that God assumes the character of man in order that he may more
familiarly instruct us. Let us then especially bear in mind, that the riders who
appeared to the Prophet were angels, who are ever ready to serve God. And they
were sent here and there, not that they might declare to God any thing unknown
to him, but that we may believe that God cares for human affairs; and that
though angels appear not to us they are always engaged, and survey the world, so
that nothing is done without the knowledge and will of God. This is one
thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet says also, that the vision was given him
in the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>night</i></font><font face="Palatino">:
he refers no doubt to what actually took place, and also to the manner in which
he was taught; for though the vision was not given in vain, yet God meant that
it should not be plain, in order that he might give by little and little a
glimpse of hope to the Jews. As then God did not intend to exhibit in full light
what he afterwards in due time taught them, the vision appeared in the night.
And to the same purpose is what he says respecting the angels, that they were in
a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dark</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deep
place</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and that they were among the myrtles.
For to consider what is here said allegorically seems to me frivolous. I will,
therefore, not refinedly discuss here the nature of myrtles: but as we know that
the trees are dark and afford a thick shade, God intended, I have no doubt, by
the sight of them, to produce an effect on the Prophet&#8217;s mind, so that he
might understand that the prophecy was yet obscure, and that the time for a
plain and clear revelation was not come. There were then horsemen among the
myrtles, that is, under these dark and shady trees; and also in a deep place and
in a thick shade. We see how aptly these things correspond. Some think that by
their colors is designated the state of the people, being that of sorrow and of
joy; for though quietness in part was restored to the people, yet much darkness
remained and much perplexity in their affairs: but as this idea is probable, I
do not reject it, provided we retain what I have stated, that the obscurity of
the Prophecy is noted by the deep valley and the myrtles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There was one more eminent than the rest, and in this
there is nothing unusual; for when God sends forth a company of angels, he gives
the lead to some one: and this is the reason why one is described here as more
illustrious than all the others. If we regard this angel to be Christ, the idea
is consistent with the common usage of Scripture; for Christ, we know, being the
head of angels, ever exercises such dominion over them, that in obeying God they
do nothing but under his authority. It may be then that one angel assumed here a
pre-eminence over the rest, that the Prophet might think of the Redeemer, who
exercises power over angels and the whole Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the different colors the Prophet no
doubt understood that they designated the offices allotted to angels, as some
convey God&#8217;s benefits, and others come armed with scourges and swords. For
what was the design of the vision in which some riders appeared on white horses,
some on red, and some on bay, (or, on those of a mixed color, which is more
probable,) except that God intended to show that he sent angels, not only that
they might survey the state of things, but that they might also come to chastise
men, or to be ministers of his benefits? Besides, it was God&#8217;s purpose, as
I have already hinted, to make it known, that nothing is carried on in this
world but what is known by angels, who are his emissaries and
agents.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They said that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the whole earth was then
quiet</i></font><font face="Palatino">, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm14</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
is, the countries bordering on Judea, or the oriental regions. Hence a greater
confidence might be entertained by the Jews, for with the prayer of the angel is
connected a complaint &#8212; &#8220;God of hosts, what is thy purpose?&#8221;
that is, &#8220;Is it thy will that all others should enjoy quietness and peace,
while enemies are continually hostile and troublesome to thy people? Is it right
that thy Church should be ever miserably distressed, while heathens, who have no
care for religion, should be so bountifully favored by thee? Is it not better
that the memory of thy name should be extinguished, and that all worship should
fall to the ground, than that so unjust a reward should be returned to thy
servants?&#8221; We now see the design of the vision, even that the Jews might
be assured that the distresses which they endured would not be perpetual. How
so? because God slept not in heaven, but had his runners; and further, since his
will was that all nations should be tranquil, he would no doubt have at length a
regard for his own people, so as to deliver them from their
troubles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though then the vision is obscure, yet its design is
not doubtful. Besides, if we are content with what is moderate, there will be
found here nothing so perplexing but that we may easily learn at least the
import of the Prophecy. But the curiosity of those interpreters has done much
harm, who by examining every single syllable have advanced many puerile things.
There is therefore nothing better than to attend to the design of the Prophet,
and then to regard the circumstances of the time, and thirdly, to follow the
analogy between the signs and things signified.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have said that angels are here introduced, because
it would be difficult for us to ascend to the highest glory of God. God, we
know, is not constrained by necessity to employ angels as ministers to execute
his judgments, to punish men, or to confer benefits: for God himself is
sufficient for all these things. Why then does he employ angels and make use of
their ministration, if it be superfluous? The obvious answer is this &#8212; as
we are prone to unbelief, we ever tremble in dangers, except we know that God is
prepared with many forces to help us in time of need. When it is said in Psalm
24 that angels encamp around those who fear God, is it not a much more effectual
relief than if it had been simply said that God is our citadel? It is indeed
said in many places that God is an unassailable fortress; but as many still
continue to doubt when they hear that there is a sufficient defense for them in
God, he consults now their weakness, and adds, &#8220;I come with a great host;
I am not alone your helper, but there is a great army ready at my bidding.
Whenever then it may please me a troop of angels, yea, many myriads shall
assemble together.&#8221; When therefore God thus speaks, it is a mode of
teaching suitable to the capacities of men. So now, when Zechariah sees many
runners, who have been sent by God to perambulate and to survey the earth, it
may with greater certainty be learnt that nothing is carried on without design
or by chance in the world, but that all things come before God, and that the
manner in which all things occur is set forth by the angels. In the same way is
the representation given in the first chapter of Job
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;180101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
1:1) All the sons of God, that is, angels, came before his throne; and also
among them Satan came; for though he does not willingly obey God, yet while he
perambulates the earth, he at the same time executes God&#8217;s judgments,
though unwillingly. We now then see the reason why God did not himself appear,
and testified to the Prophet, that whatever took place among the nations was
known to him; but he shows that his runners rode swiftly through the whole
earth, and returned afterwards to the heavenly tribunal, and proved that they
had carefully performed their office.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Prophet says, that he had this vision in the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>eleventh month, called
Sebat,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm15</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
and on the twenty-fourth day </i></font><font face="Palatino">of the month; that
is, in the third month after his first Prophecy. He had in the eighth month
sharply reproved the Jews: now a consolation is added, lest they should despair,
but know that they were still the objects of God&#8217;s care. And possibly the
reproof referred to had been effectual; nay, it is probable, that the Prophet
did not labor in vain in exhorting the Jews to true and sincere repentance. When
therefore they had given some evidence of religion, we see that God afterwards
treated them more kindly, and set before them the hope of a future
deliverance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the night time, it is of importance to
observe, that though God does not always set forth with full clearness his
predictions, they are not yet without instruction, provided we be attentive, and
provided also we suffer ourselves, while in darkness, to be ruled by the spirit
of knowledge. By whatever different means then God may teach his faithful
people, he always teaches them something useful, provided they murmur not when
any thing is for a time obscure, but wait for the day of full revelation. And
this is the design of Paul&#8217;s admonition, &#8220;If ye think otherwise,
this also will God reveal to you.&#8221; Let us then know that God&#8217;s
manner of teaching is not always the same, but that his teaching is always
profitable, provided the faithful retain due moderation and sobriety, and suffer
themselves to be guided step by step by God. This observation is to be applied
to the whole verse, when it is said, that the horses and the horsemen stood
under the myrtles, and also in a low place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And, then, as to the various colors of the horses, it
ought not to be deemed strange, that God should thus allot different offices to
angels; for he does not always punish us by the ministry of Satan. He has
celestial angels, when it pleases him, as executioners of his vengeance; and he
sometimes employs devils for this purpose. However this may be, it is in his
power to delegate angels as ministers of his kindness, or to send them to
execute his vengeance, so that they appear in red color, or in some other. In
conclusion, it ought also to be borne in mind, that angels do stand before the
tribunal of God, after having diligently perambulated the earth, not after the
manner of men: for it would be gross and puerile to imagine angels sitting on
horses, inasmuch as they are spirits who are confined to no certain place; but
as we cannot understand, according to our capacities, the celestial mysteries of
God, it is necessary that such representations should be set before our eyes.
however this may be, it ought to remain a fixed principle, that angels are
always employed, for they survey the earth, that nothing may be done or carried
on without design; and they are also sent with power and authority, so that they
are, as it were, the hand of God: and at one time they execute his judgments,
inflict punishments, as it has been said; and at another they come with
blessings from God. This then is the meaning as to the horsemen. I cannot
proceed farther: the rest I shall defer.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that since we live
here as in thick darkness, and are also surrounded with so much darkness of
ignorance, that we often entertain doubts as to thy providence, and think

O grant, that with our minds raised above, we may contemplate those things which
thou hast once revealed to thy servant Zechariah, and not doubt, but thou
lookest on us also and commandest thy angels to take care of us, and to raise us
up in their hands, and to guide us in all our ways, yea, in all the crooked
windings of this life, so that we may learn to commit ourselves to be wholly
ruled by thee, and thus suffer ourselves to be drawn and turned here and there
in the world, so as still to follow the way which thou hast pointed out to us,
and to proceed straight towards the mark which thou hast been pleased to set

has been obtained for us by the blood of thine only-begotten Son. &#8212;

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet now shows that the angel who was his
guide and teacher, became even a suppliant before God in behalf of the welfare
of the Church. Hence the probable opinion is, that this angel was Christ the
Mediator. For they who say that it was the Holy Spirit, who forms prayers in our
hearts, seem to depart very far from the meaning of the Prophet: and it is
nothing new, that Christ should exercise care over his Church. But if this view
be disapproved, we may take any one of the angels to be meant. It is certain
that it is enjoined them all to minister to the salvation of the faithful,
according to what the Apostle says in the first chapter of the Hebrews
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
1:1; and indeed the whole Scripture is full of evidences, which prove that
angels are guardians to the godly, and watch over them; for the Lord, for whose
service they are ever ready, thus employs them: and in this we also see the
singular love of God towards us; for he employs his angels especially for this
purpose, that he might show that our salvation is greatly valued by
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is then nothing wrong, if we say that any one
of the angels prayed for the Church. But absurdly, and very foolishly do the
Papists hence conclude, that dead saints are our advocates before God, or that
they pray for us; for we never read that it is an office committed to the dead
to intercede for us; nay, the duties of love, we know, are confined to the
present life. When, therefore, the faithful remove from this world, having
finished their course, they enter on a blessed life. Though then the case is
different, yet the Papists foolishly pass from angels to the dead: for as it has
been stated, the case of the faithful has been committed to angels, and they
ever watch over the whole body, and over every member of it. It is then nothing
strange that they offer prayers for the faithful; but it does not hence follow,
that angels are to be invoked by us. Why does Scripture testify, that angels
supplicate God for us? Is it that each of us may flee to them? By no means; but
that being assured of God&#8217;s paternal love, we may entertain more hope and
confidence; yea, that we may courageously fight, being certain of victory, since
celestial hosts contend for us, according to what appears from many examples.
For when the servant of Elisha saw not the chariots flying in the air, he became
almost lost in despair; but his despair was instantly removed, when he saw so
many angels ready at hand for help,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;120617&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 6:17;) so whenever God declares that angels are ministers for our safety,
he means to animate our faith; at the same time he does not send us to angels;
but this one thing is sufficient for us, that when God is propitious to us, all
the angels have a care for our salvation. And we must further notice what is
said by Christ,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;hereafter ye shall
see angels ascending and
descending,&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430151&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
1:51,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">which means, that when we are joined to the head,
there will thence proceed a sacred union between us and angels; for Christ, we
know, is equally Lord over all. When, therefore, we are united to the body of
Christ, it is certain that angels are united to us, but only through Christ. All
this favor then depends on the one true Mediator. Far then is it from being the
case, that Scripture represents angels as patrons to whom we may pray. The
meaning then is what we have stated, when Zechariah says, that the angel thus
prayed, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Jehovah of hosts, how
long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and the cities of
Judah?</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The angel seems in this place to have indirectly
blamed God for having too much delayed to bring help to his Church: but this
mode of speaking, we know, frequently occurs in the prayers of the saints; they
in a manner charged God with delay, that is, according to the perception of
their flesh. But this is not inconsistent with the obedience of faith, since the
faithful submit at length to the counsel of God. Hence, however familiarly they
may often expostulate with God, when he seems to delay and to withhold his aid,
they yet restrain themselves, and at length feel assured that what God has
appointed is best. But they thus pour forth their cares and their sorrows into
the bosom of God, in order to disburden themselves. The angel now adopts this
form when he says, &#8220;How long wilt thou not show mercy?&#8221; It is not
however the complaint of unreasonable fervor, as that of the ungodly, who in
praying accuse God, rage against him, and quarrel with his judgments. The angel
then was not moved by any turbulent feeling, nor were the saints, when they
adopted this mode of praying; but they did what God allows us all to do; they
thus disburndened their cares and sorrows.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We ought at the same time to notice the special
import of the words, &#8220;how long,&#8221;
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ytmAd[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>od-mati?</i> The angel indeed afterwards explains himself, when he expressly
mentions the term of seventy years. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm16</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It was
not then without design, or through a strong impulse of feeling, that the angel
said, How long? but he had regard to a memorable prophecy, which was in the
mouth of all the godly; for God had fixed seventy years for the exile of the
people. Since the people knew that a time had been predetermined by God, he does
net here supplicate God according to his own will, but only alleges the promise
itself: and it is an usual thing with the saints to plead before God what he has
promised to them. What indeed can better sustain our hope? and what can give us
a greater encouragement in praying, than when we plead with God according to his
promises? For God will have our prayers to be founded first on his gratuitous
goodness, and then on the constancy of his faithfulness and truth. When
therefore they thus address God, &#8220;O Lord, thou art true, and thou hast
promised this to us; relying on thy word, we dare ask what otherwise we could
not,&#8221; &#8212; they certainly do not exceed the limits as though they
prescribed to God a law, but anxiously seek to obtain what had been freely
offered. We have seen that the angel does not here complain of delay, but that
he founded his plea on that remarkable prophecy, in which God had fixed the term
of seventy years for his people.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shows here, that though God did not
immediately on the first day stretch forth his hand to the miserable Jews, he
was yet propitious to them. But we must notice, that God speaks only, and does
not yet manifest his power. The Prophet&#8217;s design must be here observed;
for first he reminds the faithful that there was no reason for them to despair,
or to be cast down with sorrow; for celestial angels prayed to God for them, and
pleaded for their salvation. This is one thing. But a greater and fuller
confirmation is added; for God testifies that he is ready to deliver the Jews,
though he does not declare this immediately at first. And here we may remark,
that it ought to be sufficient to sustain our hope and patience, when God
testifies and affirms that he favors us, and that our salvation is dear to him,
however miserable our condition may apparently be. God might indeed have
immediately given a real proof to the Jews that the time had come to restore
them to full prosperity: this he did not, but only made a promise. He gave words
only: but his purpose was, by an actual trial, to prove the patience and
obedience of his people, when he said that he had not forgotten his covenant, on
which depended all the promises previously made.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet seems to allude to a prophecy of
Isaiah in the fortieth chapter,</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>consoling

godly and the prayer of the angel had been heard; for redemption was now nigh at

<div><font face="Palatino">Zechariah now mentions the chief consolation to which
he had referred; for it would not have been sufficient to say in general, and in
a few words without explanation, that God gave a kind answer to the angel. For
we know how strong were those temptations with which the faithful had to
struggle. It was then needful for them to be furnished, not with light weapons,
in so arduous a contest. This is the reason why Zechariah more fully expressed
the words by which God then strengthened the faith of his
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that the angel had spoken; and he thus
intimates that the consolation was not given privately to the angel that he
might keep it in his own bosom, but convey it to the whole people. This was not
then a secret consolation but what the Lord intended to be proclaimed by his
Prophets, according to what is said by Isaiah in the passage to which we have
already referred &#8212; &#8220;Comfort ye, comfort ye my people saith your
God.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What God says, that he was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>moved with great zeal for
Jerusalem and Sion</i></font><font face="Palatino">, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm19</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is
according to the common language of Scripture. For as God cannot otherwise
sufficiently express the ineffable favor which he has towards his elect he is
pleased to adopt this similitude, that he undertakes the defense of his people
according to what is done by a husband who fights with the greatest zeal for his
own wife. This is the reason why he says that he was zealous for Jerusalem. And
we ought especially to notice this mode of speaking, that we may not think that
God is indifferent when he delays and defers his aid: for as we are hasty in our
wishes so we would have God to be precipitant in the same manner; and we impute
to him indifference when he does not hasten according to our desires. These
doubts God checks when he testifies that he is zealous: for he intimates that
his slowness did not proceed from neglect or because he despised or disregarded
them; but that there was another reason why he held them in suspense. We may
therefore be fully persuaded that even when God withholds his aid he is not
otherwise affected towards us than the best of fathers towards his own children;
and further that the signs of his love do not appear because it is not always
expedient for us to be delivered soon from our troubles. Let this then be our
shield against all hasty desires, so that we may not indulge our too ardent
wishes, or think that our salvation is neglected by God, when he hides himself
for a time and does not immediately stretch forth his hand to help us. It

<div><font face="Palatino">God here obviates the doubt which might have easily
crept into the minds of the godly. &#8220;Why should he then give up the
miserable Jews to the will of the Gentiles, and suffer these heathens at the
same time to be in a quiet state and to enjoy their pleasures?&#8221; This
indeed at the first view seemed very strange: if God had such a zeal towards
Jerusalem, why did he not give some token at least of his favor? He therefore
gives this answer, &#8212; That though the condition of the Gentiles was now
better, there was yet no reason for the Jews to be discontented in their
troubles, because they were to look forward to the end that was to come. It must
further be noticed, that God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>speaks</i></font><font face="Palatino">
only here, and is not going forth prepared to execute his vengeance: and it is a
real and just trial of faith, when God bids us to depend on his
word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The manner of speaking, used here deserves notice,
God was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>angry with the quiet
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is not a superfluous repetition,
when it is said, that the nations were quiet. Some render the word wealthy, but
not so suitably; for as we have said before, the angel complained that while the
whole world was tranquil, God severely chastised his Church alone. God then does
here anticipate a temptation which would have otherwise distressed and even
wholly disheartened the faithful; and he in effect says, &#8220;It is indeed
true that the Gentiles all around are quiet, that there are no calamities, that
there is no enemy, and that they are subject to no evils: this is no doubt true;
but as I am angry, their happiness, while I am opposed to and displeased with
them, is a curse.&#8221; God, then, does here elevate the thoughts of the godly,
that they might know that happiness is to be found in his favor alone, and that
whenever he is angry or displeased, though men may think themselves happy, and
flatter themselves and exult in their condition, they are yet in a most
miserable state; for all happiness is ruinous which does not flow from the
fountain of God&#8217;s gratuitous love; in short, when God is not our Father,
the more we abound in all kinds of blessings, the deeper we sink in all kinds of
miseries. This then is the meaning, when God says that he was angry with the
quiet nations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What, then, is the application of this doctrine? That
it behaved the Jews, though their condition was very hard according to the
perception of men, to have yet acquiesced in the love of God, for they knew that
he was their Father, and also, that though they saw their enemies happy, they
were yet to regard it no otherwise than a cursed happiness. so also in the
thirty-seventh Psalm, the faithful are bid not to envy the unbelieving, while
they saw them flourishing in wealth and rolling in pleasures; for it behaved
them to regard their end. Let us hence learn to raise up our thoughts to the
contemplation of God&#8217;s hidden love, when he deals severely with us, and to
be satisfied with his word, as we have there an indubitable evidence of his
favor: nor let us envy our enemies and the wicked, however the whole world may
applaud them, and they themselves luxuriate in their blessings, for we know that
God is adverse to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A reason also follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because God was a little angry,
and they helped forward the evil</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, they
exceeded moderation. The meaning is, that the reward of cruelty would be repaid
to all the enemies of the Church, because they had exercised immoderate
severity, when it was God&#8217;s purpose to chastise his children in a gentle
and paternal manner.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may be here first asked, How is it that God
declares that he had been a little angry with his people, since his judgment, as
pronounced by his servants, was most severe?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Whosoever shall escape the
famine, shall fall by the sword; whosoever shall escape the sword, shall fall
among wild beasts.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;261414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
14:14.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And in many other places he declares the same, that
there would be no hope of pardon to the people, but that they were all to
perish; that is, the whole body: &#8220;Though Noah, Daniel, and Job,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;were in this city, they shall deliver only their lives; but I will
not hear their prayers for this irreclaimable people.&#8221; But the particle
little,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">f[m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mot</i>, must be applied to the elect: for though God in his dreadful
vengeance consumed almost the whole people, yet a remnant, as we know, was
preserved. This is the reason why God says, that he was but little angry with
his people; for he speaks not of the reprobate and of that impure mass from
which he purposed to cleanse his own house; but he has respect to his covenant.
We now perceive for what purpose Zechariah says, that God was but moderately
angry with his people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But another difficulty meets us &#8212; In what sense
did the nations help on the evil? For it hence follows, that the heathens were
not restrained from raging immoderately and at their pleasure. And this place
has been also laid hold of by that miscreant, who has been lately writing
against God&#8217;s providence, holding that the wicked become wanton by means
of God&#8217;s hand and power, and are not thereby restrained. But this is
extremely foolish; for the Prophet here does not regard what the nations were
able to do or had done; but, on the contrary, he speaks of their cruelty, that
they thought that there ought to have been no end until the memory of that
people had been obliterated. And this is the reason why Isaiah says, &#8220;Thou
hast not seen her end.&#8221; He therefore upbraids the unbelieving, that they
did not calculate rightly as to the end of the Church; for the unbelieving
furiously attempted to destroy it, as though that promise could be made void,
&#8220;My mercy I will not take away.&#8221; Since the unbelieving did not see
her end, because it was the Lord&#8217;s will ever to preserve some remnant
among his chosen people, the Prophet says, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>helped forward the
evil</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We now then perceive the intention of the
Prophet, and see that the object is no other but to sustain the hope of the
faithful, until what they heard from the mouth of God really took place. Let us
proceed -</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This is a confirmation of the last prophecy, &#8212;
that God purposed to put an end to his chastisement, as it is said by Isaiah,
&#8220;They have received at Jehovah&#8217;s hand double for all their
sins.&#8221; For in these words God reminds us that he was satisfied with the
punishment he had inflicted on his people, like a father, who thinks that he had
been sufficiently severe and rigid in punishing his son. So now,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith Jehovah, I have
returned to Jerusalem in mercies</i></font><font face="Palatino">: for it was
necessary to give the people the hope of pardon and reconciliation, that they
might look forward with confidence. Hypocrites very quickly raise up their
crests as soon as a kind word is addressed to them; but the faithful, being
conscious of what is wrong, and having their sins before their eyes, do not so
easily take courage; nor can they do so, until they are convinced that their
sins are buried, and that they themselves are freed from guilt. Hence the
Prophet says, that God had turned to Jerusalem, that the Jews might know that
the punishment with which God had visited them was to be only for a
time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But in the meantime he exhorts them to humility: for
the people could not from this prophecy entertain any hope, except they duly
considered that they had suffered justly, because they had provoked God&#8217;s
wrath. Hence the Prophet reminds them that what they had hitherto endured was to
be imputed to their sins; but that God yet intended to treat them in a paternal
manner; for, as I have already stated, he had promised that his mercy towards
his elect and faithful would be perpetual. Hence he says, that he had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>returned in mercies to
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My house shall be built in it;
and over Jerusalem shall a line be stretched
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Line,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kue</i>, is to be taken for a perpendicular line, as in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;232817&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
28:17, and in other places. There is here an addition of
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>he</i>, for as it has been elsewhere said, the language had become somewhat
degenerated. The import of the whole is, that there was a hope of the temple and
of the city being built, because God had returned into favor with the people.
There are then two things to be noticed, &#8212; that God was now pacified
towards Jerusalem, &#8212; and that the fruit of reconciliation would be the
building of the temp]e, the establishment of divine worship and of the dignity
of the kingdom. The Prophet teaches us at the same time, that the building of
the temple was not to be expected but as an instance of God&#8217;s gratuitous
favor, so that the Jews might know that every hope would have been cut off, had
not God been pleased to abolish their guilt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This doctrine ought also to be extended to the state
of the Church at all times: for whence comes it that the Church remains safe in
the world? Nay, how is it that it sometimes increases, except that God indulges
us according to his infinite goodness? For we cease not daily to provoke him,
and deserve to be wholly exterminated from the world. There would then be no
Church, were not God to preserve it in a wonderful manner through his goodness
and mercies, and also to restore it when it seems to have wholly fallen. He at
length adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

shake our faith, &#8212; O grant, that we may yet stand firm on the promise that
thou hast once given us, and which thou hast also confirmed through thine
only-begotten Son, even that thou wilt ever be propitious and reconcilable to
us, so that we may not despair in our greatest troubles, but relying on thy
goodness may utter our groans to thee, until the ripened time of our deliverance
shall come: nor let us in the meantime envy the evanescent happiness of thy
enemies; but patiently wait, while thou showest that the chief object of desire
is to have thee propitious to us, and that accursed is every good thing which
the ungodly receive while they provoke thee and make thee angry, until Christ

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND THIRTY-SEVENTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I was not able in my last lecture fully to explain
the verse in which the Prophet says that he was commanded by the angel to cry
again, that God had returned to Jerusalem in mercies. The design of the words is
this, &#8212; that though it was difficult to believe the restoration of
Jerusalem, it was yet to be fully expected, for the Lord had so appointed. But
he enlarges on what I have before stated; for the blessing of God is extended to
the cities of Judah, though an express mention is made only of Jerusalem.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet
cities</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall wear out through abundance
of blessings</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for so I think the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnxwpt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tephutzne</i>, is to be taken, as futs means to spread, and also to wear out,
and to break. Some elicit a forced meaning, that cities would spread themselves;
others, that they would be separated, that is, that security would be so great,
that cities, though distant from one another, would be in no danger or fear. But
the meaning of the Prophet is clear, unless we designedly pervert it in a matter
so manifest and easy. The cities, he says, shall be worn out or wearied through
abundance of blessings, or as we say, <i>elles seront entassees</i>; for where
there is a great heap, there is crushing. He therefore says, that so great and
so full would be the abundance of all things, that the corn would press down
itself, and that the vessels would hardly contain the vintage. We now perceive
what the Prophet means, &#8212; that Jerusalem would yet be made complete, and
also that other cities would be filled with all good things, because God would
extend his favor to the whole people. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm20</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Comfort Zion will yet Jehovah,
and he will yet choose Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#8776;wp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>oud</i>, yet, is repeated; for the suspension of favor, of which we have
before spoken, might have somewhat prevented the faithful from realising the
promise. As then God&#8217;s favor was for a time hid, the angel declares, that
such would be the change, that God&#8217;s goodness and love towards his chosen
people would again shine forth as in former days.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the word &#8220;chosen,&#8221; it must be
observed, that it is applied, not in its strict sense, to the effect or the
evidence of election; for God had chosen before the creation of the world whom
he had designed to be his own. But he is said to choose whom he receives into
favor, because their adoption seems obliterated in the eyes of men, when there
appears no evidence of his paternal favor. As for instance, whenever we read
that God had repudiated his own people, it is certain, as Paul says, that the
calling of God is without repentance,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451129&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:29:) nor does he declare this only of the secret election of each, but also
of that general election, by which God had set apart the race of Abraham from
the rest of the nations. At the same time many of Abraham&#8217;s children were
reprobates, as he instances in the case of Esau and of others: yet the election
of God was unchangeable; and hence it was that there remained still some hope as
to that people, that God would at length gather to himself a Church from the
Jews as well as from the Gentiles, so that those who were then separated might
be hereafter united together. Since then the calling of God is without
repentance, </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ameta
melhtov</font><font face="Palatino">, how is it that the Lord is often said to
choose, and is also said to reject his chosen? These expressions refer to the
outward appearance of things. God therefore will secure his own election to the
end; but as we cannot otherwise perceive but that we are rejected by God when he
turns away his face from us, he is said to choose again those whom he has
repudiated, that is, when he really and by a clear evidence proves that he has
not forgotten their first adoption, but that he continues unchangeable in his
purpose.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand what the Prophet means. I have
more fully dwelt on this point, because it is necessary to understand this great
truth, &#8212; that whatever blessings God confers on his own people proceed
from eternal election, that this is a perpetual fountain, and yet that election
is catachrestically 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm21</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> applied
to its evidences or effects, as also rejection is to be taken in the same sense
for outward punishment, which seems at the first view to be an evidence of
rejection, though it be not really so. Let us now proceed -</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows another vision, by which God confirms
what he had before testified to his Prophet. He then says, that though enemies
should on every side rise up against the Church and cause it many troubles,
there was yet a remedy in God&#8217;s hand, as he would break in pieces all
horns by his hammers. He compares the Gentiles, who had been hostile to the
Jews, to horns; and he afterwards compares to workmen the other enemies, whose
hand and labor God would use for the purpose of breaking down the efforts of all
those who would be troublesome to the Church. The import of the whole then is,
&#8212; that though the Church would not be exempt and free from troubles, and
those many, yet God would have in his hand those remedies by which he would
check all the assaults of the wicked, however impetuously and violently they may
rage against his miserable Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But let us see in the first place why the Prophet
mentions </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>four
horns</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Jews refer to the Assyrians and the
Babylonians, to the Persian, the Grecians, and the Romans; because we find in
other places, and Daniel especially shows very clearly,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;270232&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
2:32,) that there were to be four principal monarchies, by which God intended to
give clear and memorable examples of his judgments. But the Prophet, I have no
doubt, speaks here of the Moabites and of the Syrians, and of other nations, as
well as of the Assyrians or Chaldees. They are then mistaken, as I think, who
suppose that these four monarchies are intended here: 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm22</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
Zechariah says that they were four horns, because they arose from the four
quarters of the world; for we know that the Jews were not harassed only on one
side, but on the east and the west, on the north and the south. Since then
enemies on every side joined their strength and their forces against the Jews,
so that there was a cause for trembling from the four quarters of the world,
that is, from all places around them, the Prophet says, that they had been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>scattered by four
horns</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This view, however, seems still frigid, because it
was not necessary for the Prophet to state what was well known to all: but God
intended to show that the nations which had been inimical and hostile to the
Jews, had done nothing but through his hidden impulse, in order that the Jews
might understand that these were so many scourges by which he purposed to
chastise them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must join the latter part, &#8212; that God
showed also to the Prophet </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>four
smiths</i></font><font face="Palatino">, for these two visions are connected
together. Whosoever then takes only the first part, acts very absurdly, for the
meaning of the prophecy will not be thus evident. If then we would not mutilate
what is connected, we must not separate what is added respecting the four
smiths. Inasmuch then as the Jews had been on every side oppressed, God shows
that he has remedies enough, and even from various quarters. The Prophet had
seen four horns; he now sees four smiths, that is, he is made to know that God
can immediately find means to check all disorders and tumults; for he can beat
as it were on an anvil these horns, and break in pieces those which had
previously scattered the Jews. The same view then is to be taken of the number
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>four</i></font><font face="Palatino">
as in the former instance: for as the Chaldeans had raged against the Jews, so
the Lord shows that he had enemies ready at hand, as he had already in part made
it evident; for how was it that the Persian and Medes had so suddenly taken
possession of Babylon, had they not been workmen whom God had employed to strike
down the Babylonian horn? And whence was it that the Syrians, the Egyptians, and
other nations had been made prostrate? It was because they were horns. But the
Lord broke down the ferocity of so many nations by his many workmen, for he
employed these as though they were hired and ready to do his service. We now
apprehend the real object of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But though the Prophet intended by this prophecy to
encourage and animate to patience his own nation, as the Spirit of God had given
him this office; yet there is here set before us by the Lord as in a mirror, the
real condition of the Church at this day. Let us not then wonder if the world
rage on every side against the Church and if storms and tempests arise from the
east as well as from the west: nor is it a new thing that many enemies from
various parts unite together; and that God&#8217;s Church should thus have to
bear many assaults. This is one thing. In the meantime let this be our
consolation, &#8212; that God has many smiths at hand. Very apposite is the
Prophet&#8217;s metaphor; for the hardiness of the horns was formidable LO the
Jews; but the Prophet intimates that there is hardness in the hammers, capable
of breaking in pieces all horns. God then, though we may be struck by our
enemies, will find smiths to break them in pieces; and this indeed is what we
have found by experience. How comes it, that the small number of those who
purely worship God continue to exist, notwithstanding the rage of enemies, and
in spite of so many consultations and devices? For what do all monarchies desire
more, or with greater avidity, than to extinguish the memory of the gospel? If
then we enquire, what is the condition of the whole world at this day, we shall
find that there is hardly a city or a people, or a monarch, or even one of the
least princes, whose race is not exhibited against the Church. How then comes
it, that they do not put forth their strength and demolish the Church, which by
one breath might a hundred times fall to the ground? How is this, except that
God by his handlers breaks the horns, and that by means of
smiths?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And who are these smiths? They are also horns; for
they all wish to destroy as much as they can the Church; but God does not permit
them; on the contrary he excites them to mutual wars to destroy one another.
Though then all these are horns, ready to assault the Church, and though it
appears evident from the comparison that they are as it were furious and vicious
bulls, and as much as they can unite together to scatter the Church, yet God
gives hammers to two or three of them, and bids them to check the ferocity of
their associates. While all these are intent on striking and dispersing the
Church by their horns, the Lord calls them to a different work, and as I have
said, bids them to be smiths that they may strike and break in pieces these
horns, even their associates, with whom they had previously wickedly conspired.
And it is certainly a wonderful instance of God&#8217;s providence, that amidst
so violent and turbulent commotions the Church should take breath, though under
the cross; for except these hammers had broken the horns, we must have been
pierced through, not only a hundred but a thousand times, and had been dashed
into fragments. But God has turned aside their strokes and assaults by his
hammers, and, as I have said, has employed his enemies for this
purpose.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see that this prophecy was not only
useful in the age of Zechariah, but that it has been so in all ages, and that it
ought not to be confined to the ancient people, but extended to the whole body
of the Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet, by saying that he asked the angel,
sets before us an example of a truly teachable disposition. Though the Lord then
may not immediately explain to us his messages, there is yet no reason for us in
disdain to reject what is obscure, as we see to be done by many in our day; for
when any thing seems ambiguous to them, they immediately reject it, and also
complain that God&#8217;s word is extremely difficult; and such blasphemies are
uttered by many at this day. But the Prophet, though perplexed, did not yet
morosely reject what God had showed; on the contrary, he asked the angels.
Though the angels are not nigh us, or at least do not appear to us in a visible
form, yet God can by other means afford us help when there is any perplexity in
his word: he promises to give us the spirit of understanding and wisdom,
whenever there is need; and we also know that the preaching of the word and the
sacraments are helps to lead us to himself. If then we neglect not these helps
which God affords us, and especially if we ask him to guide us by his Spirit,
there will certainly be nothing obscure or intricate in the prophecies, which he
will not, as far as it is necessary, make known to us. He does not indeed give
the Spirit in an equal degree to all; but we ought to feel assured, that though
prophecies may be obscure, there will yet be a sure profit derived, if we be
teachable and submissive to God; for we find that Zechariah was not deprived of
his request, as the angel gave him an immediate answer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must also be observed, that in one place he calls
him Jehovah, and in another angel; and indeed he speaks thus indiscriminately of
one and the same person. It hence follows that God appeared among the angels.
But we must remember what I have already said, that this chief angel was the
Mediator and the Head of the Church; and the same is Jehovah, for Christ, as we
know, is God manifested in the flesh. There is then no wonder that the Prophet
should indiscriminately call him angel and Jehovah, he being the Mediator of the
Church, and also God. He is God, being of the same essence with the Father; and
Mediator, having already undertaken his Mediatorial office, though not then
clothed in our flesh, so as to become our brother; for the Church could not
exist, nor be united to her God without a head. We hence see that Christ, as to
his eternal essence, is said to be God, and that he is called an angel on
account of his office, that is, of a Mediator.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning is now evident: God declares that the
horns were those which dispersed or scattered Judah as well as Jerusalem, and
the kingdom of Israel: but that he had as many smiths, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm23</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who
would by force and by hammers, shatter these horns in pieces, though for a time
they would greatly harass the Church. It must be also noticed that horn is to be
taken differently when the number is changed: the Gentiles are called horns in
the plural number to show their hardness or their strength; and they are then
said to lift up their horn in the singular number to show that they ferociously
exerted all their power to lay prostrate or to scatter the people of God. Then
follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Added now is another vision for the same end; not
that the former was difficult to be understood, but because there was need of
confirmation in a state of things so disturbed; for though the return of the
people was no common evidence of the goodness and favor of God yet as Jerusalem
was not flourishing as formerly, as the temple was like a cottage as there was
no form of a kingdom and no grandeur, it was difficult to believe what had been
already exhibited. This is the reason why God confirms by many proofs the same
thing; for we know how difficult the contest is, owing to the infirmity of the
flesh, when grievous and sharp trials assail us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence Zechariah says, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saw in the hand of a man a
measuring line</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He calls him a man, who
appeared in the form of man; and it is well known, and a common thing, that
angels are called men. For though they put on a human form only for a time, yet
as it was the Lord&#8217;s will that they should be seen in that form, they are
called men, though with no propriety. If it be asked, whether angels did really
put on human nature? the obvious answer is, that they never, strictly speaking,
became really men. But we know that God treats us as children; and there is the
same reason for the expression as for the thing itself. How was it that angels
appeared in human form? even that their access to men might be easier. Hence God
calls them men as in this place. Zechariah then says, that an angel appeared to
him in the form of a man, having in his hand a measuring line.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then asks him where he was going; the answer given
is, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to measure Jerusalem, to see
what was its breadth and its length</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The design
of the prophecy is then stated,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, inhabited shall be
Jerusalem throughout all its villages</i></font><font face="Palatino">, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm24</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as it
could not contain within its walls so large a multitude of men. God then would
so increase his people, that they could not be contained within its walls, but
that the limits of the Church would be spacious.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Inhabited</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be Jerusalem
throughout all its villages</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, through
the whole country around. This is the meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see the design of the Holy Spirit. As a small
portion only had returned from exile, the faithful might have become
disheartened when they found that the restoration of the Church was very far
from being so splendid as what had been so often predicted and promised. It was
therefore necessary that they should be encouraged, in order that they might
patiently wait while God was performing by degrees, and step by step, what he
had testified. That they might not then confine God&#8217;s favor to a short
period, or to a few days, the Prophet says here, that the measure of Jerusalem
was different in the sight of God from what it was in the sight of men. With
regard to the &#8220;line&#8221;, it was according to the ancient custom; for we
know that they did not then use a ten foot pole or some such measure, but a
line.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, by saying that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>raised up his eyes and saw
</i></font><font face="Palatino">this man, reminds us that Jerusalem was to be
regarded prospectively: for they could hardly be induced then to build the city
as a small and obscure town. We hence see that a difference is to be here
noticed between the external aspect of Jerusalem, such as it was then, and its
future condition, for which they were to look though not then visible. This then
is the design of the prophecy, when it is said, that when Zechariah raised up
his eyes, he saw a measure or a line in the hand of a man. He further reminds us
that he was attentive to these visions, for by asking he proves that he was not
asleep or indifferent, as many are who extinguish every light by their sloth;
and I wish there was no such torpor prevailing among us in the present day! for
we justly suffer punishment for our contempt, whenever we heedlessly and
negligently attend to what God sets before us. Let us then learn greater
attention and diligence from the Prophet&#8217;s example.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He asks where he was going, the answer given is,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
measure</i></font><font face="Palatino">: and then he shows what would be the
measure of Jerusalem, that it would hereafter extend beyond the walls, as that
compass would not contain the vast number of the people. &#8220;God will
extend,&#8221; he says, &#8220;far and wide the holy city; it will no longer be
confined as before to its own walls, but will be inhabited through all its
villages.&#8221; There is then no doubt but that God intended here to bear
witness respecting the propagation of his Church, which was to follow a long
time afterwards, even after the coming of Christ. For though Jerusalem became
wealthy and also large in its compass, and, as it is well known, a triple city,
and heathen writers say that it was among the first of the cities of the East
when Babylon was still existing, yet this prophecy was not verified in the state
of Jerusalem, for it was not inhabited without its walls, nor did it spread
through the whole of Judea. We hence conclude, that the spiritual Jerusalem is
here described, which differs from all earthly cities.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is said, that the angel
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>went
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>another angel met
</i></font><font face="Palatino">him. It hence appears as from the whole of what
the Prophet says, how carefully God provides for the safety of his Church; for
he has ever angels as his emissaries, who hasten at his nod, and aid the Church
in its necessities. Since then angels thus unite to secure the well-being of the
Church, we hence perceive how dear to God are the faithful, in whose favor he
thus employs all his angels; and we also see, that it was the Lord&#8217;s will
that this prophecy should be clear and manifest to all the godly: go, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>run to that young
man</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says, and tell him. Zechariah had
indeed asked for an explanation of the measure in the man&#8217;s hand, but from
the fact that another angel met him, it appears, as I have already said, that
God does not neglect the request and prayers of his people, provided only that
they are desirous of learning; he will then perform the part of a true and
faithful teacher towards them. But the word &#8220;run&#8221;, ought especially
to be noticed: &#8220;go,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and even hasten, lest the youth
should longer doubt, and explain the purpose of this prophecy.&#8221; He calls
the Prophet a youth, because he was then among angels. He would not call him a
man of full age, because he had before called an angel man. What rank could the
Prophet hold among angels except that of a youth? This circumstance ought
therefore to be observed as the reason why Zechariah spoke disparagingly or
humbly of himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now as to the import of the prophecy, we have already
said, that here is described the heavenly Jerusalem, which is surrounded by no
walls, but is open to the whole world, and which depends not on its own
strength, but dwells safely though exposed on all sides to enemies; for the
Prophet says not without reason, &#8220;through the villages shall Jerusalem be
inhabited;&#8221; that is, it shall everywhere be inhabited, so that it will
have no need of defense to restrain or hinder enemies to come near; for a safe
rest shall be given to it, when every one shall quietly occupy his own place. It

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms in this verse what I have just mentioned
&#8212; that Jerusalem would be safe, though without any fortifications; for God
alone would be sufficient for walls, for towers, for fortresses, according to
what is said by other Prophets: &#8220;God will be to thee a wall and a
fortress&#8221;,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;232601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
26:1), again, &#8220;he will be to thee a stronghold&#8221;. It is, therefore, a
sentence in accordance with other prophecies when Jehovah testifies, that he
would be a </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wall of
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We indeed know, that though walls may be
high and thick, they may be scaled by enemies; but who will dare to throw
himself into the fire? It is then the same as though God had spoken thus &#8212;
&#8220;Though there will be no watchmen to defend Jerusalem, no soldiers to
protect it, in short, no guardians whatever, yet I alone shall be sufficient;
for I shall not only be a wall to keep off enemies, but I shall be also a fire
to fill them with terror.&#8221;.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will be for glory in the midst
of her</i></font><font face="Palatino">: as though he had said, &#8220;the real
happiness of Jerusalem, within and without, will be in me alone and in my favor:
within, in the midst of her I will be for glory; I will adorn her with every
thing praiseworthy; and when there shall be any fear from the assault of
enemies, I will be to her a wall of fire. For though she will not excel in
strongholds and towers, and be without walls and fortresses, and shall be thus
exposed to many evils, I shall yet strike all enemies with terror, so that they
shall be kept afar off; and my Church shall be thus preserved safe, though
destitute of all human aids, and without any defense.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the meaning of the Prophet to be
this &#8212; that though the Jews saw that they were but few in number, weak in
strength, wretched and despised, they had yet reason to entertain hope; for
though few returned from exile God was yet able to increase the Church and to
make it a vast multitude, and that this was certain and decreed, for it was
shown by the vision, that however unequal they were to their enemies, God was
still sufficiently strong and powerful to defend them; and that however
destitute they were of all blessings, God was still rich enough to enrich them,
provided they relied on the blessing which he had promised; for he had engaged
to render them happy and blessed within, and safe from enemies from
without.</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THAT the design of the Prophet may be more clear, we
must especially bear in mind the history of the case. When it was allowed the
Jews, by the edict of Cyrus and of Darius, to return to their own land, that
kindness was suspected by many, as though the two kings had a wish suddenly to
oppress them when they had pained their object in their return. Some who dwelt
comfortably among the Chaldeans and in other places, preferred to enjoy their
rest rather than to return with so much trouble to their own country, where
there were no houses prepared, and where there were only dreary desolations. As
then the greater part of the people thus slighted the singular favor of God, of
which the Prophets had so often spoken, it was necessary that this sloth,
connected as it was with great impiety, should be reproved. For if any religion
had touched their hearts, they must have preferred Jerusalem to the whole world,
and the service of God to all earthly advantages and pleasures. Hence the
self-indulgence in which the Jews had become torpid, deserved a sharp and severe
reproof. This is the reason why the Prophet treats them here with so much
sharpness, for otherwise they could not have been roused.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ho!
Ho!</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he says, as though he had said, &#8220;What
means this delay? for when God has opened the door for you, ye still take your
rest, as though Judea were not your inheritance, as though there were no
difference between you and the profane heathens.&#8221; We now understand the
object of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ywh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>eui</i>, is used for stimulating them; and by it the Prophet reprehends their
indifference, which was a proof, as I have said, of ingratitude; for the Jews in
this way showed their contempt of that favor, which ought to have been preferred
far before all the wealth and the pleasures of the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the reason which is added seems far-fetched, or
even unsuitable &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For to
the four winds of heaven have I scattered you</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
for this could not have served to rouse the Jews to leave Babylon, and to return
to the holy land promised to them by God. Yet it was very efficacious towards
producing an impression on their minds; for the Lord shows, in these words, that
it was in his power to restore them in safety, inasmuch as they had not been
scattered here and there, except through his just vengeance. Had their enemies
prevailed against them, or had they without reason been expelled from their
country, a doubt might have crept in whether the promise could be relied on; but
when it appeared evident that their exile was a punishment inflicted by God,
they might safely conclude that he would become the author of their restoration;
for he who had inflicted the wound was able to heal it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see what the Prophet had in view: he
intimates that the Jews had hitherto suffered punishment from God, because they
obeyed not his word, but provoked by their obstinacy his extreme vengeance; they
ought then now to entertain hope, because God was pacified towards them and
ready to forgive them. As then their exile was from God, the Prophet intimates
that their return would not be difficult when God became reconciled to them,
because the Jews had to do only with the heavenly Judge himself. In short, the
Prophet designs to show that the Jews acted foolishly by continuing in exile,
when liberty was given them to return; and therefore he exhorts them to hasten
in time, lest the season of God&#8217;s favor should pass away, and thus the
door be again closed against them. That they might not hesitate whether this was
possible, he shows that it was in God&#8217;s power, for he had driven them from
their country; it would not therefore be difficult for him to open a way for
their return whenever he pleased.

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet repeats the same thing, though briefly,
and in other words: but while he briefly touches on what he meant to say, he
confirms and renders more plain the contents of the former verse. He shows that
it was a very great disgrace that Babylon should become as it were the grave of
Sion; for God had chosen that mount as the place where he was to be worshipped.
Babylon, we know, was a filthy cavern, accursed by God. It was therefore to
subvert, as it were, the order of nature, for the Jews to bury, so to speak, the
holy mount of God in that infernal region. This mode of speaking appears on the
first view somewhat harsh, but it is yet most suitable; for by Sion the Prophet
means the Jews, who were still dispersed in Chaldea. The temple had not indeed
been moved from its place, but only burnt and destroyed by the Chaldeans, and
there was no other temple built among the Babylonians. What then does the
Prophet mean by saying, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Sion,
who dwellest with the daughter of Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
return to thine own place? He even reminds the Jews that they were bound, as it
were, to the temple; for it was a sacred and an indissoluble bond of mutual
union between God and them.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;110613&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 6:13.) For when God proposed that a temple should be built for him on
mount Sion, he at the same time added,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I will dwell among
you; this is my rest.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
132:14.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since the Jews, then, became united to their God, the
temple ass introduced as a pledge of this sacred union. Thus justly and fitly
does the Prophet give the name of Sion to the Jews; for they were, as it has
been said, tied as it were to the temple, except they meant to deny God. Hence
he says, &#8220;Is it right that you should dwell among the Chaldeans? for ye
are as it were the stones of God&#8217;s temple. There is therefore for you no
fixed and permanent abode except on mount Sion, as you are in a sense that very
mount itself.&#8221; Therefore he says, &#8220;Sion, hasten and return to thine
own place; for it is strange and preposterous that thou shouldest dwell with the
daughter of Babylon.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, the Prophet shows that God&#8217;s favor
ought not to have been rejected, when he stretched forth his hand, and gave them
a free liberty to return. As then God thus appeared as the deliverer of his
people, the Jews ought not to have remained exiles, but immediately to ascend to
Jerusalem, that they might again worship God. And why did the Prophet mention
this? that the Jews might know that they had nothing to fear, though surrounded
with dangers; that though Satan suggested many perils, many difficulties, many
troubles, yet the grace of God would not be defective, or evanescent, or
fallacious, but that he would complete his work, and not disappoint those to
whom he had once testified, that there would be to them again a quiet habitation
in the land of Judah. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet pursues the same subject; for he shows
that the way was not opened to the Jews that they might soon after repent of
their return, but that the Lord might be with them, as their deliverance was a
signal proof of his kindness, and an evidence that he would commence what he had
begun. He then says, that by God&#8217;s order the Gentiles would be restrained
from effecting any thing in opposition to the Jews; as though he had said,
&#8220;Your liberty has been granted by Cyrus and by Darius; many rise up to
hinder your return, but whatever they may attempt they shall effect nothing; for
God shall check all their efforts, and frustrate all their attempts.&#8221; But
God&#8217;s herald does here publicly testify, that he was commissioned to
prevent the nations from doing any injury, and to declare that the people
brought back to Judea were holy to the Lord, and that it was not permitted that
they should be injured by any. This is the import of the whole.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But a difficulty occurs here, for the context seems
not consistent: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">, Jehovah
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sent
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for it is not the Prophet who receives here
the office of a herald; but it seems to be ascribed to God, which appears
inconsistent; for whose herald can God be? and by whose order or command could
he promulgate what the Prophet here relates? It seems not then suitable to
ascribe this to God, though the words seem to do so &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith Jehovah, After the
glory he sent me to the nations</i></font><font face="Palatino">: Who is the
sender? or who is he who orders or commands God? We hence conclude that Christ
is here introduced, who is Jehovah, and yet the Angel or the messenger of the
Father. Though then the being of God is one, expressed by the word Jehovah, it
is not improper to apply it both to the Father and to the Son. Hence God is one
eternal being; but God in the person of the Father commands the Son, who also is
Jehovah, to restrain the nations from injuring the Jews by any unjust violence.
The rabbis give this explanation &#8212; that the Prophet says that he himself
was God&#8217;s herald, and thus recites his words; but this is forced and
unnatural. I indeed wish not on this point to contend with them; for being
inclined to be contentious, they are disposed to think that we insist on proofs
which are not conclusive. But there are other passages of Scripture which more
clearly prove the divinity and the eternal existence of Christ, and also the
distinction of persons. If however any one closely examines the words of the
Prophet, he will find that this passage must be forcibly wrested, except it be
understood of Christ. We then consider that Christ is here set forth as the
Father&#8217;s herald; and he says that he was sent to the
nations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What he adds &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After the
glory</i></font><font face="Palatino">, is understood by some to mean, that
after the glory had ceased, in which the Jews had hitherto boasted, the message
of Christ would then be directed to the Gentiles. The meaning, then, according
to them is this &#8212; that shortly after the glory of the chosen people should
depart, Christ, by the Father&#8217;s command, would pass over to the nations to
gather a Church among them. But this passage may be also applied to the nations,
who had cruelly distressed the Church of God; as though he had said &#8212;
&#8220;Though your enemies have had for a time their triumphs, yet their glory
being brought to an end, God will send his messenger, so that they who have
spoiled you may become your prey.&#8221; It still seems probable to me that the
Prophet speaks of the glory which he had shortly before mentioned. We may then
view him as saying, that as God had begun to exercise his power, and had in a
wonderful manner restored his people, there would be no intermission until he
had fully established his Church, so as to make the priesthood and the kingdom
to flourish again. Then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>after the
glory</i></font><font face="Palatino">, imports as much as this &#8212;
&#8220;Ye see the beginning of God&#8217;s favor, by which his power shines
forth.&#8221; For doubtless it was no common instance of the Lord&#8217;s glory,
which he had manifested in restoring his people; and thus the Prophet encourages
their confidence, inasmuch as God had already in part dealt in a glorious manner
with them. He then takes an argument from what had been commenced, that the Jews
might hope to the end, and fully expect the completion of their deliverance.
&#8220;The Lord,&#8221; as it is said elsewhere, &#8220;will not forsake the
work of his own hands.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
138:8.) So the Prophet says now,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After the
glory</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, &#8220;since God has once shone
upon you in no common manner, ought you not to entertain hope; for he intended
not to disappoint you of a full return to your country, but to fulfill what he
had promised by his Prophets?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As God had spoken of the restoration of his Church,
and also of its perpetual condition, the Prophet here indirectly reproves the
ingratitude of those who were not convinced that God would be faithful to the
end, by seeing performed the commencement of his work. For as God had included
both the return of his people and their continued preservation, so also his
people ought to have included both favors: &#8220;The Lord, who has already
begun to restore his people, will defend to the end those whom he has gathered,
until their full and perfect redemption will be secured.&#8221; As then the Jews
did not look for the end, though God led them as it were by the hand to the land
of hope, the Prophet says to them,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After the
glory</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may farther observe, that the glory mentioned here
was not as yet fully conspicuous; it had begun, so to speak, to glimmer, but it
did not shine forth in full splendor until Christ came. It is then the same as
though the Prophet had said, &#8220;God has already emitted some sparks of his
glory, it will increase until it attains a perfect brightness. The Lord in the
meantime will cause, not only that the nations may restrain themselves from
doing and wrong, but also that they may become a prey to you&#8221;. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm26</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The reason for the order follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whosoever touches you, touches
the apple of his own eye</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or, of his eye; for
the pronoun may be applied to any one of the heathen nations as well as to God
himself; and the greater part of interpreters prefer taking it as referring to
any one of the nations. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whosoever
touches you touches the apple of his own eye</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
we say in French, <i>Ils se donnent en l&#8217;oeil</i>; that is,
&#8220;Whosoever will assail my people will strike out his own eyes; for
whatever your enemies may devise against you, shall fall on their own
heads&#8221;. It will be the same as though one by his own sword should pierce
his own heart. When therefore the nations shall consider you to be in their
poser, the Lord shall cause that they shall pierce their own eyes, or wound
their own breasts, for the import is the same.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whosoever</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>touches you, touches the

not be allowed to rage against you; for God shall cause them to kill themselves
by their own swords, or to pull out their eyes by their own fingers. This is the
meaning, if we understand the passage of the enemies of the
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may also be suitably applied to God:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whosoever touches you, touches
the apple of his eye</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and to this view I
certainly am more inclined; for this idea once occurs in
Scripture,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He will protect us
as the apple of his eye.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;191708&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
17:8.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As then the Holy Spirit has elsewhere used this
similitude, so I am disposed to regard this passage as intimating, that the love
of God towards the faithful is so tender that when they are hurt he burns with
so much displeasure, as though one attempted to pierce his eyes. For God cannot
otherwise set forth how much and how ardently he loves us, and how careful he is
of our salvation, than by comparing us to the apple of his eye. There is
nothing, as we know, more delicate, or more tender, then this is in the body of
man; for were one to bite my finger, or prick my arm or my legs, or even
severely to would me, I should feel no such pain as by having my eye or the
pupil of my eye injured. God then by this solemn message declares, that the
Church is to him like the apple of his eye, so that he can by no means bear it
to be hurt or touched. It afterwards follows: &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Christ continues to relate the commands of the
Father: for he speaks in his person, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I shake my hand over
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, enemies;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and they shall be a prey to their
own servants</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He means, that however numerous
and strong the enemies would be who would seek to injure the Jews, they would
yet be safe; for they would be protected by the hand of God, and not only so,
but that whatever their enemies would attempt to do would be in vain, for the
Lord would degrade them, and render them a prey to the Jews themselves: for by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>servants</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm27</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
doubtless means the Jews, who, for a time, had been oppressed by the tyranny of
their enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is certain that this prophecy was not fulfilled at
the time when the Jews thought that they were in a flourishing state, and
enjoying prosperity; for their condition was even then very wretched and
degrading. For whence had they their kings? Certainly not from the tribe of
Judah; and we all know how tyrannically they were governed, and also that the
kingdom was filled with many abominable sins and cruelties. They were become
parricides almost all; and whosoever will read their history will find, that
brethren were oppressed by brethren, and that even parents were cruelly and
wickedly treated. In short, not to say of other things, nothing could have been
more abominable than the family of Herod. We cannot then apply this prophecy to
that time which intervened between the return from the Babylonian exile, and the
coming of Christ. It is then only under the kingdom of Christ that God
accomplished what is here said, &#8212; that enemies became a prey to his
spiritual people, that is, when they were subdued and brought under the yoke of
Christ, for as we have said elsewhere, the government of the Church is vested in
its Head. Hence where Christ shines, there the Church, which is his body, is
said to reign; for Christ&#8217;s will is, that he should have nothing apart
from his members.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see the intention of the Prophet: he wished to
dispel the fear of the Jews, that they might not hesitate to return to their
country; for not only a way was opened for them, but confirmed also and certain
was their happiness under God&#8217;s protection; as he had not in vain begun a
glorious work, but fully purposed to carry it on to the end.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I shake my
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The shaking of the hand shows that God
has no need of many forces to put to flight his enemies, nor of a large
expedition; for as soon as he raises up his hand, he lays them all prostrate. In
short, the Prophet reminds us, that God has hands which extend far, for he can
by mere shaking conquer all enemies, however distant they may be. And then we
see that the facility with which God executes his purpose was mentioned, in
order that the Jews might feel assured, that as soon as it would please God to
put forth his strength, he would have no difficulty; for by the single motion of
his finger he could destroy all the enemies who might rise up against
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye shall know that Jehovah of
hosts has sent me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. To consider this as an
address to the faithful, may not seem suitable; for faith is connected with
knowledge, as we are taught by John,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;We know that we
are the children of God,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
John 3:2;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">for the certainty which rests on God&#8217;s word
exceeds all knowledge. Why then does the Prophet say, And we shall know that
Jehovah has sent me? for the faithful ought to have been previously certain
respecting the mission of Christ; otherwise an approach to God was closed up;
for an access, we know, to his favor is opened by faith. The Jews must have then
been assured from the beginning respecting the mission of Christ. But it is to
be observed, that there are two kinds of knowledge, &#8212; the knowledge of
faith, and what they call experimental knowledge. The knowledge of faith is that
by which the godly feel assured that God is true &#8212; that what he has
promised is indubitable; and this knowledge at the same time penetrates beyond
the world, and goes far above the heavens, that it may know hidden things; for
our salvation is concealed; things seen, says the Apostle, are not hoped for.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450824&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans

know that Christ has been sent by the Father, that is, by actual experience, or
in reality: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall

<div><font face="Palatino">He continues the same subject. The meaning is, that
God begins nothing which he does not determine to bring to its end. Since then
he had already begun to gather his people, that they might dwell in the Holy
Land, it was a work in progress, at length to be completed; for the Lord&#8217;s
will was not to be a half Redeemer. This is the purport of what the Prophet
says.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he now exhorts Sion to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rejoice</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
as though the happiness which he predicts was already enjoyed. This mode of
speaking, as we have seen elsewhere, is common among the Prophets. When they
intended to animate God&#8217;s servants to a greater confidence, they brought
them as it were into the midst of what was promised, and dictated a song of
thanksgiving. We are not wont to congratulate ourselves before the time. When,
therefore, the Prophets bade the Church to sing to God and to give thanks, they
thus confirmed the promises made to them; as though the Prophet had said, that
as yet indeed the brightness and glory of God was in a great measure laid, but
that the faithful were beyond the reach of danger, and that therefore they could
boldly join in a song of thanks to God, as though they were already enjoying
full redemption; for the Lord will perfect what he begins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rejoice</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and exult, thou daughter of
Sion</i></font><font face="Palatino">, &#8212; Why?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I
come</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God had already come; but here he
expresses the progress of his favor, by declaring that he would come; as though
he had said, &#8220;I have already given you obscure tokens of my presence; but
you shall find another coming which will be much more effectual to confirm your
faith.&#8221; Though then God had already appeared to the Jews, yet he says that
he would come, that is, when Christ would come forth, in whom dwells the
fullness of the Godhead bodily, and in whom God&#8217;s perfect glory and
majesty shines forth. And hence also does it more evidently appear what I have
already said, that this address cannot be applied without perversion to the
Prophet, nor be suitably applied to the person of the Father. It then follows
that Christ speaks here: but he does not speak as a man or an angel; he speaks
as God the Redeemer. We hence see that the name Jehovah is appropriated to
Christ, and that there is no difference between the Father and the Son as to
essence, but that they are only to be distinguished as to their persons.
Whenever then Christ announces his own divinity, he takes the name Jehovah; but
he also shows, that there is something peculiar and distinct belonging to him as
the messenger of the Father. For this reason, and in this respect, he is
inferior to the Father; that is, because he is sent as a messenger, and executes
what has been entrusted to him. These things do not militate the one against the
other, as many unlearned and turbulent men think, who entangle themselves in
many vain imaginations, or rather in mere ravings, and say, &#8220;How can it
be, that there is one eternal God, and yet that Christ, who is distinct from the
Father, and is called his angel, is a true God?&#8221; So they imagine that the
origin of divinity is God the Father, as though the one true God had begotten,
and thus produced another God from himself, as by propagation. But these are
diabolical figments, by which the unity of the Divine essence is destroyed. Let
us then bear in mind what the Prophet teaches here clearly and plainly, &#8212;
that Christ is Jehovah, the only true God, and yet that he is sent by God as a
Mediator.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold I come, he says, and I will
dwell in the midst of thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God dwelt then
among the Jews, for the building of the temple had been begun, and sacrifices
had been already offered; but this dwelling was typical only. It hence follows,
that some new kind of presence is here pointed out, when God was to reveal
himself to his people, not under ceremonial figures and symbols, but by
dwelling, at the fullness of time, substantially among them; for Christ is the
temple of the Godhead, and so perfectly unites us to God the Father, that we are
one with him. And it ought further to be carefully borne in mind, that the
Prophet does here also make a distinction between the ancient types of the law
and the reality, which was at length exhibited in Christ; for there is no need
now of shadows, when we enjoy the reality, and possess the completion of all
those things which God only shadowed forth under the law.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet describes here the voluntary surrender of
the nations, who would so join themselves to the Church of God, as to disown
their own name and to count themselves Jews: and this is what the Prophet
borrowed from those who had predicted the same thing; but he confirms their
testimony, that the Jews might know that the propagation of the Church had not
been promised to them in vain by so many witnesses. That what is said here
refers to the calling of the nations who would willingly surrender themselves to
God, is quite evident; for it is said that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>would be a people to
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This could not be, except the nations
surrendered their own name, so as to become one body with the Jews. He then
repeats what he had said, that God would dwell in the midst of Judea. Of this
dwelling something was said yesterday; for as they had already begun to offer
sacrifices in the temple, it follows that God was already dwelling among them.
We must then necessarily come to another kind of dwelling, even that which God,
who had before testified by many proofs that he was nigh the Jews, had at length
accomplished through Christ; for Christ is really Emmanuel, and in him God is
present with us in the fullness of his power, justice, goodness, and
glory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at last adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt know that Jehovah of
hosts has sent me to thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Something has also
been said on this sentence: the Prophet means, that it would be evident by what
would really take place, that these things had not been in vain foretold, as the
prophecy would be openly fulfilled before the eyes of all. Then shalt thou know,
not by the assurance of faith, which is grounded on the word, but by actual
experience. But he expresses more than before, for he says, &#8220;Thou shalt
know that Jehovah of hosts has sent me to thee.&#8221; The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;yla</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>alik</i>, &#8220;to thee,&#8221; is not superfluous; for he said a little
while before, that he was sent to the nations. As he now says, that he would be
the guardian of the chosen people, he also declares that his mission was to
them; and he gives to God the name of Jehovah of hosts, that the Jews might feel
assured that there would be no difficulty sufficient to hinder or delay the word
of God, as he possessed supreme power, so that he could easily execute whatever
he had decreed. I will not repeat now what I said yesterday of Christ; but we
ought nevertheless to remember this, that he who declares that he was sent, is
often called Jehovah. It hence appears that one and the same divine eternal
essence is in more persons than one. Let us go on -</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet confirms the former doctrine, but removes
offenses, which might have occurred to the Jews and prevented them from
believing this prophecy: for they had been for a time rejected, so that there
was no difference between them and other nations. The land of Canaan had been
given them as a pledge of their heirship; but they had been thence expelled, and
there had been no temple, no public worship, no kingdom. The Jews then might
have concluded from all these reasons, that they were rejected by God. Hence the
Prophet here promises that they were to be restored again to their former state
and to their own place.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will take Judah as his
hereditary portion</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, God will really
show that he has not forgotten the election by which he had separated the Jews
for himself; for he intended them to be to him a peculiar people. They were now
mixed with the nations; their dispersion seemed an evidence of repudiation; but
it was to be at length manifest that God was mindful of that adoption, by which
he once purposed to gather the Jews to himself, that their condition might be
different from that of other nations. When therefore he says, that Judah would
be to God for an heritage or for an hereditary portion, he brings forward
nothing new, but only reminds them that the covenant by which God chose Judah as
his people would not be void, for it would be made evident in its
time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the following clause is to the same purpose,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he will again choose
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for it was not then for the first
time that Jerusalem became the city of God when restoration took place, but the
election, which existed before, was now in a manner renewed conspicuously in the
sight of men. It is then the same as though the Prophet had said, &#8220;The
course of God&#8217;s favor has indeed been interrupted, yet he will again show
that you have not been in vain chosen as his people, and that Jerusalem, which
was his sanctuary, has not been chosen without purpose.&#8221; The renovation of
the Church, then, is what the Prophet means by these words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What we have said elsewhere ought at the same time to
be noticed, that the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>choose</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is not to be taken here in its strict sense; for God does not repeatedly choose
those whom he regards as his Church. God&#8217;s election is one single act, for
it is eternal and immutable. But as Jerusalem had been apparently rejected, the
word choose imports here that God would make it evident, that the first
elections had ever been unchangeable, however hidden it may have been to the
eyes of men. He then adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here is a sealing of the whole prophecy. The Prophet
highly extols the power of God, that the Jews might not still doubt or fear as
with regard to things uncertain. He says that whatever he had hitherto declared
was indubitable; for God would put forth his power to succor his Church and to
remove whatever hindrance there might be. We have seen similar expressions
elsewhere, that is, in the second chapter of Habakkuk and in the first of
Zephaniah;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;350201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
2:1
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;360101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zephaniah
1:1) and these Prophets had nearly the same object in view; for Habakkuk, after
having spoken of the restoration of the people, thus concludes, &#8212; that God
was coming forth to bid silence to all nations, that no one might dare to oppose
when it was his will to redeem his Church. So also Zephaniah, after having,
described the slaughter of God&#8217;s enemies, when God ordered sacrifices to
be made to him as it were from the whole world, uses the same mode of
expression, as though he had said, that there would be nothing to resist the
power of God. It is the same here,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Silent</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>let all flesh be before
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is, in short, the shout of triumph,
by which Zechariah exults over all the enemies of the Church, and shows that
they would rage in vain, as they could effect nothing, however clamorous they
might be.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By silence we are to understand, as elsewhere
observed, submission. The ungodly are not indeed silent before God, so as
willingly to obey his word, or reverently to receive what he may bid or command,
or humbly to submit under his powerful hand; for these things are done only by
the faithful. Silence, then, is what especially belongs to the elect and the
faithful; for they willingly close their mouth to hear God speaking. But the
ungodly are also said to be silent, when God restrains their madness: and how
much soever they may inwardly murmur and rage, they yet cannot openly resist; so
that he completes his work, and they are at length made ashamed of the swelling,
words they have vomited forth, when they pass off in smoke. This is the sense in
which the Prophet says now,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>silent be all
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He means, in short, by these words, That
when God shall go forth to deliver his Church, he will be terrible; so that all
who had before furiously assailed his chosen people, shall be constrained to
tremble.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the habitation of
holiness</i></font><font face="Palatino">, I explain it of the temple rather
than of heaven. I indeed allow that heaven is often thus called in Scripture:
and it is called the palace or temple of God, for we cannot think as we ought of
God&#8217;s infinite glory, except we are carried above the world. This is the
reason why God says that he dwells in heaven. But as the Church is spoken of
here, Zechariah, I doubt not, means the temple. It is indeed certain that there
was no temple when God began to rise as one awakened from sleep, to restore his
people: but as the faithful are said in Psalm 102 to pity the dust of Sion,
because the place continued sacred even in its degradation and ruin; so also in
this passage Zechariah says, that God was roused &#8212; Whence?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from
Sion</i></font><font face="Palatino">, from that despised place, exposed to the
derision of the ungodly: yet there God continued to dwell, that he might build
again the temple, where his name was to be invoked until Christ appeared. We now
see that the temple or Sion is intended rather than heaven, when all
circumstances are duly weighed. Now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We have said at the beginning that Zechariah was sent
for this end &#8212; to encourage weak minds: for it was difficult to entertain
hope in the midst of so much confusion. Some, but a small portion of the nation,
had returned with the tribe of Judah: and then immediately there arose many
enemies by whom the building of the city and of the temple was hindered; and
when the faithful viewed all their circumstances, they could hardly entertain
any hope of a redemption such as had been promised. Hence Zechariah labored
altogether for this end &#8212; to show that the faithful were to look for more
than they had reason to expect from the aspect of things at the time, and that
they were to direct their eyes and their thoughts to the power of God, which was
not as yet manifested, and which indeed God purposely designed not to exercise,
in order to try the patience of the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the subject which he now pursues, when he
says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Joshua the priest
</i></font><font face="Palatino">was shown to him, with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Satan at his right hand to oppose
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm28</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> God
was, however, there also. But when Zechariah says, that the priest Joshua was
shown to him as here represented, it was not only done in a vision, but the fact
was known to all; that is, that Joshua was not adorned with a priestly glory,
such as it was before the exile; for the dignity of the priest before that time
was far different from what it was after the return of the people; and this was
known to all. But the vision was given to the Prophet for two reasons &#8212;
that the faithful might know that their contest was with Satan, their spiritual
enemy, rather than with any particular nations &#8212; and also that they might
understand that a remedy was at hand, for God stood in defense of the priesthood
which he had instituted. God, then, in the first place, purposed to remind the
faithful that they had to carry on war, not with flesh and blood, but with the
devil himself: this is one thing. And then his design was to recall them to
himself, that they might consider that he would be their sure deliverer from all
dangers. Since we now perceive the design of this prophecy, we shall proceed to
the words of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that Joshua was shown to him. This was done
no doubt in a prophetic vision: but yet Zechariah saw nothing by the spirit but
what was known even to children. But, as I have already said, we must observe
the intentions of the vision, which was, that the faithful might understand that
their neighbors were troublesome to them, because Satan turned every stone and
tried every experiment to make void the favor of God. And this knowledge was
very useful to the Jews, as it is to us at this day. We wonder why so many
enemies daily rage against us, and why the whole world burn against us with such
implacable hatred; and also why so many intrigues arise, and so many assaults
are made, which have not been excited through provocation on our part: but the
reason why we wonder is this, &#8212; because we bear not in mind that we are
fighting with the devil, the head and prince of the whole world. For were it a
fixed principle in our minds, that all the ungodly are influenced by the devil,
there would then be nothing new in the fact, that all unitedly rage against us.
How so? Because they are moved by the same spirit, and their father is a
murderer, even from the beginning.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430844&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
8:44.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that the faithful were taught what was
extremely necessary, &#8212; that their troubles arose from many nations,
because Satan watched for their ruin. And though this vision was given to the
Prophet for the sake of his own age, yet it no doubt belongs also to us; for
that typical priesthood was a representation of the priesthood of Christ, and
Joshua, who was then returned from exile, bore the character of Christ the Son
of God. Let us then know that Christ never performs the work of the priesthood,
but that Satan stands at his side, that is, devises all means by which he may
remove and withdraw Christ from his office. It hence follows, that they are much
deceived, who think that they can live idly under the dominion of Christ: for we
all have a warfare, for which each is to arm and equip himself. Therefore at
this day, which we see the world seized with so much madness, that it assails
us, and would wholly consume us, let not our thoughts be fixed on flesh and
blood, for Satan is the chief warrior who assails us, and who employs all the
rage of the world to destroy us, if possible, on every side. Satan then ever
stands at Christ&#8217;s right hand, so as not to allow him in peace to exercise
his priestly office.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows another reason for the prophecy, &#8212;
that God interposes and takes the part of his Church against Satan. Hence he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rebuke thee Satan let
Jehovah,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm29</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
rebuke thee let Jehovah, who has chosen
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God speaks here; and yet he seems to
be the angel of Jehovah: 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm30</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
this is not inscrutable; for as in the last verse, where Zechariah says that
Joshua stood before the Angel of Jehovah, Christ is doubtless meant, who is
called an angel and also Jehovah; so also he may be named in this verse. But
that no contentious person may say that we refine on the words too much, we may
take them simply thus, &#8212; that God mentions here his own name in the third
person; and this mode of so speaking is not rare in Scripture,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Jehovah rained
from God.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011924&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
19:24).</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Why did Moses speak thus? Even to show that when God
fulminated against Sodom, he did not adopt a common mode of proceeding, but
openly showed that it was an unusual and a singular judgment. Thus the
expression here is emphatic,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rebuke thee let
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, I myself will rebuke thee.
However, were any one to consider well the whole context, he could not but allow
that the words may properly be applied to Christ, who is the portion of his
Church, and that therefore he was the angel before whom Joshua stood; and he
himself shows afterwards that the Church would be safe under his patronage.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let Jehovah then rebuke thee,
Satan, let him rebuke thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The repetition more
fully confirms what Zechariah meant to show, even that sufficient protection
would be found in God alone for the preservation of the Church, how much soever
Satan might employ all his powers for its ruin, and that though God would not
immediately give help and restrain Satan, yet a firm hope was to be entertained,
for this would be done in time the most seasonable. The import of the whole is,
&#8212; that though God had hitherto let loose Satan to assail the Church as to
the priesthood, yet God would be the faithful guardian of his Church, and would
check Satan, that he might not execute what he intended; and further, that many
contests must be patiently endured, until the period of the warfare be
completed. We now then see what the Prophet had in view in these
words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the rebuke of God is not to be regarded as being
only in words, but must be referred to that power by which God subverts and lays
prostrate all the attempts of Satan. At the same time he mentions the end for
which this rebuke was given; it was, that the Church might continue safe and
secure, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let Jehovah, who has
chosen Jerusalem, rebuke thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. These words are
to be read, not apart, but as joined with the former, as though he had said,
&#8220;Let God raise up his hand for the salvation of his chosen people, so as
to put thee, Satan, to flight with all thy furies.&#8221; This is the meaning.
Let us therefore know, that God is not simply the enemy of Satan, but also one
who has taken us under his protection, and who will preserve us safe to the end.
Hence God, as our Redeemer and the eternal guardian of our salvation, is armed
against Satan in order to restrain him. The warfare then is troublesome and
difficult, but the victory is not doubtful, for God ever stands on our
side.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we are at the same time reminded, that we are not
to regard what we have deserved in order to gain help from God; for this wholly
depends on his gratuitous adoption. Hence, though we are unworthy that God
should fight for us, yet his election is sufficient, as he proclaims war against
Satan in our behalf. Let us then learn to rely on the gratuitous adoption of
God, if we would boldly exult against Satan and all his assaults. It hence
follows, that those men who at this day obscure, and seek, as far as they can,
to extinguish the doctrine of election, are enemies to the human race; for they
strive their utmost to subvert every assurance of salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at last adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is not this a brand snatched from
the fire?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm31</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Here
God makes known the favor he had manifested towards the high priest, that the
faithful might be convinced that Joshua would overcome his enemies, as God would
not forsake his own work; for the end ever corresponds with the beginning as to
God&#8217;s favor; he is never wearied in the middle course of his beneficence.
This is the reason why he now objects to Satan and says, &#8220;Why! God has
wonderfully snatched this priest as a brand from the burning: as then the
miraculous power of God appears in the return of the high priest, what dost thou
mean, Satan? Thou risest up against God, and thinkest it possible to abolish the
priesthood, which it has pleased him in his great favor hitherto to preserve.
See whence has the priest come forth. While he was in Chaldea, he seemed to be
in the lower regions; yet God delivered him from thence: and now, when he sits
in the temple and is performing his office, is it possible for thee to pull down
from heaven him whom thou could not detain in hell?&#8221; We now perceive the
meaning of the Prophet as to this similitude. He then adds

<div><font face="Palatino">Zechariah adds here another thing, &#8212; that
Joshua had on mean garments, but that new garments were given him by the
angel&#8217;s command. And by this he means, that though the priesthood had been
for a time contemptible, it would yet recover whatever dignity it had lost. But
he ever leads the minds of the faithful to this point, &#8212; to look for what
they did not then see, nor could conjecture from the state of things at that
time. It is certain that the sacerdotal vestments, after the return from exile,
were not such as they were before; for they were not sumptuously woven, nor had
attached to them so many precious stones. Though Cyrus had bountifully supplied
great abundance of gold and silver for the worship of God, yet the chief priest
did not so shine with precious stones and the work of the Phrygians as before
the exile. Hence, what was shown to Zechariah was then well known to all. But we
ought to notice the latter clause, &#8212; that the angel commanded a change of
garments. The Prophet then bids the faithful to be of good cheer, though the
appearance of the priesthood was vile and mean, because God would not overlook
its contemptible state; but the time of restoration had not yet come; when it
came, the ancient dignity of the priesthood would again appear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the words, the first thing to be
observed is the fact, that Joshua
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stood before the
angel</i></font><font face="Palatino">, having on
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sordid</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or torn
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>garments</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm32</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
repetition seems to be without reason; for he had said before that Joshua stood
before the angel of God. Why then does he now repeat that he stood before the
angel? That the faithful might take courage; because it was God&#8217;s evident
purpose that the chief priest should remain there in his sordid garments; for we
think that God forgets us when he does not immediately succor us, or when things
are in a confused state. Hence Zechariah meets his doubt by saying, that Joshua
stood before the angel. He further reminded them, that though the whole world
should despise the priesthood, it was yet under the eyes of God. Conspicuous
were other priests in the eyes of men, and attracted the admiring observation of
all, as it is well known; but all heathen priesthoods, we know, were of no
account before God. Hence though heathen priesthoods shone before men, they were
yet abominations only in the sight of God; but the priesthood of Joshua, however
abject and vile it may have been, was yet, as Zechariah testifies, esteemed
before God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see that he who is often said to be Jehovah is
called an angel: the name therefore of Angel as well as of Jehovah, I doubt not,
ought to be applied to the person of Christ, who is truly and really God, and at
the same time a Mediator between the Father and the faithful: and hence he
authoritatively commanded the angels who were present; for Christ was there, but
with his hosts. While therefore the angels were standing by, ready to obey, he
is said to have bidden them to strip the high priest of his mean
garments.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Afterwards the angel addresses Joshua himself,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>See, I slave made to pass from
thee thine iniquity, and now I will clothe thee with new or other
garments</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> When
the angel said that he had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>taken
away iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he justly reminded them of the
filthiness contracted by the priest as well as by the people; for they had
denuded themselves of all glory by their iniquities. We hence see that the
mouths of the Jews were here closed, that they might not clamor against God,
because he suffered them still to continue in their sordid condition, for they
deserved to continue in such a state; and the Lord for this reason called their
filth, iniquity. He further teaches us, that though the Jews fully deserved by
their sins to rot in their struggle and filthiness, yet the Lord would not
finally allow their unworthiness to prevent him from affording
relief.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The import of the prophecy then is this, &#8212; That
however much the mean outward condition of the high priest might offend the
Jews, they were still to entertain hope; for the remedy was in God&#8217;s
power, who would at length change the dishonor and reproach of the high priest
into very great glory, even when the time of gratuitous remission or of good
pleasure arrived.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet had said that Joshua was clothed in
splendid and beautiful garments, who had on before such as were sordid, and that
this was done by the command of the angel: he now adds, that he wished that a
still greater glory should be bestowed on him, for he saw that something was
wanting. He therefore desired that the high priest should be adorned with a
crown, so that his dress might in every way correspond with the dignity of his
office. But what is here stated, that the Prophet spoke, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm34</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is not
to be taken as spoken authoritatively, but rather expressed as a wish, as though
he had said, that it was indeed a pleasant and delightful spectacle to see the
high priest decently and honorably clothed; but that it was also desirable, that
a crown or a diadem should be added, as a symbol of the priesthood, and not of
royalty. There is indeed no disadvantage in considering royalty also as
signified; for the kingly office, we know, is united with the priestly in the
person of Christ: but I take the crown here to be the priest&#8217;s mitre; for
we know that this was the chief ornament whenever the priest came to the altar
of incense. But as to the main point, we must bear in mind the design of the
Prophet, &#8212; that the high priest was adorned with splendid vestments, and
yet his dignity appeared only in part; therefore the Prophet desires that a pure
crown or mitre should be added: and he says that this took place even in the
presence of the angel, thereby intimating that his wish was by God
approved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now we ought first to contemplate the zeal and godly
concern of the Prophet, which he had for the glory and honor of the priesthood;
for though he regarded with joy the splendid dress of the high priest, he could
not restrain himself from wishing that the highest ornament should be added. And
this example is exhibited to us for imitation, so that we ought to desire the
increase of those favors of God, by which the priesthood of Christ is
signalised, until it arrives at the most perfect state. But we see that many are
against such a wish; for at this day there are those who profess some zeal for
true religion, but are satisfied with a mere shadow; or at least, it would
abundantly satisfy them to see the Church half purified: and the world is full
of men who indeed confess that the Church is defiled by many pollutions, but
wish only for some small measure of reformation. But the Prophet seems to invite
us to do a very different thing: he saw that the high priest was already adorned
with new garments; but when he considered that the honor of the priesthood was
not fully restored, he wished the mitre to be also added. And by saying that the
angels seconded his wish, he encourages us fully to believe, that if we desire
from the heart that his glory should be given to Christ, God will hear our
prayers: for the Prophet, when he sighed, did not in vain ask the angel to put a
mitre on the high priest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The expression, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the angel of God
stood</i></font><font face="Palatino">, is not without meaning. He was not an
idle spectator; and it is intimated that God had not only once a care for the
priesthood, but that the angel was always watching to defend Joshua; for it
would not be enough to be once adorned by God, who presides over the Church,
except his guardianship were perpetual. We now then understand the import of the
words. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet shows for what purpose he gave
Joshua his appropriate dress and splendor; and he teaches us, that it was not
done simply as a favor to man, but because God purposed to protect the honor of
his own worship. This is the reason why the angel exhorts Joshua; for it behaves
us ever to consider for what end God deals so liberally with us and favors us
with extraordinary gifts. All things ought to be referred to his glory and
worship, otherwise every good thing he bestows on us is profaned. And this is
especially to be regarded when we speak of his Church and its government; for we
know how ready men are to turn what God gives to his Church to serve the purpose
of their own tyranny.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is God&#8217;s will that he should be attended to
when he speaks by his servants and those whom he has appointed as teachers. But
we see from the beginning of the world how ambitious and proud men under this
pretense exercised great tyranny, and thus expelled God from his own government:
nay, the vassals of Satan often arrogate to themselves a full and unlimited
power over all the faithful, because God would have the priesthood honored, and
approves of a right discipline in his Church. As then Satan has in all ages
abused the high eulogies by which God commends his Church, this exhortations,
now briefly given by the Prophet, ought always to be added; for it is not
God&#8217;s will to extol men, that he himself might be as a private individual
and give up his own place and degree, but that the whole excellency bestowed on
the Church is intended for this purpose &#8212; that God may be purely
worshipped, and that all, not only the people, but also the priest, may submit
to his authority. Whatever glory then belongs to the Church, God would have it
all to be subservient to his purpose, so that he alone may be the supreme and
that rightly. We now then perceive the Prophet&#8217;s design.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And to give some weight to what is taught, he says,
that the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>angel bore
witness</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for the word used is forensic or
legal: one is said to bear witness to another, when he uses, so to speak, a
solemn protestations. In short, bearing witness differs from a common
declaration, as an oath, or an appeal to lawful authority, is interposed, so
that the words are sacred. It was then the design of the holy spirit by this
expression to render us more attentive, so that we may know that not a common
thing is said, but that God interposes an oath, or some such thing, in order to
secure more reverence to his order or command.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Protest
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>did the angel of Jehovah to
Joshua, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if my
charge thou wilt observe</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. The angel now
briefly teaches us, that the priests do not excel, that they may exult at
pleasure; but he interposes a condition, that they are to exercise faithfully
their office, and to obey the call of God. We then see that those two things are
united &#8212; the dignity of the priesthood, and the faithfulness which
God&#8217;s ministers, who have been called to that office, are to exhibit.
Hence they who seek to domineer without control, do thereby sufficiently show
that they are not the lawful priests of God; for Joshua typified Christ, and yet
we see how God bound him by a certain condition, lest relying on his honor and
title he should take to himself more than what was lawful or
right.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If Joshua, who was a type of Christ, together with
his successors, was not to regard himself dignified, but in order to obey God,
we hence see how foolish and even abominable is the arrogance of the Pope, who,
being content with a naked title, seeks to reduce the whole world to himself, as
if God had given up his own right.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But let us at the same time see what he means by ways
and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by
charge</i></font><font face="Palatino">. These two words ought, no doubt, to be
confined to the office of the priest. God commands us all in common to follow
where he leads us; and whatever he prescribes as to the way of leading a godly
and righteous life may be called a charge; for the Lord suffers us not to wander
and go astray, but anticipates errors and shows what we are to follow. There is
then a general charge with regard to all the faithful; but the priestly charge,
as I have already stated, is to be confined to that office. We yet know that men
are not raised on high by God, that he may resign his own authority. He indeed
commits to men their own offices, and they are rightly called the vicars of God,
who purely and faithfully teach from his mouth: but the authority of God is not
diminished when he makes use of the labors of men and employs them as his
ministers. We hence see that the priestly charge is this &#8212; to rule the
Church according to the pure Word of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou also shalt govern my
house</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This condition then is ever to be
observed, when the governors of the Church demand a hearing, even that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>keep the
charge</i></font><font face="Palatino"> of God. It is indeed true, that all the
ministers of the Word are adorned with honorable titles; but, as I have said,
their dignity is degraded if it obscures the glory of God. As then God would
have men to be heard, so that nothing may be taken from him, this condition
ought ever to be observed, &#8220;Thou shalt govern my house, if thou wilt walk
in my ways.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may however be asked, can priests be rightly
deprived instantly of their office when they depart from their duty? To this I
answer, that the Church ought, as far as possible, to be reformed; but yet
legitimate means ought to be used, so that the Church may reject all the
ungodly, who respond not to their duty, nor exhibit due sincerity, nor discharge
their office in obedience to God. All then who depart or turn aside from the
right course ought rightly to be rejected, but by legitimate authority. But when
the majority desire to have pastors, such as cannot but be deemed really wolves,
they must be borne with, though unworthy of the honor, and yet so borne with
that they be not allowed to oppress the Church with their tyranny, or to take to
themselves what belongs to God alone, or to adulterate the worship of God or
pure doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">However this may be, none are lawful priests before
God, except those who faithfully exercise their office and respond to the
calling of God, as we shall hereafter see in the second chapter of Malachi
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;390201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
2:1. But I am not disposed to enlarge; it is enough to adduce what an
explanation of the passage may require. In short, pastors divinely appointed are
so to rule over the Church as not to exercise their own power, but to govern the
Church according to what God has prescribed, and in such a manner that God
himself may always rule through the instrumentality of men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt keep my
courts</i></font><font face="Palatino">, appears not to be an honor to the
priest, for it was an humble service to wait in the courts of the temple. But
taking a part for the whole, the Prophet includes the charge of the whole
temple: and it was no common honor to have the charge of that sacred habitation
of God. It is not then improperly added that Joshua would be the keeper of the
temple, if he walked in the ways of the Lord. Nevertheless we see at this day
how the masked rulers of the Church, under the Papacy, not only disregard the
keeping of the temple, but wholly repudiate it, as it seems to be unworthy of
their high dignity. I call the charge of the temple, not that which is the duty
of overseers, but whatever belongs to the worship of God: but to feed the flock,
to discharge the office of pastors, and to administer the sacraments, is to
these a sordid employment. Hence the Pope, with all his adherents, can easily
bear to be relieved from the charge of the temple; but yet he seeks to rule in a
profane and tyrannical manner, and according to his own pleasure. But we here
see that the charge of the temple is especially intrusted to the priest, as it
was a special honor. We also see on what condition God allowed the priests to
continue in their dignity, even on that of walking in his ways.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will give thee passages
</i></font><font face="Palatino">(intercourses)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>among those who stand
by</i></font><font face="Palatino">, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm35</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
is, I will cause all the godly to admit and freely to receive thee. The angels
who stood there, no doubt, represented the body of the Church; for they are
mingled with the faithful whenever they meet together in the name of Christ, as
Paul teaches us in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 11:10. Angels alone then stood by; but it is the same as though God
had said, &#8220;Thee will all the faithful acknowledge, so that a free passage
will be open to thee among them, provided thou walkest in my ways.&#8221; And he
puts
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>passages</i></font><font face="Palatino">
in the plural number, for he speaks of continued homage and
regard.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning is, that the priest is ever worthy of
regard and honor when he faithfully performs his office and obeys the call of
God. We may, on the other hand, conclude that all masked pastors ought justly to
be excluded, when they not only are apostates and perfidious against God, but
seek also to destroy the Church; yea, when they are also voracious wolves and
spiritual tyrants and slaughterers. All those who are such, the angel clearly
intimates, are not only unworthy of being received, but ought also to be
excluded and exterminated from the Church. We now then perceive what I have
stated, that whatever excellency belongs to the pastors of the Church ought not
to be separated from the honor due to God; for God does not resign his authority
to mortals, nor diminish anything from his own right; but he only constitutes
men as his ministers, that he may by them govern his Church alone, and be alone
supreme. It hence follows, that they are unworthy of honor who perform not
faithfully their office; and when they rob God of what belongs to him, they
ought to be deprived of their very name; for it is nothing else but the mask of
Satan, by which he seeks to deceive the simple. He afterwards adds

<div><font face="Palatino">The angel shows here, that what had been hitherto
shown to Zechariah was typical; for the reality had not as yet come to light,
but would appear in its time. We have said that God&#8217;s design was to lead
the godly to the expectation of Christ; for these beginnings of favor were
obscure. It behaved them, therefore, to hope for far more than they saw; and
this appears evident from the verse before us, in which the angel says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hear
now</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He makes this preface to gain attention,
as though he said, that he was going to speak of something remarkable. Then he
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou and thy associates who
stand before thee; I will send my servant the
Branch</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us notice this, which is the main part of the
verse, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I send my servant,
the Branch</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The God of hosts no doubt refers to
the priest, who is eminent beyond the common comprehension of men. He is called
a Branch, because he was to come forth as a stem, according to what is said in
Isaiah, the eleventh chapter,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;231101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
11:1 and in other places. It is then the same as though he had said, &#8220;this
priesthood is as yet disregarded, nevertheless my servant, the priest, shall
come forth like a branch which arises from the earth, and it will grow.&#8221;
The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jmx</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tsamech</i> means a shoot. He then compares Christ to a shoot, for he seemed,
as we say, to rise up from nothing, because his beginning was contemptible. For
what excellency had Christ in the estimation of the world when he was born? how
did he commence his kingdom? and how was he initiated into his priesthood?
Doubtless, whatever honor and glory the Father had given him was regarded we
know with contempt. It is then no wonder that he is on this account called a
Branch.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the reason for the similitude is apparent enough:
and though the angel speaks indefinitely, the person of Christ is no doubt
intended. How so? We may judge by the event itself. What priest succeeded Joshua
who equalled him in honor, or who in the tenth degree approached him? We know
that nearly all were profane and ungodly men; we know that the priesthood became
venal among them; we know that it was contended for with the most cruel hatred;
nay, we know that a priest was slain in the temple itself; ambition was burning
so furiously that no success could be gained without shedding innocent blood.
After the death of Joshua nothing could have been more base and more disgraceful
than the Jewish priesthood. Where then is to be found this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>servant</i></font><font face="Palatino">
of God, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Branch?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">This principle must also be ever borne in mind,
that the reformation of the temple was to be made by Christ: we must, therefore,
necessarily come to him, that we may find the servant mentioned here. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm36</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And why
he is called a servant has been stated elsewhere; for he humbled himself that he
might be not only the minister of his Father, but also of men. As then Christ
condescended to become the servant of men, it is no wonder that he is called the
servant of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now enquire why the angel bids Joshua and his
companions to hear. He indirectly reproves, I doubt not, the common unbelief,
for there were very few then who had any notion of a future and spiritual
priesthood. Indeed, the people had the promises in their mouths, but nearly all
had their thoughts fixed on the earth and the world. This is the reason why the
angel directed his words especially to Joshua and his companions: he saw that
the ears of others were almost closed; he saw so much indifference in the
people, that hardly any one was capable of receiving his doctrine: and thus he
intended to obviate a trial which might have weakened the courage of Joshua. For
we know how ready we are to faint when the whole world would drive us to
apostasy; for when any of us is weak, we wish to be supported by others; and
when there is no faith, no religion, no piety among men, every one is ready to
quail. In short, we can hardly believe God, and continue firm in his word,
except we have many companions, and a large number in our favor; and when
unbelief prevails everywhere our faith vacillates. Hence the angel now addresses
Joshua and his companions apart; as though he had said, that there was no reason
for them to depend on the multitude, but, on the contrary, to look to God, and
by relying on his word to wait patiently for what he promised, though all the
rest were to reject his favor:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and thy friends who stand
before thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for they are men of
wonder</i></font><font face="Palatino">; or though they are men of wonder; but
the meaning is the same. For God means, that though the whole people rejected
what he now declares as to the renewal of the priesthood, it would yet be found
true and confirmed in its own time. Some render the words, &#8220;men of
prodigy,&#8221; because they were objects of wonder and they think that the
companions of Joshua were signalised by this title or encomium, because their
faith was victorious and surmounted all hindrances. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm37</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But the
meaning of the prophet seems to me to be wholly different: and, I doubt not, but
that this passage is the same with another in Isaiah, the eighth chapter,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230801&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
8:1 where he says, that the faithful were men of prodigy, or, that they were for
a sign or prodigy, because they were objects of hatred, &#8220;what do these
seek for themselves?&#8221; As then all were astonished as at a spectacle new
and unwonted, when any one of the faithful met them, the Prophet says, that the
true servants of God were then for a sign and prodigy. So here they are men of
prodigy, for we see clearly, that the companions of Joshua were separated from
the rest, or the common multitude. Why? not because they were objects of wonder,
for that would be frigid, but because they were objects of reproach to all; and
they were hardly borne with by the people, who clamored, &#8220;what do these
seek for themselves? they seek to be wiser than the
Church.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the same way we find ourselves at this day to be
condemned by the Papists. &#8220;Oh! these, forsooth, will create a new world,
they will create a new law: the rule of our great men will not satisfy these; we
have a Church founded for so many ages, antiquity is in our favor. In short
these men tear asunder what has been sanctioned from the beginning until
now.&#8221; But in the time of Joshua and in the time of Isaiah, all who simply
believed God were regarded as strange men; for the people had become then so
unrestrainedly licentious, that to retain the pure worship of God was viewed as
a strange thing on account of its novelty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now apprehend the meaning of the words, when the
angel bids Joshua and his companions to attend, and when he calls them the men
of prodigy, and when at last he promises that a priest should arise like a
Branch, for God would make Christ to rise up, though hid, not only under the
feet, but under the earth itself, like a shoot which comes forth from the root
after the tree has been cut down. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He more fully sets forth what we have observed in the
last verse; but he speaks figuratively. He says that there were seven eyes on
the stone which was set before Joshua; and that God would in one day take away
the iniquity of the land, so that nothing would prevent it from recovering its
ancient glory. This is the import of the whole; but interpreters vary,
especially as to the eyes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Almost all Christians agree as to the stone; for they
think Christ to be  meant; and we know that there are many similar passages,
where Christ is called a stone, because the Church is on him founded;
&#8220;Behold, I lay in Zion a precious stone,&#8221; says Isaiah in the
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;232801&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
28:1; and in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19B801&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
118:1 and in other places there are similar words. I yet think that the Prophet
alludes to the temple, which was then begun to be built; but at the same time I
take this as admitted, that Christ is called metaphorically a stone, as before
he was called a Branch. But we must bear in mind that the external figure of the
visible temple is applied to Christ himself.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
says God, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the stone which I have
set </i></font><font face="Palatino">before Joshua has
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seven
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and further,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will engrave it with
sculptures</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that it may appear wonderful before
the whole world. We now perceive what the subject is, and the mode of speaking
here adopted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the subject, the angel says, that the temple
which Joshua had begun to build, was a celestial building; for God here declares
himself to be its founder and builder, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
stone</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says, which
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have
set</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and he says this, that Joshua might know
that he labored not in vain in building the temple. For had it been the work of
men, it might have fallen, and might have been pulled down a hundred times by
the hand of enemies; but God declares that the temple was founded by his own
hand. He, at the same time, as I have said, raises up the thoughts of the godly
to Christ, which is the substance and reality of the temple. Hence he says, I
set a stone before Joshua; that is, &#8220;Though Joshua builds, and workmen
diligently labor with him, yet I am the chief framer and architect of the
temple.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on this stone
</i></font><font face="Palatino">shall be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seven
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some apply this to the seven graces of
the Spirit: but the definition which they make, who have said, that the grace of
the Spirit is sevenfold, is puerile; they know not about what they prattle and
vainly talk; for Scripture speaks of many more. They also falsely adduce a
passage from the
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;231101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
11:1 for they mistake there as to the number: the Latin version has led them
astray. Others think that the seven eyes have a reference to the whole world; as
though the angel had said, that all will direct their eyes to this stone,
according to what is said by Christ, that he was raised up on high, that he
might draw all men to himself: then seven eyes, that is the eyes of all men,
shall be turned to this stone. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm38</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some
again apply this to the fullness of grace which has been given to Christ. But I
think that the simpler view is, that his glory is set forth, according to what
immediately follows, &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will engrave its engravings</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For it is a vain
refinement to say, that God engraved engravings when the side of Christ was
pierced, when his hands and his feet were perforated: this is to trifle, and not
seriously to explain Scripture. But the Prophet by engraving, means the valuable
and extraordinary character of this stone; as though he had said, &#8220;It will
be a stone remarkable for every excellency; for God will adorn this stone with
wonderful engravings; and then it will be a stone having eyes, that is, it will
not only turn to itself the eyes of others, but it will illuminate them, and
exhibit as it were such brightness as will, by its own reflection, lead men to
behold it.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm39</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We now
understand the full meaning of the Prophet. What remains I cannot finish
now.</font><br></div>

wait, until Christ shall at length appear in the splendor of his priesthood and
kingdom; and may we, in the meantime, contemplate the excellency with which thou
hast adorned thy Church, and be thus encouraged to connect ourselves with those
few and despised men, who faithfully and sincerely follow thy word, and
disregard the arrogance of the whole world, and never doubt, but that if we
remain grounded in the pure doctrine of the gospel, thou wilt raise us up to
heaven, yea, and above all heavens, where we shall enjoy that blessedness which
thine only-begotten Son has obtained for us by his own blood. &#8212;
Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND FORTY-FIRST</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE have to consider the last words of the ninth
verse, in which God promises to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>remove the iniquity of the land
in one day</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some refinedly take the one day for
the one sacrifice, by which Christ once for all expiated for ever for the sins
of the world; but the Prophet in my view speaks in a simpler manner; for he
mentions one day for suddenly or quickly. I indeed allow that expiation was to
be sought through the one sacrifice of Christ; but the Prophet intimates, that
God would be so propitious to the Jews, as to deliver them from all the wrongs
and molestations of their enemies. He then assigns a reason why he purposed to
deal so bountifully with his people, even because he would not impute their
sins. And we know this to be the fountain of all the blessings which flow from
God to us, that is, when he forgives us and blots out our sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then apprehend the Prophet&#8217;s meaning: I
will take away the iniquity of the land in one day, that is, &#8220;Though
hitherto I have in various ways punished this people, I shall of a sudden be
pacified towards them, so that no iniquity shall come to an account before me,
or prevent me from favoring this people.&#8221; It now follows in the Prophet

<div><font face="Palatino">We see from this verse that a particular time is
signified by one day; for the Prophet wished to inspire the Jews with
confidence, lest they should think that their misery would continue, because God
had hitherto treated them with rigor and severity. Here then is shown to them a
sudden change. He therefore adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that day, ye shall call every
one his neighbor under his vine and under his
fig-tree</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, &#8220;Ye shall dwell
secure, beyond the reach of fear or of danger; for no one will be incensed
against you.&#8221; This kind of expression signifies a safe and quiet state,
that is, when it is said; that neighbors meet together under the vine and under
the fig-tree. For they who fear, either remain inclosed in cities, or seek, when
in the country, some fortified place and difficult of access, or watch their own
doors that they may not be exposed to injuries; but they who joyfully meet
together under the vine or under the fig-tree, show that they are free from
every anxiety and fear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum of the whole then is, &#8212; that when God
shall openly make himself the guardian of his Church, the faithful shall be
relieved from every fear, and shall cheerfully enjoy their freedom, so that they
shall venture to have their repast under the vine and under the fig-tree, that
is, in the open air and on the public road, as there will be none to terrify
them. But as this promise is to be extended to the whole kingdom of Christ, what
is said ought to be applied to that spiritual peace which we enjoy, when we are
fully persuaded that God is reconciled to us; for then also us become reconciled
among ourselves, so that we no longer seek to injure one another, according to
what we have observed in Micah,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;330404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah

<div><font face="Palatino">Another vision is narrated here, &#8212; that a
candlestick was shown to the Prophet, on which there were seven lights. He says
that the candlestick was formed
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all of
gold</i></font><font face="Palatino">: and he says that to the seven lamps there
were as many cruses, (infusoria &#8212; pourers,) or, as some think, there were
seven cruses to each lamp: but the former view is what I mostly approve, that
is, that every lamp had its own cruse. He further says, that there were two
olive-trees, one on the right, the other on the left hand, so that there was no
deficiency of oil, as the olive-trees were full of fruit. Since then there was a
great abundance of berries, the oil would not fail; and the lamps were
continually burning. This is the vision, and the explanation is immediately
added, for God declares that his Spirit was sufficient to preserve the Church
without any earthly helps, that is, that his grace would always shine bright,
and could never be extinguished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is, moreover, no doubt but that God set forth
to Zechariah a figure and an image suitable to the capacities of the people. The
candlestick in the temple, we know, was made of gold; we know also, that seven
lamps were placed in the candlestick, for it had six branches; and then there
was the trunk of the candlestick. As then the seven lamps shone always in the
temple on the golden candlestick, it was the Lord&#8217;s design here to show
that this ceremonial symbol was not superfluous or insignificant; for his
purpose was really to fulfill what he exhibited by the candlestick: and such
analogy is to be seen in many other instances. For it was not the Lord&#8217;s
purpose simply to promise what was necessary to be known; but he also designed
to add at the same time a confirmation by ceremonial types, that the Jews might
know that their labor was not in vain when they lighted the lamps in the temple;
for it was not a vain or a deceptive spectacle, but a real symbol of his favor,
which was at length to be exhibited towards them. But we may more fully learn
the design of the whole, by considering the words, and each part in
order.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that the Angel
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>returned</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
by which we understand that God, without any request or entreaty on the part of
the Prophet, confirmed by a new prophecy what we have already observed; for the
Prophet confesses that he was as it were overcome with astonishment, so that it
was necessary to awake him as it were from sleep. The Prophet was not therefore
able to ask any thing of God when under the influence of amazement; but God of
his own free will came to his aid, and anticipated his request. We hence see
that the faithful were not in one way only taught to entertain confidence as to
the restoration of the Church; but as there was need of no common confirmation,
many visions were given; and it must at the same time be added, that though no
one interposed, yet God was of his own self solicitous about his Church, and
omitted nothing that was necessary or useful to support the faith of his people.
And farther, as the Prophet says that he was awakened by the Angel, let us
learn, that except God awakens us by his Spirit, torpor will so prevail over us,
that we cannot raise our minds above. Since God then sees that we are so much
tied down to the earth, he rouses us as it were from our lethargy. For if the
Prophet had need of such help, how much more have we, who are far below him in
faith? Nay, if he was earthly, are we not altogether earth and ashes? It must
yet be observed, that the Prophet was not so overwhelmed with drowsiness as with
astonishment; so that he was hardly himself, as it is the case with men in an
ecstasy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet was also reminded to be attentive to the
vision &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What seest
thou?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Then there was presented to him a sight
which we have described; but the Prophet by seeing could have seen nothing, had
he not been instructed by the Angel. We must also observe, that this tardiness
of the Prophet is useful to us; for we hence more surely conclude, that nothing
was represented without a design; but that the whole was introduced for his
benefit, though he overlooked, as with closed eyes, what God showed to him by
the Angel. We then conclude that there was nothing done by chance, but that the
Prophet was really under a divine guidance, so that he might learn what he was
afterwards faithfully to deliver to others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The vision is then narrated &#8212; that a
candlestick of God was shown to him. The substance of the candlestick was
intended to set forth a mystery. It is indeed true that gold is corruptible; but
as we cannot otherwise understand what exceeds the things of the world, the
Lord, under the figure of gold, and silver, and precious stones, sets forth
those things which are celestial, and which surpass in value the earth and the
world. It was for this purpose that God commanded a candlestick to be made of
gold for him, not that he needed earthly wealth or riches, or was pleased with
them as men are, whose eyes are captivated by the sight of gold and silver. We
indeed know that all these things are counted as nothing before God; but regard
was had in these symbols to this &#8212; that they might know that something
sublime and exalted was to be understood whenever they looked on the golden
candlestick. Hence by the gold the Prophet must have learnt, that what was here
set forth was not worthless or mean, but unusual and of great
importance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards says that there was a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>vessel</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
or some render it a pot; but it was a round vessel, and it was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on the top of the
candlestick</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for the lamps burned on the very
summit of the candlestick. Now there was a pot or bowl; and here there was a
little difference between the candlestick of the temple and that of which the
Prophet speaks now; for in the candlestick of the temple there were many pots or
bowls, but here the Prophet says that there was but one; and also that there
were seven pourers or postings; for by this term we may understand the very act
of pouring, as well as the instruments themselves. But it is better to refer
this to the pourers, which distilled the oil continually, that the wick might
not become dry, but gather always new strength. He says that there were seven
pourers to the lamps on the top; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm40</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
also that there were </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>two
olive-trees</i></font><font face="Palatino">, which supplied new abundance, so
that the oil was always flowing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must now then enquire the meaning of the vision.
Many understand by the candlestick the Church; and this may be allowed. At the
same time I think that God here simply testified to the Jews, that in having
commanded them to set up a candlestick, he did not appoint an empty, or a
deceptive, but a real symbol. God no doubt represented by the lamps the graces,
or the various gifts of his Spirit; yet the idea of a sevenfold grace is a mere
fancy; for God did not intend to confine to that number the gifts of the Holy
Spirit, the variety of which is manifold, even almost infinite. Hence the number
seven designates perfection, according to the common usage of Scripture. God
then intended by placing the candlestick in the midst of the temple, to show
that the grace of his Spirit always shines in his Church, not of one kind only,
but so that there was nothing wanting as to its perfection. Some think that
teachers are represented by the lamps; but as I have already said, it is better
to take a simple view of the meaning than refinedly to philosophise on the
subject. There is indeed no doubt but that God pours forth his graces to
illuminate his Church by his ministers; this we find by experience; but what I
have stated is sufficient that God never forsakes his Church, but illuminates it
with the gifts of his Spirit; while yet the variety of these gifts is set forth
by the seven lamps. This is one thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It afterwards follows, that the Prophet inquired of
the Angel, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What does this
mean?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We hence learn again, that the Prophet
was instructed by degrees, in order that the vision might be more regarded by
us; for if the Prophet had immediately obtained the knowledge of what was meant,
the narrative might be read by us with no attention; we might at least be less
attentive, and some might probably think that it was an uncertain vision. But as
the Prophet himself attentively considered what was divinely revealed to him,
and yet failed to understand what God meant, we are hereby reminded that we
ought not to be indifferent as to what is here related; for without a serious
and diligent application of the mind, we shall not understand this prophecy, as
we are not certainly more clear-sighted than the Prophet, who had need of a
guide and teacher. There is also set before us an example to be imitated, so
that we may not despair when the prophecies seem obscure to us; for when the
Prophet asked, the Angel immediately helped his ignorance. There is therefore no
doubt but that the Lord will supply us also with understanding, when we confess
that his mysteries are hid from us, and when conscious of our want of knowledge,
we flee to him, and implore him not to speak in vain to us, but to grant to us
the knowledge of his truth. The angel&#8217;s question to the Prophet, whether
he understood or not, is not to be taken as a reproof of his dullness, but as a
warning, by which he meant to rouse the minds of all to consider the mystery. He
then asked, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Art thou ignorant of
what this means</i></font><font face="Palatino">, in order to elicit from the
Prophet a confession of his ignorance. Now if the Prophet, when elevated by
God&#8217;s Spirit above the world, could not immediately know the purpose of
the vision, what can we do who creep on the earth, except the Lord supplies us
with understanding? In short, Zechariah again recommends to us the excellency of
this prophecy, that we may more attentively consider what God here
declares.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls the angel his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
according to the custom of the Jews; for they were wont thus to address those
who were eminent in power, or in anything superior. He did not call him Lord
with the intention of transferring to him the glory of God; but he thus
addressed him only for the sake of honor. And here again we are reminded, that
if we desire to become proficient in the mysteries of God, we must not arrogate
any thing to ourselves; for here the Prophet honestly confesses his own want of
knowledge. And let us not at this day be ashamed to lie down at God&#8217;s
feet, that he may teach us as little children; for whosoever desires to be
God&#8217;s disciple must necessarily be conscious of his own folly, that is, he
must come free from a conceit of his own acumen and wisdom, and be willing to be
taught by God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows the explanation the angel gives this
answer &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is the word
of Jehovah to Zerubbabel, saying</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. Here the
angel bears witness to what I have shortly referred to that the power of God
alone is sufficient to preserve the Church, and there is no need of other helps.
For he sets the Spirit of God in opposition to all earthly aids; and thus he
proves that God borrows no help for the preservation of his Church, because he
abounds in all blessings to enrich it. Farther, by the word spirit we know is
meant his power, as though he had said, &#8220;God designs to ascribe to himself
alone the safety of his Church; and though the Church may need many things,
there is no reason why it should turn its eyes here and there, or seek this or
that help from men; for all abundance of blessings may be supplied by God
alone.&#8221; And
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>host</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>might</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm41</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> being a
part for the whole, are to be taken for all helps which are exclusive of
God&#8217;s grace. It is indeed certain that God acts not always immediately or
by himself, for he employs various means, and makes use in his service of the
ministrations of men; but his design is only to teach us that we are very
foolish, when we look around us here and there, or vacillate, or when, in a
word, various hopes, and various fears, and various anxieties affect us; for we
ought to be so dependent on God alone, as to be fully persuaded that his grace
is sufficient for us, though it may not appear; nay, we ought fully to confide
in God alone, though poverty and want may surround us on every side. This is the
purport of the whole.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But God intended also to show that his Church is
built up and preserved, not by human and common means, but by means
extraordinary and beyond all our hopes and all our thoughts. It is indeed true,
as I have just said, that God does not reject the labors of men in building up
and in defending his Church; but yet he seems as though he were not in earnest
when he acts by men; for by his own wonderful power he surpasses what can be
conceived by human thought. To be reminded of this was then exceedingly
necessary, when the Church of God was despised, and when the unbelieving
haughtily ridiculed the miserable Jews, whom they saw to be few in number and
destitute of all earthly aids. As then there was nothing splendid or worthy of
admiration among the Jews, it was needful that what we find here should have
been declared to them &#8212; even that his own power was enough for God, when
no aid came from any other quarter. The same also was the design of what we have
noticed respecting the seven pourers and the olive-trees; for if God had need of
earthly helps, servants must have been at hand to pour forth the oil; but there
were seven pourers to supply the oil continually. Wherefrom? even from the
olive-trees. As then the trees were fruitful, and God drew from them the oil by
his hidden power, that the lamps might never be dry, we hence clearly learn,
that what was exhibited is that which the angel now declares, namely, that the
Church was, without a host and without might, furnished with the gifts of the
Holy Spirit, and that in these there was a sufficient defense for its
preservation, in order that it might retain its perfect state and continue in
vigor and safety.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When therefore we now see things in a despairing
condition, let this vision come to our minds &#8212; that God is sufficiently
able by his own power to help us, when there is no aid from any other; for his
Spirit will be to us for lamps, for pourers, and for olive-trees, so that
experience will at length show that we have been preserved in a wonderful manner
by his hand alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand the design of the Prophet, and
the reason why this vision was shown to him &#8212; that the faithful might be
fully induced to entertain a firm hope as to that perfect condition of the
Church which had been promised; for no judgment was to be formed of it according
to earthly means or helps, inasmuch as God had his own power and had no need of
deriving any assistance from others. And Zechariah says also, that this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>word</i></font><font face="Palatino">
was to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zerubbabel</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
even that he might take courage and proceed with more alacrity in the work of
building the temple and the city. For Zerubbabel, we know, was the leader of the
people, and the Jews returned to their country under his guidance; and in the
work of building the city his opinion was regarded by all, as peculiar honor
belonged to him on account of his royal descent. At the same time God addressed
in his person the whole people: it was the same as though the angel had said,
&#8220;This word is to the Church.&#8221; The head is here mentioned for the
whole body, a part being specified for the whole.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now as Zerubbabel was only a type of Christ, we must
understand that this word is addressed to Christ and to all his
members.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus we must remember that all our confidence ought
to be placed on the favor of God alone; for were it to depend on human aids,
there would be nothing certain or sure. For God, as I have said, withdraws from
us whatever may add courage according to the judgment of the flesh, in order
that he may invite or rather draw us to himself. Whenever, then, earthly aids
fail us, let us learn to recumb on God alone,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for it is not by a host or by
might </i></font><font face="Palatino">that God raises up his Church, and
preserves it in its proper state; but this he does by his Spirit, that is, by
his own intrinsic and wonderful power, which he does not blend with human aids;
and his object is to draw us away from the world, and to hold us wholly
dependent on himself. This is the reason why he says that the word was addressed
to Zerubbabel. The rest I shall consider tomorrow.</font><br></div>

that we may not doubt but that thou alone art sufficient to supply us with all
those things which are necessary for the enjoyment of celestial life, that by
thus distilling on us frequently and continually thou mayest refresh us, so that
the light of faith, which has been once kindled in our hearts by thy grace, may
never be extinguished, until at length we shall attain to that fullness which
has been laid up for us in heaven: and may we thus now in part be satisfied with
the measure of knowledge which thou hast given us, until we shall at length see
thee face to face, that being thus transformed to thine image, we may enjoy the
fullness of that glory into which Christ our Lord has been received. &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">HERE the angel pursues the same subject which we have
been already explaining &#8212; that though the beginning was small and seemed
hardly of any consequence and importance, yet God would act in a wonderful
manner as to the building of the temple. But as this was not only arduous and
difficult, but also in various ways impeded, the angel now says, that there
would be no hindrance which God would not surmount or constrain to give way. He
compares to a mountain either the Persian monarchy or all the hosts of enemies,
which had then suddenly arisen in various parts, so that the Jews thought that
their return was without advantage, and that they were deceived, as the event
did not answer to their wishes and hopes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the design of the Holy Spirit:
as Satan attempted by various artifices to prevent the building of the temple,
the angel declares here that no obstacle would be so great as to hinder the
progress of the work, for God could suddenly reduce to a plain the highest
mountains. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What art thou, great
mountain? </i></font><font face="Palatino">The expression has more force than if
the angel had simply said, that all the attempts of enemies would avail nothing;
for he triumphs over the pride and presumption of those who then thought that
they were superior to the Jews: &#8220;Ye are,&#8221; he says, &#8220;like a
great mountain; your bulk is indeed terrible, and sufficient at the first view
not only to weaken, but also to break down the spirits; but ye are nothing in
all your altitude.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the text may be read in two ways, &#8220;What art
thou, great mountain? A plain before Zerubbabel;&#8221; or, &#8220;What art
thou, great mountain before Zerubbabel? A plain.&#8221; The latter rendering is
the best, and it is also what has been universally received. And he says that
this mountain was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before</i></font><font face="Palatino">
Zerubbabel, that is, in his presence, for it stood in opposition to
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this doctrine may be fitly applied to our age:
for we see how Satan raises up great forces, we see how the whole world
conspires against the Church, to prevent the increase or the progress of the
kingdom of Christ. When we consider how great are the difficulties which meet
us, we are ready to faint and to become wholly dejected. Let us then remember
that it is no new thing for enemies to surpass great mountains in elevation; but
that the Lord can at length reduce them to a plain. This, then, our shield can
cast down and lay prostrate whatever greatness the devil may set up to terrify
us: for as the Lord then reduced a great mountains to a plain, when Zerubbabel
was able to do nothing, so at this day, however boldly may multiplied
adversaries resist Christ in the work of building a spiritual temple to God the
Father, yet all their efforts will be in vain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will bring forth the stone of
its top</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The relative is of the feminine
gender, and must therefore be understood of the building. Zerubbabel shall then
bring forth the stone, which was to be on the top of the temple. By the stone of
the top, I understand the highest, which was to be placed on the very summit.
The foundations of the temple had been already laid; the building was mean and
almost contemptible: it could not however be advanced, since many enemies united
to disturb the work, or at least to delay it. Nevertheless the angel promises
what he afterwards explains more fully &#8212; that the temple would come to its
completion, for Zerubbabel was to bring forth and raise on high the stone of the
top, which was to be on the very summit of the temple. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm42</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And
then he subjoins, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shoutings,
Grace, grace, to it</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, God will grant a
happy success to this stone or to the temple. The relative here again is
feminine; it cannot then be applied to Zerubbabel, but to the temple or to the
stone: it is however more probable that the angel speaks of the temple. And he
says that there would be shoutings; for it was necessary to encourage the
confidence of the faithful and to excite them to prayer, that they might seek,
by constant entreaties, a happy and prosperous issue to the building of the
temple. The angel, then, bids all the godly with one voice to pray for the
temple; but as all prosperous events depend on the good pleasure of God, he uses
the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;j</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chen</i>, grace, which he repeats, that he might more fully encourage the
faithful to perseverance, and also that he might kindle their desire and
zeal.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see what this verse on the whole
contains: first, the angel shows that however impetuously the ungodly might rage
against the temple, yet their attempts would be frustrated, and that though they
thought themselves to be like great mountains, it was yet in the power and will
of God to reduce them to a plain, that is, suddenly to lay them prostrate. This
is one thing. Then secondly, he adds, that a happy success would attend the
building of the temple; for Zerubbabel would bring forth the top-stone, the
highest. And lastly, he subjoins, that the faithful ought unanimously to pray,
and so to persevere with the greatest ardor and zeal, that God might bless the
temple, and cause the building of it to be completed. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms in this passage what I lately stated
&#8212; That there was no reason for the faithful to entertain doubts or to feel
anxious, because they saw that the beginning of the building was mean and
despised by the world; for the Lord would at length show that it was built by
his sanction and command, and that it would succeed far better than all of them
had thought.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>word of Jehovah
</i></font><font face="Palatino">came to him; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm43</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and yet
at the end of the next verse he shows that this address came from the mouth of
the angel. But it is a well-known and a common mode of speaking, that God
himself is said to speak, when he employs either angels or men as his agents;
for the person of the messenger lessens in no degree the reverence due to the
word: the majesty, then, of God ought to remain inviolable in his word, whether
brought to us by men or by angels. Now the Prophet felt assured that nothing was
adduced by the angel, but what he conveyed as the minister of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum of the whole is, that the temple, though some
interruptions happened, was yet so begun that its completion was at length to be
expected; as God had made use of the labors of Zerubbabel, so he would not
forsake the work of his hands. Since, then, God was the chief founder of the
building, it could not be but that the temple would at length be
completed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is what the angel had in view in these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The hands of Zerubbabel have
founded this house</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Of the foundation there was
indeed no doubt; but many believed that the building would ever remain
unfinished, for Satan had already by means of the most powerful enemies impeded
its progress. As then despair had laid hold on the minds of almost all, the
angel declares that Zerubbabel would gain his object in finishing the temple
which he had begun.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt know that God has sent
me to you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Of this knowledge we have spoken
elsewhere. The meaning is, that the event would be a sure and suitable proof,
that nothing had been rashly undertaken by them, but that the temple was built
by God&#8217;s command, for his power would be evident in its completion. And he
addresses the Prophet, who though he was fully persuaded of the event and of the
fulfillment of this prophecy, yet learnt by what took place that the angel who
gave the promise was sent from above. We have said elsewhere that there are two
kinds of knowledge; one is of faith, which we derive from the word, though the
thing itself does not appear; the other is of experience, when God adds
accomplishment to the promise, and proves that he had not spoken in vain and
this is the knowledge which the angel means when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt know
</i></font><font face="Palatino">that I have been sent from above to
you.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now if this be applied to Christ, it may, as I have
said, be justly done; for it is certain that angels were then sent in such a
manner that Christ was the chief. Since, then, nothing was undertaken as to the
building of the temple without Christ being the leader, he rightly says here
that he was sent by the Father. It afterwards follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the angel reproves the sloth and fear of the
people, for the greater part were very faint-hearted; and he also blames the
Jews, because they formed a judgment of God&#8217;s work at the first view,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is
he</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that has despised the day of
paucities? </i></font><font face="Palatino">He does not ask who it was, as
though he spoke only of one, or as though they were few in number or
insignificant but he addresses the whole people, who were chargeable with
entertaining this wrong feeling; for all were cast down in their minds, because
they thought that the work begun would be a sport to the ungodly, and would come
to nothing, according to what we read in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;160312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Nehemiah
3:12, that the old men wept, so that nearly all threw down their tools, and left
off the building of the temple. We hence see that not a few despised the small
beginnings, and that the minds of all the people were dejected, for they thought
that they labored in vain while building the temple, which made no approach to
the glory and splendor of the former temple: &#8220;What are we doing here? we
seek to build a temple for God; but what is it? does it correspond to the temple
of Solomon? No, not in the tenth degree; yet God has promised that this temple
would be most glorious.&#8221; While then they were considering these things,
they thought either that the time was not come, or that they toiled in vain,
because God would not dwell in a tent so mean. This is the reason why the
Prophet now says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is he that
has despised the day of paucities?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm44</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God then sets himself in opposition to an ungrateful
and ill- disposed people, and shows that they all acted very foolishly, because
they cast and fixed their eyes only on the beginning of things, as though God
would not surpass by his power what human minds could conceive. As then God
purposed in a wonderful manner to build the temple, the angel reproves here the
clamors of the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall rejoice when they
shall see the workman&#8217;s plummet in the hard of
Zerubbabel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm45</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Though
he had adopted a severe and sharp reproof, he yet mitigates here its severity,
and promises to the Jews that however unworthy they were of such kindness from
God, they would yet see what they had by no means expected, even Zerubbabel
furnished with everything necessary for the completion of the temple. Hence
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall see Zerubbabel with
his tin-stone</i></font><font face="Palatino">; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm46</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
is, with his plummet. As builders in our day use a plumb-line, so he calls that
in the hand of Zerubbabel a tin-stone, which he had when prepared to complete
the temple.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This doctrine may be also applied to us: for God, to
exhibit the more his power, begins with small things in building his spiritual
temple; nothing grand is seen, which attracts the eyes and thoughts of men, but
everything is almost contemptible. God indeed could put forth immediately his
power, and thus rouse the attention of all men and fill them with wonder; he
could indeed do so; but as I have already said, his purpose is to increase, by
doing wonders, the brightness of his power; which he does, when from a small
beginning he brings forth what no one would have thought; and besides, his
purpose is to prove the faith of his people; for it behaves us ever to hope
beyond hope. Now when the beginning promises something great and sublime, there
is no proof and no trial of faith: but when we hope for what does not appear, we
give due honor to God, for we depend only on his power and not on the proximate
means. Thus we see that Christ is compared to a shoot, which arises from the
stem of Jesse.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;231101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
11:1.) God might have arranged that Christ should have been born when the house
of David was in its splendor, and when the kingdom was in a flourishing state:
yet his will was that he should come forth from the stem of Jesse, when the
royal name was almost cut off. Again, he might have brought forth Christ as a
full-grown tree; but he was born as an insignificant shoot. So also he is
compared by Daniel to a rough and unpolished stone cut off from a mountain.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;270245&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
2:45.) The same thing has also been accomplished in our age, and continues still
at this day to be accomplished. If we consider what is and has been the
beginning of the growing gospel, we shall find nothing illustrious according to
the perceptions of the flesh; and on this account the adversaries confidently
despise us; they regard us as the off-scourings of men, and hope to be able to
cast us down and scatter us by a single breath.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are many at this day who despise the day of
paucity, who grow faint in their minds, or even deride our efforts, as though
our labor were ridiculous, when they see us sedulously engaged in promoting the
truth of the gospel; and we ourselves are also touched with this feeling: there
is no one who becomes not sometimes frigid, when he sees the beginning of the
Church so mean before the world, and so destitute of any dignity. We hence learn
how useful it is for us at this day to be reminded, that we shall at length see
what we can by no means conjecture or hope for according to present appearances;
for though the Lord begins with little things, and as it were in weakness, yet
the plummet will at length be seen in the hand of the Architect for the purpose
of completing the work. There is at this day no Zerubbabel in the world, to whom
the office of building the temple has been committed; but we know that Christ is
the chief builder, and that ministers are workmen who labor under him. However
then may Satan blind the unbelieving with pride and haughtiness, so that they
disdain and ridicule the building in which we labor; yet the Lord himself will
show that he is the chief builder, and will give to Christ the power to complete
the work.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These seven are the eyes of
Jehovah, going round through the whole earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
The angel calls the attention of Zechariah to what we have before observed; for
the discourse was respecting the plummet, and Zechariah said, that there were
shown to him seven eyes in that stone. The angel explains what those seven eyes
meant, even that the Lord by his providence would conduct the work to its
completion. But we have said that seven eyes are attributed to God, that we may
be assured that nothing is hid from him; for no one among men or angels
possesses so great a clear-sightedness but that he is ignorant of some things.
Many of Gods mysteries, we allow, are hid from angels; but when they are sent
forth, they receive as much revelation as their office requires. But the angel
shows here, that we ought by no means to fear that anything will happen which
God has not foreseen; for the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seven
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>go around through the whole
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">: not that God has need of seven eyes; but
we know what the number seven means in Scripture; it signifies perfection. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm47</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning then is &#8212; that God would
sufficiently provide that nothing should happen that might disturb him, or turn
him aside, or delay him in the execution of his work. How so? because there were
seven eyes; that is, he by his providence would surmount all difficulties, and
his eyes went round through the whole earth, so that the devil could devise
nothing behind or before, on the right hand or on the left, above or below,
which he could not easily frustrate. We now then perceive the object of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the words, some render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hla</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ale</i>, in the neuter gender, &#8220;These are seven, they are the eyes of
God.&#8221; But as to the sense, there is no ambiguity: for the angel would have
the faithful to recumb on God&#8217;s providence, in order that they might be
secure and fear no danger; as the Lord would remove whatever was contrary to his
purpose. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The same vision is again related, at least one
similar to that which we have just explained; only there is given a fuller
explanation, for the Prophet says that he asked the angel what was meant by the
two olive-trees which stood, one on the right, the other on the left side of the
candlestick, and also by the two pipes of the olive-trees. Some render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ylb&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shebelim</i>,ears of corn, thinking that the branches of the olive-trees are
compared to ears of corn, because they were full and loaded with berries; but
the metaphor seems to me immaterial. The word in Hebrew is indeed ambiguous; but
it often means a pipe, or a running or flowing; and this sense best suits this
passage; and I wonder that this meaning has been overlooked by all interpreters;
for no doubt necessity constrained them to retake themselves to this metaphor,
however unnatural it was. But we know that this spectacle was presented to
Zechariah in order to show that the olive-tree continually supplied abundance of
oil, lest the wick should become dry, and lest the lamps should thus fail. Since
then on every side there were pourers or pipes, and three tubes received the oil
from one olive-tree, and four received it from the other, so that great
abundance thus flowed from the two olive-trees, and since there were also seven
pipes, we see how suitable it was that they should be between the olive-trees on
the right and on the left, and also that their tubes for the oil should be
between the pourers and the two pipes. As then the oil ran through the pourers
and passed through the two pipes, he asks the angel what these flowing meant?
The answer was, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These are the two
sons of oil, who stand before the Lord of all the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, they are the two fountains
which supply oil from God himself, lest the lamps should fail through the want
of it.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm48</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This is the import of the whole.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have said that there is some difference in the
visions though the angel relates hardly anything new, except respecting the
flowing and the tubes; but as a new explanation is given, Zechariah no doubt
more fully considered what he had slightly looked on before. The more attentive
then to the vision the Prophet became, the more confirmed he was; for God showed
to him now what he had not sufficiently observed before, namely, that there were
pipes or tubes through which the oil flowed into each of the pourers, and
further, that these flowing or a continual running of the oil, was like that of
a river, which runs through its own channel. But God intended to instruct his
Prophet by degrees, that we may learn at this day to apply our thoughts to the
understanding of his doctrine; for the instruction to be derived from it is not
of an ordinary kind, as I have already reminded you. Indeed the state of things
in our time is nearly the same with that of his time: for Christ now renews by
the power of his Spirit that spiritual temple which had been pulled down and
wholly demolished; for what has been the dignity of the Church for many ages?
Doubtless, it has been for a long time in a dilapidated state; and now when God
begins to give some hope of a new building, Satan collects together many forces
from all parts to prevent the progress of the work. We are also tender and soft,
and even faint-hearted, so that hardly one in a hundred labors so courageously
as he ought.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence then learn how necessary for us is this
doctrine: it was not, therefore, to no purpose that the Prophet did not
apprehend at once and in an instant what was presented to him in the vision, but
made progress by degrees.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have also mentioned before, that the desire of
improvement observed in Zechariah ought to be noticed. For though we attain not
immediately what God teaches, yet the obscurity of a passage ought not to damp
our ardor; but we ought rather to imitate the Prophet, who, in things difficult
and unknown to him, asked explanations from the angel. Angels are not indeed
sent now to us from heaven to answer our questions; but yet no one shall be
without benefit who will humbly and with a sincere desire ask of God; for God
will either by his ministers so elucidate what seems obscure to us and full of
darkness, that we shall know that there is nothing but what is clear in his
word; or he will by the Spirit of knowledge and judgment supply what is
deficient in the ministrations of men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this is also the reason why the angel replies,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Dost thou not know what these
mean?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> For he does not upbraid Zechariah with
ignorance, but rather reminds all the faithful, that they ought to quicken
themselves, and to exert all their ardor to learn, lest sloth should close up
the way against them. This reply, then, of the angel no doubt belongs to us all,
&#8220;Dost thou not know what these mean?&#8221; We ought to remember that the
things we esteem as common far exceed our thoughts. It indeed often happens that
one runs over many parts of Scripture, and thinks that he reads nothing but what
is clear and well known, while yet experience teaches us that we are inflated
with too much self-confidence; for we look down, as it were from on high, on
that doctrine which ought, on the contrary, to be reverently adored by us. Then
let every one of us, being warned by this sentence of the angel, acknowledge
that he as yet cleaves to first principles, or, at least, does not comprehend
all those things which are necessary to be known; and that therefore progress is
to be made to the very end of life: for this is our wisdom, to be learners to
the end.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I come now to the answers of the angel,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These are the two sons of
oil</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some understand by the two sons of oil a
king and a priest; but this is by no means suitable. There is no doubt but that
he calls the perpetual flowing the two sons of oil; as though he had said, that
it could not possibly be that the grace of God should ever fail to preserve the
Church, as God possesses all abundance, and bids his grace so to flow, as that
its abundance should never be diminished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore says, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stand with the Lord of the whole
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">: for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ol</i>, sometimes means with, and sometimes concerning; but I prefer taking
its simple meaning; therefore, stand do the sons of oil <i>with</i> the Lord.
Some render, &#8220;nigh the Lord,&#8221; but improperly; for they pervert the
Prophet&#8217;s meaning, inasmuch as the angel means that these two sons of oil
stood with God, as though he had said, that there is such fullness of grace in
God, that it could never be exhausted. Though then the oil flowed, it would yet
be sufficient to replenish the seven lamps, that is, fully; so that God would
raise up his Church, preserve it safe, and lead it to the highest perfection.
Hence God is not so poor but that he can continually supply as much grace as
will be sufficient for the preservation of his Church. How so? because there are
two sons of oil, that is, two continual flowing from him, so that the faithful
shall really find, that when they are enriched by the gifts of God, they are in
no danger of being in want. This is the meaning.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that since Satan at
this day sets against us many terrors to cast us down, and we are very weak,
&#8212; O grant, that with our eyes lifted above we may meditate on that
invincible power which thou possesses, and by which thou canst overcome all the
hindrances of this world: and then, when nothing in this world but what is
contemptible appears to us as capable to confirm and support our faith, may we,
by the eye of faith, behold thine hidden power, and never doubt but that thou
wilt at length perform what the world at this day thinks to be impossible and
therefore ridicules; and may we so constantly persevere in this confidence, that
every one of us may devote to thee his labor to the end, and never faint in the
work of promoting the spiritual building, until at length we ourselves shall be
gathered, and others shall be gathered through our labors, to offer to thee not
only spiritual sacrifices, such as thou receives now from us, but also to offer
to thee, together with the angels, eternal sacrifice of praise and triumphant
thanksgiving, on seeing perfected what at this day is only weakly begun. &#8212;
Amen.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">THE angel shows in this chapter, that whatever evils
the Jews had suffered, proceeded from the righteous judgment Of God; and then he
adds a consolation &#8212; that the Lord would at length alleviate or put an end
to their evils, when he had removed afar off their iniquity. Interpreters have
touched neither heaven nor earth in their explanation of this prophecy, for they
have not regarded the design of the Holy Spirit. Some think that by the volume
are to be understood false and perverted glosses, by which the purity of
doctrine had been vitiated; but this view can by no means be received. There is
no doubt but that God intended to show to Zechariah, that the Jews were justly
punished, because the whole land was full of thefts and perjuries. As then
religion had been despised, as well as equity and justice, he shows that it was
no wonder that a curse had prevailed through the whole land, the Jews leaving by
their impiety and other sins extremely provoked the wrath of God. This is the
import of the first part. And, then, as this vision was terrible, there is added
some alleviation by representing iniquity in a measure, and the mouth of the
measure closed, and afterwards carried to the land of Shinar, that is, into
Chaldea, that it might not remain in Judea. Thus in the former part the
Prophet&#8217;s design was to humble the Jews, and to encourage them to repent,
so that they might own God to have been justly angry; and then he gives them
reason to entertain hope, and fully to expect an end to their evils, for the
Lord would remove to a distance and transfer their iniquity to Chaldea, so that
Judea might be pure and free from every wickedness, both from thefts and acts of
injustice, by which it had been previously polluted. But every sentence must be
in order explained, that the meaning of the Prophet may be more clearly
seen.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, that he had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>returned</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm49</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and by
this word this vision is separated front the preceding visions, and those also
of which we have hitherto spoken, were not at the same time exhibited to the
Prophet, but he saw them at different times. We may hence learn that some time
intervened before the Lord presented to him the vision narrated in this chapter.
He adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he raised up his
eyes and looked</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and this is said that we may
know that what he narrates was shown to him by the prophetic Spirit. Zechariah
very often raised up his eyes though God did not immediately appear to him; but
it behaved God&#8217;s servants, whenever they girded themselves for the purpose
of teaching, to withdraw themselves as it were from the society of men, and to
rise up above the world. The raising up of the eyes then, mentioned by
Zechariah, signified something special, as though he had said, that he was
prepared, for the Lord had inwardly roused him. The Prophets also, no doubt,
were in this manner by degrees prepared, when the Lord made himself known to
them. There was then the raising up of the eyes as a preparation to receive the
celestial oracle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds, that he was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>asked by the angel what he
saw</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He might indeed have said, that a roll
flying in the air appeared to him, but he did not as yet understand what it
meant; hence the angel performed the office of an interpreter. But he says, that
the roll was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>twenty cubits long,
and ten broad</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Rabbis think that the figure
of the court of the temple is here represented, for the length of the court was
twenty cubits and its breadth was ten; and hence they suppose, that the roll had
come forth from the temple, that there might be fuller reason to believe that
God had sent forth the roll. And this allusion, though not sufficiently
grounded, is yet more probable than the allegory of the puerile Jerome, who
thinks that this ought to be applied to Christ, because he began to preach the
gospel in his thirtieth year. Thus he meant to apply this number to the age of
Christ, when he commenced his office as a teacher. But this is extreme trifling.
I do not feel anxious to know why the length or the breadth is mentioned; for it
seems not to be much connected with the main subject. But if it be proper to
follow a probable conjecture, what I have already referred to is more admissible
&#8212; that the length and breadth of the roll are stated, that the Jews might
fully understand that nothing was set before them but what God himself
sanctioned, as they clearly perceived a figure of the court of the
temple.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The angel then says, that it was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the curse
</i></font><font face="Palatino">which
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>went
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm50</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
over the face of the whole land</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We must
remember what I have just said, that God&#8217;s judgment is here set forth
before the Jews, that they might know how justly both their fathers and
themselves have been with so much severity chastised by God, inasmuch as they
had procured for themselves such punishments by their sins. From the saying of
the angel, that the roll went
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>through the whole
land</i></font><font face="Palatino">, we learn, that not only a few were
guilty, or that some corner of the land only had been polluted, but that the
wrath of God raged everywhere, as no part of the land was pure or free from
wickedness. As then Judea was full of pollutions, it was no wonder that the Lord
poured forth his wrath and overwhelmed, as it were with a deluge, the whole
land.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It afterwards follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for every
thief</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>every one that steals, shall on
this as on that side, be punished</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or receive
his own reward; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and every one who
swears, shall on this as on that side be
punished</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As to the words, interpreters differ
with regard to the particles,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwmk
hzm</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>mese camue</i>; some take the meaning to
be, &#8220;by this roll, as it is written;&#8221; others, &#8220;on this side of
the roll, as on the other;&#8221; for they think that the roll was written on
both sides, and that God denounced punishment on thieves as well as on
perjurers. But I rather apply the words to the land, and doubt not but that this
is the real meaning of the Prophet. As then there is no respect of persons with
God, the Prophet, after having spoken of the whole land, says, that no one who
had sinned could anywhere escape unpunished, for God would from one part to the
other summon all to judgment without any exception. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm51</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Prophet says, that all perjurers, as well as
thieves, shall be punished; and there is nothing strange in this, for God, who
has forbidden to steal, has also forbidden to forswear. He is therefore the
punisher of all transgressions. Those who think that this roll was disapproved,
as though it contained false and degenerate doctrine, bring this reason to prove
its injustice, that the thief is as grievously punished as the perjurer: but
this is extremely frivolous. For, as I have said already, God shows here that he
will be the defender of his law in whatever respect men may have transgressed
it. We must therefore remember that saying of James,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;he who forbids to commit
adultery, forbids also to steal: whosoever then offends in one thing is a
transgressor of the whole law:&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;590211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">James
2:11)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">for we ought not simply to regard what God either
commands or forbids, but we ought ever to fix our eyes on his majesty, as there
is nothing so minute in the law which all ought not reverently to receive; for
the laws themselves are not only to be regarded, but especially the lawgiver. As
then the majesty of God is dishonored, when any one steals, and when any one
transgresses in the least point, he clearly shows that the word of God is not
much regarded by him. It is hence right that thieves and perjurers should be
alike punished: yet the Scripture while it thus speaks, does not teach that sins
are equal in enormity, as the Stoics in former times foolishly and falsely
taught. But the equality of punishment is not what is here referred to; the
angel means only, that neither thieves nor perjurers shall go unpunished, as
they have transgressed the law of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must also observe, that the mode of speaking
adopted here is that of stating a part for the whole; for under the word theft
is comprehended whatever is opposed to the duties of love; so that it is to be
referred to the second table at the law. And the Prophet calls all those
perjurers who profane the worship of God; and so perjury includes whatever is
contrary to the first table of the law, and tends to pollute the service due to
God. The meaning is, &#8212; that God, as I have said, will be the punisher of
all kinds of wickedness, for he has not in vain given his law. Much deceived
then are those who flatter themselves, as though by evasions they can elude the
judgment of God, for both thieves and perjurers shall be brought before
God&#8217;s tribunal, so that no one can escape, that is, no wickedness shall
remain unpunished; for not in vain has he once declared by his own mouth, that
cursed are all who fulfill not whatever has been written.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;052726&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
27:26.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the same thing the Prophet more clearly expresses
in the following verse, where God himself declares what he would do, that he
would cause </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the curse to go forth
over the whole land</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as though he had said,
&#8220;I will really show, that I have not given the law that it may be
despised; for what the law teaches shall be so efficacious, that every one who
violates it shall find that he has to do, not with a mortal man, nor with sounds
of words, but with the heavenly judge;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will bring forth the curse over
the whole land</i></font><font face="Palatino">.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have said, that the Prophet was instructed in the
import of this vision, that all the Jews might know that it was nothing strange
that they had been so severely chastised, inasmuch as they had polluted the
whole land by their sins, so that no part of the law was observed by them; for
on the one hand they had corrupted the worship of God and departed from true
religion; and on the other, they distressed one another by many wrongs, and
oppressed them by frauds. As then no equity prevailed among the people, nor any
true religion, God shows that he would punish them all, as none were
guiltless.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It shall come into the house of
the thief, and into the house of him who swears in my name falsely; and there
will it reside, and it shall consume the hoarse, both the wood and the
stones</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here the Prophet further stimulates the
Jews to repentance, by showing that the curse would so fly as to enter into all
their houses; as though he had said, &#8220;In vain shall they, who deserve
punishment, fortify or shut up themselves; for this curse, which I send forth,
shall come to each individual, and with him it shall remain.&#8221; We know that
hypocrites so flatter themselves, as though they could escape for the moment
while God is angry and displeased; but the Prophet shows here that vain is such
a hope, for the curse would overtake all the ungodly, and wholly overthrow them;
yea, it would consume their houses, both the wood and the stones. In short, he
intimates, that punishment ends not until men are reconciled to God. And by
these words he reminds us how terrible it is to fall into the hands of God, for
he will punish the ungodly and the wicked until he reduces them to nothing. We
now then comprehend the design of the Prophet and the meaning of the words. It
now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here I stop; I intended to add all the verses, but I
can hardly finish the whole today. It will be enough for us to understand that
this is the second part of the vision, in which the Prophet, in order to relieve
or in some measure to mitigate the sorrow of the Jews, shows, that God would not
treat them with extreme rigor, so as to punish them as they deserved, but would
chastise them with paternal moderation. Hence he says, that a measure appeared
to him and a woman in the measure. The woman was wickedness; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm52</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> there
was also a covering of lead, a wide or an extended piece. The plate of lead was
borne upwards when the woman was seen in the measure. He then says, that the
measure was closed up, and that there impiety was kept hid as a captive in
prison. He afterwards adds, that it was driven away into the land of Shinar,
very far from Judea, and that wickedness was thus turned over to the enemies of
the chosen people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see that God, as I have already noticed, gives
here a token of favor; for he says that wickedness was shut up in a measure.
Though then he had spoken hitherto severely, that he might shake the Jews with
dread, it was yet his purpose soon to add some alleviation: for it was enough
that they were proved guilty of their sins, that they might humble themselves
and suppliantly flee to God&#8217;s mercy, and also that repentance might really
touch them, lest they should murmur, as we know they had done, but submit
themselves to God and confess that they had suffered justly. Since then the
angel had already shown that the curse had deservedly gone over the face of the
whole land, because no corner was free from wickedness, the angel now adds, that
he came to show a new vision,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Raise</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>now thine eyes, and see
what this is which goes forth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet was
no doubt cast down with fear, so that he hardly dared to look any longer. As
then the curse was flying and passing freely here and there, the Prophet was
struck with horror, and not without reason, since he beheld the wrath of God
spreading everywhere indiscriminately. This is the reason why the angel now
animates him and bids him to see what was going forth. And he tells what was
exhibited to him, for he saw a measure; which in Hebrew is
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hpya</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aiphe</i>: 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm53</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
some render it measure or bushel; others, firkin or cask; but in this there is
no difference. When the Prophet saw this measure, he asked the angel what it
was: for the vision would have been useless, had he not been informed what the
measure and the woman sitting in it signified, and also the lead covering. He
therefore asked what they were.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then the angel answered,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is the measure that goes
forth, and this is their eye in all the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
By saying that the measure is their eye, he no doubt means that the ungodly
could not thus be carried away at their own pleasure, but that God restrained
them whenever it seemed good to him; for they could not escape his sight. For by
their eyes he understands passively the power of seeing in God, by which he
notices all the sins of the ungodly, that he may check them when he pleases,
when they hurry on without restraint. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm54</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But that the meaning of the Prophet may be made more
clear, let us first see what wickedness means, &#8212; whether it is to be taken
for those sins which provoked God&#8217;s wrath against the Jews, &#8212; or
whether for those wrongs which heathen enemies had done. The last is the view I
prefer, though if we take it for the wickedness which had previously reigned in
Judea, the meaning would not be unsuitable. For as wickedness is hateful to God,
his vengeance against the Jews could not have ceased except by cleansing them
from their sins, and by renewing them by his Spirit. For they had carried on war
with him in such a way, that there was no means of pacifying him but by
departing from their sins. And whenever God reconciles himself to melt, he at
the same time renews them by his Spirit; he not only blots out their sins, as to
the guilt, but also regenerates those who were before devoted to sin and the
devil, so that he may treat them kindly and paternally.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard then to the subject in hand, both views
may be suitably adopted. We may consider the meaning to be, &#8212; that God
would take away iniquity from Judea by cleansing his Church from all
defilements, since the Jews could not partake of his blessing except iniquity
were driven afar off and banished. As God then designed to be propitious to his
people, he justly says, that he would cause wickedness to disappear from the
midst of them. Yet the other view, as I have said, is more agreeable to the
context, &#8212; that wickedness would not be allowed freely to prevail as
before; for we know that loose reins had been given to the cruelty of their
enemies, inasmuch as the Jews had been exposed to the wrongs of all. As then
they had been so immoderately oppressed, God promises that all unjust violence
should be driven afar off and made to depart into the land of Shinar, that is,
that the Lord would in turn chastise the Babylonians and reward them as they had
deserved. The import of the whole is, that God, who had chosen the seed of
Abraham, would be propitious to the Jews, so as to put an slid at length to
their calamities.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Prophet says that wickedness, when first
seen, was in mid air, and in a measure; but at the same time he calls the
measure the eye of the ungodly, for though wickedness extends itself to all
parts, yet God confines it within a hidden measure; and this he designates by
eyes, whereby he seems to allude to a former prophecy, which we have explained.
For he had said that there were seven eyes in the stone of the high priest,
because God would carry on by his providence the building of the temple. So also
he says, that God&#8217;s eyes are upon all the ungodly, according to what is
said in the book of Psalms &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The eyes of the
Lord are over the wicked, to destroy their memory from the earth.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;193417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
34:17.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this mode of speaking often occurs in Scripture.
The meaning then is, that though wickedness spreads and extends through the
whole earth, it is yet in a measure; but this measure is not always closed up.
However this may be, still God knows how to regulate all things, so that impiety
shall not exceed its limits. And this is most true, whatever view may be taken;
for when enemies harass the church, though they may be carried along in the air,
that is, though God may not immediately restrain their wrongs, they yet sit in a
measure, and are ruled by the eyes of God, so that they cannot move a finger,
except so far as they are permitted. Let us in a word know, that in a state of
things wholly disordered, God watches, and his eyes are vigilant, in order to
put an end to injuries. The same also may be said when God gives up to a
reprobate mind those who deserve such a punishment; for though he cast them
away, and Satan takes possession of them, yet this remains true &#8212; that
they sit in a measure. They are not indeed shut in; but we ought not, as I have
said, to suppose that God is indifferent in heaven, or that sins prevail in the
world, as though he did not see them; for his connivance is not blindness. The
eyes of God then mark and observe whatever sins are done in the
world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the angel adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a thin piece of lead was cast
over the mouth of the measure, and that wickedness was cast into the
measure</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The expression, that wickedness was
thrown into the measure, may be explained in two ways &#8212; either that God
would not permit so much liberty to the devil to lead the Jews to sin as before;
for how comes it that men abandon themselves to every evil, except that God
forsakes them, and at the same time delivers them up to Satan, that he may
exercise his tyranny over them? or, that a bridle would be used to restrain
foreign enemies, that they might not in their wantonness oppress the miserable
people, and exercise extreme violence. God, then, intending to deliver them from
their sins, or to check wrongs, shuts up wickedness, as it were, in a measure;
and then he adds a cover; and it is said to have been a thin piece, or a weight
of lead, because it was heavy; as though the Prophet had said, that whenever it
pleased God iniquity would be taken captive, so that it could not go forth from
its confinement or its prison. It afterwards follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet says here that such would be the change
of things, that God would in turn afflict the Chaldeans, who had so cruelly
treated the chosen people. And this is the reason why I think that iniquity is
to be taken for the violent injustice and plunder which heathen enemies had
exercised towards the Jews. For when he says that a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>house</i></font><font face="Palatino">
would be for </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>iniquity in the land
of Shinar</i></font><font face="Palatino">, it is as though he had said,
&#8220;as Judea has been for a long time plundered by enemies, and has been
exposed to their outrages, so the Chaldeans in their turn shall be punished, not
once, nor for a short time, but perpetually; for God will fix a habitation for
wickedness in their land.&#8221; We hence see the design of the vision, that is,
that when God had mercy on his Church its enemies would have to render an
account, and that they would not escape God&#8217;s hand, though he had employed
them to chastise his people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says then, that wickedness was taken away, that a
house might be made for it, that is, that it might have a fixed and permanent
dwelling in the land of Shinar, which means among the Chaldeans, who had been
inveterate enemies to the Jews; and as Babylon was the metropolis of that
empire, he includes under it all the ungodly who opposed or persecuted the
children of God. Why God represents the measure as carried away by women rather
than by men does not appear to me, except it was that the Jews might know that
there was no need of any warlike preparations, but that their strongest enemies
could be laid prostrate by weak and feeble instruments; and thus under the form
of weakness his own power would be made evident. The Prophet saw women with
wings, because sudden would be the change, so that in one day, as we shall
presently see, wickedness was taken away. By the wings of a <i>stork</i> either
celerity or strength is indicated. This is the sum of the whole.

<div><font face="Palatino">HERE we have another vision; and the Prophet
distinguishes it from the former visions by saying, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>turned</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
as though he had said, that there had been some intervening time. They were not
then continued visions, but he turned himself elsewhere, and then he raised up
his eyes, and the Lord revealed to him what he now relates. But as the vision is
obscure, interpreters have given it different meanings. They who think that the
four Gospels are designated by the four chariots, give a very frigid view. I
have elsewhere reminded you, that we are to avoid these futile refinements which
of themselves vanish away. Allegories, I know, delight many; but we ought
reverently and soberly to interpret the prophetic writings, and not to fly in
the clouds, but ever to fix our foot on solid ground. Others think that those
changes are meant which we know happened in Chaldea and Assyria. As Nineveh was
overthrown that Babylon might be the seat of the empire, they suppose that this
is meant by the first chariot, the horses of which were red. Then they think
that the Persian empire is intended by the second chariot, as the Jews had at
the beginning suffered many grievous evils. Afterwards by the white horses are
signified, as they suppose, the Macedonian power, as Alexander treated the Jews
with humanity and kindness. By the fourth chariot they understand the Roman
Empire, and think that the horses are of different colors, because some of the
Caesars raged cruelly against the Jews and the Church of God, and some of them
showed more lenity. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm56</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But I
know not whether these things are well founded.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see that the fourth chariot went to the south, and
wandered through various regions, and almost through the whole world. As then
this cannot be applied to Chaldea, the simpler view seems to be &#8212; that the
four chariots signify the various changes which happened not only in Chaldea and
among the Babylonians, but also in Judea and among other nations: and this may
be easily gathered from the context. But as all these things cannot be stated at
the same time, we shall treat them in the order in which the Prophet relates
them. I shall now repeat what I have elsewhere said respecting the words, that
he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>raised up his
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as intimating the divine authority of
what is predicted. The words indeed signify that he did not bring forward what
he had vainly imagined, nor adduce tales which he had himself fabricated, but he
was attentive to what was revealed to him; and also that he was somewhat
separated from common life in order to be an interpreter between God and men.
Hence authority is here ascribed to the prophecy, as Zechariah did not come
forth to speak of uncertain things, but as one sent by heaven, for he delivered
nothing but what he had received from above.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>four</i></font><font face="Palatino">
chariots appeared to him, which came forth from
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mountains</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
and that the two mountains where the chariots were seen were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mountains of
brass</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet no doubt understood by these
mountains the providence of God, or his hidden counsel, by which all things have
been decreed before the creation of the world; and hence he says, that they were
mountains of brass, as they could not be broken. The poets say, that fate is
unavoidable (<i>ineluctable</i>); but as this sentiment is profane, it is enough
for us to understand it of God&#8217;s eternal providence, which is immutable.
And here is most fitly described to us the counsel of God; for before things
break forth into action they are inclosed as it were between the narrow passes
of mountains, inasmuch as what God has decreed is not apparent, but lies hid as
it were in deep mountains. Hence we then begin to acknowledge the counsel of God
when experience teaches us, that what was previously hid from us has been in
this or in that manner decreed. But it was not in vain that Zechariah adds, that
they were mountains of brass; it was to teach us that God&#8217;s counsel is not
changeable as foolish men imagine, who think that God is doubtful as to the
issue, and is, as it were, kept in suspense: for according to their notions,
events depend on the free-will of men. They entertain the idea that God
foreknows what is to come conditionally: as this or that will not be, except it
shall please men. And though they confess not that God is changeable, yet we
gather from their dotages that there is in God nothing sure and certain. The
Prophet therefore says here, that they were mountains of brass, because God has
fixed before all ages what he has purposed to be done, and thus fixed it by an
immutable decree, which cannot be broken by Satan, nor by the whole
world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see how suitable is this representation when
the Prophet says, that chariots went forth from mountains.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the chariots, we have seen elsewhere
that angels are compared to horsemen; for these ride swiftly as it were through
the whole world to execute what God commands them: so also whatever changes take
place, they are called the chariots of God; for either angels are ready at hand
to do anything in obedience to God, or the very events themselves are
God&#8217;s chariots, that is, they are as it were swift heralds, who announce
to us what was before unknown. Let us then know that all fortuitous events, as
they are called by the unbelieving, are God&#8217;s chariots, are his
messengers, who declare and proclaim what was before concealed from us. And
there is not in this similitude or metaphor anything strained.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the color of the horses, interpreters, as I
have already intimated, have toiled with great anxiety; and though I venture not
to assert anything as certain, yet the probable conjecture is, that by the black
and white horses are designated the Babylonians rather than the Persians, but
for a purpose different from what interpreters have thought. For the reference
must be to the Jews, when it is said, that black horses and then white horses
went forth towards Babylon; for the Holy Spirit intimates, that liberty was
given to the Chaldeans to harass the Jews and to fill all places with darkness.
The blackness then of which the Prophet speaks signifies the calamities brought
on the Jews. The whole of that time was dark, full of grief and sorrow, during
which the Chaldeans possessed the oriental empire, and Babylon was the supreme
seat of government or of the monarchy. A very different time afterwards
succeeded, when the Babylonians were conquered and the Persian enjoyed the
oriental empire. The color then was white, for the favor of God shone anew on
the Jews, and liberty was immediately given then to return to their own country.
We hence see that the Prophet rightly subjoins, that the color of the horses was
white; for such was the favor shown to the Jews by the Persian, that the sun of
joy arose on them, which exhilarated their hearts. But the Prophet makes no
mention of the first chariot as going forth, and for this reason, as
interpreters think, because the empire of Babylon was shell overthrown. But they
are mistaken in this, as I have already hinted, because they refer not the
colors to the state of God&#8217;s Church. Hence the Prophet, I doubt not,
designedly omits the mention of the going forth of the first chariot, because
the Jews had experienced the riding of God&#8217;s judgment in their own land,
for they had been severely afflicted. As God then is wont to execute his
judgment first on his own household, and as it is written, &#8220;judgment
begins at his own house,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 4:17,) so he purposed to observe the same order in this case, that is, to
chastise the sins of the chosen people before he passed over to the Chaldeans
and other nations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the last chariot, the Prophet says, that it
went forth </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>toward the
south</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and then it went elsewhere, and even
through the whole world, for God had so permitted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now as to the meaning of this Prophecy nothing will
remain obscure, if we hold these elements of truth &#8212; that all events are
designated by the chariots, or all the revolutions which take place in the world
&#8212; and that the blind power of fortune does not rule, as fools imagine, but
that God thus openly makes known to us his own counsel. And why the horses are
said to have been, some red, some black, some white, and some somewhat red, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm57</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the
plain answer is this &#8212; because God had sent forth his chariots over Judea,
which was full of blood: by this then is meant the red color. But he shows also,
that their enemies would have their time, and this had been in part fulfilled;
for God had ridden over them with his chariots, having driven his wheels over
their land when Nineveh was overthrown. And though the Spirit had not simply a
reference to the Assyrians or the Chaldeans, as though he meant by the black
color to designate the wars carried on among then, but rather the calamities
brought by them on the Jews, yet I consider the black color to mean in general
the terrible disturbances which took place through the whole of the least; and
the Jews could not expect anything agreeable from that quarter, for shortly
after a heavier weight fell on their heads. But in the third place the Prophet
adds, that there were white horses, that is, when the time was accomplished in
which God intended to deliver his Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says, that the chariots not only went forth to
the East, or to Babylon; but he says, that they also ran through the south, and
then visited the whole world. That we may more fully understand this, we must
regard the design of the Prophet. He meant here, no doubt, to bring some comfort
to the Jews, that they might not succumb under their evils, however sharply God
might chastise them. And Zechariah sets before them here two things &#8212;
first, that no part of the earth, or no country, would be exempt from
God&#8217;s judgments, for his chariots would pass through all lands; and
secondly, that though the chariots of God, terrible in their appearance on
account of the black and red color, had visited Judea as well as the north, yet
the time had already come in which God, having been pacified, would change the
state of things; and therefore, in the third place, he sets before them another
color; for God&#8217;s chariot had been sent forth through Judea, and then
God&#8217;s vengeance had visited Nineveh, and afterwards Babylon: only this had
rested, because it had been already in part fulfilled, for God had removed the
darkness and brought sunshine to the Jews, and that from Chaldea, inasmuch as
the Persian, who then possessed the empire, had begun to treat the Jews with
kindness. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet asks the angel again; and by his example
we are taught to shake off every indifference, and to render ourselves both
teachable and attentive to God if we desire to make progress in the knowledge of
these predictions; for if Zechariah, who had separated himself from the world
and raised up his eyes and his mind to heaven, stood in need of the teaching and
guidance of the angel to instruct him, how much folly and arrogance is it in us
to trust in ourselves and to despise the gift of interpretation. But as angels
are not sent to us from heaven to explain to us the prophecies, let us avail
ourselves of those helps which we know is offered to us by God. There is here
prescribed to us both docility, and reverence, and attention. Let us also
remember, that as soon as men submit themselves to God, the gift of revelation
is prepared for them; for it is not in vain that God is often called the teacher
of babes. Whosoever then shall be disposed to learn with real meekness and
humility, shall not be disappointed of his desire; for we see here that the
angel performed his part in teaching Zechariah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I come now to the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The angel answered, These are
four spirits</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. Some give another rendering,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These</i></font><font face="Palatino">
chariots </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>go forth to the four
winds</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or parts of heaven; but this is forced,
and the words simply mean, &#8220;these are four spirits.&#8221; The word
spirit, I have no doubt, has led interpreters astray, for they have thought it
frigid to call different events winds or quarters of the world. But I take this
word in a different sense, that is, as designating the impulses of God. I do not
then understand them to be four winds, but the secret emotions produced by God.
Though God&#8217;s Spirit is one, yet all actions proceed from him, and whatever
is done in the world can with no impropriety be attributed to his Spirit. It is
yet certain, that the Prophet alludes to the four quarters of the world, as
though he had said, that nothing happens in the world which has not been decreed
in heaven; for God&#8217;s providence includes under it the whole world. Though
then the universe is designated here, yet by the Spirit the Prophet means those
secret movements which proceed from the eternal counsel and providence of God.
And it is a very apt metaphor; for the word Spirit is set in opposition to
fortune. We have already said, that profane men imagine that fortune possesses a
blind power, but the Prophet says, that all revolutions seen in the world
proceed from the Spirit of God, and that they are as it were his spirits or
ambassadors.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm25a</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the real meaning of the Prophet
when the angel says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>these
were the four spirits of heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And the word
heaven is by no means added in vain, for the Prophet seems here to exclude all
other causes, so that sovereignty might remain with God only. For though God
works often by instruments, or intermediate causes, as they say, yet his own
hidden decree ought to be placed first. This is the reason why he says that they
were the spirits of heaven; he says it, that we may not think that God is
dependent on the will of men, or is blended with the intervening causes, but
that he himself has fixed whatever he has in his good pleasure determined. We
hence see, that they who render the words, &#8220;into the four parts of
heaven,&#8221; have not sufficiently considered the intention of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>went forth from their station
before the Lord of the whole earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Now the
Prophet calls that space between the two mountains of brass their station before
God. Let us hence know that God does not adopt suddenly new counsels, and that
he is not like us who, in emergencies or on occasions unlooked for, attempt this
and then that; but that his course is very different, and that things in heaven
do not revolve up and down, for the chariots here had a fixed and undisturbed
station. For though they were chariots capable of moving quickly, they yet
remained still and, as it were, fixed, until God permitted their going forth. We
hence learn that when God seems to us to rest, he does not sit idly in heaven,
as ungodly men foolishly talk, but that he there determines whatever he intends
at a suitable time to do. And then when he says, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>chariots stood before
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, we may hence conclude, that what seems to
be contingently to us is fixed in God&#8217;s counsel, so that there is a
necessity at the same time. How comes it, that the greater part of mankind think
that all things are contingent, except that they continue looking at nature
only? The will of man is changeable; then changeable is everything that proceeds
from the will of man. The tree also either becomes scorched through heat, or
dies through cold, or brings forth fruit. They hence conclude that everything is
contingent, for there appears to be a changeable variety. When men thus judge of
things by nature alone, it is no wonder that they think that contingency reigns
in the world. But the Prophet distinguishes here between the things of nature
and the counsel of God; for he says, that the chariots stood, and went forth
when God commanded them. Was there no motion in the wheels? nay, the chariots
were from the first ready to move, how was it then that they rested? even
because they were detained by the secret purpose of God. Now when he sends them
forth they show that celerity which was naturally in them. We hence clearly
learn, that those things happen by nature which seem capable of being done in
two ways, and that yet the counsel of God is always fulfilled, so that immutable
necessity presides, which is at the same time hid from us. The Prophet adds,
that the first chariot had red horses. I have now explained the whole of this:
what is subjoined remains &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Zechariah explains here each part of the prophecy;
but he shows at the same time that two of the chariots hastened towards Chaldea,
that it might not be grievous to the Jews that they in the first place had to
experience God&#8217;s judgment. He then shows that God sent his messengers to
all parts; but that there had been, or were to be, remarkable and extraordinary
changes, especially among the Babylonians. It hence appeared evident, that God
had a care for his own people, who had been driven there into exile. And I leave
already stated the reason why he speaks here of red horses; for they are
mistaken who think that the first chariot was sent into Chaldea; for I consider
that this refers to the Jews, with whom God&#8217;s judgment commenced. He then
says, that two chariots went towards Babylon, the first was drawn by black
horses, and the other by white, because of the kindness shown by the Persian, by
whom a new light of joy was brought to the Jews.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>land of the
south</i></font><font face="Palatino">, the Prophet no doubt alludes to the
Egyptians. But he afterwards adds, that the last chariot was conveyed elsewhere,
even through the whole world. Some render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yxwma</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>amustim</i>, strong; and this is the proper meaning of the word, for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">xma</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>amets</i>, properly means to fortify, to strengthen; but as color is intended
here, it seems probable to me that it means somewhat red, as some of the Rabbis
teach us; for the Prophet mentioned another word before,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ydrb</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>beredim</i>, grilled. Hence some interpreters join together the two, and say
that the horses were grisled, or spotted like hail, and then that they were
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yxwma</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>amutsim</i>, somewhat red. Jerome seems to me to have sufficiently refuted
this opinion, because the other horses were
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ymda</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ademim</i>, red, but these were of different colors. And further, it can
hardly be suitable to say, that these alone were strong horses who drew this
chariot; for we know that God so wonderfully exercised his power against the
Chaldeans that two chariots went forth to them, and they would not have been
drawn by weak and feeble horses. I hence think that their color is here
designated, and the Prophet calls them once grilled, and then somewhat
red.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says, that being not satisfied with the land
of the south, they asked of God permission to go to and fro through the whole
world. And though neither the devil nor the wicked regard God&#8217;s bidding,
but are led, without knowing and against their will, wherever God drives them;
yet the Prophet says, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>asked</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
for they could not overstep the limits prescribed to them. Though Satan asked,
as to Job, to be allowed to do this and that, we are not yet too curiously to
inquire whether Satan asks leave of God whenever he intends to attempt anything;
for there is no doubt but that he is carried away by his violent rage to try in
every way to overturn the government of God. But this only ought to satisfy us
&#8212; that neither Satan nor the wicked can advance one inch, except as God
permits them. The meaning then is, that after the last chariot went forth first
to the land of the south, a permission was given to it to go through the whole
world. He now adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">From this verse we learn that the chief object of the
vision was &#8212; that the Jews might know that the dreadful tumults in
Chaldea, which had in part happened, and were yet to take place, were not
excited without a design, but that all things were regulated by God&#8217;s
hidden counsel, and also that God had so disturbed and embarrassed the state of
that empire, that the end of it might be looked for. There is therefore no
reason for any one too anxiously to labor to understand the import of every part
of the prophecy, since its general meaning is evident. But why does the angel
expressly speak of the land of the south rather than of the land of the north,
or of the whole world? Even because the eyes of all were fixed on that quarter;
for Chaldea, we know, had been as it were the grave of the Church, whence the
remnant had emerged, that there might be some people by whom God might be
worshipped. The angel then invites the Jews here to consider the providence of
God, so that they might know that whatever changes had taken place in that
country, had proceeded from the hidden counsel of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The words, they have
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>quieted my
spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">, are understood by interpreters in two
ways. Some think that God&#8217;s favor towards his people is here designated,
as though he had said, that he was already pacified; but others, by the word
spirit, understand the vengeance of God, because he had sufficiently poured
forth his wrath on the Chaldeans; and both meanings are well adapted to the
context. For it was no common solace to the Jews, that God had poured forth his
wrath on the Babylonians until it was satiated, as when one ceases not to be
angry until he has fulfilled his desire, and this mode of speaking often occurs
in Scripture. I am therefore disposed to embrace the second explanation &#8212;
that God began to be quieted after the second chariot had gone forth; for he was
then reconciled to his chosen people, and their deliverance immediately
followed. That the Jews might know that God would be propitious to them, he bids
them to continue quiet and undisturbed in their minds, until these chariots had
run their course through the whole of Chaldea; for what the angel now says would
be fulfilled, even that the Spirit of God would be quieted, who seemed before to
be disturbed, when he involved all things in darkness, even in Judea itself.

<div><font face="Palatino">This vision was given to Zechariah that he might
inspire weak minds with better hope; for the Jews found that they were hardly
pressed on every side by their neighbors, inasmuch as enemies rose up against
them before and behind, so that there was no end to their troubles. Hence they
who had returned from exile thought themselves wretched in such a state of
things. They might indeed have lived in quietness among the Babylonians, and
they had become accustomed to that kind of life, so that exile was not so very
grievous to them. Thus then the favor of God was turned unto loathing, and was
almost hated by them; for they thought it better to be deprived of their
country, than to be daily exposed to new assaults. And further, the possession
of the land was not of itself desirable, except with reference to the hope given
them; that is, because God had promised by his Prophets that the kingdom of
David would again be made glorious, and also that the grandeur and glory of the
temple would be greater than ever before. When the Jews found themselves
continually harassed by their enemies, they thought that all that had been
promised was in vain. There is therefore no doubt but that many complaints and
many clamors were everywhere raised. Hence that they might cease thus to murmur
against God, this vision was given to the Prophet, in which he is bid to take
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>silver and gold
</i></font><font face="Palatino">from four men, and to make two crowns to be set
on the head of Joshua the high priest. The design was to make the Jews to feel
assured, that the state of the people would be as safe as it was formerly, when
the kingly office and the priesthood flourished: for these were the chief
ornaments, or the two eyes, as it were, of the body &#8212; the priest, a
mediator between God and men &#8212; and the king, sustaining the person of God
in governing the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that by the two crowns is set forth the
restoration of the Church: but we must also observe that the two crowns are
placed on the head of Joshua, which was new and unusual. A mitre, we know, was
given to the priests; and we know also that kings were adorned with a diadem;
but no one individual was to wear a royal diadem and a sacerdotal mitre. Here
then we find a union of royalty and priesthood in the same person, which had
never before been the case; for God had in his law made a distinction between
the two offices. We hence see that something unknown before is set forth by this
prophecy, even this, that the same person would be both a king and a priest. For
what Jerome says, among other things, that there might have been many crowns, is
weak and frivolous; and further, he contradicts the words of the Prophet; for
shortly after he subjoins, that there would be a counsel of peace between the
two; that is, between royalty and priesthood. As to what the same author thinks,
that there was one crown given to the high priest, it is also false; besides, he
subverts as far as he can the whole doctrine of the Prophet. But I leave these
trifles; for there is no ambiguity in Zechariah&#8217;s words when he says, that
God commanded him to take silver and gold, that he might make two crowns to set
on the head of the high priest. We now perceive the design of the Prophet as to
the object of the prophecy, and also the meaning of the words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now inquire, why the Prophet was bid to take
gold from four men; for he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take from the
transmigration</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlwgh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>egule</i>, is to be taken in a collective sense, as in many other places.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then from the exiles, who have now returned from Babylon to their own country.
But he afterwards mentions four men; and there is some abruptness in the
passage, but nothing that obscures the meaning of the Prophet; for he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take frown Heldai, and from
Tobiah, and from Jedaiah</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>go in that day, enter the house
of Josiah, the son of Zephaniah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet no
doubt had been commanded to go to these four, and to enter the house of one of
them; and this is evident from the end of the tenth verse, where he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who have come from
Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm59</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He had
spoken only of Josiah the son of Zephaniah; and then he adds, that they had come
from Babylon. I come now to the answer. Some interpreters think that these four
men supplied the gold and the silver, because they were chief men among the
people, and excelled others in piety. Hence they think that these four men were
chosen, as a mark of distinction, to supply the gold and the silver to make the
crowns: but I conjecture from the end of the chapter that their weakness is here
pointed out, even because they were weak in faith and did not believe the
promises of God, and thus disheartened others by their example. It is indeed
certain that they were men in high authority, and excelled all others, so that
the eyes of all were fixed on them; this is certain. But yet their want of faith
is what is here reproved, because they did not attend sufficiently to
God&#8217;s promises, and thought themselves disappointed of their hope; for
they had left Babylon, where they enjoyed great abundance, and returned to the
holy land, and found it uncultivated and desolate. There was indeed required
great patience, when they had to plow among thorns and brambles; for that land,
as I have already said, had not been regularly cultivated. Those indeed who had
been sent from the East, dwelt here and there in it; but lions and wild beasts
had come into it, so that the desolation of the land rendered much work
necessary, when the Jews returned. I hence doubt not but that the Holy Spirit
does here reprove these four men, who ought to have been leaders and
standard-bearers to others; on the contrary, they broke down the confidence of
the common people. And this, I say, may be learnt from the end of the chapter,
where God commands the two crowns to be placed in the temple, to be a memorial
to them, that they might see there the condemnation of their unbelief, as we
shall show in its place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet is bid to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>set the two crowns on the head of
the high priest</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This, as I have said, was
intended as a symbol to denote the union of the two dignities in the person of
Christ. It was necessary until the coming of Christ to select the high priest
from the posterity of Aaron; and it was also required that the kings should be
from the seed of David; so that we observe a distinction between the royal
office and the priesthood, not only as to the persons, but also as to the
families. It would have indeed been a strange thing to see a king from the tribe
of Levi; and it would have been contrary to God&#8217;s appointed order to see a
priest from the tribe of Judah and from the family of David. Since then the king
was adorned with his own diadem, and since the high priest had his own proper
mitre, what could this mean, but that the same man was to wear two crowns?
Doubtless we observe that there is here some change in the past order of things,
and that there is something unusual set forth. But there is nothing new in this,
&#8212; that the Redeemer, who had been promised, should be eminent as a king
and a priest; for this had been predicted in the hundred and tenth Psalm,
&#8220;Jehovah said to my Lord, sit on my right hand,&#8221; &#8212; this is
what belongs to the right of a king; it afterwards follows, &#8220;Thou art a
priest for ever, according to the order of Melchizedec.&#8221; Though kings must
then have been chosen from the family of David and the tribe of Judah, and
though priests must have then been taken from the Levitical tribe, yet the
Spirit foretold, that a king would come who was to be a priest, as had been the
case with Melchisedec. This very thing is what the Prophet now
confirms.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Zechariah being ordered to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>set the crowns
</i></font><font face="Palatino">on the head of Joshua, we are not so to regard
this, as though Joshua had immediately undertaken the two offices of a king and
a priest; for he was satisfied with his own: but the Prophet shows in the type
what was to be looked for at the coming of the Messiah; for the time had not yet
come, when Christ should receive the royal diadem, as it is said in Ezekiel,
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Take away the
diadem;. set it aside, set it aside, set it aside, until he shall come, whose it
is.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;262126&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
21:26,27.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We here see that the Prophet points out a length of
time, during which the royal diadem was to be trodden as it were under foot.
Though the royal crown had not yet laid in the dust sufficiently long, yet the
Prophet did nothing presumptuously; for the Jews could not have conceived in
their mind what is here promised, had not the typical priest come forth, wearing
the two crowns. Nor could this have been so suitable to the person of
Zerubbabel; for though he was of the family of David, and was a type of Christ,
he had not yet the name of a king, nor had he any regal power: he could not
therefore have been so suitable a person. It is then no wonder that God brought
forth the high priest Joshua, who was a type and representative of Christ; and
he brought him forth with a double crown, because he who was to come would
unite, according to what follows, the priesthood with the kingly
office.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The vision is now explained; for if the chief priest,
without this explanation, had been adorned with two crowns, there must have been
much talk among the people, &#8220;What means this?&#8221; God here shows that
what he has commanded to be done to Joshua does not belong to him, but has a
reference to another, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt
say to him, Behold the Man, Branch is his nam</i></font><font face="Palatino">e.
It is the same as though the Prophet had expressly testified that Joshua was not
crowned, because he was worthy of such an honor, or because he could look for
royal dignity; but that he was to bear this honor for a time, in order that the
Jews might understand that one was to arise who would be both a king and a
priest. Hence he says, that there would be a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>man</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
whose name was to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Branch</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to this name, it has been explained elsewhere. I
omit those refinements with which some are delighted; but as I have shown in
another place, the simple and true reason why Christ is so called, is, because
he was not like a tall tree, with deep and strong roots, but like a small plant.
He is indeed called in another place, &#8220;a shoot from the root of
Jesse.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;231101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
11:1.) But the meaning is the same; for that root of Jesse was obscure and of no
repute. Besides, this kind of shoot has nothing in it that is illustrious. We
hence see that Christ is called Branch, because his beginning was contemptible,
so that he was of hardly any repute among heathens; nay even among his own
nation. But God intimates at the same time, that this little plant would be set,
as it were, by his own hand, and thus would gather strength. Though then the
beginning of Christ was humble, yet God declares, that he would give vigor for
continued growth, until he should attain to a great height. In this sense it is
that Christ is called Branch: and we clearly conclude, that the minds of the
people were transferred to Christ who was to come, that they might not fix their
attention on Joshua, who was then but a typical priest.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Say to Joshua, Behold the man,
whose name is Branch</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Where is that man? He
does not speak of Joshua; he does not say, &#8220;Thou art the man;&#8221; but
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold the man, whose
name is Branch</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, who comes elsewhere.
We then hence learn, that these crowns were those of Christ, but given to
Joshua, that the Jews might see in the type, what was as yet hid under
hope.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shall arise from
himself</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>grow up from his own
place</i></font><font face="Palatino">, literally, from under himself. Here also
some have too refinedly philosophised, &#8212; that Christ arose from himself by
his own power, because he is the eternal God. I think, on the contrary, that all
human means are only excluded, as though the Prophet had said, that though
Christ was like a little plant, he would yet grow up as though he had roots
deeply fixed in the earth. There is indeed no doubt, but that Christ grew up by
his own celestial power, and this is what the words of the Prophet include; but
what he meant was this, &#8212; that Christ had nothing in his beginning
calculated to draw the admiration of men. Though then Christ was only a shoot,
yet God had sufficient power, that he should
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>grow from his own
place</i></font><font face="Palatino">, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm60</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
though human means were absent, it would yet be enough, that God should bless
this branch, so as to cause it to grow to its proper height.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall build the temple of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is a remarkable passage: it hence
appears that the temple which the Jews had then begun to build, and which was
afterwards built by Herod, was not the true temple of which Haggai had
prophesied, when he said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The glory of the
second house shall be greater</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">than
that of the first.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;370209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Haggai
2:9.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For though the temple of Herod was splendid, yet we
see what the Spirit declares in this place, &#8212; that to build the temple
would be Christ&#8217;s own work. Hence no one, had he heaped together all the
gold and the silver of the world, could have built the true temple of which
Haggai prophesied, and of which Ezekiel has so largely spoken near the end of
his book. Christ alone then has been chosen by the Father to build this temple.
Christ indeed himself was a temple as to his body, for the fullness of the
Godhead dwelt in him,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:6;) but he built a temple to God the Father, when he raised up everywhere pure
worship, having demolished superstitions, and when he consecrated us to be a
royal priesthood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see what was shown to the Prophet,
&#8212; that though the Jews were then exposed to many evils, to reproaches and
wrongs, yet Christ would come to restore all things to a perfect order, that he
would be not only a king but also a priest; and further, that his beginning
would be obscure and despised by the world, and yet that he would attain without
any earthly helps his own elevation; and, lastly, that his own proper office
would be to build a temple to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He repeats the last thing which he had said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even he shall build the temple of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet seems here to reiterate to
no purpose the same words without any additions of light: but it seems evident
to me, that he meant in this way to confirm and sanction what seemed difficult
to be believed. As the temple, then, begun at that time to be built, had but
little splendor and glory connected with it, and could hardly be expected to
become a better or more adorned building, the Prophet reiterates this promise,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He, he shall build the temple of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">; by which he means, &#8220;Let not your
eyes remain fixed on this temple, for to look at it weakens your faith and
almost disheartens you; but hope for another temple which ye see not now, for a
priest and a king shall at length come to build a better and a more excellent
temple.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Bear shall he the glory, and
shall sit and rule on his throne</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He fully
confirms what we have already referred to &#8212; that this man, who was to grow
by God&#8217;s hidden power, would be made both a king and a priest, but by no
earthly instrumentality. In the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bear shall he the
glory</i></font><font face="Palatino">, there is no doubt an implied contrast
between Joshua and Christ, the true priest. For Joshua, though he discharged in
his time the office of a priest, was yet despised; but the Prophet bids his
people to hope for more than what could have been conceived from the view of
things at that time; for an illustrious priest was to come, full of royal
dignity. And hence he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sit
shall he and rule on his throne</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This did not
properly belong to the priesthood; but the Prophet affirms, that the man who was
to come from above, would be a king, though he exercised the priestly office. He
was then to be a priest, and yet to be on his throne and to rule as a king; and
ruling is what belongs to a king and not to a priest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At length he concludes by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The counsel of peace shall be
between the two</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I do not think that the
discords which had been between kings and priests are here indirectly reproved.
I indeed allow that such discords had often been seen among that ancient people;
but the Prophet had regard to something far different, even this &#8212; that
the priesthood would be united with the kingly office. He therefore did not
refer to different persons who were to be at peace together; but, on the
contrary, spoke of things or of the two offices;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there shall
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be the counsel of peace between
the two</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, between the kingly office and
the priesthood. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm61</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We
hence learn that which I have already stated &#8212; that what is here promised
had not been found under the law, and could not have been expected under it; and
that the fulfillment of this prophecy is the renovation which took place at the
coming of Christ. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">They who think that the crowns were deposited with
these four men, pervert the meaning of the Prophet; for they were, on the
contrary, placed in God&#8217;s temple to be a memorial to them. It hence
appears; that, as I have already said, they were not required to supply the
gold, because they excelled all others in piety and holiness, but because it was
necessary to condemn their want of faith, inasmuch as they thought that their
hope was disappointed, as God did not immediately fulfill what he had promised.

been ordered to take gold and silver from these four men: it was, that he might
make crowns, which were afterwards to be deposited in God&#8217;s temple. At

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet also states, that men would come from
remote lands to contribute labor or wealth towards the building of the temple;
for the word building may refer to either of these two things.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall those from
far</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Before this time gifts had been presented
by Gentile nations, but the temple was not built but by Solomon and his people.
God then promises here something more, and that is, that helpers would assist in
building the temple, who had been till then wholly aliens. It is indeed certain,
that in the age of Zechariah contributions had been made by Cyrus; but the
Prophet refers to nothing of this kind: he promises something more. It hence
follows that this prophecy must necessarily be referred to the promulgation of
the gospel; for then it was that strangers began to contribute their labor and
their wealth towards building a temple to God. Though then Cyrus gave a large
sum of money towards the erection of the temple, yet the allusion here is not to
his liberality. And after Cyrus no stranger had been so liberal: for Herod, who
raised up a great and a very splendid building, was not from far; nay, he wished
to be thought one of the people. We then see that this prophecy cannot be
otherwise referred than to the building of the spiritual temple, when Gentiles,
formerly remote from God&#8217;s people, joined them as friends, and brought
their labor to the work of building the temple, not with stones or wood, or with
other corruptible materials, but with the doctrine and the gifts of the Holy
Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye shall know that Jehovah of
hosts has sent me to you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Of this kind of
knowledge we have spoken elsewhere. It indeed behaved the Jews from the first to
feel assured respecting the truth of this prophecy; but when the effect or
experience itself was added, they then began to know more clearly. It is then
the same as thought the Prophet had said, &#8220;God, who speaks by my mouth,
will not disappoint you, as he will at length accomplish what I now declare; and
experience itself will be a witness that I have been a true and faithful
Prophet.&#8221; And he calls Him the God of hosts, that the Jews, hearing that
what he had said proceeded from Him whose power is infinite, might be confirmed
in their faith. There was then no reason for them to doubt as to the
accomplishment, for there is nothing that can resist God, when it pleases him to
unfold his power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If by hearing ye will hear the
voice of Jehovah your God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Zechariah promises
to the Jews here conditionally &#8212; if they became obedient to God, and
continued in obedience to his word and in his doctrine; for unbelief deprives
men of all participation in God&#8217;s favor. It is indeed true that had all
become unbelieving, Christ would have come; for God as he is true would not
change his purpose were the whole world to become false. Since then the
faithfulness of God depends not on men, we ought not so to take what the Prophet
says here, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If ye will hear the
voice of Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as though they could, by
being unfaithful to God, have rendered void the accomplishment of this prophecy.
Their defection, then, yea, that of the whole nation, could not have prevented
Christ from coming forth in his own appointed time. But the Prophet had another
thing in view, even this &#8212; that the Jews would become partakers of this
blessing, or would enjoy, so to speak, this favor, if they embraced God&#8217;s
promise, and obediently submitted to his law. For though Christ has already come
as the Redeemer of the world, yet we know that this benefit is not come to all,
and why? Because many through unbelief close the door against God and his grace
through Christ. Hence the faithful alone really know that God has spoken, and
really partake of his favor, and for this reason, because they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hear his
voice</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, they first by faith receive
what God offers, and then they fall not away from his truth, but continue in the
obedience of faith to the end.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What the Prophet then had in view, was to show to the
Jews that those things were spoken in vain, as to them, if they did not attend
to God. And he shows the way in which they were to be attentive, even by hearing
the voice of God, that is, by renouncing their own thoughts, and by not
esteeming God untrue, though he promised what seemed incredible. If then they
denied themselves, banished their own imaginations, wholly attended to
God&#8217;s word, and believed what he had said as a Prophet, he assures them
that they would really find that which he taught them to be true to their own
salvation, even this &#8212; that Christ would come to be a king and a priest,
to secure perfect happiness to his people.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">THERE is no vision here, but the answer which
Zechariah was commanded to give to the messengers of the captives: for he says
that some had been sent from Chaldea to offer sacrifices to God, and at the same
time to inquire whether the fast, which they had appointed when the city was
taken and destroyed, was to be observed. But there is some ambiguity in the
words of the Prophet, for it is doubtful whether the two whom he names, even
Sherezer and Regem-melech, together with the others, had sent the messengers of
whom mention is made, or they themselves came and brought the message from the
captives. But this is a matter of no great moment. As to the question itself, I
am disposed to adopt their view, who think that these two came with their
associates to Jerusalem, and in the name of them all inquired respecting the
fast, as we shall hereafter see. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm62</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
Jews think that these were Persian princes; but this opinion is frivolous. They
are thus accustomed to draw whatever occurs to the glory of their own nation
without any discretion or judgment, as though it had been an object much desired
by the Jews, that two Persian should go up to the temple. But there is no need
here of a long discussion; for if we regard the Prophet&#8217;s design, we may
easily conclude that these were Jews who had been sent by the exiles, both to
offer gifts and to inquire about the fast, as the Prophet tells us. The sum of
the whole then is, that Sherezer and Regem-melech, and their companions, came to
the temple, and that they also asked counsel of the priests and Prophets,
whether the fast of the fifth month was still to be observed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must first be observed, that though all had not so
much courage as to return to their own country as soon as leave was given them,
they were not yet gross despisers of God, and wholly destitute of all religion.
It was indeed no light fault to remain torpid among the Babylonians when a free
return was allowed them; for it was an invaluable kindness on the part of God to
stretch forth his hand to the wretched exiles, who had wholly despaired of a
return. Since then God was prepared to bring them home, such a favor could not
have been neglected without great ingratitude. But it was yet the Lord&#8217;s
will that some sparks of grace should continue in the hearts of some, though
their zeal was not so fervid as it ought to have been. The same sloth we see in
the present day to be in many, who continue in the filth of Popery; and yet they
groan there, and the Lord preserves them, so that they do not shake off every
concern for religion, nor do they wholly fall away. All then are not to be
condemned as unfaithful, who are slothful and want vigor; but they are to be
stimulated. For they who indulge their torpor act very foolishly; but at the
same time they ought to be pitied, when there is not in them that desirable
alacrity in devoting themselves to God, which they ought to have. Such an
instance then we see in the captives, who ought to have immediately prepared
themselves for the journey, when a permission was given them by the edicts of
Cyrus and Darius. They however remained in exile, but did not wholly renounce
the worship of God; for they sent sacred offerings, by which they professed
their faith; and they also inquired what they were to do, and showed deference
to the priests and Prophets then at Jerusalem. It hence appears, that they were
not satisfied with themselves, though they did not immediately amend what was
wrong. There are many now, who, in order to exculpate themselves, or rather to
wipe away (as they think) all disgrace, despise God&#8217;s word, and treat us
with derision; nay, they devise crimes with which they charge us, with the view
of vilifying the word of the Lord in the estimation of the simple. But the
Prophet shows that the captives of whom he speaks, though not so courageous as
they ought to have been were yet true servants of God; for they sent sacrifices
to the temple, and also wished to hear and to learn what they were to
do.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says first, that messengers were sent to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>entreat the face of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here by the word entreating or
praying, the Prophet means also sacrifices. For it is certain that the Jews
prayed in exile, as there could have been no religion in them had they not
exercised themselves in prayer. But the mention made here is of that stated
prayer, connected with sacrifices, by which they professed themselves to be
God&#8217;s people. We may hence also learn, that sacrifices of themselves are
of no great importance, since prayer, or calling on God, has ever the first
place. Sacrifices then, and other offerings, were, as we may say, additions;
(<i>accessoria</i> &#8212; accessions;) for this command ought ever to be
regarded by the faithful,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;offer to me the
sacrifice of praise.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;195014&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
50:14.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, in the second place, that messengers were
sent, that they might learn from the priests and the Prophets what was to them
doubtful. We hence conclude, that it was no gross dissimulation, such as is
found in hypocrites who pretend to pray to God, but that there was a real desire
to obey. And, doubtless, when God&#8217;s word and celestial truth are despised,
there is then neither any real prayer, nor any other religious exercise; for
unbelief pollutes and contaminates whatever is otherwise in its nature sacred.
Whosoever then desires rightly to pray to God, let him add faith, that is, let
him come to God in a teachable frame of mind, and seek to be ruled by his word.
For the Prophet in telling us what was done, no doubt keeps to the method or the
order observed by the captives. It was then worthy of praise that they not only
were anxious to seek God&#8217;s favor by prayers and sacrifices, but that they
also sought to know what was pleasing to Cod. Nor was it a matter of wonder that
they sent to Jerusalem on this account, for they knew that that place had been
chosen by God as the place from which they were to seek the right knowledge of
religion. Since then Jerusalem was the sanctuary of God, the captives sent there
their messengers, particularly as they knew that the priests were the
ambassadors of God, and that the interpretation of the law was to be sought from
their mouth. They indeed knew that the time was not yet come when the doctrine
of salvation was to be disseminated through the whole world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet says, that the captives not only
inquired of the priests, but also of the Prophets. It hence appears, that it was
a thing commonly known, that God had raised up Prophets, which he had ceased to
do for a long time. For it was not without reason that Isaiah said, that God
would yet speak by his Prophets, when he would again comfort his people.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234001&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
40:1.) There had been then a mournful silence for seventy years, when no
Prophets were sent forth, according to what is said in the book of
Psalms,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;our signs we see
not, nor is there a Prophet among
us.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;197409&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
74:9.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God indeed had been accustomed to lead the people as
by an erected banner when they dwelt in the holy land, and Prophets continually
succeeded one another in regular order, according to what the Lord had promised
by Moses,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;A Prophet will I
raise up in the midst of thee,&#8221;
etc.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
18:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From the time then in which they had been driven into
exile, while looking there on one another, they could hear no voice to encourage
them with hope, until new Prophets were again raised up beyond what they
expected. And it was God&#8217;s will that the Prophets should have their abode
and habitation at Jerusalem, in order that he might gather the dispersed Israel;
for had there been Prophets in Chaldea, many might hence lay hold of a pretext
for their slothfulness: &#8220;Does not God dwell in the midst of us? what need
is there of undertaking a difficult and toilsome journey? we shall indeed find
nothing better at Jerusalem than in this exile; for God shows that he is present
with us by his Prophets.&#8221; It would have therefore been a great evil to the
Jews to have Prophets in their exile. But when the captives heard that the gift
of prophecy appeared again in the temple, they might have called to mind what
their fathers had heard from the mouth of Isaiah, and also from the mouth of
Micah, &#8220;from Zion shall go forth a law, and the word of Jehovah from
Jerusalem.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
2:3
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;330403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah
4:3.) We now perceive why Zechariah joined Prophets to priests.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must bear in mind what we have stated
elsewhere that the prophetic was, as it were, an extraordinary office, when God
took others as the ministers of his word besides the priests. For their work was
sacerdotal; but God meant to condemn the priests by transferring the work of
teaching to others, that is, when Prophets were taken from the common people, or
from other families, and not from the Levitical tribe. It is not indeed true
that all the priests were Prophets; but the office itself would not have been
transferred to any other tribe, had not God thus punished the ingratitude of
those who bestowed more labor on their own private concerns than on teaching the
people. However this case may have been, it was an illustrious testimony of
God&#8217;s favor, that Prophets at that time had again been raised up. And this
fact has been added &#8212; that they dwelt nowhere else but at Jerusalem, in
order to encourage the dispersed to return, and to show to them that the place
had not in vain been previously chosen by God. This is the reason why the
Prophet expressly says, that the Prophets, as well as the priests, were in the
house or in the temple of the Lord of hosts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The time is also mentioned,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the fourth year of Darius, and
the ninth month </i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the fourth
day</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm63</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
beginning of the year, we know, was in March; hence the month Chisleu was
November, or a part of October and November, for they were wont to commence
their months at the new moons. Of king Darius we have spoken elsewhere. He was
not, indeed, the first Darius, the father-in-law of Cyrus, who transferred the
monarchy to the Persian, but Darius the son of Hystaspes. Passed away then had
the seventy years, for this, as it has been stated before, was the fourth
king.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now consider the question which the captives
proposed to the priests. They asked whether they were to weep in the fifth
month, and whether they were to separate themselves as they had done for seventy
years and more; for some years, as we have seen, had elapsed beyond that number.
We hence learn that a regular fast was observed from the time in which the
temple was burned and the city destroyed. He speaks here only of the fifth
month, but shortly after mention is made of the seventh month. It is evident
from sacred history that the city was demolished and the temple pulled down in
the fifth month. It is therefore probable that there was a day of mourning
observed by the people in memory of that sad event. In the seventh month, though
not in the same year, Gedaliah was slain, and the remainder of the people were
driven into exile. As the land became then desolate, it is also probable that
another fast was appointed, that they might yearly humble themselves before God,
and suppliantly seek his pardon. Since then there was a reason for both fasts,
it is evident that they could not have been condemned by the priests: nor is
there a doubt, but that it was by the public consent of all, that they every
year kept these days of weeping. We also see the end which God has in view in
prescribing a fast, &#8212; that men in coming to him may feel true penitence,
and remind themselves by their external appearance of their own guilt. As then
the Jews observed this rule in their fasts, we must conclude that they pleased
God; for these were religious exercises, by which they might have been led to
repentance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now they inquired, whether they were to continue
their weeping; for the temple had now been begun to be built as well as the
city. Since the reason for their mourning had been, that the temple no longer
stood where they might offer their sacrifices, and that the holy city had been
demolished, it was then doubtless right to give thanks to God, and to feel joy,
when an end came to their calamities. However, the captives ventured not to
change anything without the authority and consent of the priests, so that they
might all agree together. And thus they also testified that they were true
members of the Church, as they had no desire to have anything different from
others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word fast is not mentioned; but they asked,
&#8220;Shall we weep?&#8221; Hence also it appears, that they were not so gross
in their ideas as to think that the chief part of religion is fasting, as
hypocrites do, who imagine that they honor God by abstaining from food, and thus
mock God, who is a Spirit, with mere trifles, when it is his express will to be
spiritually worshipped. We then plainly see, that the Jews were not imbued with
this gross and foolish thought, when they established this annual fast; for they
put weeping in the place of fasting. And why was this weeping, except that they
went into God&#8217;s presence conscious of their guilt and in a suppliant
manner, and testified by external signs that they acknowledged their sins, so
that they might obtain mercy and forgiveness?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They mentioned also
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>consecration</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rzn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nezar</i>, which means to separate, is variously explained: but here many
interpreters confine it to abstinence from food, as though they had said,
&#8220;Shall we separate ourselves from food?&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm64</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
seems forced to me: I therefore prefer to apply it to sanctification; for we
know that when a day was prescribed for fasting or for offering sacrifices,
there was sanctification added. For though it became the Jews through their
whole life to abstain from all defilements, yet we know that when a fast or any
particular sacrifice was appointed, they were more diligent and solicitous to
cast aside every pollution. We now then understand what the Jews had in view,
and what they meant by these words. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet tells us that he was sent to the
people and to the priests, not so much to teach the messengers who came from
distant lands, as to correct the vices of his own nation; for the Jews had then
begun, according to their usual manner, to dissemble with God, and had glided,
as it has elsewhere appeared, into many evil practices. And it appears evident,
that God did not commit to Zechariah what the messengers might bring back to
Chaldea; but that an occasion was taken to remind the Jews, that they were to
look to themselves. It may have been the case, that the priests themselves and
all the rest had begun to raise a controversy, &#8220;How is this? our brethren
inquire, whether the fast is to be still observed:&#8221; and the opinions might
have been various. But as this is doubtful, I leave it as such. We however see
that the Prophet does not speak here respecting the captives, nor does he
address to their messengers anything which they might convey to Chaldea, but
turns his discourse to the priests and to the people. The sum of the whole is,
that while the captives gave no mean testimony of their religion, God reproved
the Jews, who had returned to their own country, for ingratitude, as they had
already begun to pollute themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore brings this charge against them,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Have ye fasted to me? have ye
eaten to me?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> as though he had said, &#8220;God
regards not fastings, except they proceed from a sincere feeling and tend to a
right and lawful end.&#8221; It was then the object of the Prophet to awaken the
Jews, that they might not imagine that God was pacified by fasting or by any
other frigid ceremonies, but that they might know that something more was
required. And we see how prone mankind are to rely on external rites, and to
think that they have rightly performed their duty to God when they have fasted.
As then human nature labors under this disease, the Prophet is here sent to
dissipate this delusion; which he does by declaring that fasting does not please
God, or is acceptable to him, as though it were something meritorious, or as
though there was in it any holiness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says first, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the word of Jehovah was given
</i></font><font face="Palatino">to him, that he might go to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the people of the land and to the
priests</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We see the truth of what I have
already said, that the answer was not directed to the captives, but to the very
inhabitants of the land and to the citizens of Jerusalem, and for this reason,
&#8212; because they thought that when the question respecting fasting was
moved, the first and chief part of all religion was the subject of inquiry.
Hence God, that he might strip them of this superstition, says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When ye fasted in the fifth month
and in the seventh month, and during the seventy
years</i></font><font face="Palatino">, did ye fast to me &#8212; to me? for he
has put an affix to the verb,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yntmx</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tsametni</i>, and afterwards added
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yna</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ani</i>: as though he had said, &#8220;Was it to me that ye fasted? Shall I
approve of such fasting?&#8221; There is an emphasis in the repetition, as
though he had said, that there was no reason for the Jews to boast that they
faithfully served God, and fully performed their duty, because they fasted twice
in the year, for they had to do with that God who rejected such trifling
things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence learn that nothing is more preposterous than
for men to judge of God&#8217;s worship according to their own notions, and to
trust in themselves. It is indeed easy for us to deceive ourselves; for as we
are earthly, so we may think that whatever glitters before our eyes is most
acceptable to God. But the Prophet here reminds us, by one sentence, how
frivolous are such self-pleasing thoughts; for God meets us with this question,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>&#8220;Have ye fasted to
me?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Are ye to be judges, and is it right for
you at your pleasure to invent various modes of worship? But I remain always
like myself, and not transform me according to what pleases you; for I repudiate
everything of this kind.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying, that to themselves they did
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>eat</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>drink</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he intimates that to eat and to drink, or to abstain from eating and drinking,
are things wholly unconnected with the worship of God. Another sense may indeed
be elicited, &#8212; that the Jews did eat as heathens did: and there will be in
this case an indirect reproof, &#8212; that they sought to pacify God only twice
in the year, and that during the rest of the time they were heedless and
indulged themselves in excesses. We ought indeed to bear in mind what Paul says,
that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;whether we eat or
drink, all things ought to be
done</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">to the praise of God.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461031&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 10:31.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The law also expressly commanded the Jews to
&#8220;feast before the Lord,&#8221; that is, not to taste food without
thanksgiving, as though God were present. When, therefore, the Jews fasted
themselves without any regard to God, it is no wonder that their fastings where
rejected; for their course was not consistent. For though the godly do not
always fast, yet while they partake most freely of meat and drink, they turn not
away their thoughts from God, but on the contrary rejoice before him. They
therefore eat and drink to God, as well as abstain on God&#8217;s account. But
the Prophet shows here that the Jews
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>did eat to
themselves</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and that hence their fasting was
not regarded before God. This latter sense is not unsuitable: but as to the
subject itself, it is enough for us to know, that the Prophet, as he had to deal
with hypocrites, ridicules their superstition in their fastings, inasmuch as
they thought that these were expiations by which their sins were blotted out,
and that if they abstained for a day or two from meat and drink, God was thereby
pacified.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the Prophet&#8217;s object is more evident from
the next verse, when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Are
not these the words which Jehovah proclaimed by the former
Prophets?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He confirms here his doctrine by many
testimonies, that is, that God had already through successive ages exhorted the
Jews to true repentance, and condemned their dissimulation, that they might not
think that true religion was made up of fasting and of similar things. And this
the Prophet did, not only to gain or secure to himself more credit, but also to
render double the wickedness of the Jews; as though he had said, that they were
apparently very anxious not to offend God, but that it was merely a false
pretense; for had they from the heart wished to please God, they might have long
ago learnt that fastings were of themselves of no moment, but that a beginning
ought to be made with true religion and spiritual worship.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have already mentioned, that possibly, when the
question was raised by the captives, much disputing, as it is commonly the case,
prevailed among the people. But as the Jews ever reverted to their old ways,
being blindly attached to their frigid ceremonies, and thinking in this manner
to propitiate God, the Prophet, for this reason, derides their preposterous
labor and toil. &#8220;See,&#8221; he says, &#8220;the only question now is,
whether there should be fasting, as though this were the principal thing before
God; in the meantime godliness is neglected, and neglected is real calling on
God, and the whole of spiritual worship is also esteemed by you as nothing, and
no integrity of life prevails: for ye bite one another, plunder one another,
wrong one another, and are guilty of lying: ye heedlessly close your eyes to
such vices as these; and at the same time when fasting is neglected, ye think
that the whole of religion falls to the ground. These are your old ways, and
such were commonly the thoughts and doings of your fathers; and it appears
evident that ye trifle with God, and that ye are full of deceits, and that there
is not in you a particle of true religion. For God formerly spoke loudly in your
ears, and his words were not obscure when he exhorted you by his Prophets; he
showed to you what true repentance was, but effected nothing. Is it not then
quite evident that ye are now acting deceitfully, when ye so carefully enquire
about fasting?&#8221; We now perceive what force there is in this sentence,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Are not these the words which
Jehovah </i></font><font face="Palatino">formerly
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>proclaimed?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">For it was not enough to remind the Jews of
true repentance; but this reproof was needful, in order more sharply to
stimulate them; and it was wholly necessary to discover their hypocrisy, that
they might not be too much pleased with external performances.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That they might not then object, that what they asked
respecting God&#8217;s counsel was done with a good intention, the Prophet
answers them, &#8220;Where are the words by which God had testified as to what
can please him?&#8221; And for the same purpose he uses the word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">arq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kora</i>, proclaimed: for he does not say, that God merely declared words by
his Prophets, but that he uttered them loudly, and as it were with a full mouth.
&#8220;See,&#8221; he says, &#8220;ye enquire as though ye were in doubt, and
that the knot could hardly be untied, and as though it were a matter of great
moment. God has indeed not only spoken, but has also cried aloud in the ears of
your fathers; in the meantime ye tread under foot his teaching, or pass it by
with closed eyes.&#8221; What does this mean? to enquire so anxiously about
fasting, and at the same time to despise what is far more important? In a
similar manner does Christ also condemn hypocrites, because they hesitated not
to swallow a camel, while they were wont to strain at a gnat,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402324&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
23:24;) for in trifling things they dared not to attempt anything; but as to
gross wickedness, they leaped over it as it were with the audacity of wild
beasts. The object then of the Prophet&#8217;s words was to show that the Jews
did not seriously and in earnest enquire respecting God&#8217;s will, but
pretended to be very attentive to religion, while they openly, and with gross
and headless audacity, rejected the true doctrine, which was by no means
ambiguous, as God had by his many Prophets clearly taught them and their fathers
what he required from them.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The judgment of truth judge, and
kindness and mercies show, every one to his
brother</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We have seen what the Prophet said of
fasting, when messengers were sent by the exiles to enquire on the subject. It
was a suitable opportunity for handling the question. For, as we then said, the
people were so devoted to their ceremonies, as to think that the whole of
religion consisted in fasting and in similar exercises. And as we are by nature
prone to this evil, we ought carefully to consider what the Prophet has taught
us &#8212; that fasting is not simply, or by itself, approved by God, but on
account of the end designed by it. Having already shown to the Jews their error,
in thinking that God could be pacified by ceremonies, he now reminds them of
what God mainly requires in his law &#8212; that men should observe what is just
and right towards one another. It is indeed true that the first part of the law
refers to the service due to God; but it is a way which God has commonly
adopted, to test the life of men by the duties of the second Table, and to show
what this part of the law especially requires God then in this passage, as in
many others, does not commend righteousness towards men so as to depreciate
godliness; for as this far excels everything in the whole world, so we know that
in rightly forming the life, the beginning ought ever to be made by serving God
aright. But as the Prophet had to do with hypocrites, he shows that they only
trifled with God, while they made much of external things, and at the same tinge
neglected uprightness, and the duties of love</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand the Prophet&#8217;s object. He
had said in the last lecture that he brought forward nothing new, but only
reminded them of what had been taught by other Prophets; and here he pursues the
same subject &#8212; that God made more account of uprightness and kindness than
of those legal shadows, which in themselves were of no moment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The judgment of
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judge</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
This could not have been extended indiscriminately to the whole people; but by
these words the Prophet indirectly reproved the judges, because they committed
plunder, either through favor or hatred, so that they decided cases not in a
just and equitable manner. We then learn from the Prophet&#8217;s words, that
judgments were then given corruptly, so that the judge either decided in favor
of a friend, or was bought by a price or a reward. As then there was no truth in
the judgments given, but false pretences and colourings, the Prophet here
exhorts them to execute </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
judgment of truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, true judgment, when
no respect of persons is shown, and when neither hatred nor favor prevails, but
equity alone is regarded.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then addresses the whole people in common, and
says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Show</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
or exercise, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>kindness and
mercies</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm66</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
every one towards his brother</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He not only bids
them to abstain from doing any wrong, but exhorts them to show kindness; for it
would not be enough to do no harm to any one, except each of us were also
solicitous to assist our neighbors; inasmuch as it is the dictate of benevolence
to help the miserable when necessity so requires. But we must recollect that a
part is given twice for the whole in what the Prophet says: in the first place,
he refers only to the second Table of the law, while he includes in general the
rule by which our life is to be formed; and in the second place, he enumerates
not every thing contained in the second Table, but mentions only some things as
instances. It is however certain, that his design was to show that men are
greatly deceived when they seek to discharge their duties towards God by means
of external rites and ceremonies; and farther, that it is a true and substantial
evidence of piety, when and one observes what is just and equitable towards his
neighbor. He afterwards adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He mentions here some other duties, but for the same
purpose of showing, that the fear of God is not proved by ceremonies, but by
acting justly towards our brethren, and not by abstaining only from doing wrong,
but by being ready to help the miserable. As widows, and orphans, and strangers
are exposed as it were to plunder, Moses often in the law recommends them to
favor, and shows that God cares for them, and will be their defender, when by
one injured. So also the Prophet speaks here expressly of widows, and orphans,
and strangers, that the Jews might understand, not only that they were to take
heed, lest any one, being wronged, should complain, or lest any one should
retaliate an injury, but that they were to observe integrity before God; for the
ungodly are often terrified by fear, and refrain from doing mischief, because
they know that there will be an avenger. Hence it comes that the rich and the
opulent are safe from all injuries, because they are surrounded and fortified by
strong defences; but the widows and the orphans are not thus able to repel
wrongs. This is the reason why the Prophet prefers here to mention widows, and
orphans, and strangers, rather than to speak indiscriminately of all the people.
For the import of the whole is, as I have reminded you, that the fear of God is
not really proved, except when a person cleaves to what is just and right, and
is not restrained by fear or shame, but discharges his duty as it were in the
presence of God and of his angels, so that he shows favor to the poor and
miserable, who are without any to help them. But as I have elsewhere explained
this subject more at large, it is enough now briefly to touch on it.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here by referring to the fathers more
sharply reproves the Jews of his age; for he saw that they differed but little
from their fathers. The sum of what he says is, that the Jews in all ages dealt
unfaithfully and perversely with God; for how much soever they boasted of their
care and zeal for religion they yet sought to satisfy God only by vain trifles.
This then was the Prophet&#8217;s object. For it is certain that there ever had
been some pretense to religion in that nation but it was mere dissimulation for
they were in the mean time intent on their ceremonies and when God seriously
remonstrated with them their obstinacy and perverseness before concealed
instantly appeared.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore says that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>refused to
hear</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He does not now accuse the dead except
for this purpose to teach the people of his acre. He saw that they were
solicitous about fasting at appointed seasons, while at the same time they
regarded almost as nothing the main requirements of the law, even mercy, and
justice, and uprightness. These are indeed the three things, which Christ
mentions.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402323&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
23:23.) He then intimates that this doctrine was not new, and that their fathers
had been sufficiently warned and instructed, but that they wilfully, and as it
were designedly rebelled against God. In short, he pulls off their mask of
ignorance; for as men for the most part seek to extenuate their sins by the
plea, that they had not been clearly or seasonably taught, the Prophet declares
that there was not any excuse of this kind, because they had been refractory and
untameable, they had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>refused to
hear</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To set forth more fully this perverseness, he
afterwards says, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shoulder of withdrawing
</i></font><font face="Palatino">had been presented by them. The Hebrews say
that men serve with the shoulder, when they are submissive, and tractable, and
willingly undergo the burden laid on them, according to what we have seen in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;360301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zephaniah
3:1. The Prophet now, on the contrary, says that the Jews had a refractory
shoulder, as they refused to bear the yoke, but shook off every fear of God. The
reason for the metaphor is this &#8212; that as burdens are carried on the
shoulder, so the Lord lays the law on our shoulders, that the flesh may not
lasciviate at pleasure, but be kept under restraint. He hence says, that they
had presented a rebellious shoulder. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">trrs</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sarret</i>, is properly rendered declining; but some render it perverse, and
others contumacious: since the meaning is the same, I contend not about the
word. It is enough to know that the contumacy of the Jews is what is here
condemned; for they had been wholly unteachable, and had refused to submit to
God and to his word. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm68</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards mentions their ears,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They made heavy their ears, lest
they should hear</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In short, the Prophet sought
by all means to prove the Jews guilty, that they might not adduce anything to
extenuate their sin: for they had in every way, with the most determined
wickedness, refused to obey God, when his teaching was sufficiently clear and
intelligible.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then comes to the heart,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
made</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their heart
adamant</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or the very hardest stone. Some render
it steel, and others flint. It means sometimes a thorn; but in this place, as in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;260309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
3:9, and in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;241701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
17:1, it is to be taken for adamant, or the hardest stone. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm69</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We now
see that the Prophet&#8217;s object was to show that the Jews had no excuse, as
if they had fallen away through error or ignorance, but had ever wilfully and
perversely rejected sound doctrine. The Prophet then teaches us that hypocrisy
had been the sole hindrance to prevent them from understanding and following
what was right.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be useful to notice the manner of speaking
which the Prophet adopts in condemning the perverseness of the Jews, when he
says, that they had refused attention to God. For we ought here to observe the
connection between the fear of God and obedience, and on the other hand, between
the contempt of the law and wilful rebellion. If then we would not be condemned
for contumacy before God, attention must in the first place be given to his
word, and afterwards the shoulders must be put under, so that we may bear
submissively the yoke laid on us; and thirdly, we must listen with the ears, so
that the word of God, preached to us, may not be lost, but strike in us deep
roots; and lastly, our hearts must be turned to obedience, and all hardness
corrected or softened. Then Zechariah adds, that the Jews had a stonily or an
iron heart, so that they repudiated the law of God and all his Prophets. He
gives the first place to the law, for they ought to have sought from it the
whole doctrine of religion; and the Prophets, as it has been often stated, were
only interpreters of the law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards mentions the words which had been sent
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by Jehovah through his Spirit and
through his Prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm70</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By
saying that God spoke by his Prophets, he meets an objection by which hypocrites
are wont to cover themselves, when they reject the truth. For they object and
say, that they would be willingly submissive to God, but that they cannot bear
the authority of men, as though God&#8217;s word changed its nature by coming
through the mouth of man. But as hypocrites and profane men are wont to lessen
the authority of the word, the Prophet here shows, having this pretext in view,
that God designed to be heard, though he employed ministers. Hence by this kind
of concession it is implied, that Prophets are middle persons, and yet that God
so speaks by their mouth, that contempt is offered to him when no due honor is
shown to the truth. And further, lest the baseness of men should withhold regard
from the word, he mentions also the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
as though he had said, that God had spoken not only by his servants, even mortal
men, but also by his Spirit. There is then no reason for hypocrites deceitfully
to excuse themselves, by saying, that they rebel not against God, when they
depreciate his Prophets; for the power and majesty of the Holy Spirit appear and
shine forth in the doctrine itself, so that the condition of men takes nothing
away from its authority. This part was also added in order to condemn the Jews,
because they had from the very beginning been seasonably warned, and it was only
their own fault that they did not repent. For if the Lord had allowed them for a
long time to go astray, there would have been some pretense for their evasions:
but since God had tried to recall them to the right way, and Prophets, one after
another, had been continually sent to them, their unfaithfulness, yea their iron
perverseness, in obstinately refusing to obey God, was more fully discovered.
This is the reason why Zechariah mentions here the former
Prophets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there was great wrath from
Jehovah of hosts</i></font><font face="Palatino">; by which sentence he reminded
them, that it was no matter of dispute, as in case of a doubtful thing, whether
their fathers had been wicked and disobedient to God; for he had sufficiently
proved be punishments that he abominated their conduct; for this principle is to
be held true that God does not deal unjustly with men when he chastises them,
but that the demerit of crimes is to be estimated by the punishment which he
inflicts. As then God had so severely chastised the ancient people, the natural
conclusion is, that their wickedness had become intolerable. We now then see why
the Prophet said that there had been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>great wrath from
</i></font><font face="Palatino">God; the reason was, that the Jews might not
think that he had been lightly offended, as he had not been satisfied with a
moderate punishment; for since his wrath had been so great, and since he had in
so dreadful a manner punished the sins of the people, it follows, that their
wickedness had been more grievous than what men considered it to have
been.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is also here an implied comparison; for the
unfaithfulness of those who then lived was the worse, for this reason &#8212;
because they took no warning from the calamities of their fathers, so as to deal
with more sincerity with God. They knew that their fathers had been carefully
and in various ways admonished; they knew that exile followed, which was an
evidence of the dreadful vengeance of God. As then they were like their fathers,
and had not put off their perverse disposition, they proved themselves guilty of
greater and more refractory baseness, for they ought to have been influenced at
least by fear, when they saw that God&#8217;s judgment had been so dreadful
against obstinate men. It afterwards follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet sets forth more fully the dreadfulness of
this punishment &#8212; that they in vain groaned and complained, for God was
deaf to their complaints and cryings. When God in some measure fulminates and
becomes soon reconciled, he does not seem to be greatly incensed, but when the
miserable whom he afflicts by his hand, avail nothing by their entreaties and
prayers, it then appears evident that God is in no common degree offended. This
then is what the Prophet meant by saying, that they were not
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heard</i></font><font face="Palatino">
by God when they cried.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must notice what is said of their
perverseness; for he says, that God had called, and that he was not heard by
them. Now it cannot be deemed an unjust reward, that God should punish the
contempt of his word; for how great is the honor by which he favors miserable
wretches, when he invites them to himself, and most expressly invites them?
When, therefore, the calling of God is thus rejected and despised, do not they
who are so refractory deserve what the Prophet declares here &#8212; that they
would have to cry in vain, as God would be deaf to their
groanings?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the words, the change of person may embarrass
the unlettered, but it is a mode of speaking common to the Prophets, for they
assume the person of God in order to gain more authority to their doctrine; and
they spoke sometimes in the third and sometimes in the first person: when in the
first God himself speaks, and when in the third it is in the character of
ministers, who declare and deliver, as it were from hand to hand, what had been
committed to them by God. Hence the Prophet in the first clause speaks as
God&#8217;s minister; he afterwards assumes his person, as though he were God
himself. But this, as it has been said, was done with regard to the word
delivered. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It was, that as he
called and they heard not</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. Who called? It
is not right to apply this, as some do, to the Prophet; he, therefore, charges
here the Jews, no doubt, with the sin of turning a deaf ear to God&#8217;s word.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall call, and I
will not hear</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It might have been said,
&#8220;so they shall call, and the Lord will not hear.&#8221; There is in the
meaning, as we see, nothing obscure or ambiguous. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm71</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The import of the whole then is, that God had not
threatened in vain by his ancient Prophets; but that as he had denounced
vengeance by the mouth of Isaiah, so it had been executed on the Jews, for they
had without effect cried, and found God a severe judge, whose voice they had
previously despised. We indeed know, that it is a truth often repeated, that the
ungodly are not heard by God; nay, that their prayers are abominable; for they
profane God&#8217;s name by an impure heart and mouth whenever they flee to him,
as they approach him without faith and repentance. We then learn from these
words, that those who perversely despise God&#8217;s word deservedly rot in
their own calamities; for it is by no means right or reasonable that the Lord
should be ready to hear the crying of those who turn a deaf ear to his voice. It
follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet concludes what he had been speaking
of God&#8217;s vengeance, by which he had fully proved, that the sins of that
nation had arrived to such a pitch, that there was no room for pardon. Hence he
says, that they had been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dispersed</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
for so I prefer to render the word, and the context seems to require this.
Interpreters vary as to its meaning; and, indeed, the Hebrews themselves say,
that this is a difficult passage, for, according to the rules of grammar, the
word can hardly be made suitable to the context. But let us first see what the
Prophet treats of; and secondly, what meaning, as the word signifies various
things, is the most suitable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet no doubt refers here to God&#8217;s
vengeance, as evidenced by the dispersion of the Jews among many nations, not
only when they were driven into exile, but also when scattered in various parts
of the world. The verb, taken transitively, is by no means doubtful in its
meaning, for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r[s</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sor</i>, means to move one from a place, or to expel, and that by force,
inasmuch as it is derived from whirlwind. As it may therefore be here a
transitive verb, I see no reason why we should seek other meanings at variance
with the design and object of the Prophet. He then says, that the Jews had been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dispersed</i></font><font face="Palatino">
&#8212; how? </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>among all
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, through all parts of the
world; and then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>among unknown
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Now we know, that the farther the
exile, the more severe it is, for neighbors for the most part are the most
humane; and when one is removed far to a barbarous nation, he would rather a
hundred times to die on his journey than to live at a great distance from his
country, and among a people of new and strange habits. The meaning is, that the
Jews had been severely visited by God, not only because they had departed from
his true worship and holy fear, but because they had been perverse, had rejected
all sound doctrine, and had been deaf and indifferent to all admonitions. It was
then for this reason that they had been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dispersed among all
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the land after them became
desolate </i></font><font face="Palatino">that no one passed through it. This
circumstance also, that God devoted the land to desolation, proved more fully
his wrath: for when God imprints marks of his vengeance on the land, and on
other harmless things, necessary for man&#8217;s support, it becomes evident
that he is not lightly displeased with men. He then intimates, that God was not
satisfied with the exile and dispersion of that people, but that he intended
that there should be also visible marks of their wickedness in the sterility and
desolation of the land itself: and that land, we know, was very fruitful, both
by nature and by God&#8217;s blessing; for he had promised to give to the
Israelites a land flowing with milk and honey. When this fruitfulness was turned
to sterility, such a change ought to have roused the minds of all to consider
the dreadful judgment of God. We now then see why the Prophet says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the land after
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, after their departure,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>became
desolate</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for they had polluted the land so far
as to constrain it, though innocent, to bear the judgment of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says further, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the desirable land became a
waste</i></font><font face="Palatino">, even through their fault. God was indeed
the author of that waste, but Zechariah imputes this calamity to the people,
because they had provoked God&#8217;s wrath, and procured this evil for
themselves; yea, they had involved the land itself as it were in the same guilt,
for it was cursed by God, though they had been driven hence to another country.
Desirable land was a name often given to Judea, not only on account of its
fruitfulness, and the abundance of its produce, but because God had chosen it
for himself: for though that land excelled other lands in many respects, it is
yet certain that its chief excellency consisted in this, &#8212; that God
honored it with peculiar favor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Zechariah then condemns the Jews, not only because
they had by their own fault extinguished the favor as to the produce of the
land, but because they had corrupted the land itself, which had been so
singularly favored as to have become the habitation of God. And hence we more
fully learn how great was the enormity of their sins, which caused God to devote
to desolation a land chosen by himself; for, as we have said, it was no common
honor for that land, in which God designed to be worshipped by his chosen and
holy people, to have been destined by him to be made like Paradise. But when
such an honor was turned to shame and perpetual reproach, it was clearly a
remarkable sign of God&#8217;s wrath: and hence also becomes evident the impiety
of that people who, as it had been said, turned aside God&#8217;s favor from the
land, that not only it did not bring forth its usual produce, but that it also
became, as it were, a disgraceful spectacle, and filled all with horror on
seeing it so desolate, where was previously seen the temple and the worship of
God.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">SOME think that at the beginning of this chapter the
people are reproved for their unfaithfulness, because they conducted themselves
towards God in a way they ought not to have done, as they had violated that
sacred marriage which God had been pleased to contract with them; for it is a
common mode of speaking for God to compare himself to jealous husbands, when he
sees his Church dealing with him unfaithfully. But this meaning is inadmissible:
for the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">anq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kona</i>, connected as it is here, is to be taken in a good sense, as
signifying concern or affection, inasmuch as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lamed</i>, means, &#8220;on account of,&#8221; or &#8220;for;&#8221; and we
have in the first chapter a similar sentence;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;380101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
1:1 and it is evident that in many other places the meaning is no other, but
that God burned with wrath against all the enemies of his Church, as he regarded
his Church with singular love. Emulation then here does not mean jealousy, but
is to be taken in a different sense, as signifying that concern which God had
for the protection of his Church. The whole then of this chapter proves that God
would be the defender of his people, and that such was his care for the safety
of all the godly, that he resolved to oppose the whole world, if necessary, for
their protection. This is the sum of the whole.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the word of Jehovah came to

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm73</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
was indeed an incredible change, for God had for a time restrained himself,
while the ungodly at their pleasure harassed the Church, so that they thought
that they could do so with impunity. As God then had for some time remained at
rest, what the Prophet says here could not have been easily believed, that is,
that God would, through a sudden jealousy, undertake the cause of the Church.
Hence the indignation, immediately subjoined, must be regarded with reference to
enemies, as though he had said, that all the ungodly would now perceive what
they had by no means expected, &#8212; that God was the protector of Jerusalem.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now more clearly explains what he
intended; but it was necessary to preserve this order &#8212; that enemies were
to be by force ejected from their possession, and the Church delivered, before
God could dwell in the midst of it; for how could God have proved that Jerusalem
was under his guardianship and protection without having first subdued its
enemies? It was not then without reason that the Prophet commenced with this
promise &#8212; that God was prepared for war, and was burning with wrath, that
he might deliver his Church from the hands of enemies. Then follows the fruit of
the victory; for it would not have been enough for God to avenge the wrongs done
to his chosen people, without gathering the dispersed and restoring the Church
to its ancient condition. For it often happens that those who have been cruelly
treated find an avenger; but no comfort, or very little comfort, comes to them,
as they are made nothing better; but the Lord here refers to these two things
&#8212; that he would take up arms to defend his chosen people, and also that he
would become, as the case was, the defender and protector of the holy
city.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The repetition of the sentence,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith Jehovah of
hosts</i></font><font face="Palatino">, almost in every verse, was no doubt
intended for the purpose of strengthening their faith; for it was, as I have
already said a thing incredible. It was then necessary to bring forward often
the name of God, that the faithful might more readily give assent to the
prophecy which they knew proceeded from God, even the God of hosts, whose power
is infinite, and to whom nothing is difficult, as we shall find it presently
stated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says that he had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>returned</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
not that the accomplishment of this prophecy was then visible, but the decree is
put for the reality. God had been, as it were, for a long time silent, while his
people were exposed as a sport to their enemies; and he seemed then to be far
away from Jerusalem, for the place was desolate and waste, yea, it was a scene
of dreadful vengeance. God, then, during the whole of that time, seemed to have
forsaken the place, according to the testimony of Ezekiel, who says, that God
had removed from the temple, and that it was an empty place, and as it were
profane. On this account he says now that he had returned; for he intended
openly to show that it had not in vain been made the seat of his glory, when he
had commanded his name to be there invoked. It is indeed true that mount Sion
had never been forsaken by God; but no other opinion could have been formed,
when there were there no altar, no sacrifices, and no people to worship God; for
this is said with reference to divine worship; and the holiness of the mount was
also nothing, except as far as God had consecrated it to himself. Hence these
two things were connected &#8212; the holiness of the mount and the presence of
God. It therefore follows that God, according to the judgment of men, was
absent, when no religion appeared there, and the Jews offered there no
sacrifices.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He further says, that he had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>returned, that he might dwell in
the midst of Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm74</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It was
necessary to add this, that the Jews might be convinced that his return was not
in vain; for many said that they foolishly made too much haste, and that though
the commencement had been favorable, yet many troubles would come upon them in
future, and that their building would be only for a short time, and that though
they spent much toil and labor in rebuilding the city, it would yet be only for
a season, as their enemies would shortly come and destroy their new edifices.
Since then reports of this kind were spreading, it was necessary to support the
minds of the godly, that they might be fully persuaded that God had returned to
his people, and had become the restorer of his exiles for this end &#8212; that
he might as before dwell at Jerusalem.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now apprehend the Prophet&#8217;s object; it was
as though he had said, that the people had not returned in vain to their
country, but that they had been delivered by the authority of God, and that his
dwelling at Jerusalem would be fixed and perpetual, as it had before been his
habitation. We indeed know that the stability of the Church is not otherwise
secured than by the presence of God, as it is said in Psalm 46:, &#8220;God is
in the midst of her, she shall not be moved;&#8221; for the Church would not be
less exposed to sudden and frequent destruction than other things, were it not
that God, her support, dwells in her. And this is what our Prophet means here
when he says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God would
dwell </i></font><font face="Palatino">there.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And called shall be Jerusalem the
city of truth, and the mount of Jehovah the mount of
holiness</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm75</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By the
first clause the Prophet reminds us why God had for a time forsaken Jerusalem,
even because it was a city given to falsehoods, wicked devices, deceits, and
perverse counsels. As then the Jews had wholly degenerated from true religion,
the Prophet intimates that the city became destitute of its guardian and
protector, even of God himself. And for the same purpose are added the words,
the mount of Jehovah shall be called the mount of holiness. For however proudly
the Jews boasted that they worshipped God, they yet had profaned both the temple
and the altar by their sins, as we have seen it proved by the Prophet Haggai.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;370215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Haggai
2:15.) Here then Zechariah indirectly reproves the Jews for having corrupted all
purity by their frauds, and also for having, by the defilements of their sins,
polluted Sion and the temple of God. At the same time he teaches us that God
dwells in his Church where he sanctifies it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence God is never idle while he dwells in his
people; for he cleanses away every kind of impurity, every kind of deceit, that
where he dwells may ever be a holy place. Therefore the Prophet not only
promises here an external blessing to the Jews, but also shows that God performs
what is far more excellent &#8212; that he cleanses the place where he intends
to dwell, and the habitation which he chooses, and casts out every kind of
filth. And since God promises to do this, we hence see that it is his own
peculiar work and gift to cleanse all our impurities, and also to dissipate
everything false and deceitful. The import of the whole is, that when God
reconciles his people to himself, he not only brings an outward blessing of an
earthly kind, but also something better and far more excellent, even the renewal
of the heart and mind, and that when all things are polluted and filthy, he
restores true and perfect cleanness and integrity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must further bear also in mind what I have already
stated &#8212; that their sins are here intimated to the Jews, that they might
be touched with shame, and seek repentance; for we have seen that they were very
slow and tardy in this respect. It was then necessary to stimulate them that
they might repent. For what the Prophet says clearly intimates that mount Sion
had been profaned, though God had consecrated it to himself; for God&#8217;s
worship had been there vitiated, and there was there no integrity; and that the
faithful city, such at least as it ought to have been, had become full of
falsehood and treachery; for truth is not to be confined to that fidelity which
men ought to observe one towards another, but is to be extended to that
sincerity which the faithful ought to possess as to the pure and sincere worship
of God. This is the sum of the whole. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

when we have peace with the whole world, we may yet disturb one another, except
the God of peace restrains us; inasmuch as mutual and intestine discord may
harass us, though we may be spared by external enemies. It is then necessary in
the first place, that the God of peace and salvation should dwell in the midst
of us. But when we have the presence of God, then comes full security. Suitably
then does the Prophet now say, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yet dwell
</i></font><font face="Palatino">would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>old men and old women the midst
of Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">: for since the time the Jews had
returned, they had been harassed, we know, by continual wars; and it could
hardly be expected that they could live long in a state of incessant troubles,
while new fears were daily disturbing them. Since then they were thus in
incessant and endless dangers, the Prophet gives them relief, and promises that
there would be to them yet a quiet habitation, so that both men and women would
live to extreme old age. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall yet
dwell</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a staff shall be to man for his
age</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or on account of multitude of days. This
seems indeed to have been said with no great propriety; for it would have been
much better had vigor been given them, so that men failed not through old age.
Hence the weakness mentioned here seems to have been a sign of God&#8217;s curse
rather than of his favor; and on this account the Lord promises by Isaiah, that
old men would be vigorous and strong,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;236520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
65:20;) so that they felt not the disadvantage of age. But the design of
Zechariah, as we have already reminded you, was here different; for many by
their daily complaints depressed the minds of the godly, declaring that they
were deceived, and saying that Jerusalem would not long stand, as they were
surrounded by so many enemies. Hence Zechariah shows, that the Jews would be in
no danger of falling by the hand of enemies, as they would live securely without
any external disturbances; for we know that many old men, half alive through age
and supporting themselves by a staff, cannot be anywhere seen, except in a state
of peace and quietness, undisturbed by enemies. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm76</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the design of the Prophet, which
was to show, that Jerusalem would be tranquil and in peace, and that this would
be the fruit of God&#8217;s presence; for its citizens would die through years,
and not through the violence of eternal enemies. To the same purpose is what
follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He repeats and confirms the same thing by another
representation &#8212; that boys and girls would play in the streets and on the
public roads, which could not be during the troublous time of war; for when arms
clatter, the sound of trumpets is heard, and assaults of enemies are dreaded,
every one keeps his children at home, and in public there is sad confusion, and
few are found abroad; in short there is no cheerfulness even in children when
fear is hanging over them. We hence see, that what is here promised is a state
of quietness to Jerusalem; for God would keep off the onsets of enemies &#8212;
not that Jerusalem was ever exempt from all evils, but that God&#8217;s defense
was so effectual as to render them safe amidst many and various
dangers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is not needful here anxiously to raise the
questions &#8212; Whether it is lawful to play during times of peace? for the
Prophet here took his language from the common habits of men, and even from the
very nature of things; for we know that men give way to cheerfulness when no
fear lays hold on their minds, and that play and sport are allowed to children.
The Prophet meant only this, that though the Jews might then have something to
do with various enemies, they would yet be in a state of peace and safety. He
afterwards adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He sharply reproves here the lack of faith in the
people; for as men are wont to measure whatever is promised by their own
understanding, the door of entrance for these prophecies was nearly closed up
when they saw that the fury of their enemies could by no means be pacified. They
had indeed tried in various ways to check them, or at least to conciliate them;
and we know that many edicts had been proclaimed in favor of the Jews by the
kings of Persia; but such was the common hatred to them, that new enemies arose
continually. On this account it is that the Prophet now blames their want of
faith; and he points out, as by the finger, the source of their unbelief when he
says, that they had no faith in God who spoke to them, because he promised more
then what they could conceive to be possible. And this deserves notice, for if
we wish to pull up unbelief by the roots from our hearts, we must begin at this
point &#8212; to raise up our thoughts above the world; yea, to bid adieu to our
own judgment, and simply to embrace what God promises; for his power ought to
carry us up to such a height that we may entertain no doubt but that what seems
to us impossible will surely be accomplished. What the Prophet calls
&#8220;wonderful&#8221; is the same as impossible; for men often wonder at
God&#8217;s worlds without believing them, and even under the false pretense of
wonder deny his power. Hence when God promises anything, doubts immediately
creep in &#8212; &#8220;Can this be done?&#8221; If a reason does not appear, as
the thing surpasses our comprehension, we instantly conclude that it cannot be.
We thus see how men pretending to wonder at God&#8217;s power entirely
obliterate it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When therefore the Prophet now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If this be wonderful in your
eyes, shall it be so in mine?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> it is the same as
though he had said, &#8220;If you reject what I promise to you, because it is
not in accordance with your judgment, is it right that my power should be
confined to what you can comprehend?&#8221; We hence see that nothing is more
preposterous than to seek to measure God&#8217;s power by our own understanding.
But he seems to say at the same time, that it is useful for us to raise upwards
our minds, and to be so filled with wonder, while contemplating God&#8217;s
infinite power, that nothing afterwards may appear wonderful to us. We now
perceive how it behaves us to wonder at God&#8217;s works, and yet not to regard
anything wonderful in them. There is no work of God so minute, but that it
contains something wonderful, when it is considered as it ought to be; but yet
when raised up by faith we apprehend the infinite power of God, which seems
incredible to the understanding of the flesh, we look down as it were on the
things below; for our faith ascends far above this world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see the true source of unbelief and also of
faith. The source of unbelief is this &#8212; when men confine God&#8217;s power
to their own understanding; and the source of faith is &#8212; when they ascribe
to God the praise due to his infinite power, when they regard not what is easy,
but being satisfied with his word alone they are fully persuaded that God is
true, and that what he promises is certain, because he is able to fulfill it. So
Paul teaches us, who says, that Abraham&#8217;s faith was founded on this
assurance &#8212; that he doubted not but that he who had spoken was able really
to accomplish his word.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450420&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:20.) Hence, that the promises of God may penetrate into our hearts and there
strike deep roots, we must bid adieu to our own judgment; for while we are wise
in ourselves and rely on earthly means, the power of God vanishes as it were
from our sight, and his truth also at the same time disappears. In a word, we
must regard, not what is probable, not what nature brings, not what is usual,
but what God can do, what his infinite power can effect. We ought then to emerge
from the confined compass of our flesh, and by faith, as we have said, ascend
above the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the eyes of the remnant of
this people</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. By this sentence he seems to
touch the Jews to the quick, who had already in a measure experienced the power
of God in their restoration; for thirty years before their freedom had been
given them by Cyrus and Darius, they regarded as a fable what God had promised
them; they said that they were in a grave from which no exit could have been
expected: they had experienced how great and incredible was God&#8217;s power;
and yet as people astonished, they despaired of their future safety. This
ingratitude then is what Zechariah now indirectly reproves by calling them the
remnant of his people. They were a small number, they had not raised their
banner to go forth against the will of their enemies; but a way had been
suddenly opened to them beyond all expectation. Since then they had been taught
by experience to know that God was able to do more than they could have
imagined, the Prophet here justly condemns them for having formed so unworthy an
idea of that power of God which had been found by experience to have been more
than sufficient. He afterwards adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He pursues the same subject, and introduces a
preface, very necessary in so confused a state of things; for it was very
difficult to raise up desponding minds and to inspire them with confidence, when
pressed down with fear and trembling. This is the reason why Zechariah repeats
so often, that he declared nothing but God&#8217;s commands
only.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
save</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or deliver
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>my
people</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As dispersion took away hope, the
Prophet restores it, and says, that it would not be difficult to gather the
people from all parts of the world, when God stretched forth his hand; and
emphatical is the expression, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will deliver my people</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God then does here
exalt himself, that we may learn to exalt his power, and not to judge of it
according to our own comprehension.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will deliver my
people</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the rising as well as from
the setting of the sun</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This sentence then is
connected with the preceding, in which the Prophet briefly shows that the Jews
erred and acted perversely, when they ascribed no more to God than what the
judgment of their own flesh dictated, or what seemed probable according to the
course of nature. As then he had taught them that great wrong is done to God
except he is separated from men, and shines eminent above the whole world, he
now adds, that God, with whom nothing is wonderful or difficult, had resolved to
gather his people, and from their dispersion to restore them again to Jerusalem.
The Prophet then says here nothing new, but rightly applies what he had just
said of God&#8217;s infinite and incomprehensible power, which men absurdly
attempt to inclose in their own brains, and to attach to earthly
instrumentalities.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will restore them, and they
shall dwell, he says, in the midst of
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He again confirms what I have
already stated, &#8212; that their return would not be in vain, though many
said, that the Jews had done foolishly in having returned so quickly into their
own country; and they condemned their determination, as though they had been
suddenly carried away by extreme ardor. Hence the Prophet, in order to show that
God had dealt faithfully with his people, promises them here a safe and a
perpetual habitation at Jerusalem.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall
dwell</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says; that is, &#8220;As you now see
that you have been gathered, so expect that God will be your protector, so as to
render you safe, and to make Jerusalem to be again inhabited, as it had been
formerly.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall be to me for a people,
and I shall be to them for a God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By these
words the Prophet confirms what he has hitherto taught, when he now speaks of
the renewal of the covenant; for the whole hope of the people depended on this
one thing, &#8212; that God remembered the covenant which he had made with them.
This covenant had indeed been broken, according to the usual language of
Scripture; for the people, when removed into exile, thought that they were cast
away and forsaken by God. As then the memory of this covenant had been buried as
to the effect, or as they say, apparently, the Prophet, in order to confirm what
he has already said, expressly declares, that they would be God&#8217;s people,
and that he would be their God. We now then understand why he adds, &#8220;I
will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people&#8221;.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the last place he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in truths and
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, &#8220;settled and
permanent shall be this felicity&#8221;: for when God shows that he cares for
his people, then follow outward blessings, which are evidences of his favor. The
Prophet adds, that this shall be in truth and righteousness; for God will not be
propitious and kind to his people only for a short time, but will continue his
favor to them to the end. As then God intended to establish the safety of the
city, he testifies that he would be its God in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
even in sincerity, in good faith, and without dissimulation, and also without
any danger of changing.

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet having taught us that God was reconciled
to his people, does now seasonably exhort the Jews to prepare themselves for
work and strenuously to exert themselves in erecting the temple, and also in
building the city: for as we have stated, many were then become slothful, as
they thought that they were soon to be destroyed by their enemies, and that what
they built with great labor, toil, and expense, would be presently demolished.
Hence it was that sloth had crept in, so that many had left off the building
both of the temple and of the city: and we have also seen elsewhere, that they
were too intent on building their own houses, and at the same time neglected the
temple; for each looked to his own private advantage, and also to his own
pleasures. The Prophet Haggai sharply reproved this indifference,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;370104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Haggai
1:4;) and the Lord clearly showed that he had punished this their sloth; for
they preferred their own houses to the temple, and through want of faith
trembled, as though their restoration was a mockery. As then the people by their
ingratitude had almost wiped away the recollection of their deliverance, the
Prophet Haggai severely reproved them; and Zechariah now touches on the same
subject.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he says, that before they had begun the work of
building the temple, the land was sterile, as though it was cursed by God, and
that they were deprived of their hope, and that whatever they attempted proved
useless; but that after they had begun, through the encouragement given them by
the Prophets, to take courage to build the temple, things changed for the
better, and that openly, so that it was easy to conclude, that God had been
previously displeased with them, but that now he was favorable, as all things
went on prosperously. This change then was a clear token both of God&#8217;s
displeasure and of God&#8217;s favor; for he had justly chastised his people as
long as they were under the influence of unbelief, so as not to proceed with the
work of building the temple; and afterwards the favor of God had begun to shine
on them, as God gave them abundance of provisions, and proved in various ways
that he was now favorable to them. Zechariah therefore mentions these things,
that they might proceed more cheerfully with their work, and not provoke
God&#8217;s wrath, which they had previously found to have been so much to their
loss, and that they might seek to enjoy his blessing, which was now so manifest
before their eyes. This is the import of the whole.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Strengthened let be your
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He exhorts them to perseverance: but as
men become weak, and many things occur which enfeeble or break down their
courage, he uses the word, strengthen; for it is often necessary to gather new
strength, and to confirm a pious resolution. Let us now then learn to apply this
doctrine to our own benefit, and let us understand what experience sufficiently
teaches us, even this &#8212; that our hands, though at first well prepared, are
yet soon relaxed, and as it were loosed, and even entirely fail, unless new
strength be now and then attained; and that this is effected when we are
animated by God&#8217;s word, and rise superior to the trials which enfeeble us.
And Zechariah will presently inform us whence this strength was to be sought,
even from the promises which they had already heard from the Prophets; for he
would have in vain exhorted them to persevere, had not the ground of confidence
been mentioned. For when God is silent, our minds, though before abundantly
ready and willing, must languish, and at length wholly fail.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We then see that there can be no courage in men,
unless God supports them by his word, so that they may recover their lost
strength and regain their alacrity. Had the Prophet only bidden them to take
courage, they might have replied, that there was nothing in their circumstances
to encourage them; but when the word of God was set before them, every excuse
was taken away; and they were now to gird up the loins, and boldly to fight,
inasmuch as God supplied them with weapons.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Be strong, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye who hear in these days these
words from the mouth of the Prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Though
Zechariah is not often concise in his words, but in many parts diffuse, yet he
is so here, and the whole verse is very emphatical; for after having said that
they were not destitute of God&#8217;s promises, he adds, &#8220;in these
days,&#8221; and also &#8220;these words.&#8221; He intimates that they were not
only taught a general truth, that they were to render obedience, but that God
himself would be their leader to direct their steps and to show them the way: in
a word, he omits nothing to enable them to proceed without difficulty with the
work which they had begun. There is then an emphasis intended by the
demonstrative, &#8220;these,&#8221; &#8220;these;&#8221; for the Prophet
intimates that God was continually speaking to them, and that he announced not
only a general truth, but specific words, by which they might guide their feet
and their hands in every action. And he says, that those words were heard from
the mouth of the Prophets, for God intended honor to be done to his servants;
and it is, as it has been often stated, a true test of faith, when God descends
not himself from heaven, or does not appear to us in a visible form, but makes
use of men as his ministers. Yet Zechariah briefly intimates, that the Prophets
are not the authors of the promises, which are necessary to raise up, support,
and stimulate our minds; for the Lord only employs their service; and this is
what he means by the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who were in that day in which was
founded the house of Jehovah, in order to build the
temple</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Not much time had elapsed since they
had begun again to build the temple, and the foundations had been laid; but the
work had been discontinued through the unbelief of them all, and also through
the private regard of each to his own interest. For as they were in suspense and
doubtful, there arose sloth and indifference, and avarice possessed them, so
that they despised the temple of God. But he says now that during that short
time God often spoke to them by his Prophets with the view of correcting their
delay and tardiness, for the Prophet mentions here as it were but one day, for
the purpose of expressing how short the time had been. Less excusable then was
their sloth, since God daily spoke to them and confirmed by new Prophets what
the former ones had said. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm78</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For before these days there was
no hire for man, and no hire for beast, no peace to passengers, because I had
sent forth all men, each one against his
friend</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet mentions here, as I have
already said, evidences of God&#8217;s curse, by which the Jews might have
learnt that he was displeased with their neglect in disregarding the building of
the temple, for while omitting that they paid attention to their domestic
affairs. He therefore reminds them of what might have made them to fear, lest
they should go on still to provoke God; for they had been taught, to their great
loss, not to excite in this manner his displeasure: and Zechariah, no doubt, as
well as Haggai and Malachi, had often addressed the people on this subject; for
we see how prone is the disposition of us all to relapse into forgetfulness when
God in any measure relaxes in his discipline. We presently shake off every fear
when exempt from evils. This is the reason why it is needful for us to be often
reminded of those judgments of God which we have experienced, according to what
is done here by Zechariah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before these
days</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there was no hire for man, and no
hire for beast</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, there was no profit
from the labor of men or of beasts. He takes it as granted, that men were not
tardy in their work, and that beasts performed their labors, but that no fruit
appeared. And whence was it the labor of men and of beasts was unprofitable,
except from God&#8217;s curse, as the law testifies?
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;052808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
28:8.) For when the Prophets speak of God&#8217;s curse they refer to the law,
and only apply to their present purpose what is stated generally in the law. As
then God declares in the law that he will bless the work of the hands, Zechariah
draws this inference that God was displeased when men and beasts toiled
laboriously without any advantage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There was no
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">. When men labor in vain, thirst and want
of all things must follow; for though the labor of man, we know, is of itself of
no value, yet when blessed by God it is the means of promoting fertility, so
that the earth may supply us with food. On the other hand, when the labor of man
is barren, even the earth itself refuses to bring forth fruit. It was then no
light calamity when God visited the people with poverty and famine. But another
evil is added, no less dreadful and even more grievous that the land was so
harassed by enemies that no travelling was safe. Hence he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there was no peace to him who
went out or to him who came in</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, there
was no free or peaceable travelling, but they were exposed to pillage and
plunder. In a word, Zechariah teaches us here, that the Jews were under a curse
both within and without, for the land disappointed those who cultivated it, as
it yielded no fruit, and then they were exposed to hostile
assaults.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the words,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rxh
&#710;m</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>men etsar</i>, some render them, on
account of distress, &#8220;there was no peace on account of distress.&#8221;
But we may retain the proper meaning of the preposition
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mem</i>, &#8220;there was no peace from distress;&#8221; that is, there were
none safe from inconvenience and molestation. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm79</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The reason is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because God had sent forth all
men, each one against his neighbor</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet
designedly subjoined this, that the Jews might know that these evils could not
be ascribed to fortune, as though men did rise up thoughtlessly one against
another. Hence he reminds them that their quietness was disturbed by the just
and hidden judgment of God, for he can turn as he pleases the hearts of men; he
now inclines them to humanity or to mercy, and then he turns them to madness and
ferocity. That the Jews might know that they had to do with God, the Prophet
declares here that men had been sent forth, that they might mutually rage and
assault one another.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence they who use the word permit, not only take
away from what the Prophet means, but wholly pervert his doctrine and extinguish
its light altogether: for God does not say here that he was still when the Jews
ill-treated one another; but he meant to have this attributed to his judgment.
For when almost the whole world was hostile to a few men, and those related to
one another, they ought surely to have been united among themselves; for
necessity conciliates even the most alienated, and even pacifies those who have
been previously the most violent enemies. Since, then, the Jews were assailed by
foreign enemies, they ought to have been friends among themselves, or at least
to have been so softened as not to be so hostile towards one another. As then
they raged against their own bowels, so that no one spared his own friends, God
more fully shows by this circumstance that he was the author of these
confusions. And how God kindles the hearts of men to ferocity, and is yet free
from all blame, has been explained elsewhere. God indeed executes his righteous
judgments, when he sets men one against the other; and if we inquire into the
cause and the end, we shall find that men are in this way justly punished. As
then in God&#8217;s judgments there ever shines forth the highest equity, there
is no reason for men to try to implicate him in their own perdition, or to
devolve on him a part of the blame. God then justly excites the hearts of men
into madness, and yet men themselves bear the whole blame, though God draws them
here and there against their will, and makes use of them as his instruments; for
the hidden purpose of God does not excuse them, while nothing is less their
object than to obey his word, though they are guided by his hidden operation. We
know that no work pleases God, but when there is a willing obedience, which none
of the reprobate ever render; and we also know that all works are to be judged
according to the end designed. We must therefore consider what was the reason
that God thus set men against one another, and what end he had in view. But we
have elsewhere discussed this subject at large.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then now, in short, bear this in mind, that
the Jews mutually harassed and distressed one another, not by chance, but
because the Lord, who was their enemy and whose wrath they had provoked, had
sent them forth as enemies among themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But now, not according to former
days, shall I be to the remnant of this people, saith Jehovah of
hosts</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Zechariah now reminds them that things
had changed for the better, as it was evident that God was propitious to them.
And if the cause of this change be asked, the answer is, the building of the
temple. If nothing had been said by the Prophets, the Jews might have only
conjectured, but every doubt had been removed; for God had threatened then with
punishment which he afterwards inflicted, and then he exhorted them to
repentance, and said that he would be reconciled to them: when the Jews rightly
considered these things, they had no need of having recourse to conjectures. It
was indeed fully evident that God regarded them with favor, and that the fruits
of his favor were before their eyes; and they were thus encouraged to proceed
with the work of building the temple. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Zechariah promises the continuance of
God&#8217;s favor, which the Jews had now begun to taste. God then had in part
openly showed that he was a Father to the Jews, by dealing liberally with them:
but in order more fully to strengthen them in their perseverance, Zechariah says
that this favor would be continued.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says first, that there would be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the seed of
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some think that it is called the seed of
peace because the cultivation of the fields, while the assaults of enemies were
dreaded, was deserted; no one dared to bring out his oxen or his horses, and
then even when the husbandmen sowed their fields, it was not done as in seasons
of quietness and security. As then the fields, when badly cultivated in times of
war, do not produce a full crop, so they think that it is called the seed of
peace, when husbandmen are permitted to employ necessary labor, when they are
free from every fear, and devote securely their toils on the cultivation and the
sowing of their fields. Others explain the seed of peace to be this &#8212; that
it is so when neither storms, nor tempests, nor mildew, nor any other evils do
any harm to the corn and fruit. But as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;wl&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shelum</i>, means often in Hebrew prosperity, we may so take it here, that it
would be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the seed of
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, that the seed would be
prosperous; and this interpretation seems to me less strained.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It shall
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be the seed of
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, it shall prosper according to
your labor; what is sown shall produce its proper fruit. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm80</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is added an explanation &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The vine shall yield its fruit,
and the earth shall yield its increase, and the heaven shall yield its
dew</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We hence conclude that it was called the
seed of peace, because the husbandmen gained their object when the earth,
irrigated by the dew of heaven, was not sterile, and when the produce was
abundant, when there was plenty of corn and wine, and of other things. There is
then peace or prosperity as to the seed, when the corn grows according to our
wishes, and comes to maturity, and when heaven responds to the earth, and
withholds not its dew, as we have seen in another place. In short, God testifies
that the remnant of his people should abound in all good things, for the heaven
would not withhold from them its rain, nor the earth shut up its
bowels.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But God ever recalls his people to himself, that they
may depend on his blessing; for it would be a cold doctrine were we not
persuaded of this &#8212; that the earth is not otherwise fruitful than as God
gives it the power of generating and of bringing forth. We ought therefore ever
to regard the blessing of God, and to ask of him to supply us with food, and to
pray him every day, as we are taught, to give us our daily bread. But few do
this from the heart, and hardly one in a hundred so turns his thoughts to
God&#8217;s hand as firmly to believe that he daily receives from him his daily
food. We now understand what the Prophet means in these words. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">He goes on with the same subject, and in this verse
he states two contrary things, in order to render more clear what he teaches
here &#8212; that while God was angry the earth was barren, and all things went
on unhappily with the Jews; but that when God had begun to be reconciled, the
earth had as it were changed its nature, and brought forth plentifully, and that
they were in every way made blessed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As ye have been a
curse</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. Here again he mentions and reminds
them how miserable they were while they minded only their private interest, and
by neglecting the temple manifested their impiety and ingratitude; for what
ought they to have been more ready to do when they returned to their country
than to build the temple, and to offer there sacrifices to God, in order to avow
him as the author of their deliverance? But the temple was neglected; and the
Prophet concludes that they must have been extremely forgetful, if they did not
consider what their condition was as long as they had no care for the temple;
and he says that they had been a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>curse among the
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, that they were an example of
a curse, according to the threatening of the law. For it is a mode of speaking
frequent in Scripture, that the people were a curse; and the common formula of
cursing was &#8212; &#8220;Let the Lord curse thee as he does the Jews.&#8221;
Zechariah then says that the Jews had been a curse, that they had not only been
smitten by God&#8217;s hand, but that they had been given up to calamities, in
order that they might become to all detestable, and bear in a manner signs of
God&#8217;s wrath imprinted on them. Whoever then at that time looked on a Jew,
he might see that he had the appearance of bearing a curse. In short, Zechariah
means that the Jews had been punished in a manner not common or usual, but that
God had executed on them dreadful judgments, which made it evident to all that
he was grievously offended with them.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have been then a curse among
all nations</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm81</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So I will save you, as ye shall
be a blessing</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>save</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is introduced that God might more clearly set forth his favor, lest the Jews
should think that the change had been effected by fortuitous change; for we know
that men&#8217;s thoughts soon change, and they feign this or that cause that
they may obscure God&#8217;s providence. God then, before he promises that they
should be a blessing, says that he would save them. What it is to be a blessing
may be easily learnt from the opposite clause. They are then said to be a
blessing who bear evident tokens of God&#8217;s favor and kindness. So the
Prophet means, that when people wished to be prayed for, or when they wished
well to one another, this would be the common form of their requests &#8212;
&#8220;May God bless us as he blesses his chosen people: as the Jews are dear to
God, so may he favor us with the same or similar kindness.&#8221; Thus then we
see that the Jews were a curse, when exposed to extreme reproaches; and that
they became a blessing when God manifested towards them tokens of favor, and
showed in reality, or by the effect, that he was pacified towards
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, in the last place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fear ye not; strengthened be your
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He exhorts them to entertain hope, for
fear stands opposed to confidence; and fear, proceeding from unbelief, cannot be
otherwise dissipated but by God&#8217;s promises made to us, which chase away
all doubts. Rightly then does the Prophet teach us that the Jews had no reason
to fear, for he declares that God was propitious to them. We indeed know that
all fear cannot be wholly driven away from the hearts of men; for it would be
necessary to deprive us of every feeling before we could regard dangers without
fears. But though fear is natural to us, and occasions of fear ever occur to us,
yet the fear of unbelief may be dispelled by faith; and hence it is no wonder
that God condemns fear, when he promises salvation to his elect. But as I have
said, we ought to observe that there is here a contrast between condemnable fear
and that confidence which relies on God&#8217;s word. We must also add, that the
confidence of God&#8217;s children is never so complete that they are free from
all fear, even the fear of unbelief; but still we ought to struggle against it,
so as not to be hindered in the course of our calling. And this we learn more
fully from the end of the verse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Strengthened be your
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino">. But why does the Prophet forbid the Jews
to fear? even for this purpose, &#8212; that they might arouse themselves for
the work which the Lord had allotted to them, and not allow fear to retard them
or to prevent them to persevere.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive how the faithful become prepared
and ready to render service to God: sloth must first be shaken off &#8212; but
how? even by having fear removed. What is the remedy for healing fear? even to
recomb on the promises of God; for when our minds are composed, the hands and
the feet and all the members will be ready to do their office. Alacrity both of
mind and heart and of all the members follows, when fear is shaken off, and when
men begin so to rely on God&#8217;s word, as to know that his help is enough for
them against all dangers, and to dread nothing, being convinced that the Lord
will by his power remove all hindrances.</font><br></div>

indifference, and contend with all hindrances, and boldly repel all assaults

<div><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet confirms the truth in the preceding
verse, when he said that there would be a wholly different lot to the Jews, as
they would in every way be blessed. He shows the cause of the change; for God
would begin to favor them, who had been before displeased with them. We indeed
know that the Holy Spirit everywhere calls men before God&#8217;s tribunal, that
they may know that no adversity happens to them, except through their sins. So
also in this place Zechariah reminds us, that God had been angry with the Jews,
because they had provoked his wrath. But now a promise is added, that God had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>turned</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
not that he had changed his mind, but he meant to show that he was pacified. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm82</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We
indeed know that we are to judge of God&#8217;s love or hatred to us by outward
things; for when God treats us severely, manifest tokens of his wrath appear;
but when he deals kindly with us, then the fruit of reconciliation seems
evident. According to this view does he now say, that God was of another mind
than formerly towards the Jews; for he designed to show them kindness, having
before sharply and severely chastised them. But we must more particularly
consider each part.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, that as God had previously resolved to
punish the Jews, he was now inclined to show mercy, and that they would find him
as it were changed and different from what he had been. These verses, as I have
said, are explanatory; for the Prophet had briefly promised that the Jews would
be a remarkable example of being a blessed people, but he now shows why God had
previously inflicted on them so many evils and calamities, even because their
fathers had provoked his wrath. And when he says that he had visited them on
account of the crimes or sins of their fathers, we must understand this of the
body of the people. Superfluous then is the question which some interpreters
moot, Whether God punished the children for the sins of their fathers, when yet
he declares in another place, that the soul that sins shall die: for in this
place the Prophet does not distinguish the fathers from the children, but
intimates that God had not been propitious to the Jews, because they had before
greatly provoked his wrath. There is yet no doubt, but that every one justly
suffered the punishment of his iniquity. The import of the whole is, that the
Jews gained nothing by evasion, for God had not without reason visited them, but
had rendered a just reward for their sins. This is one thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What he adds, that God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>repented not
</i></font><font face="Palatino">for being thus angry, means the same as though
he had said, that the Jews through their perverseness had only rendered
God&#8217;s rigour inflexible. Zechariah then reminds us, that when men cease
not to add evils to evils, and obstinately rush on as though they would make war
with God, he then becomes as it were obstinate too, and according to what is
said in the eighteenth Psalm, &#8220;deals perversely with the perverse.&#8221;
The reason then why God declares that he had been implacable to his people, is,
because the wickedness of those whom he had spared and long tolerated was become
unhealable; for when he saw that they were wholly perverse, he armed himself for
vengeance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And hence we may gather a general truth, &#8212; that
God cannot be intreated by us, except when we begin to repent; not that our
repentance anticipates God&#8217;s mercy, for the question here is not, what man
of himself and of his own inclination can do; as the object of Zechariah is only
to teach us, that when God designs to forgive us, he changes our hearts and
turns us to obedience by his Spirit; for when he leaves us in our hardness, we
must necessarily be ever afflicted by his hand until we at last
perish.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must at the same time notice what I have also
referred to, &#8212; that God here closes the mouths of the Jews, that they
might not murmur against his severity, as though he had dealt cruelly with them.
He then shows that these punishments were just which the Jews had endured; for
it had not been for one day only, but for a continued succession of time, that
the fathers had excited his wrath. The reason why he speaks of the fathers
rather than of themselves is, because they had for a long series of years
hardened themselves in their wickedness, and corruption had become in them as it
were hereditary. He now says that he had turned; not that he was of another
mind, as we have already said, but this is to be understood of what the people
experienced; for God seemed to be in a manner different, when he became kind to
them and showed them favor, having before manifested many tokens of
vengeance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now at the end of the verse the Prophet reminds us of
the application of his doctrine, even to encourage the Jews, that they might go
on with alacrity in the work of building the temple. But we have said that we
ought to be armed with God&#8217;s promises, so that we may with courageous
hearts follow wherever he may call us; for we shall all presently faint except
we find that the hand of God is present with us. Since then we are by nature
slothful and tender, and since inconstancy often creeps in, this is our only
remedy, &#8212; that when we seek to go on in the course of our calling to the
end, we know that God will be ever a help to us; and this is what the Prophet
now teaches us. He then applies what he had before promised to its legitimate
purpose, &#8212; to encourage the Jews to lay aside their fear, courageously to
undertake their work, and to expect what was not yet evident, even a complete
restoration. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Zechariah exhorts them here to true repentance, by
showing that more things were to be hoped for than what they saw with their
eyes; and at the same time he shows that it was not enough for them assiduously
to build the city and the temple; but he requires other things, even that they
should observe integrity and justice towards one another. We indeed know that
the Jews were so given to their own ceremonies, that they thought that holiness
existed in them: and this error Zechariah had before condemned, and now he
inculcates the same truth, &#8212; that if they wished to have God propitious to
them, and also wished to enjoy continually that goodness which they had already
tasted, they were to strive to secure it not only by sacrifices and other
ceremonies, but especially by attention to justice and equity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet does not here mention every part of
an upright life, but only refers to some things. This mode of speaking is quite
common, as we have already often noticed. The Prophet then states a part for the
whole; but still he includes generally the whole of the second table, when he
says that these things were to be observed, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm83</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> even
that they should </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>speak the
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, deal faithfully with one
another, abstain from every falsehood and deceit, and from every kind of
craftiness, &#8212; and also that they should
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>execute justice in their
gates</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And because he names
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>neighbors
</i></font><font face="Palatino">here, it would be very absurd for anyone hence
to conclude, that it is lawful to defraud strangers, or those with whom we have
no near connection: but the Prophet by this term meant only to set forth the
atrocious conduct of the Jews, who spared not even their friends and their
brethren. Though then it is a wicked thing to deceive any one, even the farthest
from us, it is yet a greater crime when one lies in wait for his near neighbor
and brother: and we know that this mode of speaking occurs everywhere in the
law; for God, in order to restrain us from evil deeds, has set before us that
kind of sin which we are constrained by the impulse of nature to detest. Thus he
speaks of secret hatred as being murder. Then the Prophet in this place meant
more sharply to reprove the Jews, because such barbarity had prevailed among
them, that no one regarded his neighbor, but raged as it were against his own
bowels.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgment of
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he intimates by them, that not only
individuals were privately given to evil deeds, but that also the court of
justice was full of frauds and wrong acts, while it ought to have been the
sanctuary of justice. Though many may be perversely wicked among the people, yet
their audacity and wickedness are always restrained, when the laws are put in
force, and incorrupt judges rule. But the Prophet shows that the judges had
become like robbers, for there was no integrity in the gates. He mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">
first, for the judges craftily perverted all truth by misrepresentations, as it
is commonly the case. For even the worst of men do not openly say that they
approve of a wicked deed; but they find out disguises by which they cover their
own baseness, and that of those who do wrong, whom they favor, when bribed with
money. It is then necessary that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">
should have the first place in courts of justice. By the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgment of peace
</i></font><font face="Palatino">he understands, when his own is given to every
one. Some think that what is right is called the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgment of
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because when mercenary judges condemn
and oppress the innocent, and for gain&#8217;s sake patronise what is wrong,
many tumults often arise, and then open war ensues: but as the word peace has a
wide meaning in Hebrew, we may take the judgment of peace as meaning only a calm
and a rightly formed judgment. The Jews, we know, administered justice in the
gates.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And think not evil every one
against his friend</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here the Prophet not only
condemns open wrongs, but also the hidden purposes of evil. We hence learn, that
the law was not only given to restrain men as it were by a bridle, and that it
not only contains a rule of life as to outward duties, but that it also rules
their hearts before God and angels. The law is indeed really spiritual; and
extremely gross and foolish are they who think that they satisfy the law of
Moses, when they abstain from murder and theft and other evil deeds; for we see
that the Prophets everywhere required a right feeling in the hearts as Zechariah
does in this place, who reminds the Jews, that they were not to devise evil
against their friends, no, not in their hearts. He might have omitted the last
words; but he meant to condemn those frauds which were wont to be covered by
many and various disguises. Though then men may not bring forth their
wickedness, yet Zechariah shows that God will punish it; for whatever dwells
within, however concealed it may be from the eyes of men, however hidden it may
be in the depth of the heart, it must yet come to an account before
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds another kind of evil, even perjury,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And love not the oath of
falsehood</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He might have said, swear not to the
injury of thy neighbor; but there is to be observed here a contrast between the
perverted love of men and the hatred of God. As then God hates a false oath as
all other frauds and falsehoods, so he forbids us to desire it: for if we wish
to please God, we must see what he requires from us, inasmuch as we designedly
provoke his wrath when we desire or covet what he declares that he hates. In a
word, Zechariah shows that God would be propitious and kind to the Jews,
provided they truly and from the heart repented, and attended to what was right
and just &#8212; not only to build the temple, to offer sacrifices, and to
observe other rites, but also to form their life according to what integrity
required; to labor not only by external acts to discharge their duties towards
their neighbors; but also to cleanse their hearts from all hatred, all cruelty,
and all depraved affections. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms the same truth, that such would be the
restoration of the Church that all the memory of their sorrows would be
obliterated. We have already said, that some fasts were observed by the Jews
after the destruction of their city. Before two only were mentioned, but now the
Prophet names four. In the fourth month the city was taken, and in the fifth the
temple was destroyed and burnt down; in the seventh was Gedaliah slain, who had
remained with the residue of the people who had been gathered by him; and the
fast of the tenth month, as some think, was appointed when the city was
besieged. If so, the fast of the tenth month preceded the rest, then followed
the fast of the fourth month, in the third place the fast of the fifth month,
and, lastly, the fast of the seventh month, on account of the death of
Gedaliah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These then were tokens of mourning to the time of the
restoration; for when the city was besieged, God raised up, as it were, a sign
of dreadful vengeance; and when Nebuchadnezzar broke through the wall of the
city, it was then openly forsaken by God; after the burning of the temple there
remained no hope, except that some of the common people continued in the land
under the protection of Gedaliah. The root, as it were, of the people was cut
off, but some thin fibres were remaining; and when even these were torn asunder,
when all who could be found were led into exile, the favor of God had wholly
disappeared as to the outward appearance. It behaved then the Jews to be in
mourning and humiliation, that they might seek pardon from God. We shall not
then say, that these fasts were without reason, and foolishly appointed by them,
for they were at liberty to testify their sorrow; nay, it was an act of piety
humbly in their guilt to deprecate the wrath of the celestial Judge, when they
perceived that he was displeased with them. But God now promises joy, which was
to extinguish all sorrow, as the rising of the sun drives away all the darkness
of the night.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet seems to allude to what he had before
taught when he indirectly taunted the Jews, because they were too anxious about
keeping fasts, while they neglected the main things. But the simple meaning is,
that if the Jews really repented and sincerely sought to return to God&#8217;s
favor, there would be an end to all their miseries, so that there would be no
need of fasting.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must also remember that the design of fasting is
this, that those who have sinned may humble themselves before God, and go as
suppliants before his throne, that they may confess their sins and condemn
themselves. Fasting then is, as it were, the habit of criminals when they desire
to obtain pardon from God; for Christ says, that there is no fasting at
marriages and during festal days.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400915&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
9:15.) We then see that there is here promised a restoration which was to put an
end to every former cause of sorrow among the people; not that these fasts of
themselves displeased God, for they were appointed, as we have said, for a good
purpose &#8212; that the people might thus exercise themselves in acts of piety,
and also stimulate and support their hope till the time of their deliverance;
but Zechariah pursues what he had begun &#8212; that God was now plainly
reconciled, for he favored his people, and proved this by the blessings he
bestowed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>festal
days</i></font><font face="Palatino">, we know that among other things they are
expressly mentioned by Moses, &#8220;Thou shalt rejoice before thy God.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
12:18.) When therefore the Jews celebrated their festal meetings, it was the
same as though they stood before God, and were thus fully persuaded that they
were in his presence. Forasmuch then as God thus designed to exhilarate his
people by festivals, the Prophet does not without reason say, that the fasts,
which had been signs of mourning, would be turned into joy and into festal days.
Moreover, the Prophet thus speaks, because the observance of the law, which
prevailed while the people were in a state of security, had been interrupted in
their exile &#8212; as though he had said, &#8220;As food expelled you to a
foreign land, and made you while exiles from your country to grieve and mourn,
so now being restored you shall have joy, and religiously keep your festal
days.&#8221; And thus he indirectly reproves the Jews for having deprived
themselves of their festal days, in which the law invited them to rejoice, for
they had profaned them. God would not have suffered to be discontinued what he
had commanded, had not religion been corrupted; for on this account it was that
things changed for the worse, and that sorrow succeeded, which is here
designated by fastings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At length he concludes by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Love ye then truth and
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By truth he means integrity, as we have
said before; and Zechariah includes in this word the whole of what is just and
right: for when our hearts are cleansed, then the rule of justice and equity is
observed. When then we deal sincerely with our neighbors, all the duties of love
freely flow from within as from a fountain. As to the word peace, it may be
explained in two ways: either as in the former instance when he mentioned the
judgment of peace in the sense of judgment rightly formed, and thus to love
peace is to love good order; or it may be taken for God&#8217;s blessing, as
though the Prophet said, &#8220;If ye wish to be in a good and prosperous state,
observe integrity towards one another; for God will ever be present by his
blessing, provided ye be sincere and faithful. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm84</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Ye have
in a manner sought a curse for yourselves, and dried up as it were the fountain
of God&#8217;s blessings by your wickedness and your frauds. If then truth reign
among you, all felicity shall accompany it; for the Lord will bless you.&#8221;
I shall not proceed farther now.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as thou

<div><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet here extends his discourse still farther;
for he promises not only the complete restoration of his chosen people, but also
the propagation of the Church; for God, he says, will gather a Church for
himself from many and remote nations, and unite many nations in one body. And
this ought to have availed especially to animate the Jews, as they were thus
taught that the temple was built, not only that God might be worshipped by one
nation, but by all nations. Moreover, as before this time some had come from
distant lands to worship God, the Prophet may seem here to have this in view by
using
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dw[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>oud</i>, the adverb of time. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm85</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But he
not only declares that some would come, as in the time of Solomon, but as I have
already said, he promises here something more remarkable &#8212; that the temple
would not belong peculiarly to the Jews, but would be common to all nations; for
there is to be no language and no nation which is not to unite in the true
worship of God. But let us consider the words of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He begins by saying, that God was the author of this
prophecy; and this was said to secure credit. There was need, as we have said,
of no common authority, since he was here speaking of what was incredible. There
was only a handful of people returned to their country, and many dangers
surrounded them almost every day; so that many, wearied with their present
condition, preferred exile, and regret for their return had now crept into the
minds of many, for they thought that they had been deceived. Since then the
state of the people was such, there was need of something more than ordinary to
confirm what is here said &#8212; that the glory of the second temple would be
greater and more eminent than that of the first:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It shall yet
be</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says. Though a comparison is implied,
there is yet no equality expressed, as though some few only would come. But as
there had been no temple for seventy years, and as the temple, now begun to be
built, was in no high esteem, but mean and insignificant, the Prophet says, that
the time would yet come, when
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nations and inhabitants of great
cities</i></font><font face="Palatino"> would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ascend into
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We may indeed render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twbr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rebut</i>, many or great, for it means both; but the Prophet, I think, speaks
of great cities; and the reason will presently appear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come shall the inhabitants of one
to one</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, the inhabitants of one city to
another; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saying, going let us
go</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. He means by these words, that there
will be a mutual consent among all nations, so that they will stimulate one
another, and thus unite together their exertions. We here see that the
Prophet&#8217;s object was to encourage the Jews to entertain good hope, and
thus to cause them to persevere, so that they might not doubt but that success
would attend their work and labor, because the Lord would have himself
worshipped at Jerusalem, not only by themselves but also by all nations. But as
the Jews could not believe that nations could by force be drawn there, he
teaches them, that their assembling would be voluntary; he says that those who
had been before extremely refractory would be disposed to come of their own
accord, so that there would be no need of external force to constrain them; for
they would willingly come, nay, would excite one another, and by mutual
exhortations stimulate themselves so as to come together to worship God at
Jerusalem.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The ardor and vehemence of their zeal is to be
noticed; for the Prophet says, that they would come of their own accord, and
also encourage one another, according to what we have seen in the second chapter

2:1, Lay hold will each on the hand of his brother, and say, let us go to the
mount of the God of Jacob. But more is expressed in this place, for not only
shall each one encourage his brother whenever met and an opportunity be offered,
but he says that they will come from all quarters. We now then see the design of
the Prophet in these words. And we hence learn, that faith then only produces
its legitimate fruit when zeal is kindled, so that every one strives to increase
the kingdom of God, and to gather the straying, that the Church may be filled.
For when any one consults his own private benefit and has no care for others, he
first betrays most clearly his own inhumanity, and where there is no love the
Spirit of God does not rule there. Besides, true godliness brings with it a
concern for the glory of God. It is no wonder then that the Prophet, when
describing true and real conversion, says, that each would be solicitous about
his brethren, so as to stimulate one another, and also that the hearts of all
would be so kindled with zeal for God, that they would hasten together to
celebrate his glory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let us go to entreat the face of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The phrase is common in Scripture. But
we must observe, that the Prophet in speaking of God&#8217;s worship, sets
prayer in the first rank, for prayer to God is the chief part, yea, the main
thing in religion. It is, indeed, immediately added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and to seek
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">: he explains the particular by the
general; and in the next verse he inverts the order, beginning with the general.
However, the meaning continues the same, for God seeks nothing else but that we
should be teachable and obedient, so as to be prepared to follow wherever he may
call us, and at the same time carefully to enquire respecting his will, as we
have need of him as our leader and teacher, so that we may not foolishly go
astray through winding and circuitous courses; for if we deem it enough to take
presumptuously our own way, the endeavor to seek God will be superfluous. It
must then be observed, that God is then only really sought when men desire to
learn from his word how he is to be worshipped. But, as I have already said, the
Prophet adds prayer here, for the design of the whole truth respecting salvation
is to teach us, that our life depends on God, and that whatever belongs to
eternal life must be hoped for and expected from him. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm86</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We now
then understand the import of the whole.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must enquire also why he says, that the
nations would come to seek God at
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
and there to call on him. The Jews foolishly imagine that God cannot be
otherwise worshipped than by offering sacrifices still in the temple. But the
Prophet had something very different in view, that the light of truth would
arise from that city, which would diffuse itself far and wide: and this prophecy
ought to be connected with that of Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;A law shall go
forth from Sion,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and the word of
Jehovah from Jerusalem.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
2:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As then the doctrine of salvation which has filled
the whole world flowed from that city, the Prophet says, that nations would come
to Jerusalem, not that it would be necessary for them to assemble there, but
because all were to seek there what could not be obtained elsewhere. Since then
none could be accounted the children of God except they were brought up in that
school and acknowledged that alone to be true religion which had its first
habitation at Jerusalem, we hence see why the Prophet expressly mentions that
city.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must further bear in mind, that the temple was
built for this end and purpose, &#8212; that the doctrine of salvation might
continue there, and have there its seat until the coming of Christ; for then was
fulfilled that prophecy in the hundred and tenth Psalm, &#8220;The scepter of
thy power shall God send forth from Sion.&#8221; The Prophet here teaches us,
that Christ would not be the king of one people only, whose power was to be
confined to narrow limits, but that he would rule through the whole world, for
God would extend his scepter to every quarter of the globe. As tell it behaved
the Jews to have this end in view, the Prophet, in order to animate them that
they might not fail in the middle of their work, says, that that place was
sacred to God, so that salvation might thence be sought by the whole world, for
all were to be the disciples of that Church who wished to be deemed the children
of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we ought carefully to notice what I have already
referred to, the two things required in God&#8217;s worship &#8212; to seek him,
and also to pray to him. For the superstitious, though they pretend great ardor
in seeking God, yet amuse themselves with many delusions; for they hurry on
presumptuously, and as it were at random, so that they seek not God, but leave
him, and weary themselves without thought and without any judgment. As then the
superstitious have no reason for what they do, they can not be said properly to
seek God. But the faithful seek God, for they acknowledge that he is not to be
worshipped according to the fancy of any one, but that there is a certain
prescript and rule to be observed. To us then this is the beginning of religion
&#8212; not to allow to ourselves liberty to attempt anything we please, but
humbly and soberly to submit to God&#8217;s word; for when any one seeks and
chooses an unfit teacher, he will not advance as he ought to do. But the Prophet
shows, that all the godly succeed when they strive to be approved of God by
confining themselves to his word, and by attempting nothing through their own
promptings, but when they have such a discernment as not to blend, as it is
said, profane with sacred things. The second chief thing is, to pray to God: and
the Prophet thus reminds us why it is that God would have us especially to seek
him. Nothing indeed results to his advantage and benefit from our efforts, but
he would have us to seek him that we may learn to expect from him everything
connected with our salvation. This seeking is also defined by the term prayer,
and not useless is the word <i>face</i>, for though God is invisible, we yet
ought not to wander with uncertainty, as it were through the air, when our
purpose is to flee to him, but to go to him with full confidence. Unless then we
are fully persuaded of what the Scripture teaches us &#8212; that God is ever
nigh those who truly call on him, the door will be closed against our prayers,
for God&#8217;s name will be profaned though we may express what we wish. As
then the nearness of God ought to be impressed on our hearts when we prepare
ourselves for prayer, the Scripture usually adopts this form,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to entreat the face of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. But this is not to be understood of an
ocular sight, but, on the contrary, of the conviction of the heart. Let us now
proceed -</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He pursues the same subject in this verse; for as he
had before said, that the nations would willingly come to worship God, and that
each would encourage his brother to undertake this pious and holy expedition, so
he now adds, that ten men would lay hold on the border of a Jew&#8217;s garment:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ten men shall then take hold of
the skirt of a Jew</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He shows here more clearly
what I have briefly referred to &#8212; that there would be no need of arms, or
of any compulsion, in order to draw or compel the nations to engage in
God&#8217;s service; for even ten would of themselves accompany one Jew; and it
is a proof of a very great readiness when ten surrender themselves to be ruled
by one. As one Jew could not be sufficient to draw so many nations, the Prophet
declares that there would be everywhere a union of faith, so that those, before
wholly alienated from God, would desire to join themselves as friends, or rather
as companions to the Jews.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From all
languages</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By these words he amplifies the
miracle; for there cannot be a union between men far distant, especially when
they are of different languages, as they are barbarians to one another. When the
Prophet then says that they would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>come from all
languages</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and unite together, it more fully
appears to be God&#8217;s work; for there is nothing here to be ascribed to
human contrivances. It must then be that the hearts of those who cannot express
their minds, and can hardly give a sign, are united together by the hidden power
of the Spirit. We now perceive the Prophet&#8217;s object in this
verse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he uses in the last clause a phrase different
from the one he employed before &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let us go with you, for we have
heard that with you is God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He had said,
&#8220;Let us go to seek Jehovah, and to entreat his face;&#8221; but now he
says &#8220;Let us go with you.&#8221; But yet he handles and confirms the same
thing; for the nations could not have sought God without following the Jews
going before them. For when any one separates himself from others, it so happens
that he is led astray, and feeds on much that is very absurd, as we see to be
the case with proud and morose men, who invent strange and monstrous things; for
they shun society, and seem not to themselves to be wise, until they put off
every feeling of humanity. The character then of faith has also this in it
&#8212; that the elect, while they themselves obey God, desire to have many
associates in this obedience, and many fellow-disciples in true religion. The
Prophet thus intended to point out two things: be had said before &#8212;
&#8220;Let us go to seek God;&#8221; and now &#8212; &#8220;We will go with
you.&#8221; What else is this but to seek God? But he expresses more now &#8212;
that the nations declare that they would come to seek God for this end &#8212;
that they might learn from others, like rude beginners, who have their
fellow-scholars as their teachers; so that every one who had made some progress,
was to preside over others, and those as yet commencing, and still in the first
elements of knowledge, were humbly to connect themselves with others better
informed. Shame prevents many from making in this manner any advancement, and so
they ever remain sunk in ignorance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet at the same time not only commends
humility, but also exhorts all God&#8217;s children to cultivate unity and
concord. For whosoever tears asunder the Church of God, disunites himself from
Christ, who is the head, and who would have all his members to be united
together.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand that God ought to be sought in
order to be rightly worshipped by us; and also, that he ought to be thus sought,
not that each may have his own peculiar religion, but that we may be united
together, and that every one who sees his brethren going before, and excelling
in gifts, may be prepared to follow them, and to seek benefit from their labors.
It is indeed true that we ought to disregard the whole world; and to embrace
only the truth of God; for it is a hundred times better to renounce the society
of all mortals, and union with them, then to withdraw ourselves from God; but
when God shows himself as our leader, the Prophet teaches us that we ought
mutually to stretch forth our hand and unitedly to follow him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have again to notice at the end of the verse what
I have already referred to &#8212; that the nations would come, not compelled by
force of arms or by violence, but drawn by hearing alone.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have
heard</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By hearing the Prophet means here the
doctrine of salvation everywhere diffused; for there would be no care nor
concern for worshipping were we not taught; for faith, as Paul says, is by
hearing; and so prayer proceeds from faith.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451017&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:17.) In short, the Prophet means that the knowledge of religion would be
through the preaching of the truth, which would rouse all nations to the duty of
worshipping God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now again confirms what we have also mentioned
&#8212; that the Jews would have the precedence of all nations; for it appears
that God would be among them. We hence see that primacy is not ascribed to the
Jews in being leaders to others, because they excelled others by their own
virtue or dignity, but because God presided over them. Then God is ever to be
sought, though we may avail ourselves of the labors of men, and follow them when
they show us the right way. We must ever bear this in mind &#8212; that those
only exhort truly and honestly, who not only do so by word, but who really prove
what they feel by their conduct; according to what the Prophet has said &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go will I
also</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and he says the same now &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let us
go</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or, we shall go
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For many there are who are strenuous
enough in stimulating others; but their vain garrulity appears evident; for
while they bid others to run, they are standing still; and while they vehemently
encourage others, they themselves delay and take their rest. Now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">One thing had escaped my notice in the words of the
Prophet &#8212; that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>great people
and strong nations would come</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We have said
that &#8220;great&#8221; rather than &#8220;many&#8221; ought to be adopted. The
latter meaning may indeed be allowed that the worshipers of God would come from
various cities; but as the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ymwx[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>otsumim</i> properly signifies strong, and as it is certain that the Prophet
means the same thing by the two words, it is more probable that he speaks of
strong and valiant people, as they are not so easily subdued; for the more any
one excels in prowess, the more stiff is his neck to undertake the yoke. As then
the strong and the brave, and such as are eminent in the world, are not so
easily brought to submit to God, the Prophet expressly says, that they shall
become teachable, and be made willing, so that pride, as it is usually the case,
shall not be a hindrance to them. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm87</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I come now to the passage in which the Prophet
announces a heavy burden, or a severe and fearful prophecy respecting Syria and
other neighboring nations. I prefer to retain the word &#8220;burden,&#8221;
rather than to render it prophecy, as many expositors have done; for though
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">a&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mesha</i>, is sometimes taken simply for prophecy, yet there is here, as it
appears to me, something particular intended; for the Prophet denounces
God&#8217;s judgment both on Syria and on the surrounding countries, and the
word prophecy is not suitable; for to say &#8220;the prophecy of the
word,&#8221; would be strange and without meaning. But when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The burden of the word
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of God, the sentence is full, and flows well;
for he reminds us that his word would not be ineffectual, but full of effect, as
it would lie as a burden on Syria and on other countries, which they should not
be able to shake off. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The burden
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the word of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, &#8220;I have now a
prediction which will be grievous and severe to those heathens who now disturb
the Jews, the chosen people.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this doctrine contains consolation to the godly;
for they may hence know that they are safe under God&#8217;s protection, as he
carries on war with their enemies; nay, his vengeance was now prepared against
all those who harassed the Jews. As then he had before promised that incredible
favor of God which we have noticed, so now he declares that the Church would be
safe under the protection of God, inasmuch as vengeance was in readiness for all
the ungodly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet mentions here only the cities known
to the Jews, for it was enough to refer to them as an example, that the Jews
might hence conclude that God would be always the protector of his Church, so
that no enemies shall escape unpunished. The Prophet then no doubt mentioned
these few cities to the Jews, that they might feel assured that nothing is so
strong and impetuous in the world which God cannot easily subdue and lay
prostrate. Now as we apprehend the Prophet&#8217;s object, we shall come to the
words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some think that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;rdj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chedrak</i>, includes the whole of Syria, which seems to me probable. Others
suppose that some notable city is meant, as Damascus is immediately subjoined.
But as the matter is uncertain, and as there is no doubt but that the Prophet
speaks of the kingdom of Syria, I will not contest the point. Be it then the
name of a city or of a country, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm88</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it is
all the same, for the Prophet means that the vengeance of God was impending over
the Syrians, and impending in such a manner, that it would not depart from them
until they were wholly destroyed. For when he adds that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>its rest would be
Damascus</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he intimates that God&#8217;s
judgment would not be like a storm, which soon passes away, but that it would be
a heavy and burdensome mass, which could not be dissipated, according to what
Isaiah says &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The word came on
Jacob and fell on Israel;&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230809&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
8:9;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">that is, what God pronounced against Jacob fell on
Israel. He indeed changes the name, but it is the same as though he had said
&#8212; &#8220;When God shall punish Jacob, can the Israelites escape?&#8221;
for they were the same. The sentence then shall fall, that is, it shall find its
own place: in vain will they run here and there to escape. The Jews then will
gain nothing by their flight; for the vengeance now denounced by the Lord shall
lay hold on them. So also in this place he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the burden of the word of Jehovah
on the land of Chadrak and Damascus</i></font><font face="Palatino">, the royal
city, the metropolis, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be
its rest</i></font><font face="Palatino">, its dwelling; for the Lord&#8217;s
vengeance will fix its station there, and it cannot be thence removed. In vain
then will the Syrians try in various ways to escape, for they must be pressed
down by God&#8217;s hand, until they be laid prostrate. We now then understand
in what sense the Prophet says that Damascus would be the rest, the habitation,
or the abode of God&#8217;s vengeance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For to Jehovah the eye of
man</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ki</i> is to be taken here, I think, as an adverb of time,
&#8220;When&#8221;. There is indeed in reality but little difference, except
that the common rendering of it greatly obscures the meaning of the Prophet. But
if it be taken as an adverb of time, the passage will read better,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When the eye of man shall be to
Jehovah, and of all the tribes of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that
is, when the Jews shall begin to turn to God without any dissimulation, but with
real sincerity; then he says, God will in every way bless them, and raise up his
hand against their enemies. The Prophet had before exhorted the Jews to
repentance; for they had been too much given to sacrifices and fastings, while
no integrity existed among them. So also he shows again that their hypocrisy was
an hindrance, which prevented God to manifest his favor to them; and thus he
reminds them, that the gate would be opened, and the way made plain and even for
God&#8217;s favor and blessings, whenever they raised their eyes to him, that
is, whenever they derived their hopes from him, and fixed on him their
dependence. For to direct the eyes to God is nothing else than to look to him so
as to fix on him all our thoughts. Some understand by &#8220;man&#8221; all
mortals, but of this I approve not; nor do I doubt but that the Prophet refers
to the Jews alone; and doubtless it is not consistent with the context to regard
any but the Jews. It is indeed true, that the Prophet speaks here of the calling
of the Gentiles, but so as to begin with the Jews; for as they were the
first-born, so it was necessary for them to have the precedence. The Prophet
then here declares that God would be glorious in his chosen people, and would
lay prostrate all the bordering enemies. Then the eye of man signifies the same
as the eye of the whole people; as though he had said, that after the Jews had
begun to lay aside all dissimulation and devoted themselves to God, and cast all
their hopes on him, they would then find God sufficiently powerful to lay in the
dust all their enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he afterwards adds, by way of explanation,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and of all the tribes of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some give this rendering, &#8220;How
much more,&#8221; as though the Prophet reasoned here from the less to the
greater. But, as I have already said, this cannot be maintained. First, this
explanation is strained, &#8220;The eye of man, and especially of all the tribes
of Israel;&#8221; for the Jews ought to have had the first place: and secondly,
the particle waw has no amplifying sense. In short, he intended by a small
particle to show that precedence belonged to the Jews. I do not then understand
what they mean, who would include all nations in the word &#8220;man,&#8221; and
then regard the Prophet as proceeding to mention the tribes of Israel. Now what
I have stated, that the true servants of God were then few, is probable enough;
hence the Prophet here exhorts the whole people to a union in religion. Whenever
then the whole tribes of Israel directed their eyes to God, the burden of his
word would then come upon Damascus and all the Syrians.

<div><font face="Palatino">ZECHARIAH goes on with the same subject: for he says
now, that destruction was nigh all the nations who, being neighbors, harassed
the people of God. Yesterday I briefly referred to what he had in view, which
was to show, that God would so defend his Church as to execute vengeance on all
the ungodly who had unjustly persecuted it; and he spoke of the kingdom of
Syria, which was contiguous to Judea. But he now goes farther, &#8212; that the
wrath of God would extend to the remoter parts of Syria: for Hamath is Antioch
the great, and it gave a name to a part of Syria. Damascus was the metropolis of
the Syrian empire. But as we have said elsewhere, this word is variously taken
in Scripture, but generally for the whole country extending from Judea to the
Euphrates and even beyond it. We now then see why Zechariah adds Antioch to
Syria, as though he had said, that God would now be the avenger of his people,
not only by rewarding bordering cities, but also those afar off. He then passes
on to Tyrus and Simon, which were, as it is well known, cities on the sea-side,
and were also nigh to the Jews; for there was no great distance between Galilee
and Phoenicia. But as we said yesterday, destruction is denounced on all the
nations who had been inimical to the chosen people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that Hamath, or Antioch, would be in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>its
border</i></font><font face="Palatino">. All nearly with one consent apply this
to Judea or to Jerusalem, but they are mistaken; and this whole chapter is
misunderstood by all expositors, Jews and others. I indeed feel ashamed when I
see how widely they have departed from the meaning of the Prophet, and it will
be almost a trial to me wholly to reject their mistakes. But it will become
plainly evident that none of them have understood what the Prophet
means.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They thus explain the passage, that Antioch would be
within the borders of Judea, as God would consecrate to himself the lands which
were before heathen. But the Prophet no doubt says, as I have already stated,
that Antioch would be within the borders of Syria whenever God should visit them
all for their wickedness, as though he had said, &#8220;God will involve in the
same punishment that part of Syria which derives its name from Antioch, because
with united forces had all the Syrians assailed his chosen people; though then
they are far distant from Judea, they shall yet partake of the same punishment,
because they took up arms against his Church.&#8221;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hamath</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then, or Antioch, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be in the
borders </i></font><font face="Palatino">of Damascus; that is, it shall not be
exempt from the punishment which God will inflict on the bordering kingdom of
and. And as we advance this view will become more clear. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm90</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Tyrus and Sidon, though it be
very wise</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ki</i>, is used, which is properly causal; but we may gather from many parts
of Scripture that it is taken as an adversative. Either meaning would not,
however, be unsuitable, that God would take vengeance on the Sidonians and
Syrians, because they were very crafty, or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>though</i></font><font face="Palatino">
they were cautious, and seemed skillful and cunning in managing their affairs:
they were not however to escape God&#8217;s judgment. If the former meaning be
approved, it was the Prophet&#8217;s object to show, that when men are extremely
provident and labor to fortify themselves by crafty means, God is opposed to
them; for it is his peculiar office to take the crafty by their own craftiness.
As then too much cunning and craftiness displease God, it may suitably be said,
that the Syrians and Sidonians were now summoned before God&#8217;s tribunal,
because they were extremely crafty, as is commonly the case with merchants in
wealthy and maritime cities; for they learn much cunning by the many frauds
which they are almost compelled to use. Since then the Sidonians and Syrians
were such, it was right to denounce vengeance on them. But the other view is
equally suitable, that all the craft of Tyrus and Simon would not prevent God
from executing his judgment. As to myself, I think that a reason is here given
why God threatens ruin to the Syrians and Sidonians, even because they were
given to crafty artifices, and thus circumvented all their
neighbors.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he uses a good word by way of concession; for all
who intend to deceive cover their craft with the name of wisdom or prudence.
&#8220;They wish to be cautious,&#8221; when yet they wickedly deceive others by
their intrigues and frauds. A concession then is made as to the word wise: but
the Prophet at the same time teaches us, that this kind of wisdom is hateful to
God, when by the loss of others we increase our own wealth: for an explanation
immediately follows &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For Tyrus has for herself built a
fortress</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet shows by these words how
very cautious or prudent the Syrians had been; for they fortified themselves by
strongholds, and thought themselves to be beyond the reach of danger. He then
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and heaped to herself
silver as dust, and gold as the mire of the
streets</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, accumulated wealth above
measure; for he mentions &#8220;dust&#8221; and &#8220;mire&#8221; as signifying
an immense heap; as though he had said, &#8220;They have worthless heaps of
silver and gold for their vast abundance&#8221;. He no doubt includes silver and
gold in the fortress which he mentions; for I do not confine the word fortress
only to towers and strongholds; but the Prophet, as I think, states generally,
that Tyrus was so furnished and fortified with wealth, forces, and all kinds of
defences, that it thought itself impregnable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is a striking correspondence between
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwx</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tsur</i>, and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwxm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>metsur</i>.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwx</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Tsur</i>, he says, has built
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwxm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>metsur</i>, a fortress. It is a paronomasia worthy of notice, but cannot be
retained in Latin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now declares that God would be an avenger. Behold,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah will
possess</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or cause to possess, as some read, but
they are mistaken, owing to the two meanings of the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;ry</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>iresh</i>, which means to possess and also to expel or impoverish; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm91</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for
interpreters think that a hope of favor and of salvation is here given to these
cities, and say that they are now chosen by God as a possession. But this is
wholly contrary to the intention of the Prophet, as it appears more clearly from
a view of each clause.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will expel her, and smite her
strength</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet no doubt alludes to what
he had already said &#8212; that Tyrus had heaped silver and gold; now on the
other hand he declares that Tyrus would be exposed to a scattering; for the heap
of gold and silver it had laid up would be dissipated by God:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he will then
dissipate</i></font><font face="Palatino">; or if one chooses to take the verb
as meaning to reduce to want, the contrast would thus be suitable &#8212; God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>impoverish</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
or expel her. Afterwards he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the sea will he smite her
strength</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As Tyrus, we know, was surrounded by
the sea, the Prophet by this reference shows God&#8217;s power in taking
vengeance on her; for the sea would be no restraint or hindrance to God, when he
resolved to enter there. The Syrians, indeed, thought themselves safe from every
hostile attack, for they had the sea on every side as a triple wall and a triple
rampart. Nor was Tyrus altogether like Venice; for Venice is situated in a
stagnant sea, while the situation of Tyrus was in a very deep sea, as historians
plainly show who relate its assault by Alexander the Great. It had indeed been
before taken and plundered; but he did what none had ever thought of &#8212; he
filled up a part of the sea, so that Tyrus was no longer an
island.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see what Zechariah had in view, when he
threatened ruin to Tyrus, though its strength was in the midst of the sea,
beyond the reach of fortune, as it is commonly said.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And she shall be consumed by
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He means that Tyrus would not only be
plundered, but wholly demolished; for we know that even the strongest things are
consumed by fire. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">In this verse also is described the devastation of
those cities which the Prophet names; as though he had said, that all those
cities which had risen up against God&#8217;s people were devoted to extreme
vengeance. Zechariah says that none would be exempt from punishment, since the
hand of God would be stretched forth, and extend everywhere, so that it might be
easily concluded, that all those who had unjustly harassed the Church would be
thus rewarded for their cruelty. This is the import of what is here
said.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ascalon would see and
fear</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for at that time the Ascalonites were
hostile to the Jews. He speaks the same of Aza, which the Greeks called Gaza;
but they were deceived in thinking it was a name given to it by Cambyses, for
the reason that Gaza means a treasure in the Persian language. This is childish.
It is indeed certain that it has been owing to a change in the pronunciation of
one letter; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>oin</i>, is guttural among the Hebrews, and was formerly so pronounced, like
our g: as they called Amorrah, Gomorrah, so Aza is Gaza. We have spoken of this
elsewhere.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now it appears from geography that these cities were
near the sea, or not far from the sea, and having this advantage they gathered
much wealth. But as wealth commonly generates pride and cruelty, all these
nations were very troublesome to the Jews. This is the reason why the Prophet
says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>grief</i></font><font face="Palatino">
would come on Gaza, and then on Ekron and on other cities. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because ashamed shall be her
expectation</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There is no doubt but they had
placed their trust in Tyrus, which was thought to be impregnable; for though
enemies might have subdued the whole land, there a secure station remained.
Since they all looked to Tyrus, the Prophet says that their hope would be
confounded, when Tyrus was overthrown and destroyed. The sum of the whole is,
that the beginning of the vengeance would be at Tyrus, which was situated as it
were beyond the world, so as not to be exposed to any evils. He says then that
the beginning of the calamity would be in that city, to which no misfortunes, as
it was thought, could find an access. And then he mentions that other cities, on
seeing Tyrus visited with ruin, would be terrified, as their confidence would be
thus subverted. He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Perish shall the king from Gaza,
and Ascalon shall not be inhabited</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is,
such a change will take place as will almost obliterate the appearance of these
cities. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">In this verse the Prophet denounces a similar ruin on
Azotus, and the whole land of the Philistines, or on the whole land of
Palestine. For what interpreters say, that the Jews would dwell at Azotus as
strangers, that is, though they had previously been counted aliens, is to reach
neither heaven nor earth. The Prophet on the contrary means, that after the
destruction of these cities, if any inhabitants remained, they would be like
strangers, without any certain habitation. The Prophet then mentions the effect,
in order to show that the country would be waste and desolate, so as to contain
no safe or fixed dwellings for its inhabitants. Some render it spurious, as it
is rendered in some other places; and they understand it of the Jews, because
they had been before in a mean condition, as though they were like a spurious
race. But their opinion is probable, who derive

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwz</font><font face="Palatino">,

the double
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">mm</font><font face="Palatino">,

many passages of scripture, that

any one carefully considers the design of the Prophet, he will see the truth of
what I have said &#8212; that is, that his object is to show, that all the
inhabitants of Azotus, and of the land of the Philistine, would be like lodgers,
because all places would be desolate through the slaughter and devastations of
enemies. As then Ashdod and Palestine had been before noted for the number of
their people, the Prophet says that all the cities of Palestine, and the city
Ashdod, would be deserted, except that there would be there a few scattered and
wandering inhabitants, like those who sojourn in a strange land. It follows

check their savage disposition, that they may not thus swallow down the blood of

become a different people, as though the Syrians, the Sidonians, the Philistine,
and other nations, who had been given to plunders, and raged cruelly against the
miserable Jews, were to assume the gentleness of lambs: this the Prophet does
not mean; but he introduces God here as armed with power to repress the
barbarity of their enemies, and to prevent them from cruelly assaulting the
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will take away
blood</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the midst of their teeth

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm93</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And he
compares them to wild beasts, who not only devour the flesh, but drink also the
blood and tear asunder the raw carcass. In short, he shows here, under the
similitude of wolves and leopards and wild boars, how great had been the
inhumanity of enemies to the Church; for they devoured the miserable Jews, as
wild and savage beasts are wont to devour their prey.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It afterwards follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and he who shall be a
remnant</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some translate, &#8220;and he shall be
left,&#8221; and explain it of the Philistine and other nations of whom mention
is made. But the Prophet doubtless means the Jews; for though few only had
returned to their country as remnants from their exile, he yet says that this
small number would be sacred to God, and that all who remained would be, as it
were, leaders in Judah, however despised they might have been. For there was no
superiority even in the chief men among them; only they spontaneously paid
reverence to Zerubbabel, who was of the royal seed, and to Joshua on account of
the priesthood; while yet all of them were in a low and mean condition. But the
Prophet says, that the most despised of them would be leaders and chiefs in
Judah. We now perceive the Prophet&#8217;s meaning; for after having predicted
the ruin that was nigh all the enemies of the Church, he now sets forth the end
and use of his prophecy; for God would provide for the good of the miserable
Jews, who had been long exiles, and who, though now restored to their country,
were yet exposed to the ill treatment of all, and also despised and made even
the objects of scorn to their enemies.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who shall be a remnant, even
he shall be for our God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as though he had said,
&#8220;Though the Lord had for a time repudiated you as well as your fathers,
when he drove you here and there and scattered you, yet now God has gathered
you, and for this end &#8212; that you may be his people: ye shall then be the
peculiar people of God, though ye are small in number and contemptible in your
condition.&#8221;  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm94</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds, these remnants

by God almost all of them princes. It then follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Ekron shall be as a
Jebusite</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some explain thus &#8212; that the
citizens of Ekron would dwell in Jerusalem, which the Jebusites had formerly
possessed; and others give another view, but nothing to the purpose. The Prophet
speaks not here of God&#8217;s favor to the citizens of Ekron, but on the
contrary shows the difference between God&#8217;s chosen people and heathen
nations, who gloried in their own good fortune: hence he says, that they should
be like the Jebusites, for they at length would have to endure a similar
destruction. We indeed know, that the Jebusites had been driven out of that
town, when Jerusalem was afterwards built; but it was done late, even under
David. As then they had long held that place and were at length dislodged, this
is the reason why the Prophet says, that though the citizens of Ekron seemed now
to be in the very middle of the holy land, they would be made like the
Jebusites, for the Lord would drive away and destroy them all. He afterwards

<div><font face="Palatino">He concludes what he had been speaking of, &#8212;
that God would be the guardian of his chosen people, so as to repel on every
side the violent assaults of enemies. It is then the same as though he had said,
&#8220;though the Church is not strongly fortified, it shall yet be impregnable,
for God&#8217;s protection is of more value than all human strength, than all
aids and helps.&#8221; God then compares himself here to a moat and a bulwark,
and other kinds of fortresses, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will be</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a camp to my
house</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He mentions here house rather than city,
that the Jews might feel confident that there was sufficient help in God alone,
though they might dwell in a private house or in a cottage. &#8220;My Church,
though it be a small house, will I yet surround with my defences, so as to
render it safe from all harm.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the
army</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from him that passes through, and
from him that returns</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He places the army in
opposition to the house; and thus he exhorts the Jews, not to regard their own
strength, but to know that God alone is far better shall all armies. Though then
the whole world united together and collected all its forces, he still bids them
to be calmly confident, for God alone would be sufficient to put to flight all
armies. And according to the same meaning he refers to him that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>passes through
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and who
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>returns</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
as though he had said, &#8220;Though enemies may wander through the whole earth
and occupy it from one end to the other, yet I will cause my house to remain
safe.&#8221; By him that returns, he intimates, that though enemies renewed
their armies the second and the third time, yet God&#8217;s strength would be
always sufficient to check their assaults. In a word, what is here taught is the
perpetuity of the safety of God&#8217;s people, for he will never be wearied in
defending them, nor will his power be ever lessened. It often happens that those
who with the best intention succor their neighbors, by degrees grow wearied, or
they may have their efforts prevented by various events; but the Prophet tells
us, that God is not like men, wearied or unable, after having once helped his
people and repelled their enemies; for he will be always ready to aid his
people, were enemies to renew the battle a hundred times.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>enemy</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then he means forces; by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>passing

by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>returning</i></font><font face="Palatino">,

new army and repairing his strength.

<div><font face="Palatino">At length he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And pass shall no more the
extortioner through them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This sentence
explains what he had figuratively expressed, &#8212; that though the Jews had
been exposed to the will of their enemies, yet God would not hereafter suffer
them to be unjustly treated and to be plundered as they had been: for under the
name of extortioner he includes all plunderers who had spoiled the miserable
Jews of their goods. Then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I have seen with mine
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It would be frigid, nay insipid, to
explain this clause as some do, that is, as though the Prophet had said, &#8212;
that he related what had been made known to him from above: for on the contrary
God testifies here, that he had seen with his eyes how cruelly and disgracefully
the Jews had been treated. And some, while they regard God as the speaker, very
unwisely give this explanation, &#8212; that God already foresaw what he would
do. But evidently God assigns here, as I have said, a reason why he purposed to
deliver the Jews from injuries, and for the future to keep them safe and defend
them; and the reason given is, because he saw what grievous wrongs they were
suffering. And the Prophet speaks according to the usual manner adopted in
Scripture; for though nothing is hid from God&#8217;s eyes, yet he is rightly
said to see what he takes notice of, and what he declares must be accounted for
before his tribunal. Though then God saw even before the creation of the world
what was to take place afterward in all ages, yet he is rightly said to see what
he begins to call to judgment. The Jews indeed thought they were neglected by
him; for the Scripture everywhere says, that God closes his eyes, is asleep,
lies down, forgets, cares not, when he hides himself and appears not as the
avenger of wrongs. Hence, on the other hand, the Lord declares here, that he saw
with his eyes those things which were not to be tolerated, inasmuch as enemies
had passed all bounds, and had so far advanced and indulged in wantonness, that
their pride and cruelty were become intolerable.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet here briefly shows the manner in which
the Church was to be restored; for a king from the tribe and family of David
would again arise, to restore all things to their ancient state. And this is the
view given everywhere by the Prophets; for the hope of the ancient people, as
our hope, was founded on Christ. Inasmuch then as things were as yet in a
decayed state among the Jews, Zechariah here testifies that God had not in vain
formerly spoken so often by his servants concerning the advent of a Redeemer,
but that a firm hope was to be entertained, until the prophecies were in due
time fulfilled. As then Zechariah has been hitherto speaking of the prosperous
and happy state of the Church, he now confirms what he had said; and this was
especially necessary, for they could not, as I have already said, have raised up
their minds so as to feel confidence as to their salvation, without having a
Mediator set before them. But as the faithful were then in great grief and
sorrow, Zechariah here exhorts them to perseverance: for by bidding them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rejoice
greatly</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and even to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shout for
joy</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he no doubt intimates, that though grief
and sorrow took fast hold on their hearts, they ought yet to strive manfully, so
as to receive the favor of God; for they must have a hundred times succumbed
under their evils, had they not Christ before their eyes; not indeed in a carnal
manner, but in the mirror of the word; as the faithful see in that what is far
distant and even hidden from them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand, first, why the Prophet here
makes such a sudden reference to Christ; and secondly, why he does not simply
exhort the faithful to rejoice, but encourages them greatly to exult as though
they were already in a safe and most happy condition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>king</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
the Prophet intimates, that except they thought God unfaithful in his promises,
they were to entertain hope, until the kingdom of David, then apparently fallen,
arose again. As God then would have himself acknowledged faithful, and his
adoption counted fixed and ratified in the Messiah, it is no wonder that the
Prophet now briefly refers to a king; for this mode of speaking was well known
by the people. And we have also seen elsewhere, that when the Prophets speak of
the safety of the Church, they mention a king, because the Lord designed to
gather again the dispersed Church under one head, even Christ. And no doubt
there would ever remain a dreadful dispersion, were not Christ the bond of
union. He then says that a king would come. But he speaks not as of a king
unknown; he only reminds them that God would be true and faithful to his
promises. Now since the whole law, and adoption, must have vanished away, except
Christ came, his coming ought to have been patiently waited
for.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Further, that God&#8217;s children might be more
confirmed, he says also that this king would come to the people,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the daughter of
Sion</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as though he had said, that God, for the
sake of the whole Church, had fixed the royal throne in the family of David: for
if the king was to come, that he might indulge in his own triumphs, and be
contented with pomps and pleasures, it would have been but a small and wholly
barren consolation: but as God in determining to send the Messiah, provided for
the safety of the whole Church, which he had promised to do, the people might
here derive solid confidence. It is not then a matter of small moment, when the
Prophet teaches us, that the king would come to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sion</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and to Jerusalem; as though he had said, &#8220;This king shall not come for his
own sake like earthly kings, who rule according to their own caprice, or for
their own advantage:&#8221; but he reminds us, that his kingdom would be for the
common benefit of the whole people, for he would introduce a happy
state.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards states what sort of king he was to be.
He first names him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>just</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
and then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>preserved</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or <i>saved</i>. As to the word, just, it ought, I think, to be taken in an
active sense, and so the word which follows:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Just</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saved</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is called the king of the chosen people, for he would bring to them
righteousness and salvation. Both words depend on this clause, &#8212; that
there would come a king to Sion. If he came privately for himself, he might have
been for himself just and saved, that is, his righteousness and salvation might
have belonged to himself or to his own person: but as he came for the sake of
others, and has been for them endued with righteousness and salvation; then the
righteousness and salvation of which mention is made here, belong to the whole
body of the Church, and ought not to be confined to the person of the king. Thus
is removed every contention, with which many have foolishly, or at least, very
inconsiderately, wearied themselves; for they have thought that the Jews cannot
be otherwise overcome, and that their perverseness cannot be otherwise checked,
than by maintaining, that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[&ccedil;wn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nusho</i>, must be taken actively; and they have quoted some passages of
Scripture, in which a verb in Niphal is taken in an active sense. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm96</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But
what need there is of undertaking such disputes, when we may well agree on the
subject? I then concede to the Jews, that Christ is saved or preserved, and that
he is said to be so by Zechariah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must see what this salvation is which belongs
to Christ. This we may gather from what is said by the Prophet. We are not then
to contend here about words, but to consider what the subject is, that is, that
a just and saved king comes to his chosen: and we know that Christ had no need
of salvation himself. As then he was sent by the Father to gather a chosen
people, so he is said to be saved because he was endued with power to preserve
or save them. We then see that all controversy is at an end, if we refer those
two words to Christ&#8217;s kingdom, and it would be absurd to confine them to
the person of one man, for the discourse is here concerning a royal person; yea,
concerning the public condition of the Church, and the salvation of the whole
body. And certainly when we speak of men, we say not that a king is safe and
secure, when he is expelled from his kingdom, or when his subjects are disturbed
by enemies, or when they are wholly destroyed. When therefore a king, deprived
of all authority, sees his subjects miserably oppressed, he is not said to be
saved or preserved. But the case of Christ, as I have said, is special; for he
does not exercise dominion for his own sake, but for the preservation of his
whole people. Hence with regard to grammar, I can easily allow that Christ is
called just and saved, passively; but as to the matter itself, he is just with
reference to his people, and also saved or preserved, for he brings with him
salvation to the lost; for we know that the Jews were then almost in a hopeless
state.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He however at the same time adds, that the king would
be saved, not because he would be furnished with arms and forces, or that he
would defend his people after the manner of men; for he says, that he would be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>poor</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm97</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He must
then be otherwise preserved safe than earthly princes are wont to be, who fill
their enemies with fear, who fortify their borders, prepare an army, and set up
every defense to ward off assaults. Zechariah teaches us, that Christ would be
otherwise preserved, as he would prove superior to his enemies through a divine
power. As then he is poor, he must be exposed to all kinds of injuries; for we
see, that when there is no earthly fortress, all the wicked immediately fly
together as it were to the prey. If Christ then is poor, he cannot preserve his
own people, nor can he prosper in his kingdom. It hence follows, that he must be
furnished with celestial power, in order to continue himself safe, and in order
to prevent harm to his Church; and this is what Zechariah will presently tell
us, and more clearly express. It is now sufficient briefly to state his
object.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Riding on an ass, the colt, the
foal of an ass</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm98</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some
think that the ass is not mentioned here to denote poverty, for they who
excelled in power among the people were then in the habit of riding on asses.
But it seems to me certain, that the Prophet added this clause to explain the
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yn[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>oni</i>, poor; as though he had said, that the king of whom he spoke would
not be distinguished by a magnificent and splendid appearance like earthly
princes, but would appear in a sordid or at least in an ordinary condition, so
as not to differ from the humblest and lowest of the people. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm99</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He then
bids the faithful to raise up their eyes to heaven, in order to come to the true
knowledge of Christ&#8217;s kingdom, and to feel assured that righteousness and
salvation are to be expected from him. How so? Because he will be accompanied
with nothing that may strike men with fear, but will serve as an humble and
obscure individual. We may also here add, that righteousness and salvation must
be understood according to the character of Christ&#8217;s kingdom; for as the
kingdom of Christ is not temporal or what passes away, we conclude that the
righteousness he possesses is to be perpetual, together with the salvation which
he brings. But I am not disposed ingeniously to speak here of the righteousness
of faith; for I think, on the contrary, that by the word is meant here a right
order of things, as all things were then among the people in a state of
confusion; and this might be easily proved by many passages of
Scripture.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum of the whole is, that the predictions by
which God gave to his chosen people a hope of redemption were not vain or void;
for at length in due time Christ, the son of David, would come forth, &#8212;
secondly, that this king would be just, and saved or preserved; for he would
restore things into order which were in a disgraceful state of confusion,
&#8212; and thirdly, he adds, that this king would be poor; for he would ride on
an ass, and would not appear in great eminence, nor be distinguished for arms,
or for riches, or for splendor, or for number of soldiers, or even for royal
trappings which dazzle the eyes of the vulgar: he shall
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ride on an
ass</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This prophecy we know was fulfilled in Christ; and
even some of the Jews are constrained to confess that the Prophet&#8217;s words
can be justly applied to none else. Yet they do not acknowledge as the Christ of
God the Son of Mary; but they think that the Prophet speaks of their imaginary
Messiah. Now we, who are fully persuaded and firmly maintain that the Christ
promised has appeared and performed his work, do see that it has not been said
without reason that he would come
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>poor</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>riding on an
ass</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It was indeed designed that there should
be a visible symbol of this very thing; for he mounted an ass while ascending
into Jerusalem a short time before his death. It is indeed true, that the
Prophet&#8217;s words are metaphorical: when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come shall a king, riding on an
ass</i></font><font face="Palatino">, the words are figurative; for the Prophet
means, that Christ would be as it were an obscure person, who would not make an
appearance above that of the common people. That this is the real meaning is no
doubt true. But yet there is no reason why Christ should not afford an example
of this in mounting an ass.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I will adduce a similar instance: it is said in the
twenty second Psalm, &#8216;They have cast lots on my garments.&#8217; The
metaphor there is no doubt apparent, which means that David&#8217;s enemies
divided his spoils. He therefore complains that those robbers, by whom he had
been unjustly treated, had deprived him of all that he had: and fulfilled has
this been in a literal manner, so that the most ignorant must acknowledge that
it has not in vain been foretold. We now then understand how well do these
things agree &#8212; that the Prophet speaks metaphorically of the humble
appearance of Christ; and yet that the visible symbol is so suitable, that the
most ignorant must acknowledge that no other Christ but he who has already
appeared is to be expected.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I omit many frivolous things, which in no degree tend
to explain the Prophet&#8217;s meaning, but even pervert it, and destroy faith
in prophecy: for some think that Christ rode on an ass, and also on a colt,
because he was to govern the Jews, who had been previously accustomed to bear
the yoke of the law, and that he was also to bring the Gentiles to obedience,
who had been hitherto unnameable. But these things are very frivolous. It is
enough for us to know what the Prophet means. It afterwards follows

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here expresses more clearly what he had
briefly referred to by the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>poor</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
and by the metaphor which we have explained. Hence he says, that there would be
no horses, no chariots, no bows, no warlike instruments in Christ&#8217;s
kingdom; for tranquillity would prevail in it. The sum of the whole is, that
Christ and his people would not be kept safe and secure by human defences, by
means of many soldiers and of similar helps being at hand; but that God would
restrain, and even compose and allay all warlike commotions, so that there would
be no need of such aids. We now understand the Prophet&#8217;s
design.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must notice the language here used. God
declares here that he would be the giver of peace, so that the Messiah would
continue safe in his kingdom; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will cut off</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says; for it might have been
objected &#8212; &#8220;If he is to be poor, what hope can there be of
safety?&#8221; The answer is, because it will be God&#8217;s work to restrain
all the assaults of enemies. He means, in short, that the Messiah&#8217;s
kingdom would be safe, because God from heaven would check all the rage of
enemies, so that however disposed they might be to do harm, they would yet find
themselves held captive by the hidden bridle of God, so as not to be able to
move a finger.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But after having said that the Jews and Israelites
would be safe, though stripped naked of all defences, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will speak peace to the
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, though he will not use
threats or terrors, nor bring forth great armies, yet the nations will obey him;
for there will be no need of employing any force. To speak peace then to the
nations means, that they will calmly hear, though not terrified nor threatened.
Some with more ingenuity make the meaning to be that Christ, who reconciles the
Father to us, will proclaim this favor of reconciliation; but the Prophet, as I
think, with more simplicity, says, that Christ would be content with his own
word, inasmuch as the Gentiles would become obedient, and quietly submit to his
authority. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm100</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
import of the whole is, that Christ would so rule far and wide, that the
farthest would live contentedly under his protection, and not cast off the yoke
laid on them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He states in the last place, that his dominion would
be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from sea to

them all. For we must bear in mind what I said at the beginning &#8212; that the
Prophet here strengthens the minds of the godly, and on this account, because
the Messiah, on whose coming was founded the gratuitous adoption of the people,
as well as their hope of salvation, had not yet appeared. We now then understand
the real meaning of this passage. He then adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here he applies his former doctrine to its right use,
so that the faithful might emerge from their sorrow, and come to that joy which
he had before encouraged them to entertain. He then addresses Jerusalem, as
though he had said, &#8220;There is no reason for thee to torment thyself with
perplexed and anxious thoughts, for I will accomplish what I have promised
&#8212; that I would become a deliverer to my people.&#8221; For this doubt
might have occurred to them &#8212; &#8220;Why does he exhort us to rejoice,
while the Church of God is still in part captive, and while those who have
returned to their country are miserably and cruelly harassed by their
enemies?&#8221; To this objection Zechariah answers in the person of God &#8212;
that God would be able to deliver them, though they were sunk in the deepest
gulf. We hence see how this verse harmonises with the other verses: he had
before spoken of the happy state of the Church under Christ as its king; but as
the condition of the people then was very hard and miserable, he adds, that
deliverance was to be expected from God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must observe, that a pronoun feminine is here
used, when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>even
thou</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or, thou also. Both the Latins and Greeks
have been deceived by the ambiguity of the language used, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm102</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
have thought that the words are addressed to Christ, as though he was to draw
his captives from a deep pit; but God here addresses his Church, as though he
had said, &#8220;Hear thou.&#8221; And the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;g</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gam</i>, is emphatical, meaning this &#8212; &#8220;I see that I do not
prevail much with you, for ye are in a manner overwhelmed by your calamities,
and no hope refreshes you, as you think yourselves visited, as it were, with a
thousand deaths; but still, though a mass of evils disheartens you, or at least
so far oppresses you as to render inefficacious what I say &#8212; though, in
short, ye be of all men the most miserable, I will yet redeem your
captives.&#8221; But God addresses the whole Church, as in many other places
under the character of a wife.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the blood of thy
covenant</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This seems not to belong properly to
the Church, for there is no other author of the covenant but God himself; but
the relation, we know, between God and his people, as to the covenant, is
mutual. It is God&#8217;s covenant, because it flows from him; it is the
covenant of the Church, because it is made for its sake, and laid up as it were
in its bosom. And the truth penetrated more fully into the hearts of the godly,
when they heard that it was not only a divine covenant, but that it was also the
covenant of the people themselves:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then by the blood of thy
covenant</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. Some refer this, but very
unwisely, to circumcision, for the Prophet no doubt had regard to the
sacrifices. It was then the same as though he had said &#8212; &#8220;Why do ye
offer victims daily in the temple? If ye think that you thus worship God, it is
a very gross and insane superstition. Call then to mind the end designed, or the
model given you from above; for God has already promised that he will be
propitious to you, by expiating your sins by the only true sacrifice: And for
this end offer your sacrifices, and that blood will bring expiation with it. Now
since God has not in vain appointed your sacrifices, and ye observe them not in
vain, no doubt the benefit will come at length to light, for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have sent forth thy
captives</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For God does not reconcile himself to
men, that he may destroy or reduce them to nothing, or that he may suffer them
to pine away and die; for why does God pardon men, but that he may deliver them
from destruction?&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm103</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive why the Prophet thus speaks of the
blood of the covenant in connection with the salvation of the whole people.
&#8220;Ye daily offer victims,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and the blood is poured on
the altar: God has not appointed this in vain.&#8221; Now since God receives you
into favor, that ye may be safe, he will therefore deliver the captives of his
Church; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will send
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says, or, have sent forth
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy

tense what he would do in future.</font><br></div>

the pit in which there </i></font><font face="Palatino">is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>no

itself would destroy miserable men without being drawn forth by a power from
above. In short, he means, first, that the Jews were sunk in the deep; and
secondly, that thirst would consume them, so that death was nigh at hand, except
they were miraculously delivered by God: but he reminds them, that no impediment
would prevent God from raising them to light from the deepest darkness. We then
see that this was added, that the Jews might learn to struggle against all
things that might strengthen unbelief, and feel assured that they would be
preserved safe, for it is God&#8217;s peculiar work to raise the dead. This is
the meaning. He now adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Zechariah proceeds with the same subject. He bids the
Jews suddenly to retake themselves to their fortress. There is no doubt but that
he means by that term the holy land; nor do I oppose the opinion of those who
think the temple to be intended: for Jerusalem and the whole of Judea is called
a fortress, and for this reason, because God had chosen his sanctuary there. It
is then the same, as though one wishing to collect a dispersed and straggling
band of soldiers were to say, &#8220;To the standard, to the standard;&#8221;
or, &#8220;To the troop, to the troop.&#8221; For though Judea was not then
fortified, nay, Jerusalem itself had no high wall or strong towers, yet they had
God as their stronghold, and this was impregnable; for he had promised that the
Jews would be safe under the shadow of his wings, though exposed to the caprices
of all around them. Nor does he here address them only who had returned, or the
exiles who still remained scattered in the East; but by this declaration he
encourages the whole Church, that they might be fully persuaded that when
assembled under the protection of God, they were as fortified as though they
were on every side surrounded by the strongest citadels, and that there would be
no access open to enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Return ye
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the
stronghold</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This could not have appeared
unreasonable; for we know that when they were building the city their work was
often interrupted; and we know also that the temple was not then fortified by a
wall. But Zechariah teaches them, that in that state of things there was
sufficient defense in God alone. Though then the Jews were not made safe by
moats, or by walls, or by mounds, he yet reminds them, that God would be
sufficient to defend them, and that he would be to them, as it is said in
another place, a wall and a rampart.

<div><font face="Palatino">But it is not without reason that he calls them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the captives of
hope</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for many had wholly alienated themselves
from God and altogether fallen away, so as to be unworthy of any promise. By
this mark then he distinguishes between the faithful captives and those who had
wholly degenerated and separated themselves from the family of God, so as no
more to be counted among his people. And this ought to be carefully noticed,
which interpreters have coldly passed by. They have indeed said, that they are
called captives of hope, because they hoped to be saved; but they have not
observed the distinction, by which Zechariah intended to convey reproof to the
unbelieving Jews. It was therefore not without meaning that he directed his word
to the faithful only, who were not only captives, but also captives having hope.

carry on a warfare under the banner of the cross, until he appear to us from
heaven to gather us into his blessed kingdom, &#8212; O grant, that we may
patiently bear all evils and all troubles: and as Christ once for all poured
forth the blood of the new and eternal covenant, and gave us a symbol of it in
the Holy Supper, may we, confiding in so sacred a seal, never doubt but that he
will be always propitious to us, and render manifest to us the fruit of his
reconciliation, when after having supported us for a season under the burden of
those miseries by which we are now oppressed, thou gatherest us into that
blessed and perfect glory, which has been procured for us by the blood of Christ

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND FIFTY-FOURTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">IN yesterday&#8217;s lecture the Prophet exhorted the
Jews to assemble into that stronghold of which God was to be the guardian. And
we have said that Jerusalem was then to the godly an impregnable fortress,
though for the most part without walls, because the place was as it were sacred
to God, and as under his care and protection. He now adds a confirmation of this
truth, that they would be doubly more blessed who had resorted to Jerusalem than
their fathers before their exile: for a comparison is no doubt made between them
and their fathers. From the reign of David until the exile, God had proved by
many tokens that he had a care for that people; he afterwards raised up, as it
were, a new Church, that is, when a liberty to return was granted to the Jews.
The meaning then here is, that if the fathers before they were driven from their
country had experienced God kind and bountiful, those who had now returned to
their country would find God much more bountiful towards his new Church. We now
then understand what he means by double, even double happiness; for God would
increase his blessings to the Jews, though their condition was then by no means
desirable; nay, very hard according to the estimation of the world. But he says,
that he declared from that day, intimating, that though the effect of this
prophecy was not immediately apparent, yet he spoke with confidence; for they
would in course of time find that nothing had been said to them in vain or
rashly. The Prophet then shows &#8212; here, that he spoke with perfect
confidence, and this in order to gain credit to the promise, lest the Jews
should doubt that what they heard from the mouth of Zechariah should at length
be made evident to them.

<div><font face="Palatino">God declares here that the Jews would be the
conquerors of all nations, though they were then despised. That people, we know,
were hated by all; and they were at the same time weak, and had hardly any
strength, so as to be able to resist the wrongs done them on every side. As then
this trial might have terrified weak minds, the Prophet says that the Jews would
be as it were the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bow</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and <i>the quiver </i>of God, so that they would be able to pierce all nations
with their arrow; and that they would also be like a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sword</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
which would wound and lay prostrate the strongest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive the meaning of the words, and see
also the reason why the Prophet made this addition, even because the Jews were
filled with terror on seeing themselves surrounded on every side by violent and
strong enemies, to whom they were very unequal in strength. Now, these
similitudes we know occur elsewhere in Scripture, and their meaning seems to be
this &#8212; that the Jews would be the conquerors of all nations, not by their
own prowess, as they say, but because the Lord would guide and direct them by
his own hand. For what is a bow except it be bent? and the bow itself is
useless, except the arrow be discharged. The Prophet then teaches us, that
though the Jews could do nothing of themselves, yet there was strength enough in
God&#8217;s hand alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have bent for
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judah as a
bow</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Lord reminds the Jews of his own
power, that they might not regard their own strength, but acknowledge that they
were made strong from above, and that strength to overcome their enemies would
be given them. Hence he compares Ephraim to a quiver. But we have seen
yesterday, that Judah and Ephraim are to be taken as the same; for as it had
been a divided body, God intimates here, that when the Jews became again united
and joined together, and when the ten tribes showed brotherly kindness towards
the kingdom of Judah, then the people would be to him like a bow well furnished,
being fully supplied with arrows. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm105</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will rouse thy sons, O Sion,
against thy sons, O Javan</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This apostrophe is
more emphatical than if the third person had been adopted; for by addressing
first Sion, and then Greece, he shows that he possesses power over all nations,
so that he raises up the one and casts down the other, as he
pleases.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Ivan</i>, we have elsewhere seen that it is to be taken for Greece, and now
for all the countries beyond sea. Yet many think that the word Jonah is derived
from this Hebrew word, and, as it often happens, is corruptly pronounced. But we
may gather from many instances that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Ivan</i>, is put for Greece, or for distant countries, and specifically for
Macedonia. It is then the same as though he had said &#8212; That the Jews would
be superior to all heathen nations, even were they to unite together and bring
vast forces from distant lands. For the Greeks could not have waged war in Judea
with a small force; they must have brought with them large armies, to fight in a
strange country and unknown to them. Nor could the Jews have attacked the
Grecians or other remote nations, except they were favored with aid from heaven.
For this reason also he adds, that they would be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>like a
sword</i></font><font face="Palatino">, by which a strong man can destroy others
of less power. Let us now go on &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He goes on with the same subject, but explains what I
have said &#8212; that victory is promised to the Jews, not that which they
could gain by their own power, but that which should happen to them beyond their
expectation; for this is what is meant when he says, that God would be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seen over
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For though the events of all wars depend
on God, yet he is said to be seen where there is a remarkable victory, which
cannot be accounted for by men. When unequal armies engage, it is no wonder when
one becomes victorious; and it may sometimes be that a less number overcomes a
greater, even because it exceeded the other in courage, in counsel, in skill, or
in some other way, or because the larger army fought from a disadvantageous
position, or trusting in its own strength rushed on inconsiderately. But when
consternation alone dejects one party and renders the other victorious, in this
case the power of God becomes evident. And even heathens have thought that men
are confounded from above when courage fails them; and this is most true. We now
then understand why the Prophet says, that God would be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seen over
</i></font><font face="Palatino">the Jews, even because they would conquer their
enemies, not by usual means, not after an earthly manner, but in a wonderful
way, so that it would appear evident to be the work of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go forth shall his arrow as
lightning</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He again repeats and confirms what
we have already observed that there would be no movement among the Jews, no
celerity, but what would be like the sword, which lies quiet on the ground,
except it be taken up by the hand of man, and what also would be like the arrow,
which can do no harm except it be thrown by some one. We then see that the
victory mentioned before is ascribed to God alone. And for the same reason he
adds what follows, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">
would </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>come with the shout of a
trumpet</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and also, with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the whirlwind of the
south</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In a word, he means that the work of God
would be evident when the Jews went forth against the enemies by whom they had
been oppressed and would still be oppressed. That they might not then compare
their own with their enemies&#8217; strength, the Prophet here brings God before
them, by whose authority, guidance, and power this war was to be carried on. And
then, that he might extol God&#8217;s power, he says, that he would come with
the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shout of a
trumpet</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the whirlwind of the
south</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Interpreters take the whirlwinds of the south simply
for violent storms; for we know that the most impetuous whirlwinds arise from
the south. But as the Prophet joins the whirlwinds of the south to the shout of
a trumpet, he seems to me to allude to those miracles by which God showed to the
Jews in a terrific manner his power on Mount Sinai, for the desert of Teman and
Mount Paran were in that vicinity. We have seen a similar passage in the third
chapter of Habakkuk
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;350301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
3:1, &#8220;God,&#8221; he said, &#8220;shall come from Teman, the Holy One from
Mount Paran.&#8221; The Prophet&#8217;s object was to encourage the Jews to
entertain hope; for God, who had long concealed himself and refrained from
helping them, would at length come forth to their aid. How? He reminded them in
that passage of the records of ancient history, for God had made known his power
on Mount Sinai, in the desert of Teman, and it was the south region with regard
to Judea; and we also know that trumpets sounded in the air, and that all this
was done that the Jews might reverently receive the law, and also that they
might feel certain that they would be always safe under God&#8217;s hand, since
he thus shook the elements by his nod, and filled the air with lightnings and
storms and whirlwinds, and also made the air to ring with the shouts of
trumpets. It is for the same reason that the Prophet speaks in this passage,
when he says, that God would make himself known as formerly, when he astonished
the people by the shouts of trumpets, and also when he appeared in whirlwinds on
Mount Sinai.

<div><font face="Palatino">He expresses again the same thing in other words
&#8212; that God would be like a shadow to his people, so that he would with an
extended hand protect them from their enemies. Since the Jews might have justly
felt a distrust in their own strength, the Prophet continually teaches them that
their safety depended not on earthly aids, but that God alone was sufficient,
for he could easily render them safe and secure. He also adds, that there would
be to them plenty of bread and wine to satisfy them. He seems here indeed to
promise too great an abundance, as by its abuse luxury came, for he says, that
they would be satiated and be like the drunken;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall
drink</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and shall make a noise as through
wine</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Certainly those who drink wine
moderately, do not make noise, but they are as composed and quiet after dinner
as those who fast. Zechariah then seems here to make an unreasonable promise,
even that of excess in meat and drink. But we have elsewhere seen that wherever
the Holy Spirit promises abundance of good things he does not give loose reigns
to men&#8217;s lusts, but his object is only to show that God will be so
bountiful to his children that they shall stand in need of nothing, that they
shall labor under no want. Nay, the affluence of blessings is to try our
frugality, for when God pours forth as it were with a liberal hand more than
what is needful, he thus tries the temperance of each of us; for when in the
enjoyment of great abundance, we of our own accord restrain ourselves, we then
really show that we are grateful to God. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm107</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is indeed true, that cheerfulness for abundance of
blessings is allowed us, for it is often said in the law, &#8220;Thou shalt
rejoice before thy God,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
12:18;) but we must bear in mind, that frugal use of blessings is required, in
order that the gifts of God may not be converted to a sinful
purpose.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then the Prophet does not here excite or stimulate
the Jews to intemperance, that they might fill themselves with too much food, or
inebriate themselves with too much wine; but he only promises that there would
be no want of either food or drink when God blessed them as in former days. And
this seems also to be specified at the end of the verse, when he mentions the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>horns of the
altar</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He had previously said, that they would
be full as the bowls were; but when he adds, &#8220;the horns of the
altar,&#8221; he no doubt reminds them of temperance, that they were to feast as
though they were in God&#8217;s presence. They were indeed accustomed to pour
out the wine and the oil on the horns of the altar; but, at the same time, since
they professed that they offered from their abundance of wine and oil some
first-fruits to God, it behaved them to remember that their wine was sacred,
that their oil was sacred, as both proceeded from God. The Prophet then
declares, that the Jews would be thus enriched and replenished with all good
things, and that they were yet to remember, that they were to live as in
God&#8217;s presence, lest they should by luxury pollute what he had consecrated
to a legitimate end. He then adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He continues the same subject, but uses various
figures, that he might more fully confirm what then was incredible. He indeed
reminds them that God would not save his people in an ordinary way, such as is
common to men. He compares them to sheep, that they might know, as I have said
already, that their salvation would come from heaven, as they were themselves
weak, and had no strength and no power; for to show this was the object of this
comparison. He declares then that the Jews would be saved, because God would
supply them with every thing necessary to conquer their enemies; but that he
would in a wonderful manner help their weakness, even like a shepherd when he
rescues his sheep from the jaws of a wolf. For the sheep, which escapes death by
the coming of the shepherd, have no reason to boast of victory, but all the
praise is due to the shepherd. So also God says, that it will be his work to
deliver the Jews from their enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his own
people</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he seems to confine to his elect what
appeared too general; for he had said
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>save then will
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is however certain that the people who
were then small, had been cut off, so that the greater part had perished; but at
the same time it was true that God was a faithful guardian of his people, for
there were then many Israelites, naturally descended from their common father
Abraham, who were only in name Israelites.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds another similitude, &#8212; that they
would be elevated high, like precious stones in a crown, which are borne on the
head of a king, as though he had said, that they would be a royal priesthood
according to what is said in the law. He had said before,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall subdue the
stones</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or, with the stones,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of a
sling</i></font><font face="Palatino">. More correct seems to be the opinion of
those who read </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with the stones of
a sling</i></font><font face="Palatino">, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm108</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
is, that the Jews would conquer their enemies, not with swords, nor with arrows,
but only with stones, in the same manner as Goliath was slain by David. Though
not given to warlike arts, nor exercised in the use of arms, they would yet, as
the Prophet shows, be conquerors; for their slings would be sufficient for the
purpose of slaying their enemies. But some think that heathens and the
unbelieving are compared to the stones of the sling, because they are worthless
and of no account; which at the first sight seems ingenious, but it is a
strained view. It is not at the same time improper to consider that there is
here an implied contrast between the stones of the sling, and the stones of a
crown; the Jews would cast stones from their slings to destroy their enemies,
and they themselves would be precious stones. The Prophet seems here to
represent the holy land as the chief part of the whole world.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Elevated</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, shall be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the stones of
crown over the land </i></font><font face="Palatino">of God. Had he said over
Egypt or over Assyria, the connection of the clauses would not have been so
appropriate; but he names Judea, as the head of the world, and that the Jews,
when prosperous and happy in it, would be like the stones of a crown, all the
parts set in due order. In short, he shows, that the favor of God alone and his
blessing, would be sufficient to render the Jews happy, as they would then excel
in honor, enjoy the abundance of all good things, and possess invisible courage
to resist all their adversaries.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now enquire when all these things were
fulfilled. We have said that Zechariah, by promising fullness to the Jews, gave
them no unbridled license to indulge themselves in eating and drinking, but only
expressed and extolled, in hyperbolical terms, the immense kindness and bounty
of God to them. This is one thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But at the same time we must by the way consider
another question: He says, that they would be like
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>arrows and
swords</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Now as they were too much inclined to
shed blood, he seems here to excite them in a manner to take vengeance fully on
their enemies, which was by no means reasonable. The answer to this is plain
&#8212; that the Jews were not to forget what God prescribed in his law: for as
when God promised large abundance of wine, and a plentiful provision, he did not
recall what he had already commanded &#8212; that they were to practice
temperance in eating and drinking; so now when he promises victory over their
enemies, he is not inconsistent with himself, nor does he condemn what he had
once approved, nor abrogate the precept by which he commanded them, not to
exercise cruelty towards their enemies, but to restrain themselves, and to show
mercy and kindness. We hence see that we are not to judge from these words what
is right for us to do, or how far we may go in taking revenge on enemies; nor to
determine what liberty we have in eating and drinking. Such things are not to be
learnt from this passage, or from similar passages; for the Prophet here does
only set forth the power of God and his bounty towards his
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now again it may be asked, when has God fulfilled
this, when has he made the Jews far and wide victorious and the destroyers of
their enemies? All Christian expositors give us an allegorical explanation,
&#8212; that God sent forth his armies when he sent forth Apostles into all
parts of the world, who pierced the hearts of men, &#8212; and that he slew with
his sword the wicked whom he destroyed. All this is true; but a simpler meaning
must in the first place be drawn from the words of the Prophet, and that is,
&#8212; that God will render his Church victorious against the whole world. And
most true is this; for though the faithful are not furnished with swords or with
any military weapons, yet we see that they are kept safe in a wonderful manner
under the shadow of God&#8217;s hand. When adversaries exercise cruelty towards
them, we see how God returns their wicked devices on their own heads. In this
way is really fulfilled what we read here, &#8212; even that the children of God
are like arrows and swords, and that they are also preserved as a flock; for
they are too weak to stand their ground, were not the Lord to put forth his
power, when he sees them violently assailed by the wicked. There is then no need
to turn the Prophet&#8217;s words to an allegorical meaning, when this fact is
evident that God&#8217;s Church has been kept safe, because God has ever blunted
all the weapons of enemies; yea, he has often by a strong hand discharged his
arrows and vibrated his sword. For when Alexander the Great had passed over the
sea, when he had marched through the whole circuit of the Mediterranean sea,
when he had filled all the country with blood, he came at length to Judea; how
was it that he left it without committing any slaughter, without exercising any
cruelty, except that God restrained him? It will not weary you, if I relate what
we read in Josephus; and it is true I have no doubt. He says, that when
Alexander came, he was full of wrath, and breathing threats against those Jews
by whom he had not been assisted, and who seemed to have despised his authority:
after having thus given vent to his rage, he at length came into the presence of
Jadeus the high-priest, and seeing him adorned with a mitre, he fell down and
humbly asked pardon; and while all were amazed his answer was &#8212; that God
had appeared to him in that form while he was yet in Greece, and encouraged him
to undertake that expedition. When therefore he saw the image or figure of the
God of heaven in that sacerdotal dress, he was constrained to give glory to God.
Thus far Josephus, whose testimony in this instance has never been
suspected.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is then no reason for any one to weary himself
in finding out the meaning of the Prophet, since this fact is clear enough
&#8212; that God&#8217;s elect have been victorious, because God has ever sent
forth his arrows and vibrated his sword. At the same time there is another view
of this victory; for alien and remote people were subdued by the sword of the
Spirit, even by the truth of the gospel: but this is a sense deduced from the
other; for when we apprehend the literal meaning of the Prophet, an easy passage
is then open to us, by which we may come to the kingdom of Christ. These remarks
refer to the abundance of provisions, as well as to the victory over enemies. It
now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here exclaims at the incredible kindness
of God, that the Jews might learn to raise up their thoughts above the world, as
they were to look for that felicity which he had before mentioned. We then see
that by this exclamation a fuller confirmation is given to what had been said by
the Prophet, as though his words were, &#8212; &#8220;No one ought to judge of
God&#8217;s favor, of which I have spoken, according to his own doings, or
conduct, or experience; but on the contrary, every one of you ought to be filled
with amazement at God&#8217;s incredible kindness, and at his incredible
beauty.&#8221; But by the last word he understands the brightness or splendor,
which appears in all God&#8217;s favors and gifts. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm109</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then concludes by saying, that the abundance of
corn and wine would be so great, that young men and young women would eat and
drink together, and be fully satisfied. Here a frivolous question may be asked,
whether Zechariah allowed the use of wine to young women. But he speaks not
here, as I have said before, of God&#8217;s blessing, as though it were an
incentive to luxury; but what he means is, that the abundance of provisions
would be so great as to be fully sufficient, not only for the old, but also for
young men and young women. We know that when there is but a small supply of
wine, it ought by right of age to be reserved for the old, but when wine so
overflows that young men and young women may freely drink of it, it is a proof
of great abundance. This then is simply the meaning of the Prophet: but
something more shall be said tomorrow on the subject.</font><br></div>

learn to renounce the whole world, and so strive against all unbelief; that we
may not doubt but that thou wilt ever be one kind and gracious Father, and fully
supply whatever is necessary for our support: and may we at the same time live
soberly and temperately, so that we may not be under the power of earthly
things; but with our hearts raised above, aspire after that heavenly bliss to
which thou invites us, and to which thou also guides us by such helps as are
earthly, so that being really united to our head, we may at length reach that

<div><font face="Palatino">ZECHARIAH, after having shown that God would be
bountiful towards the Jews, so that nothing necessary to render life happy and
blessed should be wanting, now reproves them for their unbelief, because they
did not expect from the Lord what he was ready fully to bestow on them. As then
it depended on them only, that they did not enjoy abundance of all blessings, he
charges them with ingratitude: for though he exhorts them to prayer, there is
yet an implied reproof. One by merely reading over the words may think that a
new subject is here introduced, that the Jews are directed to ask of the Lord
what he had previously promised them; but he who will more minutely consider the
whole context, will easily find that what I have stated is true &#8212; that the
Jews are here condemned, and on this account, because they closed the door
against God&#8217;s favor; for they were straitened in themselves, as all the
unbelieving are, who cannot embrace the promises of God; nor is it at all
doubtful but that many made great complaints, when they found themselves
disappointed of their wishes. They had indeed hoped for a most abundant supply
of corn and wine, and had also promised to themselves all kinds of blessings,
yet the Lord, as we have seen in the book of Haggai, had begun to withdraw his
hand, so that they labored under want of provisions; and when mine and thirst
oppressed them, they thought that they had been in a manlier deceived by God. On
this ground the Prophet expostulates with them; they thrust from themselves, by
their want of faith, the favor which had been prepared for them. We now then
understand the Prophet&#8217;s meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He bids them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ask rain of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. They ought indeed to have done this of
themselves without being reminded; for though Christ has delivered to his Church
a form of prayer, it ought yet to be as it were the dictate of nature to seek of
God our daily bread; and it is not without reason that he claims to himself the
name of a Father. The Prophet then does here reprove the Jews for their brutal
stupidity &#8212; that they did not ask rain of the Lord. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>at the late
season</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, at spring time; for rains at
two seasons were necessary for the corn, after sowing and before harvest, and
whenever Scripture speaks of fruitfulness or of a large produce, it mentions
rain at these two seasons. Zechariah in this place only refers to the vernal
before harvest; for in that hot country the earth wanted new moisture, Ask, he
says, rain at the beginning of summer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">,

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yzyzj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chezizim</i>, means clouds, which are as it were preparations for rain. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm110</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He

here the two words, as though he had said, that the rains would be continued
until the ground was saturated and the dryness removed. Some translate,
&#8220;the rain of a shower,&#8221; but this would be too strained. I prefer

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to every one grass in the

enough for the ground. In short, he promises a plentiful irrigation, that

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet, as I have said, confirms the truth,
that the blame justly belonged to the Jews that God did not deal more liberally
with them; for he shows that they had fallen into superstitions, and had thus
turned away the favor of God, which was already certain and nigh to them.
Zechariah does not here condemn foreign nations given to superstitions; but, on
the contrary, he reproves the Jews themselves for leaving the true God, and for
retaking themselves to idols, to soothsayers, and diviners, and for having thus
preferred to feed on their own delusions, rather than to open the door to the
favor of God, who had freely promised that he would suffer them to want nothing.
As then God had kindly invited the Jews to himself, as he had showed himself
ready to do them good, was it not the basest ingratitude in them to turn away to
idols and to attend to magical delusions? for they might have safely acquiesced
in God&#8217;s word. They would not have been deprived of their hope, had they
been firmly persuaded that God had spoken the truth to them. As then they had
done so grievous a wrong to God, as to run after idols, and after the crafts and
impostures of Satan, the Prophet here deservedly condemns them for this
wickedness.</font><br></div>

unbelieving men may try, they can attain nothing, and they will at length find
that they have been miserably deceived by Satan. They have recourse to various
expedients, for unbelief is full of bustle and fervor: &#8220;O! this will not
succeed, I will try something else.&#8221; Thus the unbelieving wander, and
resort to many and various expedients. But the Prophet teaches this general
truth &#8212; that when men turn away from God, they have recourse to vain
things; for there is no truth without God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds, that on account of idols, as well
as of diviners and magicians,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>consolation was given in
vain</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and this he confirms by the event, and
says, that they had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wandered as
sheep</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that they had been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>distressed, because there was no
shepherd</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet no doubt refers here to
the time of exile, that the Jews might learn to be wise, at least by the
teaching of experience; for they had known to their great loss, that without God
there is no real and solid comfort: nor does he without reason upbraid them with
the punishment which their fathers had suffered, for he saw that they were
walking in their steps. Since then the Jews were imitating the depraved
inquisitiveness of their fathers, the Prophet justly charges them, that they did
not acknowledge what, by the event itself, was well known to all; for the common
proverb is, that experience is the teacher of fools. Since they did not become
wise even when smitten, their stupidity was more than proved. We now then
perceive what the Prophet means.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must first notice, that when he bids them to
ask rain of the Lord, he speaks of the kingdom of Christ, as all the Prophets
are wont to do; for since the Redeemer, promised to the Jews, was to be the
author of all blessings, whenever the Prophets speak of his coming, they also
promise abundance of corn, and plentiful provisions, and peace, and everything
necessary for the well-being of the present life. And Zechariah now follows the
same course, when he declares that it was not owing to anything in God that he
did not kindly supply the Jews with whatever they might have wished, but that
the fault was with themselves; for they had by their unbelief, as it has been
said, closed the door against his favor. We must yet ever remember what we
stated yesterday &#8212; that whatever the Prophets have said concerning a
blessed life, ought to be judged of according to the nature of the kingdom of
Christ. It is a strained interpretation to say that rain is heavenly doctrine;
and I do not say that Zechariah spoke allegorically, but he describes under this
common figure the kingdom of Christ &#8212; even that God will fill his elect
with all good things, so that they shall not thirst, nor labor under any
want.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But at the same time we must bear in mind the
exhortation of Christ &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Seek ye first the
kingdom of God; other things,&#8221; he
says,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;shall afterwards be
added.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400633&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
6:33.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then is strangely wrong who thinks that abundance
of food was alone promised to the Jews; for God intended to lead them by degrees
to things higher. The Prophet then no doubt includes here, under one kind, all
things necessary for a happy life; for it is not the will of God to fill his
faithful people in this world as though they were swine; but his design is to
give them, by means of earthly things, a taste of the spiritual life. Hence the
happiness of which Zechariah now speaks is really spiritual; for as godliness
has the promises of the present as well as of the future life,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 4:8,) so the purpose of God was to consult the weakness of his ancient
people, and to set forth the felicity of the spiritual life by means of earthly
blessings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It ought further to be carefully noticed, that the
Jews are here exposed to derision, because they wandered after their own
devices, when God was yet not far from them, and ready to aid them. Since God
then showed himself inclined to kindness, it was a double wickedness in them
that they chose to run after idols, magical arts, and the illusions of Satan,
rather than to acquiesce in God&#8217;s word. And similar is the upbraiding we
meet with in Jeremiah, when God complains that he was forsaken, while yet he was
the fountain of living water, and that the people dug out for themselves
cisterns, dry and full of holes.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
2:13.) But as this evil is very common, let us know that we are here warned to
plant our foot firm on God&#8217;s word, where he promises that he will take
care of us, provided we be satisfied with his favor; nor let us thoughtlessly
run after our own imaginations; for however our own counsels may delight us, and
though some success may sometimes appear, yet the end will ever show us that
most true is what Zechariah teaches us here &#8212; that whatever we may attempt
will be useless and injurious too, for God will take vengeance on our
ingratitude.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must now also observe, that since Zechariah
adduces an example of God&#8217;s vengeance, by which the Jews had found that
they had foolishly sought vain consolations, we ought to take heed, lest we
forget those punishments with which God may have visited us in order to restore
us to himself: let us remember what we ourselves have experienced, and what has
happened to our fathers, even before we were born. Thus then ought the faithful
to apply their minds so as to recount the judgments of God, that they may derive
profit from his scourges. He afterwards adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He had said that the Jews had been driven into exile,
and had been oppressed by their enemies, because they had no shepherd; not
indeed to lessen their fault, for they were wholly inexcusable, since they had
wilfully renounced God, who would have been otherwise their perpetual shepherd:
but he now turns his discourse to the false teachers, to the false prophets and
to the wicked priests. Though then they were all unworthy of pardon, yet God
here justly summons the shepherds first before his tribunal, who had been the
cause of making others to go astray: as when a blind man leads the blind into a
ditch, so ungodly pastors become the cause of ruin to others. We have elsewhere
observed similar passages, in which God threatened priests and prophets with
special punishment, because they had unfaithfully discharged their office; but
yet he did not absolve the common people, for from the least to the greatest
they were guilty; and it is also certain that men are punished for their
obstinacy and wickedness, whenever God gives loose reins to the devil, and
deceives them by ungodly teachers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see the order observed by the Prophet: At
the beginning of the chapter he declares that the Jews were without excuse,
because they had turned aside again to their own superstitions, though God had
severely punished the sins of their fathers, and that thus they had profited
nothing; he also shows that they were acting perversely, if they clamored
against God, that he scantily or badly supported them, for they did not look for
any thing from him, nor solicited by prayer what he was prepared willingly to
grant them. Having thus reproved generally the wickedness of the whole people,
the Prophet now assails the ungodly priests, and says that judgment was nigh
both the shepherd and the he-goats.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He gives the name of pastors to wolves, which is a
common thing. And here the Papists betray their folly, laying hold of words
only, and claiming to themselves all power, because they are called pastors in
the Church, and as though Antichrist was not to reign in the temple of God. Does
not Zechariah give an honorable name to these wicked men who destroyed the
Church of God? Yea, he brings a most heavy charge against them, that they
scattered and trampled under their feet the whole kingdom of God, and yet he
calls them pastors, even because they held the office of pastors, though they
were very far from being faithful, and in no respect attended to their
duties.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then concedes the name of pastors to those who had
been called to rule the people, and to whom this office had been divinely
committed; and yet God declares that he would visit them, because they had
elicited his just displeasure. The same is said of the he-goats, by which
metaphorical name he means all those who were governors, or were in rank above
the common people. Those who injured and cruelly treated the sheep had been
called he-goats by other Prophets, and especially by Ezekiel
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;263417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
34:17.) So then he adds the he-goats to the pastors, because the poor and the
lower orders had been led to ruin through their misconduct. And it hence appears
how dear to God is the salvation of men; for he denounces vengeance on pastors,
though they had not exercised tyranny except on men worthy of such punishment;
for it was the just wages of their sins, that the Lord gave them wolves instead
of shepherds. But though the Jews had merited such a judgment, yet God was angry
with the pastors on account of his constant solicitude for his
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the reason is also added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For visit will God his flock, the
house of Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as though he had said, that he
would not regard what the Jews were, but would regard his own election; for
greatly valued by God is his own adoption; and as he had been pleased to choose
that people, he could not have allowed them to be destroyed. When therefore he
saw that his Church had been so much exposed to destruction through the fault of
the pastors, he alleges here as a reason for his future vengeance, that he could
not endure his favor to be brought to nothing; nor is it to be doubted but that
he mentions here the house of Judah, because he had restored and consecrated
that people to himself, that he might be served by them. He then takes away from
the false pastors every pretense for an excuse, when he brings forward his own
election, as though he had said, &#8220;Though this people had provoked me a
hundred times, and deserved a hundred deaths, yet I intended you to be pastors,
because the house of Judah has been made sacred to me.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the visitation of the flock is different from
that of the shepherds; for God visits the reprobate, being armed with vengeance,
and he visits his own people by aiding them. Now the visitation of the flock
refers to the whole house of Judah: and this was owing, as we have said, to
their gratuitous adoption; yet the Lord suffered many to rush headlong into
ruin, because he delivered only his own elect. It is indeed a mode of speaking
that often occurs in the Prophets &#8212; that God would help the children of
Abraham, when he means only those who were Israelites indeed, and not the
degenerated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds that they would be as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a splendid horse in
war</i></font><font face="Palatino">. A contrast is here no doubt implied
between splendid horses and asses or oxen; for these shepherds who had
tyrannically oppressed God&#8217;s people, are said to be like violent riders
who ride on asses and shamefully abuse them, or like herdsman, who treat their
own oxen inhumanely. God then says that he would ride his people in another
manner, even as the horseman, who sits splendidly on his horse when going to
battle: for even kings, after having ridden a horse in battle, do afterwards
wish it to be well taken care of; and they show much solicitude for their
horses, and even go to the stable that they may see, if possible, with their own
eyes, that they are properly attended to. God then thus intimates, that he
indeed required obedience from his people, and intended to retain his own right,
to ride as it were on his own people; but yet that he would not oppress them,
and that on the contrary he would make them like a splendid horse. We now then
perceive why the Prophet turns his discourse here especially to the false
shepherds, not indeed to extenuate the fault of the whole people, for none among
them was worthy of pardon. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">There is here a confirmation of the last verse, but
the metaphors are different; for he says, that the Jews would be fortified by
every defense necessary for their security; nor is he inconsistent with himself.
In the last chapter he indeed taught us, that though exposed to all kinds of
wrongs, they would yet be safe through aid from heaven; but now he promises that
there would come from them the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>corner-stone, the nail, the
bow</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
exactor</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and this seems a different doctrine;
but it is the same as though he had promised, that though they stood in need of
many helps, they would yet be sufficiently furnished, as God would be ready to
aid them whenever there was need.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the corner-stone he means the firmness of the
building; from the Jews then shall be the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>corner-stone</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
that is, there shall ever be among that people those capable of carrying on the
public government: then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from
thee the nail</i></font><font face="Palatino">; beams, we know, and other parts
of the building, are fastened by nails, and we know also, that the ceiling is
thereby made secure. Zechariah then mentions here all the supports which sustain
a building from its very foundation. He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the bow of
war</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, what is necessary to overcome
enemies; and, lastly, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
exactor</i></font><font face="Palatino">, one who has power over bordering
nations, and demands tribute or tax from them, as conquerors are wont to do from
their subjects.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm112</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see what the Prophet means &#8212; that when
God would manifest his care for his people and openly show his favor, the Jews
would be fortified by all kinds of help, so as to be well established, and that
they would possess so much public authority as to have strength enough to resist
all enemies; in short, that they would gain the fruit of conquest, and constrain
all nations to be tributaries to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If any one asks when has this been fulfilled, my
answer is, that some preludes of this were given when God raised up the
Maccabees, and made the Jews again to live according to their own laws, and to
enjoy their own rights; but no doubt the Prophet includes the whole course of
redemption. As then God redeemed his people only to a small extent until Christ
appeared, it is no wonder that Zechariah, in speaking of full and complete
redemption, extends his words to the kingdom of Christ, and this was necessary.
We hence learn, that the Church stands abundantly firm, and is also furnished
with all needful things, while it continues under the protection of God, and
that it is endued with sufficient power to resist all its enemies. It follows

Jews would be victorious over all nations. Though the Church is fighting under
the cross, she yet triumphs over all the wicked, partly by hope and partly by
present success; for God wonderfully sustains it, and makes the faithful to
possess their souls in patience; and he also protects them by his own power, and
renders them safe amidst all the roarings and insatiable rage of their enemies.
Since then God thus strengthens the minds of his people, and cherishes in them
the hope of salvation, and also defends them against raging assaults, it is no
wonder that the Prophet testifies that the church would be victorious, treading
down, as a giant or a strong man, her enemies in the mire.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">ZECHARIAH pursues the same subject, &#8212; that the
work of redemption, the beginning of which the Jews saw, would not be
incomplete, for the Lord would at length fulfill what he had begun. The Jews
themselves could not acquiesce in those beginnings, which were not a hundredth
part of what God had promised; it was hence necessary for them to raise up their
minds above, that they might hope for much more than what was evident before
their eyes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this truth is very useful to us, for we are wont
to confine God&#8217;s promises to a short duration of time, and when we thus
include him within narrow limits, we prevent him as it were to do what we stand
in need of. Let then the example of the return of the people of Israel ever come
to our minds, for the Lord had promised by his Prophets that they would become
very eminent, and in every way rich and happy; but when this did not take place
after their return to their country, many of the Jews thought that they had been
deceived, as they had expected God to fulfill his word immediately, but they
ought to have suspended their hope and expectation until Christ came to the
world. On this then the Prophet now insists &#8212; that the Jews were to rest
patiently, until the ripened time came, when the Lord would prove that he is not
only in part but a complete redeemer of his people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will strengthen the house of
Judah, and the house of Joseph will I save</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The
kingdom of Israel, we know, had by degrees wholly fallen; for at first four
tribes were driven into exile, and afterwards the whole people perished, so that
all thought that the name of the ten tribes had become extinct. The Lord
afterwards visited the kingdom with dreadful ruin. But it must be observed, that
while the two kingdoms existed, they entertained grievous enmities towards each
other; for the defection which happened under Jeroboam, ever made the Jews
violently to hate their brethren, the Israelites, as they indeed deserved; for
they had in a manner rejected God by rejecting the son of David, and became in a
manner alienated from the body of the Church. Now then Zechariah promises
something uncommon, when he says that the two peoples shall be united, so as to
be again one, as before the defection: for the house of Joseph means the same as
the house of Ephraim; and we know that by taking a part for the whole, the house
of Ephraim is taken for the whole kingdom of Israel. We now then understand the
Prophet&#8217;s meaning &#8212; that the state of the people would be happier
than it had been since the ten tribes separated from the kingdom of Judah, or
from the house of David; for God would gather for himself a Church from all the
children of Abraham.

<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will bring them back and cause

<i>shub</i>; but they are mistaken who think these to be words of different
meanings, because some refer to the one root, and others to the other; nor can
this be maintained: but those who minutely consider the rules of grammar, say
that the verb is a compound, and means that God would not only restore the ten
tribes, but also make them to dwell, that is, give them a fixed habitation in
their country.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm115</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because I have pitied
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some read this in the future tense, but I
retain the past, for the Lord assigns here a reason for their future gathering,
even because he would deal mercifully with his people. He recalls then the
attention of the Jews to the fountains of his mercy, as if he had said,
&#8220;Though they have deserved perpetual ruin, He will yet hear their
greenings, because he will be propitious to them.&#8221; As their calamity was
an hindrance, which prevented the Jews from expecting any such thing, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall be as though I had not
cast them away</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By which words he reminds them
that the punishment which had been inflicted on the people, would be only for a
time. He then bids them to take courage, though they were like the lost or the
dead, for he would put an end to their miseries. And when God says that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had cast away
</i></font><font face="Palatino">his people, it ought to be taken according to
the perceptions of men, as we have observed elsewhere; for adoption was
unchangeable, but external appearance could have led to no other conclusion, but
that the people had been rejected by God. The meaning of the Prophet is,
however, clearly this &#8212; that though God had dealt severely with that
people, and inflicted on them the heaviest punishment on account of their
perfidy, yet his vengeance would not be for ever, for he would give place to
mercy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds another reason,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I Jehovah am their
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He means by this sentence that adoption
would not be void, though he had for a time rejected the Jews: for by calling
himself their God, he reminds them of his covenant, as though he had said, that
he had not in vain made a covenant with Abraham, and promised that his seed
would be blessed. Since then God had pledged his faith to Abraham, he says here
that he would be the God of his people; not that they deserved anything, but
because he had gratuitously chosen both Abraham and his seed.</font><br></div>

not strictly correct, for God is said to hear those who do not flee to him; but
what I have stated is more suitable to this place &#8212; that the people are
stimulated to prayer, as God freely invites us to himself for this end, that is,
that our prayers may harmonise with his promises. This is the meaning. It now
follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He declares the same in other words: he had said in
the last verse, that he would strengthen both the house of Judah and the house
of Joseph, that is, the ten tribes; he now speaks of Ephraim alone, but includes
the kingdom of Judah; and he names Ephraim, not because he deserved to be
honored, or to be preferred to the Jews, for Ephraim had become apostate; but
because the return of the ten tribes was an event more incredible: this is
clearly the reason why the Prophet expressly mentions Ephraim. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm117</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For
even to the very destruction of the city and of the temple, God had continued to
promise restoration to the Jews: the hope then of the Jews was certain and
peculiar to themselves; but as to the Israelites, they were like a putrid
carcass, for they had heard only something here and there, and received only
some portion of the prophecies, as a grain of seed that falls outside of the
field; for they were then as it were alienated from the people of God. We now
then understand what the Prophet means by saying, that the Israelites would be
like giants; for though they had been cast down by their enemies, and then
driven in great dishonor and disgrace into exile, and had been exposed to all
kinds of reproaches, and oppressed by extreme bondage; yet God promises them the
strength of giants.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now we have said that the words contain a part for
the whole; for this promise no doubt belongs especially to the Jews: there is
yet no mention of them, though they were first in rank, and had a better ground
of hope as to their return, and the Lord had already given them some
proof.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rejoice shall their hearts
through wine; and see shall their sons and be glad; exult shall their heart in
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is certain that they had already a
cause for joy, as it is said in the book of Psalms,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;We became like
those who dream,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">when the Lord
restored his captives.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19C601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
126:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet speaks here of a greater joy, that
is, when they should see gathered all the tribes from their miserable and
grievous dispersion: hence it is said in the same Psalm, &#8220;Gather, Lord,
our captivity, like the stream in the south;&#8221; and then he adds,
&#8220;They who sow in tears, in joy shall reap.&#8221; In part then did the
faithful lament, and in part did they rejoice: the beginning of redemptions had
raised their minds to joy; but on seeing their brethren still living under the
tyranny of their enemies and having hardly a hope of restoration, they could not
but mourn. Now the Prophet here declares, that their joy would be full, when
their complete restoration came.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he extends this joy to their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sons</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
for it was needful to restrain their armor in expecting a full favor, as they
ever closed up their way to God by their complaints, according to what we do
when we give loose reigns to our wishes, for we then in a manner turn away from
God. In order then to teach the people patience, the Prophet says, &#8220;Though
ye see not this today with your eyes, yet your sons shall at length see
it.&#8221; We now perceive that he here exhorts them to patience, that they
might not anticipate with too much haste the promises of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Of the metaphor it is not needful to say much: he
compares to the drunken, or to such as become cheerful through drinking, those
who rejoice in the Lord, not that he expresses an approval of drunkenness, but
because he wished to show that it would be no common joy, as though they were
carried away beyond themselves. It would be then superfluous to move here the
question, whether it be right to seek joy by drinking freely. It is indeed true
that hilarity is connected with the lawful use of wine
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19A415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
104:15;) but as we are too prone to excess, we ought to restrain the lusts of
the flesh rather than to seek some color of excuse for a sinful indulgence. But
as I have said, this question does not belong to the present passage. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">The same is the object of this verse. By the word
whistle, Zechariah means what it imports in other passages, &#8212; that it will
not be an arduous world for God; for we are wont to measure his works by what
our flesh understands. Since then the Jews might have easily raised this
objection, &#8212; that their brethren were dispersed through various countries
and among many nations, so that the assembling of them was incredible, the
Prophet meets this objection and says, that God was able by mere whistling or by
a single nod to restore them to their country. God is sometimes said to whistle
for the wicked, when he constrains them unwillingly to do him service, and
employs them as instruments to execute his hidden purposes; for when great
armies daily assemble, it is no doubt through the secret appointment of God.
When therefore trumpets sound and drums beat, the Lord whistles from heaven, to
lead the reprobate here and there as it pleases him. But in this passage the
Prophet simply means, that though God may not have many heralds nor an equipped
army to open a way for his people, he will be satisfied with whistling only; for
when it should please him, a free passage would be made for captives, though the
whole world were to hinder their return. These two words then are to be joined
together, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will whistle for them
and gather them</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as though Zechariah had said,
that the nod of God would alone be sufficient, whenever he designed to gather
the people.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm118</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I have redeemed
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here also I retain the past time, as the
verb is in the past tense: for God speaks of redemption already begun, as though
he had said, &#8220;I have promised that your exile would only be for a time; I
have already appeared in part as your Redeemer, and I will not discontinue my
work until it be completed.&#8221; God then no doubt confirms here what I have
stated, &#8212; that as he had begun in some measure to redeem his people, a
complete redemption was to be expected, though the distressed could hardly
believe this. But they ought to have felt assured, that God, as it is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D801&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
138:1, would not forsake the work of his hands. Hence by the consideration of
what had commenced he encourages the Jews here to entertain confidence, so that
they might with composed minds look for the end, and doubt not but that the
whole people would be saved; for the Lord had already proved himself to be their
Redeemer. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm119</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is
indeed true that this had not been fulfilled as to all the Israelites: but we
must ever remember, that gratuitous election so existed as to the whole people,
that God had notwithstanding but a small flock, as Paul teaches us.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:5.) The Prophet at the same time intimates that Christ would be the head of
the Church, and would gather from all parts of the earth the Jews who had been
before scattered; and thus the promised restoration is to be extended to all the
tribes. It afterwards follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He continues the same subject, and employs here a
most suitable metaphor &#8212; that the dispersion of the people would have a
better issue than what any one then could have conceived, for it would be like
sowing. The verb for scattering or sowing is often taken in a bad sense; for
when people rested in their country, they ought then to have considered that
they were living under God&#8217;s protection. Dispersion, then, was an evidence
of a curse, and it is often so taken by Moses. Now God uses it here in an
opposite meaning, as though he had said, that he would at his pleasure turn
darkness into light. The meaning then is, that the people had been dispersed
through God being angry with them, but that the issue of this dispersion would
be joyful; for the Jews would dwell everywhere, and be God&#8217;s seed, and
thus be made to produce abundant fruit. We then see that the meaning is, that
God&#8217;s favor would surpass the wickedness of the people; for those would
bear fruit who had been scattered, and scattered because God would no longer
exercise care over them, and defend them in the promised land. As God then had
so often threatened by Moses that he would scatter the Jews, he now says in
another sense, that he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>would
sow</i></font><font face="Palatino"> them, and for this ends that they might
everywhere produce fruit. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm120</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was an instance of the wonderful grace of God,
that he so ordered his dreadful judgment as to make the dispersion, as it has
been said, a sowing of the people; for it hence happened, that the knowledge of
celestial truth shone everywhere; and at length when the gospel was proclaimed,
a freer access was had to the Gentiles, because Jews were dispersed through all
lands. The first receptacles (<i>Hospitia</i>) of the gospel were the
synagogues. We see that the apostles everywhere went first to the Jews, and when
a few were converted, the door was now opened that more might come, and Gentiles
were also added to the Jews. Thus the punishment of exile, which had been
inflicted on them, was the means of opening the door for the gospel; and God
thus scattered his seed here and there, that it might in due time produce fruit
beyond the expectation of all; and this consideration availed not a little to
moderate the impatient desires of the people; for the Prophet intimates that
this alone ought to have satisfied them &#8212; that their exile would be
productive of good, for the Lord would thereby gather much people to himself.
Had the Jews been confined within their own borders, the name of the God of
Israel would not have been heard of elsewhere; but as there was no part of the
East, no part of Asia and of Greece, which had not some Jews &#8212; and they
inhabited many cities of Italy &#8212; hence it was that the Apostles found, as
we have said, wherever they came, some already prepared to embrace the
gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall remember me in distant
lands</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He shows the manner how the memory of
God would be preserved: though the Jews sacrificed not in the temple, though
they dwelt not in the holy land, they would yet ever worship the only true God;
as then the seed cast on the ground, though it may not appear, and seem even to
be wholly lost, being apparently consumed by rottenness, does yet germinate in
its season, and produces fruit; so God teaches us, that the memory of his name
will occasion this people to fructify in their dispersion. But as God promises
this, we hence learn that it is through his singular kindness that we cherish
piety in our hearts, when he sharply and severely chastises us. When therefore
we cease not to worship God, it is certain that we are kept by his Spirit; for
were this in the power of man, this promise would be useless, and even
absurd.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says further,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall live with their sons,
and shall return</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He again speaks of sons, that
the Jews might not make too much haste; for we know that men, having strong
desires, hurry on immoderately. That they might not then prescribe time to God,
the Prophet reminds them that it ought to have been enough for them that the
Lord would quicken them as it were from the dead, together with their children.
He however promises them a return, not that they would return to their own
country, but that they would be all united by the faith of the gospel. Though
then they changed not their place, nor moved a foot from the lands where they
sojourned, yet a return to their country would be that gathering which would be
made by the truth of the gospel, as it is well known, according to the common
mode of speaking adopted by all the Prophets. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms the same prediction &#8212; that though
the Jews were like broken pieces, they were yet to entertain hope of their
return and future restoration, since God was able to gather them from the
remotest parts whenever he stretched forth his hand. He then names Egypt and
Assyria, that the Jews might know that the redemptions here promised is equally
open to them all, however far separated they might be. For though Egypt was not
very far from Assyria, yet they who had fled to Egypt were regarded with more
dislike than the rest, who had been forcibly driven into exile; for God had
pronounced a curse on the flight of those who sought refuge in Egypt. Since then
they were hated by the others, and as a hostile discord existed between them,
the Prophet says that the gathering of which he speaks would belong to both.

in Isaiah, &#8220;Secede from me,&#8221; not that the faithful, when God shall
increase his Church, will molest one another, or desire to drive away their
brethren; but by this mode of speaking Isaiah means that the Church will be
filled with such number of men that they will press on one another. So also now
Zechariah says, that the number of people will be so great, that the place will
be hardly large enough for so vast a multitude. It follows

reminds the Jews that God&#8217;s power would be far superior to all the
impediments which the world could throw in their way. But the expressions are
figurative, and allusions are made to the history of the first

sufficient to change the order of nature, so that the waters would immediately

to dry up. Others regard it as transitive, &#8220;The wind shall dry up the
depths.&#8221; But as to the object of the Prophet, the passive or active sense
of the verb is of no moment; for the Prophet no doubt means here, that there
would be so much force in the very nod of God as to dry up rivers suddenly,
according to what happened to Jordan; which being smitten by the rod of Moses
dried up and afforded a passage to the people.</font><br></div>

In the preceding metaphor Zechariah alludes, as I have said, to the first
redemption, as it was usual with all the Prophets to remind the people of the
former miracles, that they might expect from the Lord in future what their
fathers had witnessed. He now however declares, that God would be the Redeemer
of his people, though the Assyrians on one side, and the Egyptians on the other,
were to attempt to frustrate his purpose; for they could effect nothing by their
obstinacy, as God could easily subdue both. He at last adds

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in his

there is here an implied contrast between the name of God and the wealth and the
forces of their enemies, which might have filled the minds of the faithful with
fear, and cast them down. Hence the Prophet bids the Jews to give the glory to
God, and not to doubt but that they would be victorious, whatever hindrance the
world might throw in their way. And by this word walk, he means a continued
course of life, as though he had said, that the people indeed had returned from
exile, that is, in part; but that more of them were to be expected, for the Lord
had not only been a leader in their return, but that he would be also their
perpetual guardian, and defend them to the end.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">THIS Chapter contains severe threatenings, by which
God designed in time to warn the Jews, that if there was any hope of repentance,
they might be restored by fear to the right way, and that others, the wicked and
the reprobate, might be rendered inexcusable, and also that the faithful might
fortify themselves against the strong temptation to despond on seeing so
dreadful a calamity awaiting that nation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This prophecy does not indeed seem consistent with
the preceding prophecies; for the Prophet has been hitherto not only encouraging
the people to entertain hope, but has also declared that their condition would
be so happy that nothing would be wanting to render them really blessed: but now
he denounces ruin, and begins with reprobation; for he says, that God had been
long the shepherd of that nation, but that now he renounced all care of them;
for being wearied he would no longer bear with that perverse wickedness, which
he had found in them all. These things seem to be inconsistent: but we may
observe, that it was needful in the first place to set before the Jews the
benefits of God, that they might with more alacrity proceed with the work of
building the temple, and know that their labor would not be in vain; and now it
was necessary to change the strain, lest hypocrites, vainly confiding in these
promises, should become hardened, as it is commonly the case; and also, lest the
faithful should not entertain due fear, and thus go heedlessly before God; for
nothing is more ruinous than security, inasmuch as when a license is taken to
sin, God&#8217;s judgment impends over us. We hence see how useful and
reasonable was this warnings of the Prophet, as he made the Jews to understand,
that God would not be propitious to his people without punishing their
wickedness and obstinacy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In order to render his prophecy impressive, Zechariah
addresses <i>Libanon</i>; as though he was God&#8217;s herald, he bids it to
open its gates, for the whole wood was now given up to the fire. Had he spoken
without a figure, his denunciation would not have had so much force: he
therefore denounces near ruin on Lebanon and on other places. Almost all think
that by Lebanon is to be understood the temple, because it was built with timber
from that mountain; but this view seems to me frigid, though it is approved by
the common consent of interpreters. For why should we think the temple to be
metaphorically called Lebanon rather than Bashan? And they think so such thing
of Bashan, though there is equally the same reason. I therefore regard it simply
as the Mount Lebanon; and I shall merely refer to what Joseph us declares, that
the temple was opened before the city was destroyed by Titus. But though that
history may be true, and it seems to me probable, it does not hence follow that
this prophecy was then fulfilled, according to what is said of Rabbi Jonathan,
who then exclaimed, &#8220;Lo! the prophecy of Zechariah; for he foretold that
the temple would be burnt, and that the gates would be previously opened.&#8221;
These things seem plausible, and at the first view gain our approbation. But I
think that we must understand something more solid, and less refined: for I
doubt not but that the Prophet denounces complete ruin on Mount Lebanon, and on
Bashan and other places. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm123</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But why does he bid Lebanon to open its gates? The
reason is given, for shortly after he calls it a fortified forest, which was yet
without walls and gates. Lebanon, we know, was nigh to Jerusalem, though far
enough to be free from any hostile attack. As then the place was by nature
sufficiently safe from being assailed, the Prophet speaks, as though Lebanon was
surrounded by fortresses; for it was not exposed to the attacks of enemies. The
meaning is, &#8212; that though on account of its situation the Jews thought
that Lebanon was not exposed to any evils, yet the wantonness of enemies would
lead them even there. We have already said why the Prophet bids Lebanon to open
its gates, even because he puts on the character of a herald, who threatens and
declares, that God&#8217;s extreme vengeance was already nigh at
hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Howl thou, fir-tree, for the
cedar has fallen</i></font><font face="Palatino">. No doubt the Prophet by
naming Lebanon, mentioning a part for the whole, meant the whole of Judea: and
it appears evident from the context that the most remarkable places are here
mentioned; but yet the Prophet&#8217;s design was to show, that God would punish
the whole people, so as not to spare Jerusalem or any other place. And then by
the fir-trees and cedars he meant whatever then excelled in Judea or in other
places; and for this reason he compares them to the cedars of Lebanon, as though
he had said, &#8220;There is no reason for the fir-trees to regard themselves as
beyond the reach of danger; for if he spares not the cedars what will become of
the fir-trees, which possess no such stateliness and
grandeur?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the Prophet&#8217;s meaning as
to the trees: but he includes, as I have said, under one kind, whatever was
valuable in Judea; and this we learn more clearly from what follows: for he
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fallen
have</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or laid waste have been,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
strong</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm124</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some
read in the neuter gender, &#8220;Laid waste have been splendid things;&#8221;
but I am inclined to regard persons as intended. The Prophet then now simply
declares, that the vengeance of God was nigh all the great ones, whom dignity
sheltered, so that they thought themselves in no danger. And for the same
purpose he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Howl, ye oaks of
Bashan</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He joins, as we see, Bashan to Lebanon;
there is then no reason for allegorising only one of the words, when they are
both connected. And he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For
fallen has the fortified forest</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Either this
may be applied to Lebanon, or the Prophet may be viewed as saying in general,
that there was no place so difficult of access, which would not be penetrated
into, when the Lord should give liberty to enemies to destroy all things. Though
then the density of trees protected these mountains, yet the Prophet says that
nothing would obstruct God&#8217;s vengeance from penetrating into the inmost
recesses of strongholds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The voice of the howling of
shepherds; for their excellency</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or their
courage, is laid waste. Here he has
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rda</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ader</i>, and before
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yryda</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>adirim</i>, in the masculine gender. We see then that the Prophet confirms
the same thing in other words, &#8220;Howl now,&#8221; he says, &#8220;shall the
shepherds.&#8221; He intimates that the beginning of this dreadful judgment
would be with the chief men, as they were especially the cause of the public
ruin. He then says, that the dignity of the great was now approaching its fall,
and hence he bids them to howl. He does not in these words exhort them to
repentance, but follows the same strain of doctrine. By God&#8217;s command he
here declares, that the shepherds who took pride in their power, could not
escape the judgment which they had deserved: and as this is a mode of speaking
usually adopted by the Prophets, I shall no longer dwell on the
subject.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The voice of the roaring of
lions</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He no doubt gives here the name of
lions, by way of metaphor, to those who cruelly exercised their power over the
people. But he also alludes to the banks of Jordan, where there were lions, as
it is well known. Since then lions were found along the whole course of Jordan,
as it is evident from many passages, he compares shepherds to lions, even the
governors who had abused their authority by exercising tyranny over the people:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fallen
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has the pride
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or the excellency
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of
Jordan</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In short, it is now sufficiently
evident, that the Prophet threatens final destruction both to the kingdom of
Judah and to the kingdom of Israel. Both
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>kingdoms</i></font><font face="Palatino">
were indeed then abolished; but I speak of the countries themselves. The meaning
is &#8212; that neither Judea nor the land of the ten tribes would be free from
God&#8217;s vengeance.

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here is given a reason why God purposed to deal so
severely with his people &#8212; even because their obstinacy deserved no
pardon. As then in the beginning of the chapter the Prophet threatened ruin to
the Jews, so now he reminds them that their punishment was nigh, and that they
could not be more gently treated, because their wickedness was wholly incurable.
We now perceive the design of the Prophet; but he charges the Jews especially
with ingratitude, because they responded so basely and shamefully to the
singular benefits of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says first, that he was bidden to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>feed the flock
</i></font><font face="Palatino">destined to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>slaughter</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm126</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now
the Prophet does not here relate simply what command he had received from God,
but teaches us in general that God had ever performed the office of a good and
faithful shepherd towards the Jews. The Prophet then assumes the character of
all the shepherds, as though he had said, &#8220;There is no reason why this
people should plead their ignorance, or attempt to disguise their own fault by
other names and various pretences; for God has ever offered them a shepherd, and
sent also ministers to guide and rule them: it is not to be ascribed to God that
this people has not enjoyed prosperity and happiness.&#8221; There is now no
need of spending much labor about this verse, as interpreters have done who
confine what is here said to Christ alone, as one who had received this office
from the Father; for we shall see from the passage itself that the
Prophet&#8217;s words are by them forcibly wrested from their
meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let it then be borne in mind, that his special object
is to show &#8212; that God had ever been ready to rule this people, so that he
could not have been accused by them of not having done what could have been
possibly looked for or expected from a good shepherd. If any one objects and
says, that this could have been said in other words, the plain answer is &#8212;
that God&#8217;s perpetual care in his government had been fully shown; for he
had not only himself performed the duties and office of a shepherd, but had also
at all times set over them ministers, who performed faithfully their work. Since
God then had so constantly and sedulously watched over the safety of the people,
we see that their ingratitude was wholly proved. And by calling it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the flock of
slaughter</i></font><font face="Palatino">, a reference is made to the time of
the Prophet; for the Jews were then as though they had been snatched from the
jaws of wolves, having been delivered from exile. They were then as dead sheep,
whom the Lord had rescued; and we also know to how many troubles and dangers
they had been constantly exposed. And hence appeared more clearly the goodness
of God; for he was pleased nevertheless to exercise care over his flock. Then
the Prophet enlarges here on God&#8217;s favor, because he had not despised his
sheep though given up to the slaughter. The words might indeed be extended
farther, as though the Prophet referred to what had already taken place, and
they might thus be applied to many ages; but it seems to me more probable, that
he mentions here what belonged to that age. Zechariah then teaches us why God
was constrained to adopt extreme severity, even because he had tried all things
that might have healed the people, and yet lost all his labor: when their
wickedness became wholly incurable, despair as it were at length constrained God
to exercise the severity mentioned here. This is, as I think, the meaning of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds another circumstance, which shows
still further the wonderful and ineffable goodness of God, &#8212; that he had
been a shepherd of a flock, which had not only been harassed by wolves and
robbers, but also by its own shepherds. In short, the import of the whole is,
&#8212; that though wolves and robbers had ranged with great barbarity among the
people, yet God had always been their shepherd.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then enlarges on the subject and says, that they
who </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>possessed
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"> had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>killed</i></font><font face="Palatino">
them, so that they spared not. By these words the Prophet shows that the safety
of the people had been deemed as nothing by their very leaders: they could not
then by any excellence of their own have induced God to show so much kindness to
them. But these words ought to be attentively noticed, &#8212; that when the
flock was slain, the executioners or butchers themselves had no mercy, for they
thought it was a spoil justly due to them. We see how God extols here his own
goodness; for he had condescended to defend and rule and feed that people, who
were not only despised in the world, but counted as nothing, and the
slaughtering of them deemed a lawful prey: they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sin
not</i></font><font face="Palatino">, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm127</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
says, that is, they are not conscious of exercising any cruelty, &#8212; Why?
because they thought that they justly enriched themselves, while they were
plundering so wretched a flock. The more base, then, and inexcusable was the
ingratitude of the people, when after having been so kindly received and so
gently nourished by God, they yet rejected all his favors and suffered not
themselves to be governed by his hand. And it is material to observe here, that
these contrasts tend greatly to exaggerate the sins of men, and ought to be
considered, that God&#8217;s severity may not be blamed; for we know that many
complain when God executes his judgments: they would measure all punishments by
their own ideas, and subject God to their own will. In order therefore to check
such complaints, the Prophet says, that though the flock was most contemptible,
it had not yet been despised by God, but that he undertook the care of
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The shepherds and masters said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessed be
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We are wont to give thanks to God when
we really believe that the blessings we have come from him. The robber who kills
an innocent man will not say, &#8220;Blessed be God;&#8221; for he on the
contrary tries to extinguish every remembrance of God, because he has wounded
his own conscience. The same may be also said of thieves. Hypocrites often
profess the name of God; and they whose trade is cheating ever make a speech of
this kind, &#8220;By God&#8217;s grace I have gained so much this year;&#8221;
that is, after having acquired the property of others by deceit, cheating, and
plunder, they give thanks to God! and at the same time they flatter themselves
by self-deception, as though all were a lawful prey; for, forsooth! they are not
proved guilty before a human tribunal. Now the Prophet here adopts this common
mode of speaking, by which men, not conscious of doing wrong, usually testify
that their gain is just and lawful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he who fed then has not
spared </i></font><font face="Palatino">them. The meaning is, that the people,
according to the opinions commonly entertained, were not worthy of mercy and
kindness. Hence, as I have said, the wonderful goodness of God shines forth more
clearly; for he condescended to take the care of a flock that was wholly
despised. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm128</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Then
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will not spare the
inhabitants of the land; behold I will deliver</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
etc. To some it appears that there is here a reason given; for the Jews would
have never been thus stripped, had not God been angry with them; as though he
had said, that God&#8217;s vengeance was just, inasmuch as they were thus
exposed to such atrocious wrongs. But according to my judgment God simply
confirms what we have stated, &#8212; that his future vengeance on the Jews
would be most just, because he had in feeding them so carefully labored wholly
in vain. For though the Prophet has not as yet expressed what we shall hereafter
see respecting their ingratitude, he yet does not break off his discourse
without reason, for indignation has ever some warmth in it; he then in the
middle of his argument exclaims here,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will not
spare</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for God had spared the Jews, when yet
all men exercised cruelty towards them with impunity; and when they were
contemptible in the sight of all, he still had regarded their safety. As then
they had been so ungrateful for so many acts of kindness, ought not God to have
been angry with them? This is then the reason why the Prophet introduces here in
God&#8217;s name this threatening,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Surely I will not spare
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, &#8220;I have hitherto deferred
my vengeance, and have surpassed all men in kindness and mercy; but I have
misplaced my goodness, and now there is no reason why I should longer suspend my
judgment.&#8221; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will spare
then no longer the inhabitants of this
land</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
give</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or deliver, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>every man into the hand of his
friend</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as though he had said, &#8220;They are
no longer sheep, for they will not bear to be ruled by my hand, though they have
found me to be the best of shepherds. They shall now tear and devour one
another; and thus a horrible dispersion will follow.&#8221; Now the Jews ought
to have dreaded nothing so much, as to be given up to destroy themselves by
mutual slaughter, and thus to rage cruelly against one another and to perish
without any external enemy: but yet God declares that this would be the case,
and for this reason, because he could not succeed with them, though willing to
feed them as his sheep and ready to perform the office of shepherd in ruling
them.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm129</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He concludes by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall smite the land, and I
will not deliver from their hand</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He intimates
in the last place that ruin without any remedy was nigh; for he alone was the
only deliverer of the people; but now he testifies that their safety would not
be the object of his care; for should he see them perishing a hundred times, he
would not be moved with pity, nor turn to bring them help, inasmuch as they had
precluded all compassion. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He resumes here the thread of the discourse, which he
had shortly before broken off; for he sets forth what had not yet been
sufficiently expressed &#8212; that the ingratitude of the people, with which
obstinacy was especially united, deserved entire ruin, and that now there was no
hope of pardon; for the paternal care of God had been most basely and most
shamefully repudiated, as well as the kind favor which he had manifested to the
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God then complains that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fed the
flock</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some apply this to Zechariah; but, as I
have said, God relates the acts of kindness which he had uniformly showed to the
people, until they became wholly unworthy of his favor. Let us however remember
that the Prophet speaks of the remnant; for he does not here recount the
benefits of God in ancient times, but describes the state of the people after
their return from their exile in Babylon. God seemed before to have committed
this office to Zechariah &#8212; to feed them; but as I have already said, the
design of that was no other than to make it evident that the whole fault was in
the people; for they had thrust from them the kindness of God, and in a manner
carried on war frowardly with God, so as to prevent any access for his favor.
There is therefore here an expostulation in God&#8217;s name.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have
fed</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,

rendering &#8212; &#8220;therefore the poor,&#8221; or, especially the poor.
With regard to the meaning, God here intimates that he had manifested his care
for the whole people, for he had hoped that there were a few sheep yet remaining
worthy of having mercy shown to them. As then some poor sheep might have been
found among the impure flock, God says, that having this hope, he did not deem
it grievous or burdensome to undertake the office of a shepherd in ruling the
people. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fed the flock of
slaughter</i></font><font face="Palatino">, even for this reason, he says,
because there were some miserable sheep among them: I was therefore unwilling to
forsake them, and preferred to try all means rather than to cast away even one
little sheep, provided a single one were found in the whole flock.

I have no doubt, means by
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ylbj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chebelim</i>, ropes or bindings. Grammar, indeed, does not allow this; but
Zechariah did not set down the points, for they were not then in use. I indeed
know with how much care the old scribes contrived the points, when the language
had already ceased to be in common use. They then who neglect, or wholly reject
the points, are certainly void of all judgment and reason; but yet some
discrimination ought to be exercised; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm131</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for if
we read here &#8220;destroyers,&#8221; there is no meaning; if we read
&#8220;cords,&#8221; there is no letter changed, but only two points are
altered. As then the subject itself necessarily demands this meaning, I wonder
that interpreters suffer themselves to be servilely constrained, so as not to
regard the design of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet then says, that he had taken two rods,
that he might devote himself in a manner not common to the office of a shepherd.
Shepherds were satisfied with one crook; for by rods he means here the crook
used by shepherds. As then every shepherd carried his own crook, the Prophet
says here that he was furnished with two crooks, or pastoral staffs, because the
Lord surpassed all men in his solicitude in the office of ruling his people. But
the remainder I must defer until tomorrow.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND FIFTY-EIGHTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE said yesterday that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ylbj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chebelim</i>, the name given by Zechariah to the second rod, could not be
rendered &#8220;destroyers,&#8221; as all the Hebrews do; for God teaches us
that he had fully and faithfully discharged the duties of a shepherd, so that
the people perished through their own fault; and since God undertook the office
of a shepherd, it could not have been said that he took a staff to destroy them:
and there is also no doubt but that he connects this word with the other,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;[n</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nom</i>, &#8220;beauty.&#8221; And he says in the last place, that this rod
called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ylbj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chebelim</i>, was broken, in order to show that the brotherhood between Judah
and Israel was come to an end. Now what affinity can there be between destroying
and uniting? It is then clear that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ylbj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chebelim</i>, is to be taken here for ropes, or cords.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now see why the Prophet calls one
&#8220;Beauty,&#8221; and the other &#8220;Ropes.&#8221; Some think that the law
of nature is designated by
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;[n</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nom</i>, and by
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ylbj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chebelim</i>, the law of Moses, and those who render the word
&#8220;Lines,&#8221; such as Jerome, who gives here the right version, think
that as the law was a hard yoke on the ancients, the rod was so called because
it bound them fast. Others, as Jerome also does, refer to this passage of Moses,
&#8220;When the Lord cast his line, he chose a place for Israel, and when the
Highest divided the nations,&#8221; etc. They then think that a line is taken
for an inheritance. But the first interpretation is too remote and distorted;
with regard to the second, as the Prophet puts the word in the plural number, it
cannot be suitably taken for an inheritance, and, as we said yesterday, the
following clause shows that the idea of union is included in
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning of the Prophet then is, that God had so
performed his office of a shepherd towards his people, as to rule them in the
best manner; this I understand by the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;[n</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nom</i>, beauty, for nothing could have been more perfect in beauty than the
government which God had exercised over the Israelites; and hence he compares
here his pastoral staff to beauty, as though he had said, &#8220;The order of
things was so arranged that nothing could be imagined better.&#8221; He then
mentions unity or concord, and it was the highest favor that God gathered again
the scattered Israelites so as to make them one body. It is indeed true, that
few of the kingdom of Israel had returned to their own country, but it is yet
evident that the remnant was not only from the tribe of Judah, from the half
tribe of Benjamin, and from the Levites, but that there were others mingled with
them. It was therefore a most appropriate representation, that not only a most
beautiful order was established by God, but that was also added a brotherly
concord, so that the children of Abraham were joined together in one spirit and
in one soul. Since then they had so good a shepherd, the baser and less
excusable was their ingratitude in shaking off his yoke, and in not suffering
themselves to be ruled by his staff.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see what the words of the Prophet mean,
when he introduces God as furnished with two rods, even beauty and gathering. He
then repeats what he had said before,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have
fed</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
sheep</i></font><font face="Palatino">, intimating, that it was not owing to him
that he should not continue to rule them. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">At the beginning of the verse the Prophet continues
the same subject, that God spared no pains in ruling the people, but patiently
bore with many grievances; for it is the duty of every good and careful husband
man to inspect often his flock, and to change his shepherd, when he finds him
idle and inattentive to his duties. God then shows that he had exercised the
greatest vigilance, for </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in one
month he had rejected three shepherds</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is,
he had within a short space of time often made choice of new shepherds, and
substituted them for others, for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one
month</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is to be taken here for a short time, and
the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>three shepherds
</i></font><font face="Palatino">signify many, indefinitely. When a husband man
neglects his own flock, he may be deceived all the year round, should he meet
with a thief or an inactive and worthless man. Since then God says, that he had
changed his shepherds often in one month, he intimates what I have already said,
that he took the greatest care of his flock, for he loved it, and omitted
nothing necessary to defend it. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm132</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And
this circumstance especially aggravated the sin of the Jews, for they did not
respond to so great a care on God&#8217;s part; no, not when they saw that he
watched night and day for their safety.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the latter part of the verse is a complaint, for
God begins to set forth how base had been the wickedness and ingratitude of the
people, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With
weariness</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has my soul been affected by
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their soul has hated
</i></font><font face="Palatino">me. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm133</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
speaks not now of the shepherds, and they are mistaken who so read the passage,
as though God had repudiated the shepherds, because his soul w as wearied with
them: on the contrary, he turns his discourse to the whole people, and begins to
show how wicked they had been, who having been favored with so many benefits,
could not yet endure the best of shepherds. Hence he says, that his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>soul had been straitened by
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">, for he found no room made for his favors.
Paul also, treating on this subject, expostulates with the Corinthians, and
says, that he was ready to pour forth his heart and to open widely his mouth,
but they themselves were straitened, and he felt himself these straitenings in
his own heart.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470611&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 6:11.) So also God complains here and says, that he was straitened
by the Jews; for he found that his blessings were not rightly received, but as
it were hindered, so great was the wickedness of the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He expresses more clear]y at the end that he was
despised by them, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They also have
hated me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Now it was a contempt in no way
excusable, when the Jews would not acknowledge how kindly and bountifully God
had treated them. We now perceive the Prophet&#8217;s design: after having
related how kindly God had condescended to rule the people, he now says that
this labor had produced no fruit, for the door for God&#8217;s favors had been
closed up. It afterwards follows-</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">God now declares what had been briefly mentioned
before, &#8212; that his judgment could not be deemed cruel, for the people had
been extremely wicked, and their wickedness deserved extreme punishment. It
seems indeed to be a simple narrative; but God here defends his own cause, for
he had tried all means in ruling the people, before he had recourse to extreme
rigor. Who indeed could now murmur against God? for he had been ever ready to
undertake the office of a shepherd, and had so humbled himself as to take care
of that people as his own flock, and had, in short, omitted no kind of
attention; and yet he had been despised by that people, and even treated with
derision. It was therefore an extreme indignity when they hated God, who had yet
dealt with them with so much kindness. We hence see that God&#8217;s judgment is
here vindicated from every calumny; for the wickedness of the people was
altogether inexcusable before God had renounced his care of
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
said</i></font><font face="Palatino">: the time must be noticed, for he
intimates that he had not been too hasty in taking vengeance; but that as there
was no longer any remedy, he had been constrained, as it were by necessity, to
give up his office of a shepherd.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I said
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will not feed you; what is to
die, let it die; what is to be cut off, let it be cut
off</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm134</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
here resigns his office of a shepherd, and intimates that he was innocent and
free from all blame, whatever might happen. A shepherd is set over a flock for
this purpose, &#8212; that he may defend it, even every sheep, both against the
depredations of robbers, and the rapacity of wolves: but when he gives up his
office, he is exempt from all blame, though afterwards the flock may be stolen
or devoured by wolves and wild beasts. God then here openly declares, that it
was not to be imputed to him, if the Jews perished a hundred times, for they
refused to be ruled by him, and thus he was freed from the pastoral charge.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What then is to perish, let it
perish</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, &#8220;Since they are not
healable, and allow no remedy to be applied to their evils, I leave them; they
shall find out what it is to be without a good shepherd.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see more clearly what I before stated, &#8212;
that the wickedness and ingratitude of the people are here reproved, because
they had rejected God, who was ready to be their shepherd, &#8212; and that the
cause of the ruin which was nigh at hand, was in the Jews themselves, though
they anxiously tried, but in vain, to transfer it to another.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He concludes with these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And those which
remain</i></font><font face="Palatino">, even those who shall escape external
attacks, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>let them eat one
another</i></font><font face="Palatino">, since they are not now sheep, but
savage wild beasts. And this we know has been fulfilled; for the Jews at length
perished through mutual discords, and no one spared his own brother; nay, the
nearer the relationship, the more cruelly each raged against the other. Hence
God&#8217;s judgment, denounced by the Prophet, then appeared most openly, when
the Jews perished through intestine broils and even slaughters. It then follows

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms the same truth, but a metaphor is
introduced: for he says, that when he freed himself from the office of a

and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Gathering</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
He speaks of the first staff, because things were in a confusion in Judea,
before the people were wholly cut off; for the dispersion did not immediately
take place, so that there was no sort of social state among the Jews; but social
order was so deranged, that it was sufficiently evident that they were not ruled
by God. By degrees the purity of doctrine was corrupted, and a flood of errors
crept in; superstition gained great strength. When things were in this state of
confusion, the pastoral staff was broken, which is called, Beauty. This verse
then contains no more than an explanation of the last: and hence also he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That broken might be the covenant
which I had made</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, that it might be now
quite evident that this people are not ruled by my hand and

that which is said in

2:1, -that the Lord made a covenant with the beasts of the earth and the birds
of heaven, that no harm should happen to his people; but the comparison is not
suitable. It is then probable, that God here speaks only of the posterity of
Abraham; nor is it to be wondered at that they are called nations, for even so
Moses says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Nations from thee

<div><font face="Palatino">and this was done for the purpose of setting forth
the greatness of God&#8217;s favor; for the ten tribes were as so many nations
among whom God reigned. It seemed incredible, that from one man, not only a
numerous family, but many nations should proceed. The real meaning then seems to
be, that God testified that he would no longer be the leader of that people; for
when order was trodden under foot, the covenant of God was made void. Why indeed
was that covenant continued, and what was its design, except to keep things
aright, in a fit and suitable condition? Thus in the church, God regards order,
so that nothing should be done rashly, according to every man&#8217;s humor.
This then was the beginning of that dispersion, which at length followed when
the people had fallen off from the order which God had appointed.

<div><font face="Palatino">He concludes by saying, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in that day the covenant was

not by chance that the law was destroyed, and that the Jews departed from the
just government of God, but that it was through the dreadful vengeance of God.
In that day then: this is emphatical, as though the Prophet had said, &#8220;It
ought not to be ascribed to chance that things have changed for the worse, for
God has thus executed his judgment, after having with extreme patience borne
with the wickedness of the people.&#8221; And hence he adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the poor of the flock saw that
this was the word of Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here the Prophet
briefly points out two things &#8212; that this was not commonly known as
God&#8217;s judgment, but that almost all with closed eyes overlooked what had
happened; for the world contracts as it were hardness, and becomes wilfully
obdurate under the scourges of God. All cry out that they are miserable, but no
one regards the hand of the striker, as it is said elsewhere.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230913&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
9:13.) So also Zechariah charges here the Jews with stupidity; for though the
greater part saw all things in confusion, yet they did not consider, but
regarded almost as nothing the dreadful judgment of God. It must then be that
men are extremely refractory, when they perceive not that they are chastised by
God; yet the Prophet charges the Jews with this sottishness; for they regarded
not this as the word of Jehovah, they did not believe that this was God&#8217;s
hand. But he says further, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>poor of the flock
</i></font><font face="Palatino">perceived this: and thus he shows, that while
the body of the people followed the way to ruin, a few derived benefit from
God&#8217;s scourges; and thus it never happens, that God chastises without some
advantage. Though then the reprobate obstinately resist God, and hesitate not to
tread under foot his judgments, and as far as they can, render them void, there
are yet some few who receive benefit and acknowledge God&#8217;s hand so as to
humble themselves and repent.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, then, after having complained that the
chief men, even those who were in honor and in wealth among the Jews, heedlessly
despised God&#8217;s dreadful judgment, makes this addition, that there were a
few very poor and humble men, who regarded this judgment as not having come by
chance, but through God, who became a just avenger, because his favor had been
wantonly despised: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The poor then
of the flock knew this to be the word of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As this happened in the time of the Prophet, it is no
wonder that at this day, even when God thunders from heaven and makes known his
judgments by manifest proofs, the world should yet rush headlong into perdition,
and become as it were stupefied in their calamities. In the meantime we ought to
strive to connect ourselves with the miserable poor, who are deemed as the
offscourings of the world, and so attentively to consider God&#8217;s vengeance,
that we may seriously fear and not provoke his extreme judgments, and thus
perish with the wicked.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must observe also the expression which Zechariah
introduced before the last words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who attend to
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He mentions it as a singular and a rare
thing, that even a few deigned to consider the works of God. The chief wisdom of
men, we know, is attentively to consider the hand of God; but almost all seem to
be immersed in a state of stupor: when the Lord smites them, they stand as it
were amazed, and never, as we have already said, regard the hand of the smiter;
and when the Lord freely and kindly cherishes them, they exult in their own
wantonness. Thus under every kind of treatment, they are untractable; for they
attend not to God, but close their eyes, harden their hearts, and cover
themselves with many veils; in short, we find the blindness of the world ever
connected with perverseness, so that they in vain pretend ignorance, for they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>attend</i></font><font face="Palatino">
not to God, but on the contrary turn their backs on him and darken the clear
light by their wickedness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see why this sentence is introduced, that
the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>poor of the flock
</i></font><font face="Palatino">understand, because they apply their minds and
devote their attention for the purpose of considering the works of God. It hence
follows that the bulls, who with their horns fearlessly assail God, and that
he-goats, who by their stench fill the air, continue in their brutishness, and
derive no benefit from God&#8217;s judgments, because they are wilfully and
through their own wickedness wholly blind. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">God now adds another crime, by which he discovers the
wickedness of the people; for they estimated all the labor he had bestowed at a
cry insignificant price. He had before complained of ingratitude; but more fully
detected was the iniquity and baseness of the people, when they thus regarded as
of no value the inestimable favor of God towards them. What the Prophet then
says now is &#8212; that God at last tried them so as to know whether his
benefits were of any account among the Jews, and that it had been fully found
out, that all the labor and toil employed in their behalf, had been ill-spent
and wholly lost. That Zechariah now speaks in his own person, and then
introduces God as the speaker, makes no difference, as we said yesterday, as to
the main subject; for his object is to set forth how shamefully the Jews had
abused the favor of God, and how unjustly they had despised it. And yet he
speaks as God&#8217;s minister; for God not only governed that people himself,
but also endued with the power of his Spirit many ministers, who undertook the
office of shepherds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says, that he came (and what is said properly
belongs to God) to the people and demanded a reward,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Give
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a reward; if not,
forbear</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm136</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
expresses here the highest indignation, as though one upbraided the wickedness
and ingratitude of his neighbor and said, &#8220;Own my kindness, if you please;
if not, let it perish: I care not; I see that you are wholly worthless and
altogether unworthy of being so liberally treated: I therefore make no account
of thy compensations; but at the same time it behaves thee to consider how much
thou art indebted to me.&#8221; So now does God in high displeasure speak here:
&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Give</i></font><font face="Palatino">
me at least </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
reward</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that I may not have served you for
nothing: you have misused my labor, I have borne with many wrongs and annoyances
in ruling you; what is to be the compensation for my solicitude and care? I
indeed make no account of a reward, for I am not a mercenary.&#8221; He then
adds, that they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gave him thirty
silverings</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm137</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
mentions this no doubt as a mean price, intimating, that they wished by such a
small sum to compensate for the many and inestimable favors of God; as when one
hires a swineherd or a clown, he gives a paltry sum as his wages; so the Jews,
as the Prophet says, acted towards God. At the same time by the mean price, a
suitable reward only to a clown, he means those frivolous things by which the
Jews thought to satisfy God: for we know how diligent they were in performing
their ceremonies, as though indeed these were a compensation that was of any
value with God! He requires integrity of heart, and he gives himself to us, that
he may in return have us as his own. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm138</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
then was the price of labor which the Lord had deserved. It would have been a
suitable reward had the Jews devoted themselves wholly to him in obedience to
his word. But what did they do? They sedulously performed ceremonies and other
frivolous things. This then was a sordid reward, as though they sought to put
him off with the reward of a swineherd.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah said to me, throw it to
the potter</i></font><font face="Palatino">. &#8220;This truly is my reward!
Cast it to the potter, that he may get some bricks or coverings to repair the
temple; if there are any parts of the temple dilapidated, let the potter get
thereby some bricks, or let any humble artisan have such a price for
himself.&#8221; But he afterwards speaks ironically when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
magnificence</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and the glory of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the price at which he had been
estimated! </i></font><font face="Palatino">&#8220;This is, forsooth! the
magnificence of my price, though I had endured many toils! they now deal with me
as with some mean swineherd, though I was their Lord and Shepherd: since then
they seek thus craftily to satisfy me, and reproachfully offer me a paltry
reward, and as it were degrade my glory and spit in my face, Cast,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cast
it</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the
potter</i></font><font face="Palatino">;&#8221; that is, let them repair the
temple, in which they delight so much as if they were in heaven: for the temple
is their idol; but God will be never nigh them while they act thus
hypocritically with him. &#8220;Let them then repair the breaches of the temple
and pay the price to the potter, for I will not suffer a price so unworthy of my
majesty to be obtruded so disgracefully on me.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then apprehend the meaning of the Prophet: and
first we must bear in mind what I have stated, that here is described how
irreclaimable had been the wickedness of the people: though rejected by God,
when he had broken his rod, they yet esteemed as nothing the favors which they
had experienced. How so? because they thought that they performed an abundant
service to God, when they worshipped him by external frivolities; for ceremonies
without a real sense of religion are frivolous puerilities in God&#8217;s
presence. What then the Prophet now urges is, that the Jews wilfully buried
God&#8217;s benefits, by which he had nevertheless so bound them to himself that
they could not be released. And to the same purpose is what follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cast it to the
potter</i></font><font face="Palatino">: for he testifies that the price was of
no value, nay, that he abominated such a reward as men paid hint when they dealt
with him in such a reproachful manner; for as he says in Isaiah, it was a
weariness to him &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I am disgusted
with your festal days; why do you daily tread the pavement of my temple?&#8221;

66:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God in these places shows, as here by Zechariah, that
these sacrifices which ungodly men and hypocrites offer to him, without a right
feeling of religion, are the greatest abominations to him, &#8212; why? Because
it is the highest indignity which the wicked call offer, which is as it were to
spit in his face, when they compare him to a potter or a swineherd, and think
nothing of the reward which he deserves, and that is, to consecrate and really
to devote themselves wholly to him without any dissimulation. When therefore men
trifle with God and think that he is delighted with frivolous puerilities, they
compare him, as I have said, to a swineherd, or to some low or common workman;
and this is an indignity which he cannot bear, and for which he manifests hero
by his Prophet his high displeasure.

<div><font face="Palatino">THERE is here set before us the extreme vengeance of
God in scattering his people, so that there would be no longer any union between
the children of Abraham. We have seen that the Prophet took two staves or crooks
to execute the office of a shepherd in ruling the people. The first staff he
said was Beauty, because God had omitted nothing necessary to produce the best
order of things. Now when this blessed mode of ruling was trodden under foot,
then soon after followed the scattering of the people: and this is the reason
why the Prophet says, that he broke the other rod, or his crook. We then see
that this people by their ingratitude at length justly deserved to be left
without any regular form of government, and also without any
union.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ylbj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chebelim</i>, we have before said that what the Rabbis teach us, that it
means &#8220;destroyers,&#8221; does not comport with the passage. But why
should Zechariah say here that the rod was broken, that there should be no more
union or fraternity between the kingdom of Judah and the ten tribes? We have
already said, that this word by changing the points may have the meaning which
has been mentioned; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lbj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chebel</i>, signifies a rope or binding. We must also bear in mind, that this
is an instance of &#8220;last first&#8221;
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">u[steron
pro&gt;teron</font><font face="Palatino">;) for he told us before that God,
bidding adieu to the people, demanded his reward; this then ought to have been
first mentioned: but this inversion of order is common in Hebrew. This verse
then we are to read, as though it was placed before the last mission, by which
God laid aside the office of a shepherd. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm140</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I will come now to the passage in Matthew; for after
having told us that the thirty pieces of silver were cast away by Judah, and
that by them the Potter&#8217;s Field was bought, he adds, that this prediction
of the Prophet was fulfilled. He does not indeed repeat the same words, but it
is quite clear, that this passage was quoted,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;They gave,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;the thirty silvering, the price of the valued, whom they of the
children of Israel have
valued.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402709&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
27:9.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In substance then there is no doubt an agreement
between the words of Matthew and those of the Prophet. But we must hold this
principle, &#8212; that Christ was the true Jehovah from the beginning. As then
the Son of God is the same in essence with the Father, and is with him the only
true God, it is no wonder that what the Prophet figuratively expressed as having
been done under the law by the ancient people, has been done to him literally in
his own person: for as they had given to God thirty pieces of silver, a sordid
price, as his just reward, so he complained that the labor he undertook in
ruling them, was unjustly valued; and when Christ was sold for thirty pieces of
silver, it was a visible specimen of this prophecy exhibited in his own
person.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When Matthew says, that Christ was valued by the
children of Israel, he charges the chosen people with impiety. The article
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oJi</font><font face="Palatino">,
is to be here understood. The expression is indeed,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpo&lt; uJiwn
Israh&lt;l</font><font face="Palatino">; but the sentence is to be taken in this
sense, &#8212; that he was valued at so low a price, not by barbarous nations,
but by the very people who were of the children of Israel and of the seed of
Abraham, as though he had said, &#8220;This wrong has been offered to God, not
by strangers, but by a people whom he had chosen and adopted as his peculiar
possession; and this wickedness is therefore less
excusable.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then Matthew adds,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;They gave it for
the Potter&#8217;s Field,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">as the
Lord had commanded me.&#8221;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
27:7-10.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This part also well agrees with the prophecy. It is
indeed certain that this money was not designedly given to buy a field, that the
Jews might obey God; but we know that God executes his purposes by means of the
wicked, though they neither think nor wish to do such a thing. But what does
Zechariah say? </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cast
it</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the
potter</i></font><font face="Palatino">; he does not say &#8220;To the field of
the potter.&#8221; But we have explained for what purpose God commanded the
thirty silvering to be cast to the potter; it was, that he might get bricks or
tiles to repair the temple; and this was said in contempt, or by way of
ridicule. Such also was the visible symbol of this as to the purchase of the
field; for the potter, the seller of the field, knew not what he was doing; the
Scribes and Pharisees thought nothing of fulfilling what had been predicted. But
that it might be made evident that Christ was the true God who had from the
beginning spoken by the Prophet, God, by setting the thing before their eyes,
intended that there should be a visible fact or transaction, that he might as it
were draw the attention of the Jews to what is here said. The Prophet proceeds,

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet teaches us, that when God shall
renounce the care of his people there will be some weak form of government; but
it is evident that God would no longer perform the office of a shepherd; as
though he had said, that the people would be so deserted, that they would yet
think themselves to be still under the protection of God, as we see to be the
case among the Papists, who proudly make a boasting of this kind &#8212;
&#8220;The Church is never forsaken by God.&#8221; Though the truth of God has
been long ago completely buried, they yet hold that it is still the true Church,
a Church filled with impious superstitions! As then the Papists glory in the
title only, and are content with it, so the Jews, we know, boasted of their
privileges; and these were their weapons when they sought to oppose and contend
with the Apostles &#8212; &#8220;What! are not we the heritage of God? has he
not promised that his sanctuary would be perpetual among us? is not the
sacerdotal unction a sure and infallible proof of his favor?&#8221; As then the
Jews made use of these foolish boastings against the Apostles, so also at this
day the Papists hide all infamy under the title of Church. The same thing
Zechariah here means by saying that he by God&#8217;s command

I have no doubt, means the implements of a shepherds by which he proves himself

according to the usual manner of scripture; and we also at this day concede
sometimes the name of Church to the Papists; and we farther concede the name of
pastors to their milted bishops, but improperly. So also does Zechariah in this
place; though he speaks of a shadow and thing of nought, yet he says that there
would be shepherds in Judea; and he adds the reason &#8212; Because God would
thus punish that wicked and ungrateful people:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will set a shepherd in
the land</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God had now, as we have said,
renounced the office of a shepherd; but he afterwards set over them wolves, and
thieves, and robbers, instead of shepherds, that is, when he executed his
dreadful judgment on the Jews: and he shows at the same time what sort of
shepherds they would be who in future should possess power over
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They were to be such as would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not look after what had been cut
off</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some consider the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twdjknh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>enecachedut</i>, as signifying the sick sheep; but they are in my judgment
mistaken; for careful shepherds seek what is lost, or what has disappeared from
the flock; and this is what Zechariah means, for he says, he will not visit,
that is, he will look after what has been cut off from the flock. Then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he will not seek
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r[nh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>enor</i>, the young. Some explain this of fat lambs; but others more
correctly of those which are tender, not as yet accustomed to follow the
shepherd; for sheep by long use keep from going astray, but lambs are more apt
to wander from the flock, and are easily scattered here and there. This is the
reason why Zechariah makes it one of the duties of a good shepherd
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to seek what is yet
young</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He adds in the third place, the sick,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What is
wounded</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he will not
heal</i></font><font face="Palatino">: and lastly,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he will not feed what
stands</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, what is sound. The word
literally is, to stand; but it means full vigor or strength. What then is
vigorous and sound he will not feed. He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The flesh, of the fat he will
devour, yea, he will break their hoofs</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By
these words he amplifies the cruelty of the shepherd; for he will not be
satisfied with the fat flesh, without breaking also the bones and the hoofs, as
though his barbarity would exceed that of wolves and wild
beasts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see the import of this prophecy: and it
seems to have been added, that the Jews might not flatter themselves with an
external and evanescent form of government, after having departed from God, and
after the covenant which he had made with that nation, having been also
renounced by him, so that he should be no longer their Father, or Guardian, or
Shepherd. Hypocrites, we know, do not easily put off their obstinacy; though
God&#8217;s vengeance should be manifest, yet we see how they harden themselves,
especially when they can cover their wickedness under some false pretense, a
striking example of which we observe among the Papists. We now then perceive the
design of the Holy Spirit, when the Prophet is bid to assume the character, and
take the implements, of a foolish shepherd.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If any one objects, and says that this was not
suitable to a true Prophet of God, the answer is plain &#8212; the Prophet
deviated not from the right course of his calling, though he assumed the
character of a foolish shepherd, an instance of which we have already seen in
Hosea, who was commanded to take a harlot, and to beget spurious children from
one who had been infamous in her character.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;280102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
1:2.) As this was a vision presented to Hosea, it does not follow that he did
anything disgraceful, so as to prevent him from exercising the office of a holy
teacher. So also now, God simply shows to us what would be the fixture condition
of that reprobate people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must further be noticed, that when anything of a
right and good government remains in the external form, there is no reason to
conclude from this that God is the ruler, for, as we have already said, it is a
ridiculous and senseless glorying when men are inflated and take pride in mere
titles or names of distinction. Let us then take heed, that those who bear rule
be rightly called by God, and let them afterwards discharge their office
faithfully, otherwise they may be a hundred times called pastors, after having
attained this degree of honor, and be after all no better than wolves and
robbers; for no one is a true pastor whom the Lord does not rule by his Spirit,
and who is not his minister, and no ungodly pastors, however they may assume the
title, can be called the ministers of God, when he has already, as we see here,
forsaken the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must at the same time be observed, that it happens
not except through the just judgment of God, that things grow worse and worse,
and at length become wholly degenerated; and those who loudly boast and seek to
be esteemed by all as pastors, are altogether senseless, for God has not
appointed them, and the whole filth of the Papal clergy is at this day a
manifest evidence of God&#8217;s wrath and indignation, for he thus justly
punishes the contempt of his word, and that perverseness by which the world thus
awfully provoked him. Though God has been graciously calling the whole world to
himself, we yet see how his favor has been rejected, and we also see how almost
all have gone on in their obstinacy. God had indeed in his great goodness borne
for some ages with this great wickedness, and when he began to punish the
ungrateful, he did not break out to extreme vengeance, for he added to scourges
heavier scourges, but at length he was constrained to make his wrath to flow
like a deluge. Hence has arisen that dreadful confusion which is seen under the
Papacy; and this is what the words of the Prophet mean when God declares here
that foolish pastors would be set up by his command and through his power, as he
would thus execute his judgment on the ungodly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now as the Prophet enumerates here those things which
are inconsistent with the duty of a good shepherd, we may hence learn, on the
other hand, what it is to rule the Church rightly and according to God&#8217;s
will, and also what are the attributes or marks of a good pastor. Whosoever then
would be owned as a good pastor in the Church, must visit those who have been
cut off, seek the young, strive to heal the wounded, and feed well the sound and
the vigorous; and he must also abstain from every kind of cruelty, and he must
not be given to the indulgence of his appetite, nor regard gain, nor exercise
any tyranny. Whosoever will thus conduct himself, will prove that he is really a
true pastor. But what can be more preposterous than for those to be called
pastors who have no flock under their care? who plunder, and gather, and
accumulate what they afterward spend in dissipation?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As then it is quite evident, that all those under the
Papacy who are called bishops, seek the office for no other end but that they
may live sumptuously, without any care or labor, and indulge in pleasures, and
also spend in the gratification of their lust what is unjustly got, &#8212; as
then they are known to be idlers and cruel tyrants, such as the Prophet here
describes, do we not clearly see how childishly they boast of their hierarchy,
and at the same time declare that they derive their origin from the Apostles?
For what sort of successor to Peter or to Paul, is he who exercises the most
barbarous tyranny, and who thinks himself not bound to take care of the flock?
We then see that there is at this day under the Papacy a striking representation
of what the Prophet says here; there is a certain form of government, but God is
wholly separated from such a mask or phantom. But we must also bear in mind,
that the world suffers merited punishment on account of its ingratitude, when it
is thus cruelly and shamefully treated; for it is but just that they who will
not bear the easy yoke of Christ, should be made subject to the power of the
Devil, and be trodden under foot and disgracefully oppressed by tyrants. This is
God&#8217;s righteous judgment. The Church, we know, would not have been turned
upside down had not the greater part rejected the doctrine of salvation, and
shaken off all religion; hence God is in a manner constrained by so great and by
such unbridled wantonness to renounce his office of a shepherd. It then follows

<div><font face="Palatino">In this verse the Prophet teaches us, that though God
would inflict a deserved punishment on the Jews, yet the shepherds themselves
would not escape his vengeance; and thus he reminds them, that even in such a
confused and depressed state of things, he would still in some degree remember
his covenant. He addresses the Shepherds themselves, for he speaks not of one,
but of the whole number, as it has already been stated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woe to the baseless
shepherd</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says; the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lyla</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>alil</i>, means in Hebrew a thing of nought, and hence idols were called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ylyla</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>alilim</i>, nothings; &#8220;Those useless shepherds,&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm143</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
says, &#8220;who forsake the flock.&#8221; He again shows by an explicit term,
that those whom he called shepherds were not worthy of so honorable a title. He
then only concedes the name, for a shepherd who is not solicitous for the safety
of his flock, clearly proves that he is really no shepherd. He then denounces on
him a punishment, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A
sword</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on his right arm and on his right
eye!</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By the sword he means any kind of
punishment, by the arm is to be understood strength, and by the eye prudence. He
means, &#8220;God will punish thee both in soul and body, for his curse shall be
on thy strength and on thine understanding.&#8221; Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Dry up shall his
arm</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This seems not indeed to correspond with
the metaphor of the sword, but it matters not, for the Prophet, as we have said,
includes under that word every kind of punishment.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Dry up
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall his
arm</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, all its vigor shall cease, so as
to become like a piece of decayed wood; and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his right
eye</i></font><font face="Palatino">, the soundness of his mind or his right
understanding, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall by
contracting be contracted</i></font><font face="Palatino">; some read, shall be
darkened; but the verb properly signifies, to wrinkle, as it appears from other
places, and I can find no better way of expressing its meaning than by saying
that the eye would be contracted. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm144</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have briefly explained the object of the Prophet,
even that God would so punish the wickedness of the people, as not to allow
those shepherds to escape whom he would employ as instruments in executing his
vengeance. For though they were under the direction of divine power, we must yet
hold this principle, that they had nothing in common with God; for mere
ambition, avarice, and cruelty instigated them; and nothing was farther from
their purpose than to obey God: but he extorted service from the unwilling and
even the ignorant &#8212; for what end? that he might render to the ungrateful,
the wicked, and the perverse, in their own sinful ways, the reward which they
deserved. We then see that the design of God&#8217;s vengeance is just; and we
also see that the instruments he employs are ungodly: there is therefore no
reason for them to think that they shall be unpunished, because they accomplish
God&#8217;s purpose, for they do not intend any such thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must also bear in mind, that when the extreme
rigour of God prevails, there still remains some evidence of his favor, for some
seed, though few in number, is still perpetuated; for the Church is never so
completely abolished as not to leave any remnants, for whose safety God is
pleased to provide when he executes his vengeance, inasmuch as he stretches
forth his hand at the same time against the ministers he has employed, because
they had cruelly abused their power. So also at this day the milted bishops
shall be made to know how precious to God is the safety of his Church; for
though almost all the people and almost every individual are worthy of the most
tyrannical cruelty, yet we know that some are found in that labyrinth for whom
God has a care. Though then they who at this day possess power under the Papacy
think themselves innocent, while they are robbers and wolves, they shall yet
find that God is a righteous judge, who will visit their abominable cruelty: for
the disorder of the Church is not its destruction, as God ever preserves some
remnant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We also see that the whole strength of men depends on
the grace of God; and farther, that a sound mind proceeds from his Spirit: for
since it is he who takes away from men both their strength and a right judgment,
we hence conclude that to give these things is also in his power. Let men then
know that in order to possess due courage and strength, they are to rely on the
hidden power of God; and let them also know that in order to discern what is
useful and profitable, they must be governed by his Spirit; and let those
especially who bear rule be assured of this, that when they exercise power in
peace, it is God&#8217;s singular gift, and that when they rightly govern their
subjects, and are endued with sound discretion, it is wholly to be ascribed to
an influence from above.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be asked, how can this harmonise &#8212;
that those who were before useless are deprived of understanding and strength?
To this I answer &#8212; that it is the same as though the Prophet had said,
that the baseness of him who was previously an useless shepherd would be made
conspicuous to all. For however deficient they might have been in their office,
they yet for a time deceived the simple multitude; nay, we see at this day how
the milted bishops and abbots and their whole company by their delusive
splendor, dazzle the eyes of most men: they believe that the Pope is the vicar
of God, and the rest the successors of the apostles! But the Prophet here
testifies, that when the ripened time shall come, their shameful conduct shall
be made evident, so that all shall treat them with contempt, and that they shall
become an abomination to all. Though then they may be counted wise and held in
admiration, or at least in honor, yet Zechariah threatens them with the loss of
both; for God&#8217;s curse lies on them, on their arms, and on their right
eyes. This is the import of the passage. I shall begin the next chapter
tomorrow.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The inscription seems not to agree with what follows,
for he does not denounce any evil on the chosen people in this chapter, but, on
the contrary, comforts the miserable, and promises that God would provide for
the safety of his Church. Since then Zechariah speaks only of God&#8217;s favor
and aid, he seems to have mentioned
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>burden</i></font><font face="Palatino">
here improperly or unreasonably; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">a&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mesha</i>, we know, is rightly to be taken for a threatening prophecy. It
might indeed be said, that he promises that God would so deliver his Church as
to teach it at the same time that it would be subject to many evils and trials:
but I rather think that the Prophet&#8217;s design was different, even to show
that the Israelites, who had preferred exile to God&#8217;s favor, would be
punished for their sloth and ingratitude, because it was through their own fault
that they were not again united in one body, and that they did not rightly
worship God in their own country. Interpreters have heedlessly passed over this,
as though it had nothing to do with the subject: but except this be borne in
mind, what is read in this chapter will be altogether without meaning. I
therefore consider that the Prophet here reproves those Israelites who had
rejected what they had long desired, when it was offered to them from above and
beyond all hope: for nothing was so much wished for by them as a free return to
their own country; and we also see how ardently all the Prophets had prayed for
restoration. As then the Israelites, given to ease, and pleasures, and their
worldly advantages, had counted as nothing the permission given them to return,
that they might again be gathered under God&#8217;s protection, it was a base
ingratitude. Hence the Prophet here reproves them, and shows that their success
would be far otherwise than they imagined.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must also observe, that those who were dispersed
in different parts, were retained by their torpidity, because they did not think
that the state of the people would continue; for they saw, as they had before
found, that Judea was surrounded by inveterate enemies, and also that they would
not be a people sufficiently strong to repel the assaults of those around them;
for they had already been accustomed to bear all things, and though they might
have had some courage, they had completely lost it, having been oppressed by so
long a servitude. Since then the ten tribes entertained these ideas, they did
not avail themselves of the present kindness of God. Thus it was, that they
wholly alienated themselves from the Church of God, and renounced as it were of
their own accord that covenant, on which was founded the hope of eternal
salvation.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm145</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What then does Zechariah teach us in this chapter?
Even that God would be the guardian of Jerusalem, to defend it against all
violence, and that though it might be surrounded by nations for the purpose of
assailing it, he would not yet suffer it to be overcome: and we shall see that
many other things are stated here; but it is enough to touch now on the main
point, that God would not forsake that small company and the weak and feeble
remnant; and that however inferior the Jews might be to their enemies, yet the
power of God alone would be sufficient to defend and keep them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If it be then now asked, why the Prophet calls the
word he received a </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>burden on
Israel?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The answer is plainly this, that the
Israelites were now as it were rotting among foreign nations without any hope of
deliverance, having refused to be gathered under God&#8217;s protection, though
he had kindly and graciously invited them all to return. Since then God had
effected nothing, by stretching forth his hands, being ready to embrace them
again, this was the reason for the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>burden</i></font><font face="Palatino">
of which Zechariah speaks; for they would be touched with grief and with envy
when they saw their brethren protected by God&#8217;s aid, and that they
themselves were without any hope of deliverance. In short, there is an implied
contrast between the ten tribes and the house of Judah; and this is evident from
the context. Having now ascertained the Prophet&#8217;s design, we shall proceed
to the words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
burden</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the word of Jehovah on Israel:
Say does Jehovah who expanded the heavens</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc.
Zechariah thus exalts God in order to confirm the authority of this prophecy;
for no doubt the creation of heaven and earth and of man is here mentioned on
account of what is here announced. We have elsewhere seen similar declarations;
for when anything is said difficult to be believed, what is promised will have
no effect on us, except the infinite power of God be brought to our minds. God
then, that he may gain credit to his promises, bids us to raise up our eyes to
the heavens and carefully to consider his wonderful workmanship, and also to
turn our eyes down to the earth, where also his ineffable power is apparent;
and, in the third place, he calls our attention to the consideration of our own
nature. Since then what Zechariah says could hardly be believed, he prescribes
to the Jews the best remedy &#8212; they were to raise upwards their eyes, and
then to turn them to the earth. The expanse of the heavens constrains us to
admire him; for however stupid we may be, we cannot look on the sun, and the
moon and stars, and on the whole bright expanse above, without some and even
strong emotions of fear and of reverence. Since then God exceeds all that men
can comprehend in the very creation of the world, what should hinder us from
believing even that which seems to us in no way probable? for it is not meet for
us to measure God&#8217;s works by what we can understand, for we cannot
comprehend, no, not even the hundredth part of them, however attentively we may
apply all the powers of our minds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor is it yet a small matter when he adds, that God
had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>formed the spirit of
man</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for we know that we live; the body of
itself would be without any strength or motion, were it not endued with life;
and the soul which animates the body is invisible. Since then experience proves
to us the power of God, which is not yet seen by our eyes, why should we not
expect what he promises, though the event may appear incredible to us, and
exceed all that we can comprehend. We now then understand why the Prophet
declares, that God </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>expanded thee
heavens, and founded the earth, and formed the spirit of
man</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm146</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By
saying &#8220;in the midst of him&#8221;, he means, that the spirit dwells
within; for the body, we allow, is as it were its tabernacle. Let us proceed

<div><font face="Palatino">Zechariah begins here to teach us what I have briefly
explained, that Jerusalem would be under the protection of God, who would render
it safe and secure against all enemies. But he uses here figurative terms, which
make the point more evident. He says, that Jerusalem would be a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>threshold of
bruising</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or breaking. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;s</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>saph</i>, means a threshold almost everywhere in Scripture. But some think
that it means here a cup, and then they translate
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l[r</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rol</i>, drunkenness, or fury. But as this word also means breaking, it is
not unsuitable to say that Jerusalem is here called a threshold at which people
stumble, so that he who comes against this threshold either breaks a bone or
receives some other injury. At the same time the Prophet seems to express
something more, that whosoever ascended to attack Jerusalem would meet with a
stumbling block, by which he might have his legs broken or bruised. The meaning
then is, that access to Jerusalem would be closed up, so that enemies would not
overcome it, though they reached the walls and the gates, for they would
stumble, as it is said, at the threshold.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If the other rendering be approved, the sense would
be suitable, &#8212; that all the ungodly, while devising schemes against
God&#8217;s Church, would be inebriated by their own counsels; yea, that their
drink would be deadly to them: for the passions of men produce effects like
drunkenness. When therefore the ungodly gather their forces against the Church,
it is the same as though they were greedily swallowing down wine; for the
drunken meet together to indulge in excesses. The meaning then would be, &#8212;
that this immoderate drinking would be fatal to the nations. But I prefer the
former view, &#8212; that though the gates of the holy city were open, or even
an easy access were made through the walls, yet God would on every side be a
defense, so that enemies would stumble, as we have said, at the very threshold
and bruise themselves. And this promise was very necessary then, for Jerusalem
was exposed to the assaults of all, as it could not have defended itself by
moats or walls or mounds: but the Lord here promises that it would be a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>threshold of
bruising</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Also against
Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or over Judah,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it shall be during the siege
against Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet, as I think,
extends the promise to the whole land, as though he had said, &#8220;Though the
compass of Jerusalem should not contain all the inhabitants, yet they shall be
everywhere safe; for God will take them under his protection.&#8221; I wonder
why some interpreters have omitted the preposition
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ol,</i> and have translated thus, &#8220;Judah also shall be in the siege
against Jerusalem:&#8221; and they elicit a meaning wholly different, even that
some of the Jews themselves would become perfidious, who would not spare their
brethren and friends, but become hostile to them, and unite their forces to
those of heathen nations. But I consider the meaning to be the reverse of this,
&#8212; that when Jerusalem shall be besieged, the Lord will put impediments
everywhere, which will hinder and prevent the assaults of enemies. When God, he
says, shall defend the holy city, even this very thing, (for I apply this phrase
to God&#8217;s protection,) even this very thing shall be through the whole
land; as though he had said, &#8220;God will not only be the guardian of the
city alone, but also of the whole of the holy land.&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino">Zechariah adds here another metaphor, which is very
apposite; for when the ungodly made war against the holy city, the object was
not to reduce it only to subjection, or to impose a tribute or a tax, or simply
to rule over it, &#8212; what then? to cut it off entirely and obliterate its
name. Since then such a cruelty would instigate enemies to assail the holy city,
the Prophet here interposes and declares that it would be to them a most
burdensome stone. He thus compares the enemies of Jerusalem to a man who
attempts to take up a stone when he is too weak to do so. He then injures his
own strength; for when a man tries to do what is too much for him, he loosens
some of his joints, or breaks his sinews. The Prophet then means, that though
many nations conspired against Jerusalem, and made every effort to overthrow it,
they should yet at length find it to be a weight far too heavy for them: they
should therefore break or lacerate their own arms, for their sinews would be
broken by over-exertion. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm148</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some
explain the last clause more frigidly, &#8220;In tearing he will be torn,&#8221;
as when any one takes up a rough stone, he tears his own hands. But the Prophet,
I have no doubt, meant to set forth something more serious; and each clause
would thus correspond much better; for as we have said, the object of the
ungodly was to remove Jerusalem, so as not to leave a stone upon a stone: but
God declares here that it would be too heavy a burden, so that they would find
their own strength broken in attempting inconsiderately to remove what could not
be transferred from its own place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the reason for this prophecy is, because God was
the founder of Jerusalem, as it is said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Its foundations
are in the holy mountains, love does the Lord the gates of Sion,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
87:1,2;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and again it is said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Jehovah in the

46:5.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must also remember what we have observed in the
last verse: for though the heavens are in continual motion, they yet retain
their positions, and do not fall into disorder; but were the heavens and the
earth blended together, still Jerusalem, founded by God&#8217;s hand and exempt
from the common lot of men, and whose condition was peculiar, would remain firm
and unchangeable. We hence see why the Prophet says, that there would be no
other issue to the ungodly, while attempting to overthrow Jerusalem, than to
wound and tear themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And assemble against them shall
all nations</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This, as we have said, was added
in order to show, that though enemies flocked together from every quarter, God
would yet be superior to them. This clause then contains an amplification, to
encourage the faithful to continue in their hope with invincible constancy,
though they saw themselves surrounded by hosts of enemies. It afterwards follows

<div><font face="Palatino">He pursues here the same subject, but in other words,
&#8212; that multiplicity of means is in God&#8217;s hand, by which he can drive
away and break down the fury of enemies. By the words
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>horse and its
rider</i></font><font face="Palatino">, the Prophet, stating a part for the
whole, means whatever is strong, and intimates that it can be easily overcome by
divine power</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will smite every horse with
stupor</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm149</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Military strength, we know, is in horses and horsemen; but he says that the
horses would be stunned, and the horsemen seized as it were with madness, so
that they would destroy themselves, and could do no harm to the Church. He then
confirms what he said before &#8212; that though the whole world conspired
against the Church, there would yet be sufficient power in God to repel and
check all their assaults and he mentions stupor, madness, and blindness, that
the faithful might know that God can by hidden means either destroy or put to
flight all their enemies. Though then God fights not with drawn swords, nor uses
the common mode of warfare, yet the Prophet says, that he is prepared with other
means to lay prostrate their enemies; for even the most powerful in the world
cannot proceed so far as to confound their enemies by blindness and madness; but
the Prophet here shows, that though no way appears to us by which God may
deliver us, we are yet to entertain firm hope, for he can by his breath destroy
all enemies, as he can render then blind, and take from them understanding, and
wisdom, and strength.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will open mine eyes on the
house of Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. A reason is here given why all
enemies would be smitten with stupor and madness, because the Lord would have a
regard for his Church; for to open the eyes means the same thing as to have a
care for a thing. It had seemed good to God to neglect his people for a time,
and this neglect was as it were an oblivion. Hence the saints often complain
&#8220;How longs wilt thou sleep! how long wilt thou close thine eyes! Look
down, O Lord, and see.&#8221; So in this place Zechariah means that God would
yet care for his people, so as to subdue their enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may hence learn a useful doctrine &#8212; that, in
the first place, there is nothing better for us than to be gathered under the
shadow of God&#8217;s protection, however destitute of any fortress the Church
may be, yea, were she to have innumerable enemies hostile to her, and to be
without any strength to resist them. Though then the Church were thus grievously
tried, and be in the midst of many dangers, and exposed even to death, let us
learn from this passage that those are miserable indeed who through fear or
cowardice separate themselves from her, and that they who call on God, and cast
on him the care of their safety, shall be made blessed, though the whole world
were mad against them, though the weapons of all nations were prepared for their
ruin, and horses and horsemen were assembled to overwhelm them; for the defense
of God is a sufficient protection to his Church. This is one thing. Then let us
learn to exercise our faith, when God seems to cast us as it were between the
teeth of wolves; for though he may not afford any visible aid, yet he knows how
to deliver us, and possesses hidden means of help, which we may not perceive,
because his purpose is to try our faith and our patience. And lastly, let us
learn, that when God connives at our miseries, as though he had forgotten us,
yet our hope, founded on him, can never be disappointed; for if we abide among
his flock, he will at length open his eyes upon us, he will really show that he
cares for our safety. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He still continues the same subject &#8212; that
however small and feeble the flock of God would be, it would yet have sufficient
strength; for the Lord would stand on the side of those who fled to him. Though
then Jerusalem was not as yet filled with citizens, and though there was but one
city, yet Zechariah testifies that its strength would be invincible; but he
speaks of the chiefs of Judah comparatively. Formerly, we know, it had a great
number of men, and great armies were raised from that one tribe and the half
tribe of Benjamin. Though then there were formerly many provinces, though the
country was full of populous towns, yet almost Jerusalem alone had then begun to
be inhabited: but the Prophet says here, that though the whole Church was
gathered within the narrow bounds of one city, it would yet have sufficient
strength to resist all the attacks of enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Say

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall the chiefs of
Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, though formerly the governors
or commanders of thousands had forces in their several towns, yet now all would
look to one city; for the land was nearly forsaken and without inhabitants; at
the same time they were to entertain hope, for their strength was to be in the
Lord. Some insert a conjunction, &#8220;Strength will be to me and to the
citizens of Jerusalem;&#8221; but they pervert the meaning; for the Prophet
meant to say in one sentence what I have stated &#8212; that the eyes of all
would be directed to one city only, and that yet there would be sufficient
ground for hope and confidence, for they would become strong, not in themselves,
but in their God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is a change of number, when he says, a strength
to me, for he had spoken of chiefs; it ought then to have been

had said, &#8220;No one of the chiefs shall look to his own land, but, on the
contrary, direct his eyes to the holy city, and be content with the defense of a
few men.&#8221; Hence he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In
Jehovah of hosts, their God</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for he means that
God would be then the protector of that people whom he had for a time forsaken.
And he calls him again the Jehovah of hosts, in order to set forth his
invincible power, lest the minds of the godly should fail through fear, on
seeing themselves far unequal to their enemies.

compares them to a </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>flaming
torch</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and heathen nations to wood and stubble
or chaff. The Spirit speaks thus also in other places; and the reason is to be
noticed; for when the ungodly assail the Church of God, all things seem to
threaten its ruin; but God declares that they shall be like chaff or wood.
&#8220;The house of Israel,&#8221; says Isaiah, &#8220;shall be a flaming fire,
and shall consume all the wood of the forest:&#8221; so also in this place,
&#8220;There shall be indeed a great host of enemies, assembled against Israel;
but the Lord will consume them, for he will be like fire in the midst of his
people, and his people also shall be through the secret power of the Spirit like
a burning pot or a torch, which shall consume the chaff, in which there is
nothing substantial.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet shows again that the deliverance of
the Church is ever wonderful: and hence foolishly do they act who rely on human
and earthly instrumentality, and wilfully bind God to their own ways; for
whenever God promises to be their deliverer, their inquiry is, &#8220;But how
can this be? whence will come this aid to us? how will the hand of the Lord be
stretched forth to us? whence will he gather his army?&#8221; Inasmuch then as
we are wont thus anxiously to inquire, and thus drive away from us the aid of
God, let this truth, taught by the Prophet, be borne in mind, &#8212; that
though enemies in great numbers may come upon us, they shall yet be like a heap
of wood, and we like fire; for though we have no strength, yet the Lord by his
hidden favor will cause that our enemies shall even, by coming nigh us, be
consumed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To the same purpose is the next similitude, &#8212;
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they would be a torch in
handfuls of chaff</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for here also the singular
number is used for the plural. Then follows an explanation,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Consume shall they on the right
hand, and on the left, all nations around</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
Zechariah seems here to ascribe an insatiable cruelty, and a revengeful passion
to the faithful, who yet are to be influenced by a meek spirit, so that they may
imitate their heavenly Father. But here he speaks not of their disposition and
feeling, but only shows, that all the ungodly shall be frustrated in their
expectation of success, and not only so, but that they shall also be destroyed.
The more furiously then they assail the Church, the more sudden shall be their
destruction; for though the faithful may wish to spare them, yet God, the
righteous judge, will not spare them. In short, the work of God himself, as in
other places, is ascribed to the Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the last place he declares, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jerusalem shall stand in its own
place, where it was</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There is here a sort of
repetition; and it was made, because enemies thought, as we have already stated,
that they could destroy Jerusalem so as wholly to obliterate it: but the Prophet
on the other hand says, that it would be established in its own place, because
God had chosen it as the place where he purposed to be worshipped, and he had
chosen it, as it is often said by Moses, to commemorate his own name. In a word,
he intimates, that the Church would be perpetually established: though all
mortals conspired for its ruin and assailed it on every side, yet the sanctuary
of God, as he had promised, would continue there still, even to the advent of
Christ; for then, we know, Jerusalem was to be wholly destroyed, together with
the temple, as an end was to come on all these things, and the world was to be
renewed.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ylea</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aelim</i>, tents, which afforded a temporary accommodation; for they were not
strongly built, as it is evident from many passages. I allow that all houses
without any difference are sometimes called tabernacles,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ylha</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aelim</i>; but the word properly signifies a tent, built as a temporary
convenience; for it is said that the fathers dwelt in tents, when they had no
fixed habitation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now see why the Prophet speaks of tents. He
may have alluded to their dwelling in the wilderness; but as this may seem too
remote, I consider that he simply refers to the tents in which the Jews dwelt
when they had entered the land, after their deliverance from Egypt; for they
must have been wonderfully protected by the hand of God, inasmuch as they had
provoked all their neighbors and kindled the hatred of all against themselves.
There were indeed some fortified cities; but for the most part they lived in
villages, and the greatest part of the people were no doubt satisfied with their
tents or sheds. Hence as the Israelites then had no defense, the Prophet now
reminds them, that they were then protected by God alone, in order that they
might believe that they should in future be safe and secure, as God would defend
them to the end. There is then here an implied comparison between tents and
fortified cities; and the Prophet bids them to consider what their fathers had
formerly experienced, for God faithfully defended them, even when they were
unprotected and exposed to the attacks of their enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah will save the
tents</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc.; as though he had said, &#8220;Know
that your fathers were formerly defended by the hand of God, when they did not,
as to the greater part of them, dwell in cities, but lived scattered in
villages: since God then had been the preserver of his people many ages before a
king was made, believe that he will be the same to you hereafter.&#8221; But we
must yet remember what we said yesterday, &#8212; that the Jews who had returned
to their country had a promise of God&#8217;s help, in order that the
Israelites, who were retained by their own sloth in Babylon, might know that
they were justly suffering punishment for their ingratitude, because they had
not given glory to God, as they ought to have done, by committing themselves to
his protection, and thus relying on his defense, so as not to seek other helps
from the world: he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>save</i></font><font face="Palatino">
them, he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as at the
beginning</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for as, the particle of similitude,
is to be understood here. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm151</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And hence boast shall not the
honor of the house of David and the honor of the citizen of Jerusalem over
Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This latter clause is added, I think, by
way of explanation; and this is evident from the subject itself for God
declares, that he would be the protector of the helpless, so that they would be
no less victorious than if they possessed many armed soldiers, and were
furnished with money and other necessaries to carry on war. For by comparing
here the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem with Judah, he has no
doubt a regard to this, &#8212; that though there was no kingdom and no
fortified cities, there would yet be sufficient protection in him alone, so that
he could by himself defend the people, though unarmed, and having no swords, nor
power, nor any other requisite means.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Boast
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall not the house of
David</i></font><font face="Palatino">: and this seems to have been mentioned
designedly, for while they trusted in their own wealth and power, they did not
rest on God as they ought to have done.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As then the Jews had been elated with vain pride,
while the dignity of the kingdom remained, and while they possessed wealth and
warlike instruments, God here reproves this false confidence; for the Jews had
thus obscured his gratuitous favor. For however great might have been the
treasures collected by David and Solomon, and however formidable they might have
been to their enemies and the neighboring nations, they ought yet to have relied
on the protection of God alone. Since then earthly helps had inflated their
minds, God now reproves their vain conceit, and shows that the condition of the
people would be no less happy, when no king sat on the throne, and no aids
enlisted for the protection of the people; and therefore he declares, that
though exposed to all evils, they should yet be safe and secure, for God would
defend them. This is the reason why the Prophet says, that the royal posterity
would not glory against Judah, though dwelling in tents, nor the citizens of
Jerusalem, who were then as it were the courtiers: for as the royal seat was at
Jerusalem, a sort of vain boasting was made by all the citizens. As then all of
them despised the inhabitants of the country, when the condition of the city was
illustrious, the Prophet says, the posterity of David and Jerusalem shall not
hereafter glory against the people of Judah, scattered in the open fields. It
then follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He goes on with the same subject; and he says that
God would be like a shield to protect the Jews. For though the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;gy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>igen</i>, is used here, yet as it is derived from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;gm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>megen</i>, which means a shield, that metaphor is to be understood here,
&#8212; even that the Jews, though without power and without warlike
instruments, would yet be safe under the protection of God, for he being their
shield would be sufficient. And God is here indirectly opposed to all kinds of
fortresses which men too anxiously seek, and on which they vainly depend. The
Prophet then no doubt claims here for God a power, which in opposition to the
whole world, and when no other help appears, would be found sufficient to subdue
all enemies and to save his people.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall
be</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
shield</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm152</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there seems to be here something inconsistent;
for he had said before that the Jews would be safe wherever they lived, though
they did not dwell at Jerusalem; but now he confines this promise to the
citizens of Jerusalem. The answer to this is plain: We observed yesterday, that
the piety of those was commended who had preferred to undergo many and grievous
trials in returning home, and then to expose themselves to many dangers, rather
than to continue in exile, as in that case they wholly separated themselves from
the temple. Now since this was the object of the Prophet, it is no wonder that
he one while names the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and that at another time he
includes generally all the Jews. And by saying in the last verse, that the
citizens of Jerusalem were not to glory against the country people, scattered in
the villages, he intended, in adopting this way of speaking, to humble the
citizens of Jerusalem, but not to exclude them from the promise made to all: as
God then was to be the defender of all, the Prophet returns again to Jerusalem.
For as God had chosen there his sanctuary, it is not to be wondered that the
place was precious in his sight. But it was yet necessary to take away all pride
from the Jews, that they might not, as it has been said, trust in earthly aids
and supports. This is the meaning, when he says, the protection of God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be on the inhabitants of
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
feeble</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm153</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
among them shall be like David</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some give a
refined explanation &#8212; that as David, who was not trained up for war, and
was by no means strong, being, almost a boy, yet slew the proud giant Goliath,
so the feeble among the Jews, as they think, will, by God&#8217;s power, be made
victorious over their enemies. But this seems forced. The Prophet, then, I have
no doubt, connects the whole together, and considers David as a king; for when
David slew Goliath, he was yet a boy, remarkable for no velour. After he
attained the kingdom, he became more eminent, we know, in every way, than all
the kings of the earth. It is then this eminence which the Prophet has in view,
when he says that the least and the most despised among them would be like
David; as though he had said &#8212; &#8220;They shall all be endued with royal
and heroic velour, not only the common people, but even those who seemed to be
like women, and who possessed nothing that was manly; they would yet excel as
David in heroic velour.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then follows &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the whole house of David
shall be as angels</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, the royal
posterity shall be remarkable for angelic velour. And it was necessary to add
this, that the faithful might not think that the house of David, from which
salvation was to be expected, would be reduced to nothing. For whatever had been
promised to them might have vanished, were not that promise to stand firm, on
which was founded the salvation of the whole people &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Thy house shall
remain for ever.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198937&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
89:37.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now as Zechariah seemed to have cast down and wholly
overthrown the royal house, it might have occurred to the minds of the faithful,
&#8220;whence then shall arise our salvation? for it is certain that without
Christ we are wholly lost.&#8221; Now Christ was not to come forth, except from
the house of David. The Prophet then does here opportunely declare, that the
royal house would be most eminent, as though all the men belonging to it were
angels. He puts down the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yhla</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aleim</i>, which also means God; but he adds in the same sentence &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As the angel of Jehovah before
their face</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm154</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
Prophet compares here, no doubt, the posterity of David to the angel, who had
been the leader of the people and the minister of redemption. That angel we
conclude was Christ; for though God then appointed many angels to his people,
yet Christ, as it is well known, was their prince and head. The Prophet then
bids the Jews here to look for the perpetual aid of God, since in the royal
house were not only angels, but even the very leader of the fathers, who had
exercised the ineffable power of God in redeeming the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the design of the Prophet: The
import of the whole is, that God would so undertake the defense and protection
of his people, as to be of himself sufficient, without any other aid; and also
that the minister of salvation would be in the royal house itself; for as
formerly, when their fathers were led out of Egypt, God had exercised his power
through an angel, so now he had set over them a Mediator. And in accordance with
this meaning he adds,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;hynpl</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lepeniem</i>, &#8220;before their face.&#8221; He bids the faithful to attend
to the royal house, which was then deprived of all dignity, so that it had no
power to help. Nothing indeed was then seen in the posterity of David but what
was degrading, and even contemptible; and yet the Prophet bids them to expect
salvation from that house, which was so brought down as to possess nothing
worthy of being noticed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may now ask, when was this prophecy fulfilled?
Zechariah does indeed predict great things; but in reviewing all histories,
nothing of a corresponding character is to be found. It must nevertheless be
observed, that this blessed and happy state ass promised to the Jews, because
from them Christ was to arise, and also because Jerusalem was to be the mother
of all Churches; for from thence the law was to go forth, and from thence God
had determined to send forth the royal scepter, that the son of David might rule
over the whole world. Since the case was so, we may now easily understand how
the condition of that miserable people would become happier and more glorious
than under the rich and flourishing kingdom of David; for Christ would at length
come, in whom complete happiness was to be found.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may now also add this &#8212; that though few of
the Jews embraced the favor of Christ, and the rest fell away, and thus gave
place to the Gentiles, yet however small was the portion of the faithful, still
the Prophet does not speak here hyperbolically, for the thing itself is what
ought to be regarded; and that the Jews did not enjoy this blessed state, was
owing to their own ingratitude; but this detracts nothing from the felicity
described here by Zechariah. Let us proceed -</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet repeats again, that though ungodly and
wicked men assailed the Church in great number on every side, God would yet be
its defender. By saying, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
seek to destroy</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc., he means that God would
he fully bent (<i>intentum</i>) to destroy, as men are wont to be anxious when
they earnestly pursue an object. Lest then the faithful should think that they
should perish through the disdain, or the neglect, or the forgetfulness of God,
he says, that he would be their anxious defender.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will seek

solicitous, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to destroy all the

<div><font face="Palatino">This promise no doubt extends far wider than to the
Jews; for he prophesies here concerning the kingdom of Christ: for if we
consider the state of the people during the whole of the intervening period,
from their return to the coming of Christ, the Prophet will certainly appear to
have given here a hope of something far greater than what had taken place. But
he had a regard especially to Christ. Here then is promised a perpetual defense
to the Church; and hence also proceeds confidence as to salvation, for God
carefully watches over us, that he may effectually oppose all our
enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I only briefly touch on these things, which require
long and minute consideration: but it is enough for me to show briefly the
meaning of the Prophet, provided this be done clearly, so that each may then
apply what is said to his own improvement. We may in the meantime learn also
from the words of the Prophet, that the Church is ever to be disquieted in this
world, for not only one enemy will cause trouble to it, but even many nations
shall rise up against it. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">At the beginning of this verse the Prophet intimates,
that though the Jews were then miserable and would be so in future, yet God
would be merciful to them: and thus he exhorts them to patience, that they might
not faint through a long-continued weariness. For it was not enough to promise
to them what we have noticed respecting God&#8217;s aid, except Zechariah had
added, that God would at length be merciful and gracious to them after they had
endured so many evils, that the world would regard them as almost
consumed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>effusion of the
spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">, the expression at the first view seems
hard to be understood; for what is it to pour forth the spirit of grace? He
ought rather to have said thus, &#8220;I will pour my grace upon you.&#8221; But
what he means is, that God would be merciful, for his spirit would be moved to
deliver the Jews; for he compares the spirit of God here to the mind of man, and
we know that Scripture often uses language of this kind. The phrase then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will pour forth the spirit of
grace</i></font><font face="Palatino">, may be thus suitably expressed &#8212;
&#8220;I will pour forth my bowels of mercy,&#8221; or, &#8220;I will open my
whole heart to show mercy to this people,&#8221; or, &#8220;My Spirit shall be
like the spirit of man, which is wont to move him to give help to the
miserable.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand the sense in which God may be
fitly said to pour forth the spirit of grace. It may yet be taken in a more
refined manner, as meaning that God would not only show mercy to his people, but
also make them sensible of his mercy; and this view I am inclined to take,
especially on account of what follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the spirit of
commiserations</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or, of lamentations, for the
word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ynwnjt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tachnunim</i>, commonly means lamentations in Hebrew. Some render it
&#8220;prayers,&#8221; but improperly, for they express not the force of the
word. It is always put in the plural number, at least with this termination: and
there is but one place where we can render it commiserations, that is, in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
31:9 &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;In commiserations
will I restore them.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But even there it may be rendered lamentations
consistently with the whole verse; for the Prophet says, &#8220;They shall
weep,&#8221; and afterwards adds, &#8220;In lamentations will I restore
them.&#8221; The greater part indeed of interpreters render it here, prayers;
but the Hebrews prefer to translate it commiserations, and for this reason,
because they consider that the spirit of grace is nothing else but simply grace
itself. The spirit of grace is indeed grace itself united with faith: for God
often hears the miserable, extends his hand to them, and brings them a most
effectual deliverance, while they still continue blind and remain unconcerned.
It is then far better that the spirit of grace should be poured forth on us,
than grace itself: for except the spirit of God penetrate into our hearts and
instils into us a feeling need of grace, it will not only be useless, but even
injurious; for God at length will take vengeance on our ingratitude when he sees
his grace perishing through our indifference. What then the Prophet, in my
opinion, means is, that God will at length be so propitious to the Jews as to
pour forth on them the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit of
grace</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the spirit of
lamentations</i></font><font face="Palatino">, in order to obtain
grace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They who render the word prayers, do not, as I have
already said, convey the full import of the term. But we may also take
commiserations in a passive sense and consistently with its common meaning:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will pour forth the spirit of
grace</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that they themselves may perceive my
grace; and then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the spirit of
commiserations</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that having deplored their
evils, they may understand that they have been delivered by a power from above.
Hence Zechariah promises here more than before; for he speaks not here of
God&#8217;s external aid, by which they were to be defended, but of inward
grace, by which God would pour hidden joy into their hearts, that they might
know and find by a sure experience that he was propitious to
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But if the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;wnwnjt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tachnunim</i>, be rendered commiserations, the meaning would be, as I have
already stated, that the Jews, through the dictation and the suggestions of the
Holy Spirit, would find God merciful to them; but if we render it lamentations,
then the Prophet must be viewed as saying something more &#8212; that the Jews,
previously so hardened in their evils, as not to flee to God for help, would
become at length suppliants, because the Spirit would inwardly so touch their
hearts as to lead them to deplore their state before God, and thus to express
their complaints to Him: 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm155</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
this view is more fully confirmed by what follows.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall look to
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whom they have
pierced</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We then see here that not only an
external grace or favor was promised to the Jews, but an internal light of
faith, the author of which is the Spirit; for he it is who illuminates our minds
to see the goodness of God, and it is he also who turns our hearts: and for this
reason he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall look
to me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm156</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For
God, as I have already reminded you, deals very bountifully with the
unbelieving, but they are blind; and hence he pours forth his grace without any
benefit, as though he rained on flint or on and rocks. However bountifully then
God may bestow his grace on the unbelieving, they yet render his favor useless,
for they are like stones.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, as Zechariah declares that the Jews would at
length </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>look to
</i></font><font face="Palatino">God, it follows, that the spirit of repentance
and the light of faith are promised to them, so that they may know God as the
author of their salvation, and feel so assured that they are already saved, as
in future to devote themselves entirely to him:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>look to me whom they have
pierced</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here also the Prophet indirectly
reproves the Jews for their great obstinacy, for God had restored them, and they
had been as untameable as wild beasts; for this piercing is to be taken
metaphorically for continual provocation, as though he had said, that the Jews
in their perverseness were prepared as it were for war, that they goaded and
pierced God by their wickedness or by the weapons of their rebellion. As then
they had been such, he says now, that such a change would be wrought by God that
they would become quite different, for they would learn to

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND SIXTY-SECOND</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE said in our yesterday&#8217;s lecture, that the
words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall look to me whom
they have pierced</i></font><font face="Palatino">, are to be taken
metaphorically, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm157</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for
the Prophet expresses here what he had said before &#8212; that the Jews would
some time return to a sound mind, that is, when endued with a spirit of grace
and of commiserations. For it is a true conversion when men seriously
acknowledge that they are at war with God, and that he is their enemy until they
are reconciled; for except a sinner sets himself in a manner before God&#8217;s
tribunal, he is never touched by a true feeling of repentance. It is therefore
necessary for us to remember, that God has been offended by us, and that we
have, as far as we could, instigated him to destroy us, inasmuch as we have
provoked his wrath and his vengeance. This then is the real meaning of the
Prophet here: for the Jews, after having in various ways and for a long time
heedlessly provoked God, would sometime be led to repentance, inasmuch as they
would become terrified by God&#8217;s judgment, while no one of them thought
previous]y that they had any account to render.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">John says that this prophecy was fulfilled in Christ,
when his side was pierced by a spear,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431937&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
19:37;) and this is most true: for it was necessary that the visible symbol
should be exhibited in the person of Christ, in order that the Jews might know
that he was the God who had spoken by the Prophets; and we have elsewhere seen
similar instances. The Jews then had crucified their God when they grieved his
Spirit; but Christ also was as to his flesh pierced by them. And this is what
John means &#8212; that God by that visible symbol made it evident, that he had
not only been formerly provoked in a disgraceful manner by the Jews, but that at
length in the person of his only-begotten Son this great sin was added to their
disgraceful impiety, that they pierced even the side of Christ. It is indeed
true, that the side of Christ was pierced by a Roman soldier, but, as Peter
says, he was crucified by the Jews, for they were the authors of his death, and
Pilate was almost forced by them to condemn him.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440236&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
2:36.) So then the piercing of his side is justly to be ascribed to the Jews,
for they executed what their mad impiety suggested by the hand of a foreign
soldier.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it must be observed, that the words of the
Prophet are not cited by John with reference to repentance, for he does not
speak there of repentance; but his object was briefly to show, that Christ is
that God who had from the beginning spoken by the Prophets; for he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall look to
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is certain that the only true God, the
creator of heaven and earth, declared this through his Spirit by the mouth of
Zechariah. Then Christ is that same God. We do not, however, thus confound the
persons; but we are to conclude that the essence of the Father and of the Son is
simple and the same, which those wicked men, who now disturb the Church, attempt
to deny. For they imagine that the Father is the only true God, and then they
allow that Christ also is a God; but they devise a new kind of divinity, like a
river issuing from a fountain. They therefore deny that Christ is the only true
God; though they allow that he was begotten from eternity, they yet teach us
that the essence of the Father and of the Son is not the same; and they regard
Christ as some sort of phantom, I know not what; for they will never allow him
to be that God, the author of this prophecy. They say, as they necessarily must
say, that Zechariah spoke by his Spirit; but they even account for this by
referring to the proximate and the second cause, inasmuch as God the Father
employed his own Son. They, however, pertinaciously contend, that Christ is a
God not of the same essence with the Father; for the word God, as they imagine,
does not properly belong to any but to the Father.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we clearly see how the Holy Spirit condemns this
blasphemy; for he shows by the mouth of the evangelist, that he was not a kind
of a second God, who was crucified, but that he was the God who spoke by Moses,
and who thus declared himself to be the only true God, and affirmed the same by
the mouth of Isaiah &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;My glory will I
not give to another: I, I am, and none besides me.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
42:10:)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows what we read in our last lecture, but
time did not allow me to give an explanation:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lament</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall they for him a
lamentation as that for an only-begotten; and bitter shall they be for him as
with a bitterness for a first-born</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Zechariah
goes on with the same subject; for he promises as before the spirit of
repentance to the Jews, and mentions a particular kind of repentance; but by
stating a part for the whole, he includes under this kind every part of it. The
beginning of repentance, we know, is grief and lamentation. As then by the
phrase, &#8220;They shall look to me,&#8221; he had not sufficiently expressed
what he wished, he now explains his meaning more clearly by mentioning
lamentation and grief, that God would at length grant the Jews repentance for
heaving crucified Christ. The person indeed is changed; but we know that it is a
common thing with the Prophets to introduce God as speaking, now in the first
person, then in the second person. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm158</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> If any
one be disposed to think that there is a difference marked out here as to the
person, I do not object; but I fear that it is a refinement that will not stand.
At the same time we may state this explanation &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall look to me whom they
pierced</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Was God the Father pierced? By no
means; for he had not put on flesh in which he could have suffered; but this was
done by his only begotten Son. Why then does the Father say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall look to
me?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> the answer given is, because of the unity
of the essence. It then follows &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall lament for him and
be bitter for him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There is here a transition
from the first to the third person; for though Christ is the same with the
Father, yet different as to his person. But, as I have already said, I am not
inclined to enforce this view; for the Hebrew mode of speaking seems to
countenance the other opinion &#8212; that the Prophet first introduces God as
the speaker, and then narrates himself, as God&#8217;s minister, what would take
place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what I have just referred to is doubtless true
&#8212; that repentance is here described by stating a part for the whole; for
the first thing in order is sorrow, according to what Paul teaches us in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470710&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 7:10; and the reason may also be gathered from what I have said
&#8212; that it cannot be that sin will displease us, and we repent, except our
guilt goad and wound us, while we acknowledge that God is an avenger of sins,
and that we have to do with him; for when God the Judge comes forth to punish
us, must we not necessarily be smitten with dreadful grief and alarm, yea, be
almost so allowed up by it? Hence that bitterness that is mentioned; and hence
lamentation; for it cannot be otherwise, when we dread God&#8217;s vengeance
suspended over us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet, it may be said, seems to mean
something else &#8212; that they will lament on account of Christ, and not on
their own account. To this a ready answer may be given &#8212; that the fountain
and cause of lamentation is pointed out; for ingratitude will constrain the Jews
to lament, inasmuch as they will acknowledge that in their perverse obstinacy
they had carried on war with God and his only-begotten Son. He does not then
understand that the death of Christ would be bitter to them, as we are wont to
shed tears and to lament at the death of a friend, or of a brother or of a son;
but because they would know and feel that they had been extremely blind,and by
their sins provoked God</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Jerome</i> thought that Christ is called the
only-begotten with regard to his Divine nature, and the first-born, because he
is the elder brother of all the godly, and the Head of the Church. The sentiment
is indeed true, but I know not whether it be the sentiment of the Prophet in
this passage. I therefore prefer to take this simple view of what is here said,
&#8212; that the Jews, after having despised Christ, would at length acknowledge
him to be a precious and invaluable treasure, the contempt of whom deserved the
vengeance of God. Let us proceed -</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet says nearly the same thing to the end of
the chapter; but as the event was worthy of being commemorated, he embellishes
it with many figurative terms. He then says, that the <i>lamentation</i> for the
death of Christ would be like that after the death of Josiah; for they who would
have Hadadrimmon to be a man&#8217;s name, have no reason for what they hold,
and indulge themselves in mere conjecture. It is indeed agreed almost by all
that Hadadrimmon was either a town connected with the plain of Megiddon, or a
country near Jezreel. But as to what it was, it is a matter of no great
consequence. I indeed believe that Hadadrimmon was a neighboring town, or a part
of that country in which was situated the plain of Megiddon. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm159</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may now observe, that this comparison which the
Prophet institutes is very apposite; for when Josiah was slain by the King of
Egypt, it is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;140503&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 5:30, that an yearly lamentation was appointed. The Jews then were
wont every year to lament the death of Josiah; for from that time it was evident
that God was so displeased with the people, that they had no longer any hope of
deliverance; nay, Jeremiah in his mournful song had special reference to Josiah,
as it appears from sacred history. And, among other things, he says, that Christ
our Lord, in whose life lived our life, was slain for our sins. Jeremiah then
acknowledges that it was a special proof of God&#8217;s vengeance, that that
pious king was taken away, and that the Jews were thus as it were forsaken, and
became afterwards like a dead body, inasmuch as they only breathed in the life
of Josiah: and at the same time he reminds us, that the kingdom, which God had
intended to be the type and image of the kingdom of Christ, had as it were
ceased to exist; for the successor of Josiah was deprived of all royal honor,
and at length not only the whole dignity, but also the safety of the people,
were trampled under foot. Hence, most fitly does the Prophet apply this
lamentation to the death of Christ; as though he had said, &#8212; That the Jews
lamented yearly the death of Josiah, because it was an evidence of the dreadful
vengeance of God that they were deprived of that pious ruler; and that now there
would be a similar lamentation, when they perceived that their light of
salvation was extinguished, because they had crucified the Son of God, unless
they humbly acknowledged their great wickedness, and obtained
pardon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see the true meaning of the Prophet, when
he says, that the lamentation in Jerusalem would be like that in
Megiddon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Were any to object and say, that the death of Christ
was not accompanied with tears and mourning; I answer, &#8212; that the
penitence of believers only is here described; for we know that a few only of
the whole people were converted to God: but it is not to be wondered that the
Prophet speaks generally of the whole nation, though he referred only to the
elect of God and a small remnant; for God regarded those few who repented as the
whole race of Abraham. Some mention the women of whom Luke speaks; but this
seems too confined and strained: and we find also that that lamentation was
forbidden by Christ,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Weep,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;for yourselves and for your
children,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">not for me.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;422328&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Luke
23:28.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since then Christ shows that that weeping was vain
and useless, we may surely say that what is here said by Zechariah was not then
fulfilled. And we must bear in mind what I have said before, &#8212; that by
lamentation and sorrow is described that repentance with which the Jews were
favored, not indeed all, but such as had been ordained to salvation by the
gratuitous adoption of God. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Zechariah seems to have used more words than
necessary to complete his subject; for he appears to be diffuse on a plain
matter: but we ought to attend to its vast importance; for it seemed incredible,
that any of that nation would repent, since they had almost all been given up to
a reprobate mind. For who could have thought that there was any place for the
favor of God, inasmuch as all, as far as they could, even from the least to the
greatest, attempted to involve Christ in darkness? When therefore the Sun of
Righteousness was as it were extinguished by the Jews, it seemed probable that
they were a nation repudiated by God. But the Prophet here shows, that God would
be mindful of his covenant, so that he would turn to himself some of all the
families.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lament</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall the
land</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This indeed we know did not take place as
to the body of the people, but God, to whom a small flock is precious,
denominates here as the whole land the faithful, who had felt how grievously
they had sinned, and were so pricked in their hearts as though they had pierced
the Son of God.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440237&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
2:37.) And though the Jews had destroyed themselves, yet through special and
wonderful favor, three thousand were converted at one sermon by Peter; and then
many in Greece, Asia Minor, and in the East, repented, and many Churches arose
everywhere, as though God had created a new people. If these things be rightly
viewed by us, we shall not think it unreasonable that Zechariah promises
repentance to the whole land.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What he said before of Jerusalem ought not to be so
taken as though he confined what he said to one city, but under this name he
includes the whole nation, dispersed through distant parts of the
world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says now, that this lamentations would be in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>every family
apart</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By which word he means, that it would
not be a feigned or pretended ceremony, as when one begins to weep and draws
tears from the eyes of others. The Prophet then testifies that it would be real
sorrow, for one would not imitate another, but every one, impelled by his own
feeling, would really grieve and lament. This then is the reason why he says
that families would lament apart. Indeed the faithful ought to stimulate others
by their example and encourage them to repent, but in a congregation hardly one
in ten prays in earnest for pardon and really laments on account of his sins.
Since therefore men are thus born to hypocrisy, and are confirmed in it by the
whole practice of their the, it is no wonder that the Prophet, in order to set
forth real sorrow, represents here every family by itself; as though he had
said, &#8220;The family of David shall know that it had sinned, and the family
of Levi, though it may not observe such an example, shall yet inwardly
acknowledge its guilt.&#8221; We now see why Zechariah repeats the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>apart</i></font><font face="Palatino">
so often.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>women</i></font><font face="Palatino">
wept
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>apart</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he means no doubt the same thing with what we find in the second chapter of Joel
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;290201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joel
2:1)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Go forth let the
bridegroom from his chamber,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and
the bride from her recess.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Men in grief, we know, withdraw from all pleasures
and all joy. As then men usually separate themselves from their wives during the
appointed time of public grief or mourning, the Prophet makes the women to be by
themselves: he intimates at the same time that the women would not wait until
the men showed then an example of mourning, but that they would of themselves,
and through a feeling of their own, be inclined to lament.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must bear in mind what I lately said, &#8212;
that the grief which the Jews felt for the death of Christ is not what is
described, but rather that by which they were touched when God opened their eyes
to repent for their own perverseness; for the death of Christ, we allow, is a
cause of joy to us rather than of sorrow, but the joy arising from
Christ&#8217;s death cannot shine in us until our guilt really wounds us through
God&#8217;s appearing to us as a threatening judge. From this sorrow there
arises the desire to repent and the true fear of God. Hence it is, that God
himself will give us joy, for he will not have us, as Paul says, to be swallowed
up with sorrow; he lays us prostrate, that he may again raise us
up.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, why he names the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>house of
Levi</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>house of
Shimei</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or of Simeon, and the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>house of
David</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the house of
Nathan</i></font><font face="Palatino">, rather than the other tribes, is
uncertain: yet it seems to me probable that by the family of David he means the
whole tribe of Judah, and the same by the family of Nathan. As to the tribe of
Levi it excelled in honor on account of the priesthood, but no honor belonged to
Simeon. Why then are Issachar and Reuben the first-born, and the other tribes
omitted here? It might indeed have been, that there were then remaining more
from the tribes of Simeon and Levi than from the tribe of Zebulon or of Issachar
or of Reuben; but this is uncertain, and I am not disposed to make much of mere
conjectures. But I am inclined to think that the family of David and the tribe
of Levi are here mentioned not for the sake of honor but of reproach, because
the royal family and the priests were those who crucified Christ, and pierced
God in the person of his only-begotten Son. <i>Jerome</i> conjectures, that the
family of Nathan is named, because he was a celebrated Prophet and eminent above
others, and that the Prophets are designated by him. He says that many teachers
arose from the tribe of Simeon; but I know not where he got his information, for
he adduces no proofs. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm160</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But I am satisfied with the simple view already
given, &#8212; that the Prophet by mentioning certain families meant to include
the whole people, and that he does not omit the royal family nor the priests,
because they were especially those who crucified Christ: and we know that Christ
descended from Nathan, though Jerome thought the Prophet to be intended here
rather than Nathan, one of Christ&#8217;s progenitors: but these things are of
small moment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says in the last place, that this lamentation
would be common to all the remaining families. Though few had returned, except
those from the tribe of Judah and Benjamin, and from the tribe of Levi, yet
Zechariah, as I think, means here by the remaining families, the elect who had
been miraculously delivered from the common ruin; for blindness had so
prevailed, that the rejection of the whole people on the part of God was
evident. Under this designation then I consider the remnants of grace, as Paul
says, to be included; as though the Prophet had said, that he had spoken of
sorrow, not with regard to the whole nation indiscriminately, but to that part
which was a remnant according to the gratuitous election of God. Now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">From this verse we again learn, that Zechariah
promised the spirit of repentance to the Jews, so that they would find God still
propitious to them, when their circumstances were brought to the verge of
despair: for it would not have been enough for them to feel sorrow, except God
himself became propitious and merciful to them. He had said indeed that the
Spirit of grace and of commiserations would be poured forth; but he had not as
yet taught clearly what he now adds respecting remission and pardon. After
having then declared that there would be felt by the Jews the bitterest sorrow,
because they had as it were pierced God, he now mentions the fruit of this
repentance. And hence also appears what Paul means by sorrow not to be repented
of; for it generates repentance unto salvation. When then our sorrow is blessed
by the Lord, the end is to be regarded; for our hearts are thereby raised up to
joy. But the issue of repentance, as Zechariah declares here, is ablution: and
he alludes to the legal rites when he says,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A fountain shall be opened to the
house of David, and to the inhabitants of
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We know that formerly under the law
many washings were prescribed to the Jews; and when any one had become defiled,
to wash himself was the remedy. It is certain that water was of no value to
cleanse the heart; but the sins of men, we know, are expiated by the death of
Christ, so that true ablution is by the blood which he shed for us. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm161</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence
the types of the law ought no doubt to be referred to this blood. The meaning is
that God would be reconciled to the Jews when they became touched with sincere
sorrow, and that reconciliation would be ready for them, for the Lord would
cleanse them from every defilement.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He speaks of a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fountain
opened</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and he no doubt intimates here a
difference between the law and the gospel. Water was brought daily to the
temple; but it was, we know, for private washings. But Zechariah promises here a
perpetual stream of cleansing water; as though he had said, &#8220;Ablution will
be free to all, when God shall again receive his people into favor.&#8221;
Though remission of sins was formerly offered under the law, yet it is now much
more easily obtained by us; not that God grants a license to sin, but that the
way in which our filth is cleansed, has become more evident since the coming of
Christ. For the fathers under the law were indeed fully assured that God was so
propitious as not to impute sins; but where was the pledge of ablution? In the
sprinkling of blood, and that blood was the blood of a calf or a lamb. Now since
we know that we have been redeemed by Christ, and that our souls are sprinkled
with his blood by the hidden power of the Holy Spirit, it is doubtless the same
as though God had not only set before our eyes our ablution, but also placed it
as it were in our hands, while to the fathers it was more obscure or shown to
them at a distance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the house of David and to the
inhabitants of Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He had before
restricted God&#8217;s favor to that city, that he might goad the Jews, who had
preferred their outward gratifications to so great a happiness; for they thought
themselves happy in their exile, because they inhabited a pleasant and fruitful
country, and enjoyed quietness and peace; and thus it happened that they
despised the deliverance offered to them. Hence the Prophet promises here to the
citizens of Jerusalem and to the royal family a fountain in which they might
wash away their filth; for from Sion was the law to go forth, and from Jerusalem
the word of the Lord.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
2:2.) And we know that from thence were taken the first-fruits of the new
Church. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm162</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> What
we have before seen respecting God&#8217;s favor being extended farther, is no
objection; for both events were in their due order fulfilled, as God blessed the
tribe of Judah, who trusted in his promises and returned to their own country,
and afterwards extended wider his favor, and gathered into one body those who
had been dispersed through distant parts of the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For sin and for
uncleanness</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or as some read, &#8220;for
sprinkling,&#8221; which is by no means suitable, except the word
&#8220;sin&#8221; be taken for expiation. The word is derived from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ddn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nedad</i>, but it often means sprinkling, sometimes uncleanness, and
sometimes the uncleanness of women, and so some render it here. The verb
signifies to remove or to separate; and hence
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hdn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nede</i>, is the removal of a woman from her husband during her uncleanness,
but it is applied to designate any uncleanness. It might indeed be taken here
for the uncleanness of women, as an instance of a part for the whole; but I am
led by the context to render it uncleanness. Now if we translate
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tafj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chathat</i>, sin, then
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hdn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nede</i>, must be rendered uncleanness; but if the first be expiation, then
the second may be sprinkling: and this meaning I am disposed to take, for under
the law sins were cleansed by sacrifices as well as by washings. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm163</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The import of the whole then is &#8212; that though
the Jews had in various ways defiled themselves, so that they were become filthy
before God, and their uncleanness was abominable, yet a fountain would be
prepared for them, by which they might cleanse themselves, so as to come before
God pure and clean. We hence see that it was the Prophet&#8217;s object to show,
that the repentance of which he had spoken would not be useless, for there would
be a sure issue, when God favored the Jews, and showed himself propitious to
them, and already pacified, and even provided for them a cleansing by the blood
of his only-begotten Son, so that no filth might prevent them to call on him
boldly and in confidence; for instead of the legal rites there would be the
reality, as their hearts would be sprinkled by the Spirit, so that they would be
purified by faith, and would thus cast away all their filth.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">HERE the Prophet mentions another effect, which would
follow the repentance of the people, and which the Lord also would thereby
produce. There was to be a cleansing from all the defilements of superstitions;
for the pure and lawful worship of God cannot be set up without these filthy
things being wiped away; inasmuch as to blend sacred with profane things, is the
same thing as though one sought to take away the difference between heaven and
earth. No religion then can be approved by God, except what is pure and free
from all such pollution. We hence see why the Prophet adds, that there would be
an end to falsehoods and all errors, and to the delusions of Satan, when God
restored his Church; for the simplicity of true doctrine would prevail, and thus
abolished would be whatever Satan had previously invented to corrupt
religion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence learn what I have just stated &#8212; that
God cannot be rightly worshipped, except all corruptions, inconsistent with his
sincere and pure worship, be taken away. But we must at the same time observe,
that this effect is ascribed to God&#8217;s word; for it is that which can drive
away and banish all the abominations of falsehood, and whatever is uncongenial
to true religion. As then by the rising of the sun darkness is put to flight,
and all things appear distinctly to the view, so also when God comes forth with
the teaching of his word, all the deceptions of Satan must necessarily be
dissipated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now these two things ought especially to be known;
for we see that many, who are not indeed ungodly, but foolish and inconsiderate,
think that they give to God his due honor, while they are entangled in many
errors, and refrain not from superstitions. Others, more politic, devise this
way of peace &#8212; that they who think rightly are to concede something to
tyrants and false Prophets; and thus they seek to form at this day a new
religion for us, made up of Popery and of the simple doctrine of the gospel, and
in this manner as it were to transform God. As then we see that men are so
disposed to mix all sorts of things together, that the pure simplicity of the
gospel may be contaminated by various inventions, we ought to bear in mind this
truth, &#8212; that the Church cannot be rightly formed, until all superstitions
be rejected and banished. This is one thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may also deduce hence another principle &#8212;
that the word of God not only shows the way to us, but also discovers all the
delusions of Satan; for hardly one in a hundred follows what is right, except he
is reminded of what he ought to avoid. It is then not enough to declare that
there is but one true God, and that we ought to put our trust in Christ, except
another thing be added, that is, except we warn men of those intrigues by which
Satan has from the beginning deceived miserable mortals: even at this day with
what various artifices has he withdrawn the simple and unwary from the true God,
and entangled them in a labyrinth of superstitions. Except therefore men be thus
warned, the word of God is made known to them only in part. Whosoever then
desires to perform all the duties of a good and faithful pastor, ought firmly to
resolve, not only to abstain from all impure doctrines, and simply to assert
what is true, but also to detect all corruptions which are injurious to
religion, to recover men from the deceptions of Satan, and in short, avowedly to
carry on war with all superstitions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This was what Zechariah had in view when he said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that
day</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, when God would restore his
Church, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>perish shall the names of
idols,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm164</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
so that they shall be remembered no more</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By
this last expression he sets forth more clearly what I have just stated, that
the pure worship of God is then established as it ought to be, and that religion
has then its own honor, when all errors and impostures cease, so that even the
memory of them does not remain. It is indeed true, that superstitions can never
be so abolished, so that no mention of them should be made; nay, the
recollection of them is useful &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Thou shalt
remember thy ways,&#8221; says Ezekiel, &#8220;and be ashamed,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;261606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
16:6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But by this form of speaking Zechariah means, that
such would be the detestation of superstitions, that the people would dread the
very mention of them. And hence we may learn how much purity of doctrine is
approved by God, since he would have us to feel a horror as at something
monstrous, whenever the name of an idol is mentioned.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then refers to false teachers,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will exterminate,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Prophets and the unclean
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm165</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
from the land</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The connection here is worthy of
being noticed; for it hence appears how all errors arise, even when a loose rein
is given to false teachers. It is indeed true I allow, that the seed of all
errors is implanted in each of us, so that every one is a teacher to deceive
himself; for we are not only disposed to what is false, but rush headlong into
it: it is the corruption of our nature. But at the same time when liberty is
taken to teach anything that may please men, the whole of religion must
necessarily be corrupted, and all things become mixed together, so that there is
no difference between light and darkness. God then here reminds us, that the
Church cannot stand, except false teachers be prevented from turning truth into
falsehood, and from pealing at their pleasure against the word of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this is what ought to be carefully observed; for
we see at this day how some unprincipled men adopt this sentiment &#8212; that
the Church is not free, except every one is allowed with impunity to promulgate
whatever he pleases, and that it is the greatest cruelty to punish a heretic;
for they would have all liberty to be given to blasphemies. But the Prophet
shows here, that the Church cannot be preserved in a pure state, and, in a word,
that it cannot exist as a healthy and sound body, except the rashness and
audacity of those who pervert sound and true doctrine be
restrained.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand the import of this verse
&#8212; that in order that God may be alone and indeed be rightly worshipped, he
will take away and banish all idols and all superstitions, and also, that he
will exterminate all ungodly teachers who pervert sound
doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls them first
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
and then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unclean
spirits</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The name of Prophets is conceded to
them, though they were wholly unworthy of so honorable a title. As ungodly men
ever boast themselves in an audacious manner and hesitate not to pretend
God&#8217;s name, that they may more boldly proceed in deceiving: hence it is,
that Scripture sometimes concedes to them a name which they falsely claim. So
also the word spirit is sometimes applied to them &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Prove the spirits,
whether they are of God: every spirit that denies that Christ has come in the
flesh, he is a
liar.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
John 4:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">John doubtless adopted this mode of speaking
according to common usage; for all false teachers claimed this title with great
confidence, and maintained that all the errors they spread abroad were revealed
to them by the Spirit.&#8221; Be it so then, but ye are lying
spirits.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now then as to this title, there is no obscurity in
what the Prophet means: and by way of explanation he adds the unclean spirit,
that he might distinguish those vile men from the faithful ministers of God; as
though he had said, &#8220;They indeed declare that they have drawn down the
Spirit from heaven; but it is the spirit of the devil, it is an unclean
spirit.&#8221; Now as Zechariah declares, that this would be in the Church of
God, we learn how foolish the Papists are, who are content with the mere title
of honor, and claim to themselves the greatest power, and will have themselves
heard without dispute, as though they were the organs of the Spirit. What right
indeed do they pretend? that they have been called by the Lord. The same reason
might have been assigned by these unprincipled men, whom it was necessary to
drive away, in order that the Church might rise again. It then follows that we
are not to consider only what name a person has, or with what title he is
distinguished, but how rightly he conducts himself, and how faithfully he
performs his duties and discharges the office of a pastor. Let us proceed

</table></div>
<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The same concession is made in this verse, where
Zechariah speaks of the office of prophesying: he indeed confines what he says
altogether to false teachers, for he takes it as granted that there was then no
attention given to God&#8217;s servants, inasmuch as false spirits had conspired
together, so that nothing pure or sound remained in the Church. As then a false
and diabolical faction had then prevailed, Zechariah calls them Prophets as
though they were all such, for they were heard as the Lord&#8217;s servants
during that disorder of which mention is made. But he proceeds farther in this
verse than before, and says, that there would be so much zeal in God&#8217;s
children when renewed by his Spirit, that they would not spare even their own
children, but slay them with their own hands, when they saw them perverting the
truth of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Zechariah no doubt alludes to the 13th chapter of
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
13:1 where God requires such a rigorous severity in defending pure doctrine,
that a father was to rise up against the son whom he had begotten, that a
husband was to lead his wife to death rather than to indulge his love and to
pardon impiety, in case the wife solicited him or others to forsake God. The
Lord then would have all the godly to burn with so much zeal in the defense of
lawful worship and true religion, that no connection, no relationship, nor any
other consideration, connected with the flesh, should avail to prevent them from
bringing to punishment their neighbors, when they see that God&#8217;s worship
is profaned, and that sound doctrine is corrupted. This was the rule prescribed
by the law. Now after religion had been for a time neglected, and even trodden
almost under foot, Zechariah says, that the faithful, when they shall have
repented, would be endued with so much zeal for true religion, as that neither
father nor mother would tolerate an ungodly error in their own son, but would
lead him to punishment; for they would prefer the glory of God to flesh and
blood, they would prefer to all earthly attachments that worship which ought to
be more precious to us than life itself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it must at the same time be observed, that this
zeal under the reign of Christ is approved by God; for Zechariah does not here
confine what he teaches to the time of the law, but shows what would take place
when Christ came, even that this zeal, which had become nearly extinct, would
again burn in the hearts of all the godly. It then follows, that this law was
not only given to the Jews, as some fanatics verily imagine, who would have for
themselves at this day a liberty to disturb the whole world, but the same law
also belongs to us: for if at this day thieves and robbers and sorcerers are
justly punished, doubtless those who as far as they can destroy souls, who by
their poison corrupt pure doctrine, which is spiritual food, who take away from
God his own honor, who confound the whole order of the Church, doubtless such
men ought not to escape unpunished. It would be indeed better to grant license
to thieves and sorcerers and adulterers, than to suffer the blasphemies which
the ungodly utter against God, to prevail without any punishment and without any
restraint. And this is evident enough from the words of our
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And little consideration do they also show, who
immediately fret from a regard to their own relatives. When faithful ministers
and pastors are constrained to warn their people to beware of the artifices of
Satan, they seek to bury every recollection of this, because it is invidious,
because it leads to reproach. What if their children were to be drawn forth to
punishment? How could they bear this, though they might remain at home; for they
cannot attend to a free warning from their own pastor, when they find that
impious errors are reproved, which we see prevailing, I say not in our
neighborhood only, but also in our own bosom and in the Church. Let them then
acknowledge their own folly, that they may learn to put on new courage, so that
they may make more account of the glory of God, and of the pure doctrine of
religion, than of their own carnal attachments, by which they are too fast held.
And this is also the reason why the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who have begotten
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and he repeats it twice: nor was it in
vain that God had those words expressly added,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The husband shall not suffer the
wife who sleeps in his bosom to go unpunished; nor shall the father pardon his
son whom he has begotten, nor the mother her own offspring, whom she has
nourished, whom she has carried in her
womb.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
13:6, 9.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">All these things are said, that we may learn to
forget whatever belongs to the world and to the flesh, when God&#8217;s glory
and purity of doctrine are to be vindicated by us. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm166</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Prophet shows clearly that all this is to be
understood of false teachers, for he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For falsehood hast thou spoken in
the name of Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And at the same time the
atrocity of their sin is here pointed out; for if we rightly consider what it is
to speak falsehood in the name of Jehovah, it will certainly appear to us to be
more detestable than either to kill an innocent man, or to destroy a guest with
poison, or to lay violent hands on one&#8217;s own father, or to plunder a
stranger. Whatever crimes then can be thought of, they do not come up to this,
that is, when God himself is involved in such a dishonor, as to be made an
abettor of falsehood. What indeed can more peculiarly belong to God than his own
truth? and it is his will also to be worshipped by us according to this
distinction: God is truth. Now to corrupt pure doctrine &#8212; is it not the
same thing, as though one substituted the devil in the place of God? or sought
to transform God, so that there should be no difference between him and the
devil? Hence the greatest of all crimes, as I have already said, does not come
up to this horrible and monstrous wickedness. For how much does the salvations
of souls exceed all the riches of the world? and then, how much more excellent
is the worship of God than the fame and honors of mortals? Besides, does not
religion itself, the pledge of eternal life, swallow up in a manner every thing
that is sought in the world? But most sacred to us ought to be the name of God,
the sanctifying of which we daily pray for. When therefore what is false is
brought forward in the name of God, is not he, according to what I have already
said, as it were violently forced to undertake the office of the devil, to
renounce himself, and to deny that he is God?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see the design of the Prophet, when he shows
that there is no place for pardon, when the ungodly thus wantonly rise up to
pervert pure doctrine, and so to confound all things as wholly to destroy true
religion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pierce him shall his father and
his mother who have begotten him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is much
harder to kill their son by their own hands than to bring him to the Judge, and
to leave him to his fate. But the Prophet has taken this from the law &#8212;
that so much zeal is required from the faithful, that, if it be necessary, they
are to exterminate from the world such pests as deprive God of his own honor,
and attempt to extinguish the light of true and genuine religion. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">Zechariah proceeds with the same subject, but in
other words and in another mode of speaking, and says, that so great would be
the light of knowledge, that those who had previously passed themselves as the
luminaries of the Church would be constrained to be ashamed of themselves. And
he farther shows how it was that so great and so gross errors had arisen, when
the whole of religion had been trodden under foot, and that was because Satan
had veiled the eyes and minds of all, so that they could not distinguish between
black and white.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And such ignorance has been the source of all errors
under the Papacy. How great has been the stupidity of that people, as they have
indiscriminately admitted whatever their ungodly teachers have dared to obtrude
on them? And in their bishops themselves, and in the whole band of their filthy
clergy, how great a sottishness has prevailed, so that they differ nothing from
asses? For artisans, and even cowherds, surpass many of the priests and many of
the bishops, at least in common prudence. While then there was such ignorance in
these asses, there could not have been any difference made between truth and
falsehood. And then when they put on fine rings, and adorn themselves with a
forked metre and its ornaments, and also display their crook, and appear in all
their pontifical splendor, the eyes of the simple are so dazzled, that all think
them to be some new gods come down from heaven. Hence these prelates were beyond
measure proud, until God stripped off their mask: and now their ignorance is
well known, and no one among the common people is now deceived.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">How then is it, that many are still immersed in their
own errors? Because they wish to be so; they close their own eyes against clear
light. The kings themselves, and such as exercise authority in the world, desire
to be in their filth, and are indifferent as to any kind of abomination; for
they fear lest in case of any innovation the common people should take occasion
to raise tumults. As they themselves wish to remain quiet, hence it is that they
defend with a diabolical pertinacity those superstitions which are abundantly
proved to be so. And the people themselves neither care for God nor for their
own salvation. Hence then it is, that almost all, from the least to the
greatest, regard these asses, who are called prelates, as the most ignorant, and
yet they submit to their tyranny. However this may be, the Lord has yet
discovered the shame of those who had been a little while ago almost
adored.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is what Zechariah now declares,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ashamed</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall all the Prophets
be in that day, every one for his own vision, when they shall have
prophesied</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And the concession, of which we
have spoken, is not without reason; for when the brawling monks about thirty
years ago ascended their pulpits, or the prelates, who theatrically acted their
holy rites, there was nothing, but what was divine and from heaven. Hence with
great impudence they boasted themselves to be God&#8217;s messengers, his
ministers, vicars, and pastors; though the name of pastors was almost mean in
their esteem; but they were Christ&#8217;s vicars, they were his messengers, in
short, there was nothing which they dared not to claim for themselves. The
Prophet ridicules this sort of pride, and seems to say, &#8220;Well, let all
their trumperies be prophecies; and all their babblings, let these be for a time
counted oracles: but when they shall thus prophesy, the Lord will at length
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>make them ashamed, every one for
his vision</i></font><font face="Palatino">.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall not wear a hairy
garment that they may lie</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, they shall
not be solicitous of retaining their honor and fame, but will readily withdraw
from courting that renown which they had falsely attained. It appears from this
place that Prophets wore sordid and hairy garments. Yet interpreters do not
appropriately quote those passages from the Prophets where they are bidden to
put on sackcloth and ashes; for Isaiah, while announcing many of his prophecies,
did not put on sackcloth and ashes, except when he brought some sad message. The
same also may be said of Jeremiah, when he was bidden to go naked. But it was a
common thing with the Prophets to be content with a hairy, that is, with a
sordid and mean garment. For though there is liberty allowed in external things,
yet some moderation ought to be observed; for were I to teach in a military
dress, it would be deemed inconsistent with common sense. There is no need of
being taught as to what common decency may requite. The true Prophets accustomed
themselves to hairy garments in order to show that they were sparing and frugal
in their clothing as well as in their diet: but they attached no sanctity to
this practice, as though they acquired some eminence by their dress, like the
monks at this day, who deem themselves holy on account of their hoods and other
trumperies. This was not then the object of the Prophets; but only that by their
dress they might show that they had nothing else in view but to serve God, and
so to separate themselves from the world, that they might wholly devote
themselves to their ministry. Now the false Prophets imitated them; hence
Zechariah says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall no
more wear a hairy garment</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, they shall
no more assume a prophetic habit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">His purpose was, not to condemn the false Prophets
for wearing that sort of garment, as some have supposed, who have laid hold of
this passage for the purpose of condemning long garments and whatever displeased
their morose temper; but the Prophet simply means, that when purity of doctrine
shall shine forth, and true religion shall attain its own honor, there will be
then no place given to false teachers; for they will of themselves surrender
their office, and no longer try to deceive the unwary. This is the real meaning
of the Prophet: hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they may
lie</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We then see that hairy garments are
condemned on account of a certain end &#8212; even that rapacious wolves might
be concealed under the skin of sheep, that foxes might introduce themselves
under an appearance not their own. This design, and not the clothing itself, is
what is condemned by Zechariah. He afterwards adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He describes repentance in this verse more fully.
When Paul wished to exhort the faithful to newness of life, he
said,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Let him who has stolen, steal no
more; but rather work with his own hands, that he may relieve the wants of
others.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490418&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ephesians
4:18.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul notices two parts of repentance, &#8212; that
thieves are to refrain from acts of dishonesty and wrong, &#8212; and that they
ought to labor in order to aid others and relieve their wants. So also Zechariah
mentions these two particulars, &#8212; that false prophets will give up their
office, &#8212; and that they will then spend their labor in doing what is right
and just, supporting themselves in a lawful and innocent manner, and affording
aid to their brethren.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Having spoken already of the former part, he repeats
the same thing again, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am not a
prophet</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is then the first thing in
repentance, when they who had been previously the servants of Satan in the work
of deception, cease to deal in falsehoods, and thus put an end to their errors.
Now follows the progress, &#8212; that they who lived before in idleness and in
pleasures under the pretext of sanctity, willingly devote themselves to labor,
and continue no longer idle and gluttonous as before, but seek to support
themselves by just and lawful employment. It would not then have been enough for
him to say, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am no
prophet</i></font><font face="Palatino">, had he not added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am an
husbandman</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, I am prepared to labor,
that I may support myself and aid my brethren.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A half reformation might probably succeed with many
at this day. Were many monks sure that a rich mess would continue to them in
their cloisters, and were also the milted bishops and abbots made certain that
nothing of their gain and profit would be lost to them, they would easily grant
a free course to the gospel. But the second part of reformation is very hard,
which requires toil and labor: in this case the stomach has no ears, according
to the old proverb. And yet we see what the Prophet says, &#8212; that those are
they who truly and from the heart repent, who not only abstain from impostures,
but who are also ready to get their own living, acknowledging that they had
before defrauded the poor, and procured their support by rapine and
fraud.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet no doubt speaks of impostors, who were
then numerous among the Jews; and there were also women who boasted that they
were favored with a prophetic spirit; and the true prophets of God had to
contend with these sorceresses or wise women, who had ever intruded themselves
during a confused state of things, and undertook the office of teaching. As then
there were at that time many idlers who lived on superstition, rightly does the
Prophet send them away to cultivate the land. So at this day there are many
brotherlings who hide their ignorance under their hood, and even all the papal
clergy, under the sacred vestment, as they call it; and were they unmasked, it
might easily be found out, that they are the most ignorant asses. Now, as the
Lord has abundantly discovered their baseness, were they to acknowledge that
they have been impostors, what would remain for them, but willingly to do what
they are here taught? that is, to become husband men instead of being
prophets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the end of the verse, some retain the word
Adam; others render it man; and generally the word Adam means man in Scripture.
But they who think that Zechariah speaks of the first man, adduce this reason,
&#8212; that as this necessity of &#8220;eating his bread by the sweat of his
face&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
3:9) was imposed on all mankind after the fall, so also all his posterity were
thus taught by Adam their first parent; but this interpretation seems too
far-fetched. I therefore take the word indefinitely; as though he had said,
&#8220;I have not been taught by any master, so as to become capable to
undertake the prophetic office; but I am acquainted only with agriculture, and
have made such progress, that I can feed sheep and oxen; I am indeed by no means
fit to take upon me the office of a teacher.&#8221; I take the passage simply in
this sense.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ynnqh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ekenni</i>,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kene</i>, means to possess, to acquire; but as the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnqm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mekene</i>, which signifies a flock of sheep or cattle, is derived from this
verb, the most learned interpreters are inclined to give this meaning,
&#8220;Man has taught me to possess sheep and oxen.&#8221; I am however disposed
to give this rendering, as I have already stated, &#8220;Man has taught me to be
a shepherd.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm167</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The import of the whole is, &#8212; that when God
shall discover the ignorance, which would so prevail in the Church, as that the
darkness of errors would extinguish as it were all the light of true religion,
then they who repent shall become so humble, as to be by no means ashamed to
confess their ignorance and to testify that they had been impostors as long as
they had under a false pretense assumed the office of prophets. The Spirit of
God then requires here this humility from all who had been for a time immersed
in the dregs of falsehood, that when they find that they are not fit to teach,
they should say, &#8220;I have not been in school, I was wholly ignorant, and
yet I wished to be accounted a most learned teacher; at that time the stupidity
of the people veiled my disgrace: but now the light of truth has shone upon us,
which has constrained me to feel ashamed; and therefore I confess that I am not
worthy to be heard in the assembly, and I am prepared to employ my hands in
labor and toil, that I may gain my living, rather than to deceive men any
longer, as I have hitherto done.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast
been pleased to draw us at this day, by the light of thy gospel, out of that
horrible darkness in which we have been miserably immersed, and to render thy
face so conspicuous to us in the person of thy only-begotten Son, that nothing
but our ingratitude prevents us from being transformed into thy celestial glory,
&#8212; O grant, that we may make such advances in the light of truth, that
every one of us may be ashamed of his former ignorance, and that we may freely
and ingenuously confess that we were lost sheep, until we were by thy hand
brought back into the way of salvation; and may we thus proceed in the course of
our holy vocation, until we shall at length be all gathered into heaven, where
not only that truth shall give us light, which now rules us according to the
capacity of our flesh, but where also shall shine on us the splendor of thy
glory, and shall render us conformable to thine image, through Jesus Christ our
Lord. &#8212; Amen.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">HERE the Prophet, in order to finish what we
explained yesterday, says that such would be the discipline among the new people
after having repented, that each in his own house would chastise his sons and
relatives: and it is an evidence of perfect zeal, when not only judges perform
their office in correcting wickedness, but when also private individuals assist
to preserve public order, each according to his power. It is indeed true that
the use of the sword is not allowed us, so that the offender may be punished by
his neighbor: but as it was always allowed by the law of God, that when the
matter did not come before a public tribunal, friends might inflict punishment,
Zechariah, alluding to this custom, says, that though they who unjustly claimed
the prophetic office and spread abroad false and impious errors, should not be
visited with capital punishment, yet such would be their zeal for true religion,
that friends would privately chastise such as they found to be of this
character.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If any one objects and says, that these two things
are inconsistent, &#8212; that false Prophets were punished with death, and that
they were only chastised with stripes or scourges. To this I answer, that
Zechariah does not speak precisely of the kind and mode of punishment, but says
generally, that false teachers, even in the estimation of their parents, were
worthy of death; and that if they were treated more gently they should yet
suffer such a punishment, that they would through life be mutilated and ever
bear scars as proofs of their shame.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may at the same time gather from the answer what
proves true repentance, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Say will
</i></font><font face="Palatino">one, (it is put indefinitely,) or it will be
said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What mean these wounds in
thine hands? Then he will say, I have been stricken by my
friends</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet shows that those who had
previously deceived the people would become new men, so as patiently to bear
correction; though it might seem hard when the hands are wounded and pierced,
yet he says that the punishment, which was in itself severe, would bee counted
mild, for they would be endued with such meekness as willingly to bear to be
corrected. Some apply this to Christ, because Zechariah has mentioned wounds on
the hands; but this is very puerile; for it is quite evident that he speaks here
of false teachers, who had for a time falsely pretended God&#8217;s name. As
then they say, that they were friends by whom they were smitten, they
acknowledge themselves worthy of such punishment, and they murmur not, nor set
up any complaint.

<div><font face="Palatino">It was pleasant and delightful to hear what the
Prophet said at the beginning of the chapter, for he promised that a fountain
would be opened, by which the Jews might cleanse away all their filth, and that
God, having been reconciled, would be bountiful to them. As then he had promised
so blessed and happy a state, what he had said before might have been so taken,
even by the true and faithful servants of God, as though the condition of the
Church were to be after that time free from every trouble and inconvenience;
hence Zechariah anticipates such a conclusion, and shows that the happy state
which he had promised was not to be so looked for, as it though the faithful
were to be free from every affliction, for God would in the meantime severely
try his Church. Though then God had promised to be bountiful to his Church, he
yet shows that many troubles would be mixed up with its prosperity in order that
the faithful might prepare themselves to endure all things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This discourse may indeed appear abrupt, but its
different parts harmonise well together, for God so regulates his benefits which
he bestows on his Church in this world, as ever to try it in various ways. What
is here said was especially necessary, since very grievous afflictions were nigh
at hand: for, as it is evident from history, that nation was on the borders of
despair when the coming of Christ approached. This then is the reason why the
Prophet seems at the first view to join together things so contrary. For what he
has hitherto promised tended to prepare the faithful to bear all things
patiently, inasmuch as deliverance was nigh. But in the meantime it was needful
that they should be expressly encouraged to persevere, lest they should succumb
under the extreme evils which were not far distant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum of the whole is, that before the Lord would
cleanse his Church and bring it back to perfect order, very grievous calamities
were to intervene, for a dreadful disorder there must be when God smites the
very shepherds; and the apostrophe, when God addresses the sword, a thing void
of reason, is very emphatical. It is much more striking than if he had said,
&#8220;A sword shall be raised against my shepherds and against my ministers, so
that the flock shall be dispersed.&#8221; But the metaphor, as I said, is much
more expressive, when God directs his words to the sword itself;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Awake</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
watch, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O
sword</i></font><font face="Palatino">, &#8212; how?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>against my
shepherd</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Most of our interpreters confine this passage to the
person of Christ, because in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402631&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
26:31, this sentence is quoted,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Smite the
shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered:&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">but this is no solid reason; for what is said of a
single shepherd ought probably to be extended to the whole order. When God says

it known that I am near you.&#8221; This passage is quoted as referring to
Christ, and very suitably, because all the Prophets spoke by his Spirit, and at

<div><font face="Palatino">As then Christ possesses a supremacy among the
Prophets, and hence rightly applied to him are the words of Moses; so also as he
is the head and prince of shepherds, this pre-eminence justly belongs to him.
But what is said by the Prophet is however to be viewed as a general truth. In
short, God threatens the people, and declares that there would be a dreadful
disorder; for they would be deprived of their shepherds, so that there would be
no government among them, or one in great confusion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tym[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>omit</i>, is rendered by some, kindred, (<i>contribulis</i> &#8212; one of
the same tribe,) by others, kinsman, (<i>consanguineus</i> &#8212; one of the
same blood,) and by others, one connected, (<i>co-haerens</i>,) that is, with
God; and they have considered that this passage cannot be understood of any but
of Christ alone: but they have taken up, as I have said, a false principle. The
Greek version has citizen
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">to<sup>&lt;n
poli&gt;</sup>thn</font><font face="Palatino">,) and some render it, as
Theodotion, kindred (sumfulon &#8212; one of the same tribe.) Jerome prefers the
rendering, one connected or united with me (<i>cohaerentem mihi</i>.) 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm169</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
word, according to the Hebrews, means an associate, a neighbor, or a friend, or
one in any way connected with us. God, I have no doubt, distinguished pastors
with this title, because he gave a representation at himself by then to the
people; and the more eminent any one is, the nearer, we know, he is to God: and
hence kings and judges, and such as exercise authority, are called his sons. So
also pastors are called his associates, for they spend their labor in building
up the Church. He is the chief Pastor, but he employs his ministers to carry on
his work. This is the reason why they are called the associates of God, that is,
on account of the connection between them, for they are co-workers with God, as
Paul also teaches us. In short, the Prophet calls pastors the associates of God
in the same sense in which Paul calls them fellow-workers.

Corinthians 3:9.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Having said that the sword was permitted, nay,
commanded, to rise against the shepherd, he immediately adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the sheep were
dispersed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We then see that in these words is
set forth a calamity that was to be feared, and which the people were not able
to escape, in order that the faithful might not be too much disheartened, as
though God would disappoint them, but that they might stand firm amidst grievous
troubles and violent commotions. Since then this disorder was nigh, Zechariah
bids the faithful to continue firm and patiently, and quietly hope, until God
showed himself again propitious to them, and those evidences of his favor
appeared of which he had before spoken. We now see what the design of the
Prophet was. But we must especially notice, that it is a sure presage of the
people&#8217;s ruin and destruction when pastors are taken from them; for when
God intends to keep us safe, he employs this instrumentality, that is, he raises
up faithful teachers, who rule in his name; and he rules them by his Spirit, and
fits them for their rank and station: but when he strikes them, he not only
forsakes the people, but also shows that he is the avenger of wickedness, so
that the people themselves are destroyed. This is the import of the
Prophet&#8217;s words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this, as I have already observed, was fulfilled
in Christ; for he accommodated the passage to himself when his disciples fled
from him. Though they were but a small flock, being very few in number, yet they
were scattered and put to flight. In that case then, as in a mirror, appeared
how truly it had been said by Zechariah, that the scattering is nigh when a
pastor is smitten.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sword</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he means affliction; for though Christ was not slain by a sword, yet crucifixion
and violent death are fitly designated by the word sword.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows at the end of the verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will turn my hand to the
little ones</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some consider that the little ones
would be exposed to many evils, because the Lord would ever hold his rod in his
hand to chastise them. But the Prophet, I have no doubt, meant what is far
different, &#8212; that God would show mercy to them, when the body of the
people had been as it were torn into many parts. For all the godly might have
been wholly dejected when their shepherds were taken away, and when the people
were become like a straying flock. God then comes to their aid, and testifies
that his hand would be extended over the miserable and the poor ones, who had
been almost overwhelmed by a mass of evils.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage is also very serviceable to us in the
present state of the Church: for we see how God has lately cut off many pastors,
so that what is called the Church is become like a mutilated body. We also see
that God often deprives of good and faithful pastors those who have abused his
truth, or with impious contempt rejected it. We might then in this case be
terrified and cast off all hope of salvation, were we not to remember what
Zechariah teaches us here, even that though the Church were contemptible in the
world, and though the faithful were few in number, and all of them exposed to
calamities, yet God&#8217;s hand will be over them, so as to gather for himself
again a Church from the torn members. This is the import of the whole. It
follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He goes on with the same subject; for he reminds the
faithful, that though God had resolved to restore his Church, and though his
blessing would be evident, yet very heavy afflictions were not far distant; as
though he had said, &#8220;God will give you a serene heaven and a bland air,
that the land may bring forth its fruit; but still there is a heavy tempest
impelling, and ye shall not be exempt from storms and hail. But when God has
laid waste a part of the land, he will bless you with corn and wine, so that you
shall have sufficient support.&#8221; So also in this place he says, &#8220;God
will protect his Church, and will also be propitious to it, for he will wash
away all the filth of wickedness, and will give to you faithful pastors, when he
has removed the impostures of Satan: but in the meantime most grievous
afflictions await you, and a hard state of things, and difficult to be borne,
must be expected; for God will appear as though he intended to destroy his
people: such will be the scattering.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For this reason he says, that there will be through
the whole land the most grievous calamities:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Two
parts</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall die; the third only shall
remain</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see how all these things agree, and how the
Prophet&#8217;s words harmonise. In short, he means, that what he had before
promised respecting the future favor of God, does not belong indifferently to
all, or to the whole body of the people, but to the faithful, whom God will in a
wonderful manner deliver from ruin; for of the people God will only save the
third part, as he had already resolved to destroy the other two parts. The
intention of the Prophet is now by no means doubtful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we hence conclude, that what God daily promises
to his Church is not to be extended indiscriminately to all, for many falsely
profess his name: but he knows his own, as Paul says, and therefore exhorts them
to depart from iniquity.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;550216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 2:16.) Let us then know that promises of God&#8217;s favor do not
appertain to hypocrites: for though he has decreed to deal kindly and graciously
with his Church, he yet continues to diminish it, so that the third part only
remains safe. Whenever then we speak of God&#8217;s mercy towards his Church,
and of his aid and help, let us ever bear in mind the cleansing of which
Zechariah now speaks, that God will reserve the third part, while the greater
portion ever runs headlong into ruin. It is then enough that the third part
should be delivered from destruction. But this verse, as it has already
appeared, ought to be applied to the kingdom of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Literally we read,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the mouth of the
two</i></font><font face="Palatino">; but
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>pi</i>, is to be taken metaphorically for part or portion. A part then of the
two in it, or <i>two parts in it</i>, (the plural is joined with the singular,
as often is the case,) </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall
perish, shall be cut off</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">trk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>caret</i>, means to cut off; and then
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[wg</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>guo</i>, signifies to die or to sink. Though he understands the same things
by the two words, it is not yet an unmeaning repetition; for it might have
seemed hard and unreasonable that only a third part of God&#8217;s people should
remain. This diminution of the Church might have disturbed the minds of many,
and might have appeared incredible: hence the Prophet, in order to confirm what
in itself seemed a paradox, says, they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall
die</i></font><font face="Palatino">, they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall

<div><font face="Palatino">Zechariah proceeds further here, that when God shall
cut off two parts of the people, he will yet save the third for this end &#8212;
that it might be proved by various kinds of trials, and be made to bear many
afflictions. With regard to the two parts, the Lord did not afflict them in
order to turn them to repentance, but resolved wholly to destroy them. The third
part then is reserved for salvation; and yet it is necessary even for them to be
cleansed through many afflictions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Very useful is this doctrine; for we hence first
conclude that many, not only from the world, are led into perdition, but also
from the bosom of the Church: for when three hundred shall profess to worship
God, one hundred only, says Zechariah, will be saved. There are always among the
people many hypocrites; nay, the grains lie hid in the midst of much chaff and
refuse; it is therefore necessary to devote to ruin and eternal death a larger
number than those who shall be saved. Let us then not envy the ungodly, though
their prosperity may disturb us and cause us to grieve.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;193702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
37:2.) We think them happy; for while God spares and supports them, they deride
us and triumph over our miseries. But under this circumstance, the Holy Spirit
exhorts us to bear patiently our afflictions; for though for a time the
happiness of the ungodly may goad us, yet God himself declares that they are
fattened in order to be presently slain, when they shall have gathered much
fatness. This is one thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then it is in the second place added, that after the
greater part, both of the world and of the Church, (at least such as profess to
belong to it,) shall be destroyed, we cannot be retained in our position, except
God often chastises us. Let us then remember what Paul says, that we are
chastised by the Lord, that we may not perish with the world; and the metaphors
which the Prophet adopts here are to the same purpose; for he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will lead them through the
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He speaks here of the faithful whom God
has chosen into salvation, and whom he has reserved that they might continue
safe: yet he says, that they shall be saved through fire, that is, hard trials.
But he sets forth this still more clearly,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will prove
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as silver and
gold</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm170</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
stubble and the chaff, as John the Baptist teaches us, are indeed cast into the
fire,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
3:12,) but without any benefit; for the fire consumes the refuse and the chaff,
and whatever is corruptible. But when the gold and the silver are put in the
fire and are purified, it is done that greater purity may be produced, and also
that what is precious in these metals may become more apparent: for when the
silver is drawn out of the mine, it differs not much from what is earthy. The
same is the case with gold. But the furnace so purifies the gold and silver from
their dross, that they attain their value and excellency. Hence Zechariah says,
that when God casts his faithful people into the fire, he does this according to
his paternal purpose in order to burn out their dross, and thus they become gold
and silver who were before filthy and abominable, and in whom much dross
abounded. We see then that the elect of God, even those who may be rightly
counted his children, are here distinguished from the reprobate, however they
may profess God&#8217;s name and worship.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this passage is not inconsistent with that in
Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I have not
purified thee as silver and gold, for thou hast been wholly consumed.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234810&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
48:10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though God tries his elect by the fire of
afflictions, he yet observes moderation; for they would wholly faint were he to
purify them to the quick. It is however necessary to pass through this trial of
which the Prophet now speaks: and thus the state of the Church is here described
&#8212; that it ought to be always and continually cleansed, for we are
altogether unclean; and then, after God has washed us by his Spirit, still many
spots of uncleanness remain in us; besides, we contract other pollutions, for it
cannot be but that much contagion is derived from those vices by which we are on
every side surrounded.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will call on my name, and I
will answer him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm171</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> With
this consideration God mitigates what was in itself hard and grievous. It is
hard to see so many dreadful evils, when God treads under foot the greater part
of the world, and when his vengeance bursts forth on the Church itself, so that
his severity on every side fills us with fear. But this also is added &#8212;
that we are daily to feel the fire, as though God meant to burn us, while yet he
does not consume us. Hence the Prophet shows how these miseries are to be
sweetened to us, and how sorrow becomes not too grievous; for we are tried by
the cross and the scourges and chastisements of God in order that we may call on
his name. Hearing follows calling; and nothing can be more desirable than this.
The Prophet then proves from the happy effect, that there is no reason for the
faithful to murmur against God, or impatiently to bear their evils, because
being purified they can now really flee to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Were any to ask, whether God can by his Spirit only
draw the elect to true religion? If so, why is this fire of affliction and hard
trial necessary? The answer is, that he speaks not here of what God can do, nor
ought we to dispute on the subject, but be satisfied with what he has appointed.
It is his will then, that his own people should pass through the fire and be
tried by various afflictions, for this purpose &#8212; that they may sincerely
call on his name. We must at the same time learn that it is the true preparation
by which the Lord brings back the elect to himself, and forms in them a sincere
concern for religion, when he tries them by the cross and by various
chastisements; for prosperity is like mildew or the rust. We cannot then look to
God with clear eyes, except our eyes be cleansed. But this cleansing, as I have
said, is what God has appointed as the means by which he has resolved to render
his Church submissive. It is therefore necessary that we should be subject, from
first to last, to the scourges of God, in order that we may from the heart call
on him; for our hearts are enfeebled by prosperity, so that we cannot make the
effort to pray. But this consolation is ever to be applied to ease our sorrows,
when our flesh leads us either to perverseness or to despair; let this remedy
occur to us, that though chastisement is hard while it is felt, it ought yet to
be estimated by what it produces, as the Apostle also reminds us in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
12:11. Let us especially know that the name of God is then seriously invoked,
when we are subdued, and all ferocity, and all the indulgence of the flesh, are
corrected in us: for we are like untamed heifers, as Jeremiah says, when God
indulges us.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243118&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
31:18.) Hence the discipline of the cross is necessary, so that earnest prayer
may become vigorous in us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He shows at last how God may be invoked, for we are
taught that he will be kind and propitious to us, whenever called upon. It would
not indeed be enough for us to groan under the burden of afflictions, and to be
thus awakened to prayer, except God himself allured us and gave us hope of
favor. Hence the Prophet adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will say, My people they are; and they will say, Jehovah our God is
he</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet in short means, that unless the
promises of God shine on us, and invite us to prayer, no sincere prayer can ever
be drawn from us. How so? Because we first come to God by faith alone, and this
opens the gate to us, and all prayers not founded on faith are rejected; and
further, we know that men naturally dread the presence of God, and will do so
until he gives them a taste of his goodness and love. Hence what Zechariah says
here is especially worthy of notice, &#8212; that God&#8217;s word precedes, so
that we may follow with confidence, and be able to enter through the gate opened
to prayer, for except he first says, &#8220;ye are my people,&#8221; we cannot
claim the privilege of entering into his presence and say, &#8220;thou art our
God.&#8221; For who has bound God to us, that he should be a God to us? even he
himself; for he has bound himself to us when he promised that we shall be his
people. There is then, as I have said, no right beginning to prayer until we are
taught that God is ready to hear our prayers, as it is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;196502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
65:23, &#8220;Thou God hearest prayers, and all flesh shall come to
thee.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as thou sees
that we are full of so many sinful desires, which defile whatever purity thou
hast conferred on us by thy Spirit, &#8212; O grant, that we may daily profit
under thy scourges, and so submit ourselves to be ruled by thee, as to become
resigned and obedient, even when thou dealest with us with unusual severity; and
may we ever taste of the sweetness of thy goodness in thy greatest rigour, and
know that thou thereby providest for our safety, and leadest us towards perfect
purity, from which we are as yet far distant, so that we may be obedient to thee
in this world, and become hereafter partakers of that victory which Christ has
procured for us, and enjoy with him his triumph in thy heavenly kingdom. &#8212;

Jews having been much harassed by their neighbors; and we also know how
atrocious was the tyranny which Antiochus exercised: in short, there was a
continued series of evils from the time the city and the temple began to be
built till the coming of Christ. As then the Jews, who had preferred foreign
countries to their own, might have boasted of their lot and despised their
brethren, as though they had foolishly and thoughtlessly removed from foreign
lands, and had been too precipitate in returning, God designed to declare by the
mouth of Zechariah what evils were at hand, that the faithful might with a
courageous mind be prepared to undergo their trials, and that they might never
succumb under any evils, for the Lord had promised more to them than what they
could have attained in Chaldea and other countries. Having now explained the
meaning of the Prophet, I shall come to the words. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm173</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the day shall come to
Jehovah, and divided shall be thy spoils in the midst
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of the city. By the demonstrative particle
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
the certainty of the prophecy, as it has been elsewhere said, is intimated; for
the Prophet points out as by the finger what could not yet be comprehended by
human minds. And he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the day would come to
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that they might know that they would
suffer a just punishment when the Lord treated them in this manner; for men, we
know, indulge themselves and seek pleasures, and when God seems not to deal
kindly with them, they raise a clamor as though he were too severe. Hence the
Prophet reminds them, that so great a calamity would not come without a cause,
for God would then execute his judgment. He does not expressly describe it, but
he speaks as though he summoned them before God&#8217;s tribunal. Now when we
understand that we have to do with God, it avails us nothing to murmur. It is
then better to be silent when God is set forth as being in the midst of us, for
it is certain that he will not in chastising us exceed what is
just.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here is described a hard affliction; for
Zechariah intimates that the city would be exposed to the will of enemies, so
that they would divide at pleasure their spoils in the very midst of it. What
conquerors snatch away, they afterwards in private divide among themselves; and
we know that many cities have been plundered, when yet the conquerors have not
dared to expose to view their spoils. But the Prophet means here that there
would be no strength in the Jews to prevent their enemies from dividing the
spoils at their leisure in the midst of the city.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will gather all nations against
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He confirms what I have already
said, that God would be the author of those calamities, and thus he puts a
restraint on the Jews, that they might not expostulate with him respecting the
severity of their punishment. He then shortly intimates, that the nations would
not come by chance to attack Jerusalem; and that whatever commotions would
arise, they could not be ascribed to chance or to fortune, or to the purposes of
men, but to the decree of heaven. He then bids them to look to God, that they
might humble themselves umber his mighty hand, according to what Peter also
does.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 5:6.) He might have said in a briefer manner, &#8220;All the nations shall
conspire;&#8221; but he ascribes this to God, and says, that he will bring them,
like a prince, who collects an army, which he commands to fight under his
banner. And by naming </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he reminds them that their trials
would not be light; for such would be the union of enemies, and so large would
be their number, that Jerusalem would be brought nigh to utter ruin. But
afterwards he subjoins a consolation to moderate the grievousness of that
calamity: yet he says first -</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Taken shall be the city, plundered
shall be the houses, and the women shall be
ravished</i></font><font face="Palatino">. What usually happens to a city taken
by storm, the citizens of Jerusalem, the Prophet says, would have to endure. It
is indeed an extreme outrage, when women are ravished by enemies; and then,
poverty is often more grievous than death; and yet he says, that when deprived
of their substance they would have to witness an outrage more hard to be borne
than death itself, because their women would be subjected to such a
disgrace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that half part of the city would
depart</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He had said before that a third part
only would be saved; but he now seems to be inconsistent with himself. But as to
number we need not anxiously enquire, as I have elsewhere reminded you; for the
Prophets often mention half part and then the third, when yet they mean the same
thing. It is the same as though he had said, that the destruction would be so
great, that hardly half of them would remain alive.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows the consolation which I have mentioned,
&#8212; that the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>residue of the
people would not be exterminated from the city</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
By these words the Prophet teaches them, that though hard would be the condition
of the city, as it would be reduced nearly to a waste, yet they who having
returned to their country sincerely worshipped God, would be blessed; for the
Church would ever remain safe, and that how much soever God might lessen the
number, yet a part of the Church, however small, would be kept safe. The object
then of the Prophet is to comfort the faithful, that they might sustain whatever
evils might be at hand, and look for what God promises, even that a Church would
again emerge, and that God would really prove that Jerusalem was not in vain his
sanctuary, where he would bless the remnant which escaped, and escaped through
his wonderful favor. He afterwards adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Zechariah here amplifies the favor of God, &#8212;
that he will go forth openly, and avowedly carry on war against all the enemies
of Jerusalem. It was not indeed a small mitigation of their evils, that a part
of the Church would be saved. But the Prophet declares here what is still far
better, &#8212; that when God afflicted his Church, and suffered it to be
violently assailed by enemies, he would become at length the avenger of all the
wrongs they might have done. We know how we are wounded and tried, when God
gives loose reins to the ungodly, and when they grow wanton in their wickedness
and triumph, insult God, and almost spit as it were at the very clouds. When
therefore the ungodly thus petulantly exult, and God in the meantime hides
himself and is still, it is difficult to wait patiently for the issue. Hence the
Prophet promises that God will become the avenger, after having allowed his
Church to be for a time chastised by ungodly and wicked
enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We know the meaning of this
metaphorical expression. The Prophets sometimes extend the phrase, &#8220;Go
forth shall God from his holy place,&#8221; as though they said &#8212; that the
Jews would find by experience that God&#8217;s name is not invoked in vain in
his temple, and that it has not been said in vain, that God is seated between
the cherubim. But the Prophet seems here to speak of God generally, as going
forth armed from his recesses to resist the enemies of his Church.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go forth
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for he had for a time concealed his power.
In a like manner, we know that God hides his face from us when he brings us no
help, and when we also think that we are neglected by him. As then God, as long
as he hides his power, seems to be without power, hence the Prophet says here,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go forth shall Jehovah, and he
will fight against these
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By these words he intimates, that there is no reason
for the faithful to envy their enemies, even when all things go on prosperously
with them; for they will at length find that they cannot injure the Church
without God undertaking its cause, according to what he has
promised,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I will be an enemy
to thine enemies.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;022322&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Exodus
23:22.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as this is a thing difficult to be believed, he
calls to mind ancient history,_</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As in the
day</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in which he fought in the day of
battle</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some confine this part to the passage
through the Red Sea; but I think that Zechariah includes all the instances which
God had given to the Jews to prove that they were the objects of his care. God
then, not only once, not at one time, nor in one manner, had put forth his
power, that the Jews might plainly see that they became conquerors through his
aid. This is what Zechariah means. He in effect says, &#8220;Both you and your
fathers have long ago found that God is wont to fight for his Church; for he has
honored you with innumerable victories; you have been often overwhelmed with
despair, and his favor unexpectedly shone upon you, and delivered you beyond all
that you hoped for: you had often to contend with the strongest enemies; they
were put to flight, even when ye were wholly unequal to them in number, and yet
God bestowed upon you easy victories. Since then God has so often and in such
divers ways cast down your enemies, why should you not hope for the same aid
still from him?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see why the Prophet now refers to the
ancient battles of God, even that he might by facts confirm the Jews in their
hope, and that they might not doubt but that God was endued with power
sufficiently strong to subdue all the ungodly, for he loses
none.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the day of
battle</i></font><font face="Palatino">, even when there is need of help from
heaven. He indeed calls it the day of engagement or contest, for so the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">brq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>koreb</i>, properly means. When therefore it was necessary for God to engage
with enemies, then his power appeared: &#8220;There is hence no reason for you
hereafter to doubt, but that he will still prevail against your enemies.&#8221;
We know that this mode of speaking is frequently and commonly used by the
Prophets, that is, when they adduce examples of God&#8217;s favor and power, by
which he has proved that there is in him alone sufficient help for the
deliverance of his Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It behaves us now to apply to ourselves what is here
said, for Zechariah did not only speak for the men of his age, or for those of
the next generation, but he intended to furnish the Church with confidence till
the end of the world, so that the faithful might not faint under any trials.
Whenever then the ungodly prevail, and no hope shines on us, let us remember how
often and by what various means God has wonderfully delivered his Church as it
were from death; for it was not his purpose only once to help and aid his own
people, but also to animate us, that we at this day may not despond, when we
endure evils with which the fathers formerly struggled. He then adds

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He continues the same subject, that God&#8217;s power
would be then conspicuous in putting enemies to flight. He indeed illustrates
here his discourse by figurative expressions, as though he wished to bring the
Jews to see the scene itself; for the object of the personification is no other
but that the faithful might set God before them as it were in a visible form;
and thus he confirms their faith, as indeed it was necessary; for as we are dull
and entangled in earthly thoughts, our minds can hardly rise up to heaven,
though the Lord with a clear voice invites us to himself. The Prophet then, in
order to aid our weakness, adds a vivid representation, as though God stood
before their eyes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Stand</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall his feet on the
mount of Olives</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He does not here promise a
miracle, such as even the ignorant might conceive to be literal; nor does he do
this in what follows, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The mount shall be rent, and half
of it shall thorn to the east and half to the
west</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm174</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
has never happened, that mount has never been rent: but as the Prophet could
not, under those grievous trials, which might have overwhelmed the minds of the
godly a hundred times, have extolled the power of God as much as the exigency of
the case required without employing a highly figurative language, he therefore
accommodates himself, as I have said, to the capacity of our
flesh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The import of the whole is, &#8212; that God&#8217;s
power would be so remarkable in the deliverance of his Church, as though God
manifested himself in a visible form and reviewed the battle from the top of the
mountain, and gave orders how everything was to be done.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Stand shall his feet on the mount
of Olives</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Why does he not rather say,
&#8220;In the city itself?&#8221; Even because he meant by this mode of speaking
to show, that God would watch, that he might see what would be necessary for the
deliverance of his Church. All these things, I know, are explained
allegorically, &#8212; that Christ appeared on the mount of Olives, when he
ascended into heaven, and also, that the mount was divided, that it might be
passable, and that the apostles might proceed into the various parts of the
world, in order that they might assail all the nations: but these are
refinements, which, though they please many, have yet nothing solid in them,
when they are by any one properly considered. I then take a simpler view of what
the Prophet says, &#8212; that God&#8217;s hand would be sufficiently
conspicuous, whenever his purpose was to aid his miserable and afflicted
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The same view is to be taken of what follows, that a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>great valley
</i></font><font face="Palatino">would be in the middle, for the rent would be
one half </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>towards the north
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and the other half
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>towards the
south</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is the same thing as though he had
said, that Jerusalem was as it were concealed under that mountain, so that it
was hid, but that afterwards it would be on an elevated place, as it is said
elsewhere, &#8220;Elevated shall be the mountain of the Lord,&#8221; say both
Isaiah and Micah, &#8220;above all mountains.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
2:2;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;330401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah
4:1.) That hill, we know, was small; and yet Isaiah and Micah promise such a
height as will surpass almost the very clouds. What does this mean? Even that
the glory of the God of Jerusalem will be so great, that his temple will be
visible above all other heights. So also in this place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rent</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be the mount of
Olives</i></font><font face="Palatino">, so that Jerusalem may not be as before
in a shaded valley, and have only a small hill on one side, but that it may be
seen far and wide, so that all nations may behold it. This, as I think, is what
the Prophet simply means. But those who delight in allegories must seek them
from others. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet says again, that God&#8217;s presence
would be terrible, so that it would put to flight all the Jews; for though God
promises to be the deliverer of his chosen people, yet as there were still mixed
with them hypocrites, his language varies. But we must further observe, that
though the Lord may appear for our deliverance, it yet cannot be but that his
majesty will strike us with fear; for the flesh must be humbled before God. What
the Prophet then says is the same as though he had said, that the coming of God,
which he had just mentioned, would be fearful to all, not only to open enemies
whom he would come to destroy, but also to the faithful, though they knew that
he would put forth his power to save them. And thus the Prophet seems to reason
from the less to the greater; for if the faithful, who look anxiously for God,
yet tremble and quake at his presence, what must happen to his enemies, who know
that he is against them? As then the Prophet bids here the faithful to be
prepared reverently to look for God, so also he shows that he will be dreadful
to all the ungodly, in order that the elect might not hesitate to flee to his
aid and to rely on him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Flee</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall ye through the
valley of the mountains</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some imagine this to
have been a valley so called, because it was of long extent, stretching through
chains of mountains; but we read nothing of this in scripture. It seems to me
probable, that valleys of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
mountains </i></font><font face="Palatino">were all those places called, which
were rough, impassable, and intricate. Since then there was much wood, and no
easy passage through these countries, the Prophet says that there would be a
long valley, which never was before, but which the rending, of which he had
spoken, would produce. And for the same purpose he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Reach shall the valley of the
mountains to Azal</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This I think is a proper
name of a place; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm175</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> yet
some render it, next; but I see not for what reason. The meaning then is,
&#8212; that where there were previously many hills which were not passable, or
even mountains through which it was difficult to penetrate, there would be one
continuous and even valley to a place very remote.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>flight</i></font><font face="Palatino">
would be hasty, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as in the days of
Uzziah, king of Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for it appears from
sacred history that Judah was then shaken with a terrible earthquake. The Jews,
as they are bold in their conjectures, suppose that this happened when Uzziah
approached the altar to burn incense to God; and <i>Jerome</i> has followed
them. But at what time that earthquake happened is not certain. Amos says that
he began to prophecy two years after an earthquake,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;300101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos
1:1;) but for what cause the earth was then shaken we nowhere read: and yet we
learn from this as well as from other passages, that it was an awful sign and
presage of God&#8217;s vengeance. God then intended to announce to the Jews a
dreadful calamity, when he thus shook the earth. And for the same purpose also
does Zechariah now say, that the flight would be precipitous, as when the Jews
retook themselves to flight, as it were in extreme despair, in the time of
Uzziah.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye fled from the earthquake,
so shall ye flee now</i></font><font face="Palatino">. A long time had indeed
intervened from the death of Uzziah to the return of the people; hence the
Prophet intimates that it would be an unusual calamity, for the like had not
happened which had caused so much terror to the Jews for many
ages.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must remember what I have said &#8212; that
this coming of God is not described as fearful for the purpose of threatening
the Jews; but rather in order to show that the ungodly would not be able to
stand in the presence of God, as he would terrify even those for whose aid he
would come forth. And we must also observe what has been stated that God varies
his address by his Prophets; for now he speaks to the whole Church, in which
hypocrites are mingled with the sincere, and so threatening must be blended with
promises, and then, he directs his words especially to the elect alone, to whom
he manifests his favor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says at length,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And come shall Jehovah, my
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet repeats what he had said
shortly before &#8212; that God&#8217;s power would be made evident to the Jews,
as though they saw it with their eyes. There is indeed no necessity to suppose
that God would actually descend from heaven; but he teaches us, as I have said,
that though God&#8217;s power would be for a time hidden, it would at length
appear in the deliverance of his elect, as though God descended for the purpose
from heaven. He calls him his God, in order to gain more credit to his prophecy.
He no doubt thus courageously assailed all the ungodly, to whom promises as well
as threatening were a mockery; and he also intended to support the minds of the
godly, that they might not doubt but that this was promised them from above,
though they heard but the voice of a mortal man. The Prophet then with great
confidence claims God here as his God, as though he had said &#8212; that there
was no reason for them to judge of what he said by any worldly circumstance or
by his person; in short, he declares here that he was sent from above, that he
did not rashly intrude himself, so as to promise anything which he himself had
invented, but that he was favored with a divine mission, so that he represented
God himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this also is the object of the conclusion, which
has been overlooked by some. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All
the saints with thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There seems to be here a
kind of indignation, as though the Prophet turned himself away from his hearers,
whom he observed to be in a measure prepared obstinately to reject his heavenly
doctrine; for he turns his discourse to God. The sentence seems indeed to lose a
portion of its gracefulness, when the Prophet speaks so abruptly,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come shall Jehovah my God, all
the saints with thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm176</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
might have said &#8220;all the saints with him:&#8221; but as I have said, he
addresses God, as though he could not, on account of disgust, speak to malignant
and perverse men, and this serves much to confirm the authority of his prophecy;
for he not only declares boldly to men what was to be, but also appeals to God
as his witness; nay, he seems as though he had derived by a secret and familiar
colloquy what he certainly knew was committed to him by God. But by saints, as I
think, he understands the angels; for to include the holy patriarchs and kings,
would seem unnatural and far-fetched: and angels, we know, are called saints or
holy in other places, as we have seen in the third chapter of Habakkuk
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;350301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
3:1); and they are called sometimes elect angels. In short, the Prophet shows,
that the coming of God would be magnificent; he would descend, as it were, in a
visible manner together with his angels, that men&#8217;s minds might be roused
into admiration and wonder. This is the meaning.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet confirms what we have already observed
that the Church would be subject to many troubles and commotions, so that the
faithful should not enjoy the common light, but be more miserable than men in
general. And he has ever the same object in view, to prepare the faithful to
exercise patience, and to remind them that they are not to promise themselves
such enjoyments in the holy land, as though they were to be free from the trials
of the cross. Lest then they should deceive themselves with vain hopes, he sets
before them many evils and many calamities, that they might confidently wait for
the aid, of which he had spoken, while immersed in thick darkness, and hardly
able to distinguish between day and night. But the rest shall be considered
tomorrow.</font><br></div>

ourselves unworthy of our holy calling; and whatever evils must be borne by us,

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND SIXTY-SIXTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE explained shortly yesterday why the Prophet says,
that there would be for some time no difference between day and night; it was to
prepare the faithful for all changes, and to show that they are not to promise
themselves anything certain or sure in this world. Days and nights revolve
throughout all seasons of the year, but the Prophet shows that there would be an
uncertain time, as though it were twilight, or that there would not be constant
light, but light mixed with darkness. The two verses ought to be connected
together, when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that
day </i></font><font face="Palatino">there
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall not be precious light and
mingled light</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or, on the contrary, thick
darkness. What he says afterwards,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that day there shall not be
day or night</i></font><font face="Palatino">, is disjoined by some, but not
rightly, as we shall presently see.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But with regard to the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>light of
preciousnesses</i></font><font face="Palatino">, it is agreed among all writers
that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twrqy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ikarut</i>, means what is excellent. As to this word then there is no
ambiguity; for the Prophet means that it shall not be a light day, such as is
wont to be during a clear sky. But as to the second word, interpreters differ.
It is written
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wapqy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ikophaun</i>:
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">apq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kopha</i>, means to coagulate, to become thick: hence
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wapqy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ikophaun</i>, signifies density or dense darkness. Some think it to be in
construction; and others, that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>vau</i>, is to be put in; and this is probable, as we may see from the
context, though yet it may have a twofold meaning. If indeed we join these two
words, the Prophet may understand that the light would not be very clear, and
that there would not be thick darkness. But we may take the light of densities
for that which is steady and fixed, which gains such strength, that it cannot be
darkened. But I prefer a different view: we know that the copulative in Hebrew
is often taken adversatively; and this exposition is the most suitable, &#8212;
that there would not be clear light, but on the contrary, a density, that is,
thick darkness, which would obscure the light of the sun, or hinder the eyes of
men from enjoying clear light. This seems to be the meaning of our Prophet,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that day there shall not be
light</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, that day shall not be clear,
that is, so far that it can be numbered among fair and bright, or clear days;
but on the contrary, there will be densities, that is, it will be a cloudy time,
for much darkness will fill the sky, and prevent men to see the sun. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm177</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the subject itself, it is sufficiently apparent
what the Prophet meant; for as I said yesterday, and have again reminded you, it
was to be a perilous time, so that the miserable Jews would hourly and every
moment be filled with fear, as they should see many dangers around them; and
there would ever be some appearance of a sudden change. As when we find the
south wind blowing, and the heavens covered with clouds, a shower is expected,
and every one keeps within floors, and they who travel dare not proceed lest a
storm overtakes them; so also the Prophet says, that this time would be like
cloudy and dark days.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The same is the meaning of what he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It shall be one day, when it
shall not be day and night</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as though he had
said, that there would not be any settled state of weather. Interpreters have
given a very different view &#8212; that it would be neither day nor night. Some
give this reason, because the Lord will rule his Church by faith; and we indeed
know that our salvation is hid under the safe keeping of faith. Others give an
entirely different meaning, &#8212; that the Lord will so fill heaven and earth
by his own brightness, that there will be no need for the sun and the moon,
according to what is said by Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Shine to thee
shall not the sun by day nor the moon by night; but to thee shall Jehovah be an
eternal light.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;236019&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
60:19.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But these are mere refinements. The real meaning of
the Prophet, I doubt not, is, &#8212; that men would be in continual
trepidation, as wile the air is in various ways agitated, when clouds arise,
when the thunder is heard, and when the light of the sun disappears. When such
is the state of the sky, men we know fear, for there is hardly a distinction
between day and night. Thus our Prophet warns the faithful as to future events,
and prepares them for patience, lest any storm should overwhelm them, and they
should despond when overtaken by it, but that they might look for what had been
foretold, even for darkness mixed with light, which would be a continual
twilight: and the word, twilight, the ancients have said, is derived from one
signifying what is doubtful (<i>crepusculum a crepero</i>.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must also notice what he afterwards says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this day would towards evening be
light</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He here intimates, that there will ever
be a joyful end to the troubles of the faithful. Though then they were tossed by
many cares, and troubled with various kinds of fear, as though they were in
darkness, yet he says, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>evening</i></font><font face="Palatino">
would be clear. And this ought to be carefully observed, for with this solace
alone is the Spirit wont to ease the sorrows of the godly, that is, that after
God has for a while tried them, there will come shortly an end, and that a
joyful one, to all their evils, so that God will shine on them like the sun in
its meridian splendor. He calls, in short, the attention of the faithful to this
end, because God makes thus a distinction between the elect and the reprobate;
for though he afflicts both alike, and overwhelms them as with darkness, there
is yet light prepared for his elect; and after having suffered them for a time
to lie in darkness, he will make them at length to emerge into clear light; but
he deprives the reprobate of every hope.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the subject which the Prophet now handles; as
though he had said, &#8212; &#8220;There is no reason for the faithful to be
disheartened by adversities, when darkness on all sides surrounds them; for the
Lord will at length restore light to them, of which it was needful for them to
be deprived for a time.&#8221; But Zechariah speaks not here of one day, but of
a period which would be like a dark day, even until Christ by his coming
restored the full light, as the Sun of Righteousness, according to what he is
called by Malachi.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this day is known to
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">, in order that the faithful night
depend on his good pleasure, and not too anxiously enquire about an event hidden
from them and the whole world.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The day
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is
known</i></font><font face="Palatino">, says Zechariah, only to God, though he
speaks of things well known, and which the Jews had at length to know by
experience. But his object must be regarded, for his purpose was to restrain the
godly, that they might not unnecessarily torment themselves, for we are wont to
be too curious to know things: when God&#8217;s design is to calm us, and to
make us rely on his providence, then many thoughts come across our minds, and
toss us here and there, and thus we torment ourselves with anxiety. As then it
is disease is innate in human nature, the Prophet supplies a seasonable remedy,
&#8212; that the faithful are to allow themselves to be ruled by God, and to
follow the example of their father Abraham, &#8220;The Lord will provide:&#8221;
when he was in extremity and no escape was open he committed himself to
God&#8217;s providence. So also Zechariah says, that it would be entirely
dependent on the will of God alone, now to cover the heavens with darkness, and
then to restore the sun, and also to blend darkness with light; and nothing is
better for men than to check themselves, and not to enquire more than what is
right, nor take away anything from God&#8217;s power, for whenever men murmur
against God&#8217;s judgments, it is the same thing as though they wished to
penetrate into heaven, and concede nothing to him except what they themselves
think right. Then, in order to check this presumption, the Prophet says, that
this day is known to Jehovah, so that the faithful might patiently wait until
the ripened end should come, for our curiosity drives us here and there, so that
we always wish to be certain about the end, &#8220;How long is this to
endure?&#8221; and thus we complain against God; but when we are not able to
subordinate our minds to his will, then we break forth as it were into a furious
temper.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see how useful a doctrine this clause
contains, where the Prophet sets God as the judge and the arbitrator of all
events, so that he afflicts the Church as long as it pleases him, sets bounds to
adversities, and regulates all things as it seemeth good to him; and he also
covers the heavens with thick clouds, and takes away the sight of the sun. All
this then is what the Prophet would have us to know is in God&#8217;s power, and
directed by his counsel. It now follows-</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here is subjoined a more cheering prophecy, &#8212;
that the grace of God would yet prevail. Whatever evils, and troubles, and
dangers, and fears, and diseases awaited the faithful, he yet says that in such
miseries they would still be made happy. And this ought to be carefully
observed, for nothing can be more suitably found to alleviate our sorrows than
to put in the balance God&#8217;s benefits on one side, and on the other the
punishments and chastisements which he brings on us; for as God&#8217;s mercy
and kindness always greatly preponderate, it cannot be but that we shall be able
to say with holy Job,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;If good things
have we received from the Lord&#8217;s
hand,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">why should we refuse evil
things?&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;180210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Job
2:10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This then is what Zechariah sets before us, &#8212;
that though the Church may be harassed by many cares, and subject to many fears,
and terrified by many dangers, and be as it were in trepidation, yet the grace
of God, if rightly viewed, is sufficient to administer invaluable comfort, for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>go forth shall living waters from
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm178</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This prophecy no doubt refers to the kingdom of
Christ, and this may be sufficiently proved by other passages. The Prophet then
has hitherto spoken of the many afflictions, which were nigh at hand, in order
that the Jews might not faint or entirely fail; but he now directs their minds
to the kingdom of Christ, from whence they were to look for not only a
deliverance from all evils, but also the full restitution of the Church, and as
it were the renovation of the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is here no doubt an implied contrast between
living waters and those which soon dry up: hence he says, that they would flow
continually summer and winter. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm179</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Judea,
we know, was subject to want of water, and there were no waters around
Jerusalem, except the spring of Siloam, which had waters in abundance, and
supplied the wants of the citizens. But the Prophet promises living waters,
which would not be like occasional streams, but flow continually. At the same
time he seems to regard something higher. As by living waters he understands
those which are spiritual, so he compares these waters with all those streams
which are earthly; as though he had said, &#8220;the fountain from which the two
streams arise is inexhaustible, so that its exuberance shall never fail, but
shall send forth streams from one sea to the opposite sea, and shall water the
farthest regions of the earth.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the eastern sea many understand the Lake
Asphaltes, but it seems to me more probable that the Prophet speaks of the
Persian Sea; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm180</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for if
he had said that the waters would go forth to that lake, the distance would be
very short; but he meant on the contrary to show, that the copiousness of the
waters would be so large and abundant that though they would pass through the
whole earth, yet their flow would never cease. By the hinder sea he no doubt
meant the Mediterranean. The import of the whole is, &#8212; that thong the
earth were previously dry, yet such would be the abundance of waters as to be
sufficient for all, not only as in former times to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
but also to all the Jews in whatever part of the country they might
dwell.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, since the language is metaphorical, we must bear
in mind what I have lately said, &#8212; that here is set forth the spiritual
grace of God; nor is it a new thing to apply the word waters to the Spirit of
God:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I will pour forth
waters on the dry land</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and rivers
on the thirsty land&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
44:3;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and again,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I will give clean
waters.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;263625&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
36:25.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is a twofold reason why Scripture gives the
name of waters to the Holy Spirit, &#8212; because he performs the two offices
of cleansing and of watering: for we are like barren and dry land, except the
Lord by his Spirit from heaven gives us new vigor and conveys moisture to us. As
then the earth derives moisture from heaven, that it may produce fruit, so also
we must have conferred on us by the hidden power of the Spirit whatever vigor we
may possess. Since then Zechariah promises a fountain of living waters, he
understands that God&#8217;s grace would be offered to all the Jews, so that
they might drink and be satisfied, and no more be exposed as formerly to the
want of water.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If any one objects and says, that this interpretation
seems forced, the answer is ready at hand, which is this, &#8212; that as it is
certain that the prophet here speaks of the kingdom of Christ, this rule is to
be remembered, &#8212; That whatever is foretold of Christ&#8217;s kingdom, must
correspond with its nature and character. Since then the kingdom of Christ is
spiritual, there is no doubt but that when Scripture, as we have seen, promises
a large produce of corn and wine, an abundance of all good things, tranquillity
and peace, and bright days, it intends by all these things to set forth the
character of Christ&#8217;s kingdom. We hence see what the prophet means by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>living
waters</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and then, why he says that they would
go forth to the east and to the west; and lastly, why he adds, that they would
flow in winter as well as in summer. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the prophet shows more clearly, and without
using a figurative language, what might otherwise be more obscure: he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah would be
king</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here Zechariah compares the kingdom of
Christ with those periods of misery and calamities which had preceded, and which
had continued till the coming of Christ. We indeed know that there had been the
most dreadful scattering through the whole land, since the time the ten tribes
separated from the family of David; for since the body of the people ceased to
be one, they wilfully contrived ruin for themselves. When therefore the
Israelites fought against Judah, the wrath of God appeared, the fruit of their
defection. We indeed know that David was not made king by the suffrages of men,
but was chosen by the decree of God. Hence when the kingdom of Israel departed
from the son of David, it was the same as though they had refused to bear the
authority of God himself, according to what he said to Samuel,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Thee have they not
despised, but me,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">that I should not
reign over them.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;090807&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Samuel 8:7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And yet Samuel was only a governor for a time over
the people; but when the people through a foolish zeal wished a king to be given
then, God complains that he was despised in not being allowed to reign over them
alone. This was more fully completed, when the ten tribes separated themselves
from the lawful kingdom which God himself had established and had commanded to
be inviolable. From that time then God was not their king. This is one
thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Afterwards we know that the kings of Israel joined
themselves with the kings of Syria to overthrow the kingdom of Judah, and that
the Jews also sent for aid to the Assyrians, and afterwards had recourse to the
Egyptians. At length the kingdom of Israel was cut off; then the kingdom of
Judah, and the city was destroyed and the temple burnt, so that the worship of
God for a time ceased. They afterwards returned; but we know they were ever
oppressed by hard and cruel tyranny: when they perceived that they were
unprotected, because they had refused to take shelter under the wings of God.
Though he had so often told them that they would be safe and secure under his
protection, they yet refused that favor. Therefore the Jews then found to their
great loss that God was not their king.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence when Zechariah now speaks of the restoration of
the Church, he rightly says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah would be
king</i></font><font face="Palatino">; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm181</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
is, though the Jews had been torn asunder and pillaged by tyrants, though they
had suffered many reproaches and wrongs, yet God would become again their king,
that He might defend them against all unjust violence and keep them under His
protection. Nothing indeed can be more blessed than to live under the reigns of
God; and this highest happiness is ever promised to the
faithful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand the Prophet&#8217;s meaning as to
this part; but he shows immediately after that this cannot be hoped for, except
the Jews really attended to true religion and worshipped God aright and cast
away their superstitions. Hence he joins together these two things, &#8212; that
the condition of the people would be a happy one, because God would undertake
the care of them and perform the office of a king, &#8212; and then, that God
would be their king, in order that he might be rightly and sincerely worshipped
by them: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there shall
be</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here the Prophet briefly shows that
the legitimate worship of God cannot be set up, unless superstition be
abolished. We indeed know that God is jealous, as he calls himself, so that he
cannot bear rivals: for when we devise for ourselves any sort of deity, we
instantly take from God what is his own. The Prophet then teaches us, that God
cannot be truly worshipped, except he shines alone as the supreme, so that our
religion may be pure and sound. In short, he indirectly condemns here those
superstitions by which the earth had been corrupted and polluted, and also the
superstitions by which true religion had been adulterated and the worship under
the law had been violated. For this reason he says, that Jehovah would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be
one</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm182</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He expresses this still clearer by saying, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his name would be
one</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This second clause may indeed appear
useless; for whatever can be said of God is comprehended in his oneness. But as
we are wont by various artifices to cover superstitions, and ever devise new
excuses and new disguises, by which our impiety may seem specious and plausible,
the Prophet expressly adds here, that God&#8217;s
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>name is
one</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as though he had said, &#8220;It is not
enough for men to declare that they acknowledge one true God or one supreme
deity, except also they agree in some true and simple faith, so that the name of
this one true God may be celebrated on the earth.&#8221; But the idea of the
Prophet will become more clear if we notice the difference between the one true
God and the name of the only true God, or the one name of God. All the
philosophers with one mouth teach, that there are not many gods, but some
supreme deity, who is the source of divinity: and this is what has been believed
by all heathen nations. But in course of time they began to imagine that from
this source many gods have emanated; and hence has come a multitude of false
gods, so that some worshipped Jupiter, others Mercury, others Apollo; not
because they thought that there are many gods partaking of original divinity;
but because they imagined that gods have proceeded from the supreme fountain. As
then the Jews might have sought subterfuges, and excused themselves by saying
that they did not in heart worship many gods, the Prophet adds the second
clause, &#8212; that the name of God is one; which means, that there is a
certain way in which God is to be worshipped, that there is a certain fixed
rule, so that no one is to follow what he himself may imagine to be right, and
that the majesty of God ought not to be profaned by various errors, nor should
men be lost each in his own notion, but that all ought to attend to the voice of
God, and to hear what he testifies of himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand what the Prophet means: he
says first, that things would be in a happy state in Judea, when God would be
regarded as one, that is, when the whole land had been cleansed from its
defilements, and when true religion again prevailed: but as this purity would
not easily obtain footing in the world, and as men easily decline from it, he
adds, that the name of God would be one, in order that the Jews might understand
that God cannot be rightly worshipped except he be alone worshipped; and that it
cannot be one, unless there be one faith, prescribed and certain, and not
alternating between diverse opinions, like that of the heathens, whose religion
is no other than to follow what they themselves imagine or what they have
derived from their ancestors.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this is a remarkable passage: God distinguishes
himself from all idols and his worship from all superstitions; and the more
attentively we ought to consider what the Prophet teaches us, because our
inclinations, as I have said, to vanity, is so great, and this is what
experience itself sufficiently shows, and we also see how easily superstition,
like a whirlwind, carries us away, and not only one superstition, but
innumerable kinds of superstition. The more then it behaves us to notice this
truth, so that the one name of God may prevail among us, and that no one may
allow himself the liberty of imagining anything he pleases; but that we may know
what God ought to be worshipped by us. And Christ also condemns for this reason
all the forms of worship which prevailed in the world, by saying to the woman of
Samaria,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Ye know not what
ye worship, we Jews alone,&#8221; he
says,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;know this.&#8221;

4:22.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that this one thing is sufficient to
condemn all superstitions, that is, when men follow their own fancies, and
observe not a fixed and unchangeable rule, which cannot deceive. It follows

distance, and also, that it would be a secure and peaceable
habitation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the former part he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Turned shall be the whole land
into a plain</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm183</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We
indeed know that Jerusalem was situated with mountains around it, its
foundations, as it is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
87:1, were on the holy mountains. As then the country was uneven on account of
its many hills, the Prophet says, that it would become a wide plain, so that
travelling would not be rough and difficult as before; and further, that
Jerusalem would not be low in a deep place, but would be on a plain, which would
not prevent it from being seen from whatever quarter the visitants might come.
The whole land, he says, shall be a plain
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from Geba to
Rimmon</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As we do not fully know what sort of
country that was, nor where Geba and Rimmon were, I shall not speak here
particularly on every word; but it is enough for us to understand the design of
what is said, which was to show &#8212; that steep places would become level
ground, so that Jerusalem might be seen from far, and that the surface being
level there would be no mountains to impede a distant view. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm184</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then follows the second clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Inhabited shall be Jerusalem in

pulled down, and now lies as it were dilapidated, and the buildings already
begun are very imperfect, yet </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it
shall on itself be inhabited</i></font><font face="Palatino">, it shall have the
same limits, the same boundaries: in short, the Prophet means, that the size of
the city would be the same as it was formerly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Zechariah, we know, performed the office of a
teacher, when the Jews began, not without great hindrances, to build the city.
They were not able at first to take in the whole compass; indeed they thought
this impracticable, until they were encouraged by Ezra and Nehemiah, as we learn
from the books of both. Since then the city they began to build was confined in
its limits, Zechariah says, that there was no reason to despair, for in a short
time it would again attain its ancient splendor, and be extended to all its
gates, as it is afterwards stated. And a description of the ancient city, when
destroyed, is no doubt given here when he says,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the gate of Benjamin to the
place of the first gate</i></font><font face="Palatino">, (he mentions the place
of the gate, for there was then no gate, as that part of the city remained as
yet desolate,) </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the gate of the
corners, from the citadel of Hananeel to the wine-vats of the
king</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Though we know not fully now how far the
ancient Jerusalem extended, or what was its exact situation, it is yet certain
that the Prophet meant that such would be the greatness and magnificence of the
city, that its condition would fully equal its ancient splendor which then had
disappeared. The city, as it is well known, had been very large; though writers
do not agree on the subject, yet it is commonly admitted, that it included 30
stadia. This was certainly no common size; and hence the Prophet states what all
thought to be incredible, that though the extent of the city was small, it would
yet become a new Jerusalem, not inferior to the former either in largeness or in
magnificence, or in any other respect. But we must defer what remains till
tomorrow.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">ZECHARIAH concludes what he said in the last verse by
saying, that Jerusalem when restored by God to its pristine state would be a
populous city, for the indefinite verb here used means the same as though he had
said, that the number of people would be as great as it had been before, though
a small portion only had returned. We indeed know how difficult it is to fill a
city with inhabitants when once deserted, especially after a long interval of
time. But the Prophet here exhorts the Jews to entertain hope, for the Lord
would gather again a large number of men, so as to fill the city with
inhabitants.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there shall be no more utter
destruction</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm185</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By the
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;rj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cherem</i>, I have no doubt, the Prophet means all utter ruin, such as had
happened when the people were driven into exile. And for this reason and in the
same sense, Isaiah says, that God had sworn that the destruction of the city
would be like the deluge of Noah,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235409&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
54:9;) for he should never again bring such a grievous and dreadful vengeance on
his people. But we learn from the whole passage, that this prophecy extends to
the kingdom of Christ; for though Jerusalem was destroyed by Titus, it is yet
true that God bad been the perpetual guardian of that city, inasmuch as the
fullness of time had come when Christ was revealed. It is then the same as
though the Prophet had said, that such should be the moderation of God&#8217;s
anger, that the name of the city would wholly perish, nor the whole people be
forced to migrate. This then is what he understands by
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;rj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cherem</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds, that those who returned thither
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall dwell safely in
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">, for the Lord would protect them, and
by an extended hand defend them against all enemies. We have elsewhere reminded
you of the Prophet&#8217;s object; for he wished to goad the tardiness and sloth
of those who made so much of their pleasures in Chaldea, that to return to the
inheritance promised them from above was unpleasant and grievous to them. Hence
he shows of how great a benefit of God they had deprived themselves; for being
dispersed among the heathen nation they knew not that God&#8217;s aid was
provided for them. They indeed deprived themselves of that promise which
especially belonged to the remnant who dwelt at Jerusalem. The Prophet had also
a particular regard to those miserable inhabitants of the land, who having been
stimulated by God&#8217;s promises, had despised all dangers and all
difficulties, and then had undergone, not grudgingly, vast troubles that they
might possess their own country. The Prophet then shows that they had no reason
to repent, for the Lord would bless them, and make them to dwell safely in the
midst of enemies, by whom we know they were on every side surrounded, and
further, that the city would become populous, though they were not then many in
number. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet adds, that though there would not be
wanting many ungodly men, who should distress the Church, and attempt many
things for its destruction, yet God would be a defender and would inflict
punishment, which would exhibit a clear and decided proof of that paternal favor
which he manifests towards his Church. But these things do not seem to harmonise
&#8212; that the people should dwell safely at Jerusalem, and yet that there
would be enemies violently disturbing the city: but by saying, that they should
dwell safely, he means not that there would be none anxious to do them harm; but
that trusting in God&#8217;s protection they would continue safe in the greatest
dangers, as they would feel persuaded that God, who promised to stand on their
side, would be stronger than all. The habitation of the godly would then be
secure, not because they dreaded no attacks of enemies, but because they firmly
believed that they would be preserved by a power from above, though the devil
excited many people on all sides against them, and also prepared and suborned
many wicked men to contrive their ruin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And to this power it behaves us to raise up our
thoughts when various enemies rage against us, so that we may dwell in safety
and wait with quiet minds until God shall deliver us; for our safety is
concealed under the faithful protection of God, which is only made known to us
by the word and promises. Let us, however, bear in mind what the Prophet teaches
us here &#8212; that when God gives loose reins to enemies, his vengeance is
near, so that he will visit with punishment all those wrongs and injuries which
we patiently endure.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be the plague with

mentions </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all people
</i></font><font face="Palatino">again, lest a multitude of enemies should
terrify the faithful, when they found themselves unequal to them, and almost
overwhelmed by their vast number; they were not to doubt but that the hand of
God would prevail. Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His flesh shall consume
away</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or melt away: there is a change of
number, but the sense is not obscured; for he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This shall be the plague with
which Jehovah shall smite all people; his flesh shall melt
away</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as though he was speaking of one man; and
then he immediately adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>while
he shall stand on his feet; and his eyes shall melt away, and his tongue in
their mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm186</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We see
how the Prophet changes the number three times; but there is in the subject
itself nothing ambiguous. He means that it would be nothing to God, when
resolved to punish the adversaries of his Church, whether they were many or few;
for he can easily destroy them all, as though he had to do only with one man.
But it seems also that Zechariah had another thing in view &#8212; that as
God&#8217;s vengeance would regard each individual, no one of them would be
safe, and that thus the vengeance of God would be universal, without any
exception, and executed on all armies and on each individual.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must now notice the kind of punishment which is
here described &#8212; that God would destroy them all without the hand or the
aid of men: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall melt
away</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or dissolve. In this case divine
vengeance is more clearly seen, that is, then enemies, though no one fights with
them, yet of themselves consume away: and then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when they shall stand on their
feet</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and yet their flesh shall melt away. The
Prophet no doubt alludes to the curses of the law, among which this is
especially to be observed &#8212; that God in various ways consumes the wicked,
so that they melt away when no cause appears.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;052821&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
28:21,22.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning then is, that God has various means by
which he can reduce to nothing our enemies, though they may seek aid on every
side. We are therefore taught by these words to cast all our cares on God; for
when our enemies seem to be placed beyond the chance of danger, and confidently
boast that nothing adverse can happen to them, yet in God&#8217;s hand is their
death and life, so that they can be consumed by his breath only. There is then
no reason for us to depend on earthly means, when we seek to be certain
respecting the destruction of our enemies; for God can inwardly consume them;
though they may seem to stand whole and sound, yet they will be dissolved, so
that even their eyes shall melt away in their cavities, that is, they shall fail
without any external force. We indeed know that eyes are well protected; being
covered with their defences, they seem to be beyond the reach of harm. But the
Prophet intimates that the hidden vengeance of God can penetrate into the bowels
and marrow; in short, that there is nothing so safe that it can escape the
vengeance of God. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The tongue
</i></font><font face="Palatino">also, he says,

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet seems again to be inconsistent with
himself; for after having declared that God would be the defender of his people,
so as to destroy and consume all people for their sake, he now adds that there
would be intestine discords, by which the Jews would wilfully consume one
another; while yet there is nothing more improbable than that the people, who
live under God&#8217;s protection, should so divide themselves into factions, as
to perish miserably without any outward enemy. But these things do not ill
accord, provided we bear in mind what I have already said &#8212; that these
things are to be taken in a different sense; for the Prophet at one time warns
the faithful of the evils which were impending, lest being shaken by their
suddenness, they should despond; at another time he promises them a happy
condition, for they would ever be the objects of God&#8217;s care. So then we
may explain the matter thus &#8212; &#8220;Though enemies on every side should
unite and conspire against you, though they should hasten with great fury and
rage to destroy you, and though a vast member at home, and domestic enemies from
the bosom of your city, should rise up against you, yet God will prevail against
them, and all your enemies shall at length be for your good and
benefit.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This then is the reason why Zechariah blends together
what seems to be wholly inconsistent. It was necessary to know both these things
&#8212; that the faithful might be fully persuaded that God watched over their
safety, for it was his purpose to defend the holy city, and to be its perpetual
guardian &#8212; and then, that they might also be prepared in their minds to
bear many trials and troubles, lest they should promise to themselves a joyful
state, and thus indulge in carnal security. Having now explained the
Prophet&#8217;s intention, we must briefly notice the words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that there would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be a great tumult from Jehovah
among them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This no doubt refers to the Jews;
for the Prophet shows that they would be not only exposed to external injuries,
but also to another evil &#8212; that they would arm themselves against one
another, as though they would tear out their own bowels.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A
tumult</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be among
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">, which is the extreme of evils that can
happen to a city or people; for no danger is nearer than when they who ought as
one man to unite strength and courage to repel an enemy, rage internally against
themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this passage deserves special notice, as here is
described to us the condition of the Church, such as it is to be until the end
of the world; for though the Prophet speaks here of the intermediate time
between the return of the people and the coming of Christ, yet he paints for us
a living representation, by which we can see that the Church is never to be free
or exempt from this evil &#8212; that it cannot drive away or put to flight
domestic enemies. And we must also observe, that this tumult, as he says, would
be from
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm187</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
means that whenever the Church is rent, and sects burst forth, and many
hypocrites and ungodly men, who for a time pretend to be God&#8217;s true
servants, furiously assail true religion &#8212; whenever these things arise,
the Prophet means that they do not happen by chance, but that they are
God&#8217;s judgments, in order to prove the faith of his people, and to humble
his Church, and also to give to his people a victory and a crown. However this
may be, though their own ambition rouses heretics, and all the ungodly, to
disturb the Church, and though the devil excites them by his own fans, yet God
sits in the chief place, and whatever commotions rage in the Church proceed from
him. Hence Paul says that heresies must be, that those who are approved may
become manifest.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 11:19.) Certainly this is not the object of the devil; but Paul
shows that it is the high purpose of God, so that he may distinguish by severe
trial between his sincere servants and hypocrites; for he not only permits
tumults to arise, but even stirs them up. And hence also we learn, that nothing
is better than to flee to him when ungodly men race and distort our peace; for
he can easily by a nod silence those commotions which he
excites.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every one shall lay hold on the
hand of his companion, and rise up </i></font><font face="Palatino">(or perish)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall his hand against the hand
of his neighbor</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This passage may admit of a
twofold meaning. The first is, that every one for the sake of obtaining help
will lay hold on the hand of his neighbor, and yet without any advantage, for
his own hand would perish, that is, he who sought aid for his friend could not
support himself: and this is the meaning given by many interpreters; as though
the Prophet had said, that the state of things would be so desperate, that every
one would be constrained to seek help from his friend, and yet could not obtain
what he desired, for while attempting to lay hold on the hand of his friend, he
would find that he could not grasp it. But a different meaning would better
correspond with the next verse, &#8212; that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>every one would violently lay
hold on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand would rise up against the hand of
his neighbor</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I think then that this part is
added as explanatory, &#8212; that when God raised tumults among the Jews, every
one would start forward to act violently against his neighbor, and raise up his
hand to hurt him: for it follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Zechariah speaks here no doubt on the same subject;
for he adds, that there would be an intestine war between the country and the
city, though they were but one body, and since their return they were under the
same Divine banner: God had indeed been their leader in their journey, and was
in short the only remaining glory of the people. It was then something horribly
monstrous, that Judah should join himself to enemies in order to destroy the
city: yet the Prophet says that this evil, as well as other evils, would soon be
witnessed; so that they would have not only to sustain the assaults of enemies,
who would come from far, but would also find their brethren hostile and hurtful
to them: Fight then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall Judah

under Antiochus we know that both the city and the whole land were full of
traitors; inasmuch as hardly one in a hundred continued to follow true religion.
Thus it happened, that almost all were trodden under foot. It was not then
without reason foretold by Zechariah, that the Jews would become cruel enemies
to their own brethren.</font><br></div>

<i>chil</i>, means forces, wealth and strength. I am disposed to follow what I
have already said, &#8212; that the army or strength of all nations around would
be collected to overthrow Jerusalem. The Prophet intimates in these words that
the Jews would apparently be the most miserable of men, were their condition
estimated by their state at that time; for there would be harassing traitors
within, so that they had to fear intrigues and hidden dangers, and many people
also from every part would unite to destroy them. Nothing can be imagined more
miserable than to be assailed from within and from without by almost the whole
of mankind. But there will presently follow a consolation; and hence we must
bear in mind what I have said, that threatening are given by way of warning,
that the faithful might courageously bear those ruinous attacks, relying on the
hope of a better state of things, according to what God had
promised.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gold, and silver, and

he speaks of, would not come, as though they were hungry, running to the prey;
but that they would be so savage as to seek nothing but blood; for they would be
furnished with necessaries, having an abundance of gold and silver. For what
purpose then would they come? Not to satiate their avarice, but only to gorge
human blood, and thus to extinguish the memory of the chosen people. Even to
hear this was terrible; but it was necessary to warn the faithful, lest they
should be surprised by any sudden event. He afterwards adds

<div><font face="Palatino">Zechariah here advances farther, &#8212; that those
who shall have escaped the ruin of which he had spoken shall be so humbled that
they would of their own accord submit to God. He said before, that God would
take vengeance and destroy all the enemies of his Church; but the promise here
is still more valuable, &#8212; that he would turn the hearts of those who
escaped punishment, so that without any constraint they would become obedient;
for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>come</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall they every year to
worship God in his temple</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Then the sum of what
is said is this, that God would subdue all the enemies of his Church, and in two
ways, for some he would destroy, and he would humble others, so as to make them
willing servants and ready of themselves to obey his authority.

<div><font face="Palatino">If the time be inquired, I answer, that whenever the
Prophets speak of the conversion of the nations, they are wont to speak always
in general terms; but that this is an hyperbolical language, and that still
there is nothing unreasonable in this excess, for surely it was a wonderful work
of God when a great number from the nations became subject to him. We indeed
know, that the name of the people of Israel was universally hated, so that their
religion was disliked by almost the whole world. It was then a thing incredible
when Zechariah said, that men from all countries would be so changed as to
worship the true God of Israel. But many Churches we know were everywhere formed
in the world, and men without number professed God&#8217;s name, and undertook
his yoke, and embraced that religion which before had been despised by them, and
which indeed they had persecuted with the greatest hatred. It is therefore no
wonder that the Prophet should say, that the remnant who escaped the sword of
vengeance would at length become the willing servants of God. But we ought to
notice, as I have said, the mode of speaking commonly adopted by the Prophets,
for, in order to amplify the grace of God, they speak in general terms, though
what they say ought to be confined to the elect alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ascend</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall every one from
year to year</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Zechariah speaks here also
according to the apprehensions of the people. Festivals, we know, were appointed
by God; the Israelites ascended at least three times a year unto the temple, but
as this was too hard and difficult for the miserable exiles to do, who had been
scattered through all countries, those influenced by zeal for religion were wont
to descend unto Jerusalem once a year. To this custom of the law the Prophet now
alludes, as though he had said, &#8220;God indeed spares some, yet they will at
length come to his service without any constraint, and submit to the God of
Israel.&#8221; But he speaks, as I have said, according to the rites of the law;
and of this mode of speaking we have often reminded you: I shall therefore pass
by the subject, but some additional remarks shall be made at the end of this
chapter.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ascend</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall every one to
supplicate the king, Jehovah of hosts</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is,
that they might confess the only true God to be king: for he has regard to the
Prophecy which we considered yesterday, when he said that the only true God
would be king. So also in this place, confirming the former truth he says, that
they who had before furiously assailed the Church would become the worshipers of
God, for they would understand him to be the king of the whole world. But the
remainder shall be deferred to another time.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">ZECHARIAH goes on here with the same subject, &#8212;
that the name of the only true God would be known throughout the whole world, so
that all nations would unite in his worship, while the whole earth was before
polluted with various superstitions, and every one followed his own god: but the
more clearly expresses here than in the last lecture, that vengeance was
prepared for all the despisers of the true God. He says then, that the curse of
God is laid up for all those who would not come to Jerusalem humbly to worship
God to there.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have said that in these words is set forth the
legitimate worship of God; for after the coming of Christ it was not necessary
to ascend into Jerusalem according to what John says in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430421&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
4:21</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The time comes and
now is, that the true worshippers of God shall worship God, neither in this
mountains nor at Jerusalem;&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">but in every part of the world. But the Prophets
speak according to the state of things in their time, and always describe the
spiritual worship of God according to the types of the law. To ascend then into
Jerusalem amounts to the same thing as to embrace true religion and cordially to
engage in the worship of the only true God, such as has been prescribed in his
word. The meaning then is, &#8212; that all who despised the God of Israel would
be accursed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then what follows is mentioned by the Prophet as a
part for the whole; he declares that there would be no rain on the despisers of
God; as though he had said, that they would perceive God&#8217;s vengeance, as
he would take away from them all the necessaries of life; for by rain the
Prophet means whatever is needful for the support of life. And we know that as
to the blessings of God needful for the present life, the chief thing is, when
he renders the heavens and the earth the servants as it were of his bounty to
us: for how can we be supplied with food, except the earth by his command open
its bowels and the heavens hear the earth, as it is said elsewhere,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;280221&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
2:21;) so that rain may irrigate it, and render it fruitful, which must be
otherwise barren?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand the design of the Prophet,
&#8212; that in order to invite all nations to the pure worship of God, he
declares that all who refused to serve the only true God would be accursed. He
further intended by this prophecy to animate the Jews, that they might firmly
proceed in the course of true religion until the coming of Christ, and never
doubt but that the God whom they worshipped would be the supreme king of the
whole world, though before hidden as it were in a corner of the world, while
worshipped in Judea alone. The Prophet then intimates that though God had been
despised by all nations, his name would yet be sanctified and adored; and also,
that if any deprived him of his legitimate worship they would be visited with
punishment, because they were destined to perish through famine and want,
inasmuch as the heavens would deny rain to them, and the earth would not give
them food.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Zechariah speaks expressly of the Egyptians: and
we indeed know that they were most inveterate enemies to true religion; and he
might have also mentioned the Assyrians and the Chaldeans; but as the Egyptians
were nearer and more contiguous to the holy land, their hatred towards the Jews
was more virulent. This is the reason why Zechariah speaks of them particularly.
It may at the same time appear strange that he threatens them with want of rain;
for we know that Egypt expects no rain from above, because of the peculiar
condition of the country; for according as the Nile overflows, do the
inhabitants look for a fruitful produce of corn and of all other things. The
Prophet then ought not to have thus threatened the Egyptians, for they might
have justly laughed at him for saying that there would be no rain for them, the
want of which is not much felt there. But the Prophet&#8217;s intention was
simply what I have already explained, &#8212; that God would be a Father to the
Jews, and also to others who joined in his worship according to the law. Though
then the Egyptians had no need of rain, yet by this metaphor Zechariah denounced
on them sterility as the punishment of impiety.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And we may further observe, that though the
overflowing of the Nile irrigated the whole land and made it fruitful, yet rain
was by no means useless; and it is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19A532&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
105:32, &#8220;He turned their rain into hail,&#8221; Egypt being the place
spoken of; for the Lord destroyed all its fruit, because the rain was turned
into hail. It appears also evident from history, that rain is desirable in Egypt
in order to render the produce more abundant. But the Lord has favored that
country with a peculiar benefit by supplying the want of rain by the
Nile.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is then nothing doubtful in the meaning of the
Prophet, as his object was to show, that the Lord would constrain all people to
become obedient to true religion, not only those Jews who were far removed from
Judea, but even the Egyptians themselves, who had been always most alienated
from true and pure worship.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall be upon them the
plague</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He now speaks more generally; and what
he before specifically mentioned, he now declares in general terms, &#8212; that
God would execute vengeance and destroy and reduce to nothing all those who took
not on them the yoke, so as to worship him sincerely, together with the Jews,
according to what the law prescribes. He again repeats the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who ascended not into
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">; not that he intended to confine the
worship of God to ceremonies or rites under the law; but because it was
necessary, until Christ abrogated all the ancient rites, that the worship of God
should be thus described; nor could it then be separated from these external
exercises.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here it may be rightly inquired, why the Prophet
speaks specifically of the feast of tabernacles, since the passover was deemed
first among the festivals. The reason seems to me to have been this, &#8212;
because it was difficult to believe that the Jews would return to their own
country, that God would become again their redeemer. Many interpreters say, that
the Prophet speaks of the feast of tabernacles, because it behaved them to be
sojourners in the world: but a similar reason might be given for other days. We
must then inquire why he mentions the feast of tabernacles and not other feasts.
Now we know that when the Prophets speak of the second restoration of the
people, they often call attention to that wonderful deliverance from Egypt by
which God had proved that he possessed sufficient power to redeem and save his
own people. To this instance does Zechariah now allude, as I think, and says,
that God would restore his people by his wonderful and inexpressibly great
power, so that they might justly celebrate the feast of tabernacles as their
fathers formerly did: for we know why God commanded the Jews to dwell every year
under the branches of trees; it was, that they might be mindful of that
deliverance which had been granted to their fathers; for they had continued
forty years in the desert, where they had no buildings, but huts only, made of
branches of trees. When therefore they went forth from their houses, and dwelt
as it were in the open air in tents, they thus revived the memory of the
wonderful manner by which their fathers were delivered. Hence God, in order to

<div><font face="Palatino">He repeats the same thing, and almost in the same
words; but yet it is not done without reason: for we ought to consider how
difficult it was to believe what is said, as the Jews who had returned to their
country were few in number, and unwarlike, and on every side opposed by their
enemies. Since then the Church was almost every moment in danger, it was no
wonder that the faithful had need of being strengthened under their trials,
which often disturbed and harassed their minds. This then is the reason why the
Prophet repeats often the same thing.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tafj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chethat</i>, properly means wickedness, sin; but as <i>piaculum</i> in Latin
sometimes means sin, and sometimes expiation, so
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tafj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chethat</i>, in Hebrew: it signifies at one time sin, at another the
sacrifice by which sin is atoned: and hence Christ is said to have been made
sin; for when he offered himself as an expiation, he sustained the curse which
belonged to us all, by having it transferred on himself
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480313&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:13.) As Christ then was an expiation, he was on this account called sin. And
the Greek translators did not change the name, because they saw that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tafj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chethat</i>, in Hebrew, is taken for a sacrifice or punishment as well as for
sin; hence they used the word hamartia indiscriminately.

they despise the God of Israel and condemn his worship, such a contumacy shall
not be unpunished; for God will show himself to be the vindicator of his own

than that God should reveal himself to us, so that we may not presumptuously
wander after superstitions, but purely worship him; for no one rightly worships
God, except he who is taught by his word. It is then a singular favor, when the
Lord prescribes to us the rule by which we may rightly worship him: but when we
assent not to his true and legitimate worship, we here see that our whole life
is accursed. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Zechariah teaches us in this verse, that God would
become the king of the world, so that all things would be applied to his
service, and that nothing would be so profane as not to change its nature, so as
to be sanctified for the service of God. This is the import of the whole. There
is some obscurity in the words; but interpreters for the most part have been led
astray, because they have not sufficiently attended to the design of the
Prophet; and thus they have wrested the words to their own views, while they did
not understand the subject.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There will
be</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an inscription on the shades

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of horses, Holiness to
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. No interpreters have perceived that
there is here an implied comparison between the mitre of the high priest and all
profane things; for since the high priest was a type of Christ, there was
inscribed on his tiara, Holiness to Jehovah,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwhyl
&ccedil;dq</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>kodash la-Ieve</i>, and as the
holiness of the temple, and of everything belonging to the service under the
law, depended on the priesthood, this inscription must be viewed as extending to
everything in the temple, to the altar, to the sanctuary, to the sacrifices, to
the offerings, to the candlestick, to the incense, and in short, to all sacred
things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What now does the Prophet mean? There shall be, he
says, that inscription which the high priest bears on his head,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Holiness to
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">; there shall be, he says, this
inscription </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on the stables of the

<div><font face="Palatino">As to the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twlxm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>metsalut</i>, it is only found here. Some derive it from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lwx</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tsul</i>, and others from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">elx</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tsale</i>; but the more received opinion is that it comes from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">llx</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tsalal</i>, in which the
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lamed</i>, is doubled. And some render it trappings; others, reins; others,
bells; and all only conjecture, for there is no certainty. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm192</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some
also render it the deep; and this sense may be also suitable. But what I have
already stated seems to me more probable &#8212; that the shades or blinkers of
horses are meant, and are here metaphorically called stables. Though then the
stable of a horse is a mean and sordid place, and often filthy, yet the Prophet
says that it would become holy to the Lord.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning then is, that no place was so profane
which would not be made holy when God reigned through the whole world. But if
any one prefers trappings, or warlike harness, I do not object; for this view
also is not unsuitable. Nothing is less holy than to shed human blood; and hence
the Scripture says, that their hands are polluted who justly slay an enemy in
war; not because slaughter is of itself sinful, but because the Lord intended to
strike men with terror, that they might not rashly commit slaughter. It would
not then ill suit this place to say, that the Lord would make holy the trappings
of horses, so that nothing disorderly would hereafter be done in war, but that
every one putting on arms would acknowledge God to be a judge in heaven, and
would not dare, without a just cause, to engage with his enemy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Ridiculous and puerile is what Theodore says in the
first book of his Ecclesiastical history. He quotes this passage, and says that
it was fulfilled when Helena, the mother of Constantine, adorned the trappings
of a horse with a nail of the cross; for her purpose was to give this to her son
as a sort of charm. One of those nails by which she thought Christ was
crucified, she put in the royal diadem; of the other she caused the bit of a
bridle to be made, or according to Eusebius, to be partly made; but Theodore
says that the whole was made of it. These are indeed rank trifles; but yet I
thought proper to refer to them, that you might know how foolish that age was.
Jerome indeed rejects the fable; but as it was believed by many, we see how
shamefully deluded at that time were many of those who were accounted the
luminaries of the Church. I now return to the words of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, that upon the stables, or upon the trappings
of the horses, there would be this inscription &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Holiness to Jehovah
</i></font><font face="Palatino">&#8212;
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwhyl
&ccedil;dq</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>kodash la-Ieve</i>: then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All the pots in the house of
Jehovah shall be as the vessels before the
altar</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, whatever was before only
applied to profane uses, would be invested with holiness. I then give this
interpretation &#8212; that pots or kettles would be like the vessels of the
altar, as the whole apparatus for cooking would be converted to the service of
God; as though he had said that there would be no profane luxuries, as before,
but that common food would be made holy, inasmuch as men themselves would become
holy to the Lord, and would be holy in their whole life and in all their
actions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But most go astray in supposing that the trappings
would be made into pots; for the Prophet meant another things that holiness
would exist among men in peace as well as in war, so that whether they carried
on war, or rested at home, whether they ate or drank, they would still offer a
pure sacrifice to God, both in eating and drinking, and even in warfare. Such
then is the view we ought to take of the Prophet&#8217;s words &#8212; that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all the pots in the house of
Jehovah shall be like the vessels before the
altar</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, &#8220;whatever has hitherto
been profaned by the intemperance and luxuries of men, shall hereafter become
holy, and be like the vessels of the temple itself.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jerome philosophises here with great acuteness, as
the Prophet intimated that the sacrifices offered under the law would be of no
account, because God would no longer require the fat of beasts, nor any of the
ritual observations, but would desire only prayers, which are the sacrifices
approved by him; and hence he renders
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yqrzm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mesarekim</i>, bowls, and not vessels, a word of wider meaning; but it
signifies the latter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see that what Zechariah meant was this &#8212;
that God would so claim the whole world as his own, as to consecrate men and all
their possessions wholly to his own service, so that there would be no longer
any uncleanness, that whether they ate or drank, or engaged in war, or undertook
any other work, all things would be pure and holy, for God would always be
before their eyes. Let us proceed -</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet explains here more clearly what we have
already considered &#8212; that such would be the reverence for God, and the
fear of him through the whole world, that whatever men undertook would be a
sacrifice to him: he therefore says, that all the kettles, or pots, or vessels,
would be sacred to God. And this is fulfilled when men regard this end &#8212;
to glorify God through their whole life, as Paul exhorts us to do.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461031&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:31.) Our provisions and our beds, and all other things, become
then holy to God, when we really devote ourselves to him, and regard in all the
actions of our life the end which I have mentioned, even to testify in truth
that he is our God, and that we are under his guidance. By such comparisons then
does Zechariah teach us, that men will be sacred to God; for nothing they touch
shall be unclean, but what was before profane shall be sanctified to his glory. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fm193</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall they who
sacrifice, and shall boil flesh in pots</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as
though he had said, That such would be the multitude of men who would ascend to
offer sacrifices to God, that the vessels of the temple before in use would not
be sufficient. It would hence be necessary to apply for that purpose what was
previously profane. The language of Isaiah is similar, for he says that they who
were Levites would become priests of the first order, and that those of the
common people would become Levites, so that they might all come nigh to God.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;236620&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
66:20,21.) The meaning then of the Prophet is now clear &#8212; that he wished
to stir up the Jews to constancy and firmness, who regarded their small number
as their reproach and were almost disheartened: as then they thought that they
had in vain returned to their own country, as the Lord did not gather the whole
people, he says that God&#8217;s worship would become more celebrated than at
the time when the state of things was most flourishing in Judea; for assemble
they would, from the whole world, to offer sacrifices to God at Jerusalem, so
that the whole city, with all its utensils, would be sacred to God, for the pots
and the sacred vessels of the temple, used before under the law, would not be
sufficient.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And there shall be no Canaanite
in the land</i></font><font face="Palatino">: the meaning is, that the Church
would become pure from all defilements: and this change ought to have given no
small comfort to the Jews in their sad and calamitous state; for God had used no
small severity, when all were driven into exile; and many tokens of this
dreadful rigour still remained, since very few worshipped God, and were despised
by all, so that true religion was exposed to the contempt and ridicule of all
nations. This compensation then, that the Lord would by this remedy cleanse his
Church from its filth, must have greatly allayed their sorrow: on this subject I
have already said much.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Zechariah now briefly promises that the Church would
become pure, so that all would from the heart and sincerely worship God, and
that there would be no mixture of hypocrites to pollute the temple and holy
things. But this seems strange, since the Church has ever been contaminated by
many pollutions: and hence John the Baptist compares it to a floor, where the
chaff is mixed with the wheat; and it is also compared to a net, into which are
gathered many fishes, some good and some bad; and also at this day, in the
kingdom of Christ, the Church is subject to this evils that it cannot cast out
all corruptions: it seems then that the Prophet has spoken hyperbolically. But
what we have elsewhere said ought to be borne in mind &#8212; that a comparison
is made between the ancient state of the people and their second state, when the
Church was renewed. As the religion had been in the most disgraceful manner
corrupted, and as the Jews had impudently boasted that they were the holy people
of God, while they were the most wicked of men, the Prophet justly says, that
the Church when renewed would be purer; for the Lord would cleanse it by the
cross, as gold and silver are cleansed, which are not only tried by the fire,
but become also brighter, because the dross is removed. This is simply what the
Prophet means when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that
there will be no Canaanite </i></font><font face="Palatino">among the people of
God; that is, there will be no foreign or profane men, mingled with the
faithful, to pollute the pure worship of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some have wrested the passage and applied it to the
last coming of Christ. But this is inconsistent with the subject in hand. At the
same time I allow that the kingdom of Christ, according to the prophetic mode of
writing, is here described from its commencement to its end. When God therefore
purposed to renew his Church, he cleansed it from much filth, and still daily
cleanses it, nor will he cease to do so, until, after all the defilements of the
world having been removed, we shall be received into the celestial kingdom.
Whenever then the Prophets speak of perfection under the reign of Christ, we
ought not to confine what they say to one day or to a short time, but we ought
to include the whole time from the beginning to the end. Hence when Christ
appeared in the world, then began to shine the splendor of which Zechariah now
speaks: but the Lord will go on until that shall be completed which now makes
continual progress.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some read,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall be a merchant no
more</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc.; and they have some reason for what
they say, for the word is sometimes rendered merchant: but as in this case, we
must have recourse to allegories, and take merchants for impious corrupters who
make a merchandise of God&#8217;s worship, or give this interpretation, that
there shall be no merchant any more, because all would freely bring their
offerings, &#8212; as these explanations are not appropriate, it is better to
take the passage simply as it is &#8212; that the Lord will gather his elect, so
that pure sacrifices will be offered by them all; and that there will be no
hypocrites any more to contaminate and corrupt the Church, or to adulterate the
worship of God.

ZECHARIAH</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">CALVIN&#8217;S PREFACE TO
MALACHI</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND SIXTY-NINTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE BOOK OF MALACHI follows, whom many have imagined
to have been an angel, on account of his name. We indeed know that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;alm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Melac</i>, in Hebrew is an Angel; but how absurd is such a supposition, it is
easy to see; for the Lord at that time did not send angels to reveal his
oracles, but adopted the ordinary ministry of men; and as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">y</font><font face="Palatino">,
is added at the end of the word, as it was usual in proper names, we may indeed
hence conclude that it was the name of a man; at the same time I freely allow
that it may have been added for some particular reason not known to us now. I am
more disposed to grant what some have said, that he was EZRA, and that MALACHI
was his surname, for God had called him to do great and remarkable
things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">However this may be, he was no doubt one of the
Prophets, and, as it appears, the last; for at the end of his Book he exhorts
the people to continue in their adherence to the pure doctrine of the Law: and
this he did, because God was not afterwards to send Prophets in succession as
before; for it was his purpose that the Jews should have a stronger desire for
Christ, they having been for a time without any Prophets. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn1</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It was
indeed either a token of God&#8217;s wrath, or a presage of Christ&#8217;s
coming, when they were deprived of that benefit which Moses mentions in
Deuteronomy 18; for God had then promised to send Prophets, that the Jews might
know that he cared for their safety. When therefore God left his people without
Prophets, it was either to show his great displeasure, as during the Babylonian
exile, or to hold them in suspense, that they might with stronger desire look
forward to the coming of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">However we may regard this, I have no doubt but he
was the last of the Prophets; for he bids the people to adhere to the doctrine
of the Law until Christ should be revealed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum and substance of the Book is, &#8212; that
though the Jews had but lately returned to their own country, they yet soon
returned to their own nature, became unmindful of God&#8217;s favor, and so gave
themselves up to many corruptions; that their state was nothing better than that
of their fathers before them, so that God had as it were lost all his labor in
chastising them. As then the Jews had again relapsed into many vices, our
Prophet severely reproves them, and upbraids them with ingratitude, because they
rendered to God their deliverer so shameful a recompense. He also mentions some
of their sins, that he might prove the people to be guilty, for he saw that they
were full of evasions. And he addresses the priests, who had by bad examples
corrupted the morals of the people, when yet their office required a very
different course of life; for the Lord had set them over the people to be
teachers of religion and of uprightness; but from them did emanate a great
portion of the vices of the age; and hence our Prophet the more severely
condemns them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He shows at the same time that God would remember his
gratuitous covenant, which he had made with their fathers, so that the Redeemer
would at length come. &#8212; This is the substance of the whole: I come now to
the words. &#8212;</font><br></div>

<i>mesha</i>, burden, as signifying prophecy, without exception, are mistaken,
as I have elsewhere reminded you; for prophecy is not everywhere called a
burden; and whenever this word is expressed, there is ever to be understood some
judgment of God; and it appears evident from
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242338&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
23:38, that this word was regarded as ominous, so that the ungodly, when they
wished to brand the Prophets with some mark of reproach, used this as a common
proverb, &#8220;It is a burden,&#8221; intimating thereby that nothing else was
brought by the Prophets but threatenings and terrors, in order that they might
have some excuse for closing their ears, and for evading all prophecies by
giving them an unhappy and ominous name.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As we proceed it will become evident that the
doctrine of Malachi is not without reason called a Burden; for as I have stated
in part, and as it will be more fully seen hereafter, it was necessary that the
people should be summoned before God&#8217;s tribunal, inasmuch as many sins had
again begun to prevail among them, and such as could not be endured: and for
this reason he says that God&#8217;s judgment was at hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But under the name of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">
he refers only to those who had returned to their own country, whether they were
of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin, or of the tribe of Levi. It is nevertheless
probable that there were also some mixed with them from the other tribes: but
the Jews and their neighbors, the half tribe of Benjamin, had almost alone
returned to their country, with the exception of the Levites, who had been their
guides in their journey, and encouraged the rest of the people. They were yet
called Israel indiscriminately, since among them only pure religion continued:
but they who remained dispersed among foreign and heathen nations, had as it
were lost their name, though they had not wholly departed from the pure worship
of God and true religion. Hence, by way of excellency, they were called Israel,
who had again assembled in the holy land, that they might there enjoy the
inheritance promised them from above.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hand</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
as we have observed elsewhere, means ministration. The meaning then is, that
this doctrine proceeded from God, but that a minister, even Malachi, was
employed as an instrument; so that he brought nothing as his own, but only
related faithfully what had been committed to him by God from whom it came. It
then follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I am constrained by the context to read all these
verses; for the sense cannot be otherwise completed. God expostulates here with
a perverse and an ungrateful people, because they doubly deprived him of his
right; for he was neither loved nor feared, though he had a just claim to the
name and honor of a master as well as that of a father. As then the Jews paid
him no reverence, he complains that he was defrauded of his right as a father;
and as they entertained no fear for him, he condemns them for not acknowledging,
him as their Lord and Master, by submitting to his authority. But before he
comes to this, he shows that he was both their Lord and Father; and he declares
that he was especially their Father, because he loved them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand the Prophet&#8217;s intention;
for God designed to show here how debased the Jews were, as they acknowledged
him neither as their Father nor as their Lord; they neither reverenced him as
their Lord, nor regarded him as their Father. But he brings forward, as I have
already said, his benefits, by which he proves that he deserved the honor due to
a father and to a master.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I loved
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God might indeed have made an appeal to
the Jews on another ground; for had he not manifested his love to them, they
were yet bound to submit to his authority. He does not indeed speak here of
God&#8217;s love generally, such as he shows to the whole human race; but he
condemns the Jews, inasmuch as having been freely adopted by God as his holy and
peculiar people, they yet forgot this honor, and despised the Giver, and
regarded what he taught them as nothing. When therefore God says that he loved
the Jews, we see that his object was to convict them of ingratitude for having
despised the singular favor bestowed on them alone, rather than to press that
authority which he possesses over all mankind in common. God then might have
thus addressed them, &#8220;I have created you, and have been to you a kind
Father; by my favor does the sun shine on you daily, and the earth produces its
fruit; in a word, I hold you bound to me by innumerable benefits.&#8221; God
might have thus spoken to them; but as I have said, his object was to bring
forward the gratuitous adoption with which he had favored the seed of Abraham;
for it was a less endurable impiety, that they had despised so incomparable a
favor; inasmuch as God had preferred them to all other nations, not on the
ground of merit or of any worthiness, but because it had so pleased him. This
then is the reason why the Prophet begins by saying, that the Jews had been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>loved</i></font><font face="Palatino">
by God: for they had made the worst return for this gratuitous favor, when they
despised his doctrine. This is the first thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is further no doubt but that he indirectly
condemns their ingratitude when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In what hast thou loved us?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">The words indeed may be thus explained &#8212;
&#8220;If ye say, or if ye ask, In what have I loved you? Even in this &#8212; I
preferred your father Jacob to Esau, when yet they were twin brothers.&#8221;
But we shall see in other places that the Jews by evasions malignantly obscured
God&#8217;s favor, and that this wickedness is in similar words condemned. Hence
the Prophet, seeing that he had to do with debased men, who would not easily
yield to God nor acknowledge his kindness by a free and ingenuous confession,
introduces them here as speaking thus clamorously, &#8220;He! when hast thou
loved us! in what! the tokens of thy love do not appear.&#8221; He answers in
God&#8217;s name, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Esau was
Jacob&#8217;s brother; and yet I loved Jacob, and Esau I
hated</i></font><font face="Palatino">.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see what I have just referred to, &#8212; that
the Jews are reminded of God&#8217;s gratuitous covenant, that they might cease
to excuse their wickedness in having misused this singular favor. He does not
then upbraid them here, because they had been as other men created by God,
because God caused his sun to shine on them, because they were supplied with
food from the earth; but he says, that they had been preferred to other people,
not on account of their own merit, but because it had pleased God to choose
their father Jacob. He might have here adduced Abraham as an example; but as
Jacob and Esau proceeded from Abraham, with whom God had made the covenant, his
favor was the more remarkable, inasmuch as though Abraham had been alone chosen
by God, and other nations were passed by, yet from the very family which the
Lord had adopted, one had been chosen while the other was rejected. When a
comparison is made between Esau and Jacob, we must bear in mind that they were
brothers; but there are other circumstances to be noticed, which though not
expressed here by the Prophet, are yet well known: for all the Jews knew that
Esau was the first-born; and that hence Jacob had obtained the right of
primogeniture contrary to the order of nature. As then this was commonly known,
the Prophet was content to use only this one sentence,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Esau was Jacob&#8217;s
brother</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says that Jacob was chosen by God, and that
his brother, the first-born, was rejected. If the reason be asked, it is not to
be found in their descent, for they were twin brothers; and they had not come
forth from the womb when the Lord by an oracle testified that Jacob would be the
greater. We hence see that the origin of all the excellency which belonged to
the posterity of Abraham, is here ascribed to the gratuitous love of God,
according to what Moses often said, &#8220; Not because ye excelled other
nations, or were more in number, has God honored you with so many benefits; but
because he loved your fathers.&#8221; The Jews then had always been reminded,
that they were not to seek for the cause of their adoption but in the gratuitous
favor of God; he had been pleased to choose them &#8212; this was the source of
their salvation. We now understand the Prophet&#8217;s design when he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Esau was Jacob&#8217;s
brother</i></font><font face="Palatino">, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn2</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and yet
was not loved by God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must at the same time bear in mind what I have
already said &#8212; that this singular favor of God towards the children of
Jacob is referred to, in order to make them ashamed of their ingratitude,
inasmuch as God had set his love on objects so unworthy. For had they been
deserving, they might have boasted that a reward was rendered to them; but as
the Lord had gratuitously and of his own good pleasure conferred this benefit on
them, their impiety was the less excusable. This baseness then is what our
Prophet now reprobates.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then follows a proof of hatred as to Esau, the Lord
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made his mountain a desolation,
and his inheritance a desert where serpents
dwelt</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Esau, we know, when driven away by his
own shame, or by his father&#8217;s displeasure, came to Mount Seir; and the
whole region where his posterity dwelt was rough and enclosed by many mountains.
But were any to object and say, that this was no remarkable token of hatred, as
it might on the other hand be said, that the love of God towards Jacob was not
much shown, because he dwelt in the land of Canaan, since the Chaldeans
inhabited a country more pleasant and more fruitful, and the Egyptians also were
very wealthy; to this the answer is &#8212; that the land of Canaan was a symbol
of God&#8217;s love, not only on account of its fruitfulness, but because the
Lord had consecrated it to himself and to his chosen people. So Jerusalem was
not superior to other cities of the land, either to Samaria or Bethlehem, or
other towns, on account of its situation, for it stood, as it is well known, in
a hilly country, and it had only the spring of Siloam, fiom which flowed a small
stream; and the view was not so beautiful, nor its fertility great; at the same
time it excelled in other things. for God had chosen it as his sanctuary; and
the same must be said of the whole land. As then the land of Canaan was, as it
were, a pledge of an eternal inheritance to the children of Abraham, the
scripture on this account greatly extols it, and speaks of it in magnificent
terms. If Mount Seir was very wealthy and replenished with everything
delightful, it must have been still a sad exile to the Idumeans, because it was
a token of their reprobation; for Esau, when he left his father&#8217;s house,
went there; and he became as it were an alien, having deprived himself of the
celestial inheritance, as he had sold his birthright to his brother Jacob. This
is the reason why God declares here that Esau was dismissed as it were to the
mountains, and deprived of the Holy Land which God had destined to his chosen
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet also adds another thing, &#8212; that
God&#8217;s hatred as manifested when the posterity of Esau became extinct. For
though the Assyrians and Chaldeans had no less cruelly raged against the Jews
than against the Edomites, yet the issue was very different; for after seventy
years the Jews returned to their own country, as Jeremiah had promised: yet
Idumea was not to be restored, but the tokens of God&#8217;s dreadful wrath had
ever appeared there in its sad desolations. Since then there had been no
restoration as to Idumea, the Prophet shows that by this fact the love of God
towards Jacob and his hatred towards Esau had been proved; for it had not been
through the contrivance of men that the Jews had liberty given them, and that
they were allowed to build the temple; but because God had chosen them in the
person of Jacob, and designed them to be a peculiar and holy people to
himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as to the Edomites, it became then only more
evident that they had been rejected in the person of Esau, since being once laid
waste they saw that they were doomed to perpetual destruction. This is then the
import of the Prophet&#8217;s words when he says, that the possession of Esau
had been given to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>serpents</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
For, as I have already said, though for a time the condition of Judea and of
Idumea had not been unlike, yet when Jerusalem began to rise and to be repaired,
then God clearly showed that that land had not been in vain given to his chosen
people. But when the neighboring country was not restored, while yet the
posterity of Esau might with less suspicion have repaired their houses, it
became hence sufficiently evident that the curse of God was upon
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And to the same purpose he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If Edom shall say, We have been
diminished, but we shall return and build houses; but if they build, I will pull
down, saith God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He confirms what I have
stated, that the posterity of Edom had no hope of restoration, for however they
might gather courage and diligently labor in rebuilding their cities, they were
not yet to succeed, for God would pull down all their buildings. This difference
then was like a living representation, by which the Jews might see the love of
God towards Jacob, and his hatred towards Esau. For since both people were
overthrown by the same enemy, how was it that liberty was given to the Jews and
no permission was given to the Idumeans to return to their own country? There
was, as it has been said, a greater ill-will to the Jews, and yet the Chaldeans
dealt with them more kindly. It then follows, that all this was owing to the
wonderful purpose of God, and that hence it also appeared, that the adoption,
which seemed to have been abolished when the Jews were driven into exile, was
not in vain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then saith </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah of hosts, They
shall build</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, though they may build,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will overthrow; and it shall be
said to them, Border of ungodliness, and a people with whom Jehovah is angry for
ever</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By the border of ungodliness he means an
accursed border; as though he had said, &#8220;It will openly appear that you
are reprobate, so that the whole world can form a judgment by the event
itself.&#8221; By adding, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A
people with whom Jehovah is angry </i></font><font face="Palatino">or
displeased, he again confirms what I have said of love and hatred. God might
indeed have been equally angry with the Jews as with the Edomites, but when God
became pacified towards the Jews, while he continued inexorable to the posterity
of Esau, the difference between the two people was hence quite
manifest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Noticed also must be the words,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;lw[Ad[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>od-oulam</i>, for ever: for God seemed for a time to have rejected the Jews,
and the Prophets adopt the same word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;[z</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>som</i>, angry, when they deplore the condition of the peep]e, who found in
various ways that God was angry with them. But the wrath of God towards the Jews
was only for a time, for he did not wholly forget his covenant; but he became
angry with the Edomites for ever, because their father had been rejected: and we
know that this difference between the elect and the reprobate is ever pointed
out, that when God visits sins in common, he ever moderates his wrath towards
his elect, and sets limits to his severity, according to what he says, &#8220;If
his posterity keep not my covenant, but profane my law, I will chastise them
with the rod of man; but my mercy will I not take away from him.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198931&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
89:31-33
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;100714&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 7:14.) But with regard to the reprobate, God&#8217;s vengeance ever
pursues them, is ever suspended over their heads, and ever fixed as it were in
their bones and marrow. For this reason it is that our Prophet says, that God
would be angry with the posterity of Esau.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Your eyes shall
see</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Jews had already begun in part to
witness this spectacle, but the Prophet speaks here of what was to continue.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>See</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall your
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, &#8220;As it has already
appeared of what avail gratuitous election has been to you, by which I have
chosen you as my people, and as ye have also seen on the other hand how it has
been with your relations the Edomites, because they had been rejected in the
person of their father Esau; so also this same difference shall ever be evident
to you in their posterity:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>see</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall your
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye shall say, Magnified let
Jehovah be over the border of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is,
&#8220;The event itself will extort this confession, &#8212; that I greatly
enhance my goodness towards you.&#8221; For though tokens of God&#8217;s grace
shone forth everywhere, and the earth, as the Psalmist says, is full of his
goodness,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19A424&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
104:24;) yet there was in Judea something special, so that.our Prophet does not
in vain say, that there would be always reasons for the Jews to celebrate
God&#8217;s praises on account of his bounty to them more than to the rest of
the world. And the Prophet no doubt reproves here indirectly the wickedness of
the people, as though he had said, &#8212; &#8220;Ye indeed, as far as you can,
bury God&#8217;s benefits, or at least extenuate them; but facts themselves must
draw from you this confession &#8212; that God deals bountifully with the border
of Israel, that he exercises there his favor more remarkably than among any of
the nations.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">After having briefly referred to those benefits which
ought to have filled the Jews with shame, he comes at length to the subject he
had in view; for his main object, as I have already stated, was to show, that it
was God&#8217;s complaint that he was deprived of his own right and in a double
sense, for the Jews did not reverence him as their Father, nor fear him as their
Lord. He might indeed have called himself Lord and Father by the right of
creation; but he preferred, as I have already explained, to appeal to their
adoption; for it was a remarkable favor, when the Lord chose some out of all the
human race; and we cannot say that the cause of this was to be found in men.
Whom then he designs to choose, he binds to himself by a holier bond. But if
they disappoint him, wholly inexcusable is their perfidy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As we now understand the Prophet&#8217;s meaning, and
the object of this expostulation, it remains for us to learn how to accommodate
what is taught to ourselves. We are not indeed descended fronm Abraham or from
Jacob according to the flesh; but as God has engraved on us certain marks of his
adoption, by which he has distinguished us from other nations, while we were yet
nothing better, we hence see that we are justly exposed to the same reproof with
the Jews, if we do not respond to the calling of God. I wished thus briefly to
touch on this point, in order that we may know that this doctrine is no less
useful to us at this day than it was to the Jews; for though the adoption is not
exactly the same, as it then belonged to one seed and to one family, yet we are
not superior to others through our own worthiness, but because God has
gratuitously chosen us as a people to himself. Since this has been the case, we
are his; for he has redeemed us by the blood of his own Son, and by rendering us
partakers, by the gospel, of a favor so ineffably great, he has made us his sons
and his servants. Except then we love and reverence him as our Father, and
except we fear him as our Lord, there is found in us at this day an ingratitude
no less base than in that ancient people. But as I wished now only to refer to
the chief point, I shall speak tomorrow, as the passage requires, on the subject
of election: but it was necessary first briefly to show the Prophet&#8217;s
design, as I have done; and then to treat particular points more at large, as
the case may require.</font><br></div>

us, so that having put off all the filth of the flesh, we may be transformed
into that ineffable glory, of which we have now the image in thine
only-begotten, Son. &#8212; Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND SEVENTIETH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE saw yesterday what the object of Malachi was in
reminding the Jews that they were loved and chosen by God; it was, that he might
the more amplify their ingratitude for having rendered such an unworthy reward
for so great a favor of God: as he had preferred them to all other nations, he
had justly bound them to perpetual obedience; but they had shaken off the yoke,
and having despised God had given themselves up again to many corruptions, as we
have yesterday stated. But I reminded you at the same time, that the Prophet
refers not here to those benefits with which God favors indiscriminately all
mankind, but brings forward the adoption by which he had set apart the seed of
Abraham as his peculiar people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But that it may appear more fully how just this
expostulation was, let us first observe, that it is one kind of obligation that
God has created us men in his image and after his likeness; for he might have
created us dogs and asses, and not men. Adam, we know, was taken from the earth,
as other animals were: then as to the body there is no difference between men
and other creatures. When it is said that God breathed into man the breath of
life, we ought not to dream as the Manicheans do, that man&#8217;s soul is by
traduction; for so they say, affirming that man&#8217;s soul is from the
substance of the Deity; but Moses on the contrary understands that man&#8217;s
soul was created from nothing. We are born by generation, and yet our origin is
clay; and the chief thing in us, the soul, is created from nothing. We hence see
that we differ from animals because God was pleased to create us men. He
therefore will justly charge us with ingratitude, if we do not serve him; for it
was for this end he created us in his own image.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there is here mentioned a special favor &#8212;
that the Lord took to himself the seed of Abraham, as it is said in the song of
Moses, that all nations are God&#8217;s, but that he had cast his line to set
apart Israel for himself.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:9.) Though then the whole world was under God&#8217;s government, it was yet
his will to choose one family. If the cause be enquired, it is not to be found
in men; for all were created from the earth, and souls were implanted in their
bodies created from nothing. Since it was so, we see that the difference arose
from the fountain of gratuitous favor &#8212; that God preferred one race to the
rest; and as we stated yesterday, Moses often repeats this &#8212; that the Jews
were not chosen because they were more excellent than other nations, but because
God gratuitously loved their fathers.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;050707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
7:7.) By love he means gratuitous favor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Malachi then does not consider here that the Jews had
been chosen before other nations on the ground of their own merit; for if he
granted this, they might have objected and said &#8212; &#8220;Why dost thou
remind us that God has favored us more than other nations, since he deemed us
worthy, and rewarded our merit?&#8221; But the Prophet takes it as admitted,
according to what I have already said, that the Jews were by nature like other
nations, so that their different condition did not proceed from themselves, or
from their own worthiness, but from the gratuitous love of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A third step is also to be noticed here; for God
selected a part only from the very race of Abraham, as Esau and Jacob were
brothers, and Esau was first according to the order of nature, for he was the
first-born; and yet God rejected him, and appointed the favor of election to be
in the posterity of Jacob. This third step then was election.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These things ought to be carefully considered. Men
are peculiarly bound to God, because he might have created them asses and dogs,
and not men; but it has pleased him to form them in his own image. The second
step is, that he chose the race of Abraham, when his empire extended over all
nations without exception: for how was it that God chose to be the father and
savior of one people only, when the whole world was under his authority? Here
shines forth, as I have already said, his gratuitous favor; and in addition to
the testimonies of Moses, it is often said in the Psalms that God loved the
fathers, that he did to them what he had not done to other nations, that he made
known his judgments to them.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19E719&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
147:19.) There are many passages in which God commemorates his favor to the
Jews, because it pleased him to distinguish them from other nations, while yet
the condition of all by nature was wholly the same. Now the third step which
Malachi mentions ought to be carefully noticed &#8212; that God not only
promised to be a God to Abraham and to his seed, but also made a difference
between the very sons of Abraham, so as to reject some and to choose others; and
it is on this point that Paul dwells in the ninth chapter to the Romans;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:1-33 for he says, that not all who are of Israel-that is, who derive their
origin from him &#8212; are true and legitimate Israelites, but those who are
called. For it was Paul&#8217;s object to refute the Jews, for they boasted that
they were a holy people, though they wilfully rejected Christ and his gospel.
For when the apostles proved that the Redeemer promised had been sent, the proud
answer in the mouth of the Jews was this &#8212; &#8220;Are not we the Church of
God? but we do not acknowledge this Christ whom ye would thrust upon us.&#8221;
As then the Jews, through this false pretense, despised the favor of God, and
sought to trample Christ as it were under foot, Paul repels this arrogance, and
shows that they excelled not the nations, except by virtue of a gratuitous
adoption, and that this adoption was to be so extended to the whole race of
Abraham as yet to be confined to a certain number.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the same manner do the Papists act in the present
day. As they estimate faith by external tokens, they haughtily object to us, and
say that they are the Church; as though a general promise were sufficient
without the Spirit, who is justly called the Spirit of adoption, by whom God
seals it within, even in our hearts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now Paul adds evidences of the fact, and brings
forward the instance of Jacob and Esau. Of the twin brothers, one, he says, was
chosen, and the other passed by; and yet both were the sons of Abraham. It then
follows that there is a third step in election, as I have already stated. Now
from this third proceeds a fourth &#8212; that God takes some of the sons of
Jacob, whom he has chosen before the foundation of the world, and others he
rejects; and of this fact Paul adduces a sure proof, or assigns an evident
reason: God preferred Jacob to his brother, the first-born, but not on account
of any merit: if then the free mercy of God availed so much in the election of
Jacob, it follows that the same still prevails with regard to his posterity. If
it be again asked, whence comes it that some are faithful and others are
reprobate, the answer is, because it so pleases God. Hence Paul ascends higher
and says, that before they were born, and had done neither good nor evil, it was
said, the elder shall serve the younger; and then he brings forward this
prophecy-Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If then we wisely consider the whole passage, we
shall find what I have stated &#8212; that from the third step we may proceed to
a fourth, and that is, that from the sons of Jacob God chose whom he pleased and
rejected others; for when he chose Jacob, God was not bound to him any more than
he was before. The same promise was indeed repeated to Jacob, which had been
given to Abraham; but from Abraham proceeded Ishmael, who was rejected, we know,
from God&#8217;s Church; and the same was the case with the other sons of
Abraham. Isaac was alone chosen. But Isaac, the father of Esau and Jacob, was
not able at his own pleasure to retain them both; but here the free and hidden
election of God appeared, so that Esau was rejected, and Jacob remained as the
legitimate heir to the divine favor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then more fully understand what the Prophet
means: he does not charge the Jews with having shaken off every fear of that
God, in whose image they had been created; but he enhances their ingratitude,
because they gave no response to the free adoption of God, for they had been
chosen from all other nations, and not only this, but they had been separated
again from the very race of Abraham, and this was their second election. Another
thing must also be added respecting their gratuitous election; for the reproof
of the Prophet would not have been received, except God in his adoption had
regard only to his own favor; for if we grant that either Jacob or Abraham had
merited anything, what the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Was not Esau Jacob&#8217;s
brother?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> would not have availed. An answer
might have been readily given, &#8220;He was indeed his brother, but his virtue
being meritorious set him before his brother.&#8221; But the Prophet here
presses this point on the Jews &#8212; that having been bound by so many
benefits, they yet were become as it were spurious; for they had degenerated
from the favor which God had conferred on them. We hence see that by these words
of the Prophet it is sufficiently proved &#8212; that Abraham had been chosen by
God in preference to all other nations, Isaac in preference to his brother
Ishmael, and Jacob in preference to Esau.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And Scripture is full of proofs on the subject, and
experience also sufficiently demonstrates the truth. Moses says, that it was not
by their own virtue that they excelled other nations, for they were a rebellious
and a stiff-necked people. Though God then knew the perverse character of that
nation, it yet pleased him to make them an example of his wonderful goodness.
There is therefore no reason for us to seek any other cause for adoption except
the will of God. And since the election of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob was
gratuitous, it follows that each one is freely chosen whom God separates from
the whole body; and thus we come to the fourth step; for what is said here, that
Jacob was chosen, ought not to be confined to his person, but what he had in
common with his posterity. Jacob then was chosen &#8212; for what purpose? that
his children might be God&#8217;s holy and peculiar people. Now if we consider
his whole offspring, we shall find that all who descended from Jacob were not
legitimate Israelites, for the greatest part of them were rejected. As then many
who derived their origin from Jacob, were not less reprobate than Esau, it
follows that God&#8217;s free favor and gratuitous mercy prevails as to
individuals: and this is the subject which Paul discusses in the ninth chapter
to the Romans.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It seems hard to many, that God should choose some
and not all, and that he should regard no worthiness, but of his own free will
choose whom he pleases, and reject others. But whence comes this objection,
except that they wish to restrain God and subject him to their own judgment? But
we must come to the principle to which I have referred. If it seems unreasonable
to them that one of two should be chosen and the other rejected, how can they
defend the justice of God (if need there be of their apology) with regard to an
ass and man? for as I have said, they both proceeded, both asses and men, from
the same lump as to their bodies. Every vigor and strength in the ass has been
created by the hidden power of God: and as to the soul of man, though its
essence is immortal, it has yet been created from nothing. Now, then, let these
wise censors answer for God in this case, whom they think to be exposed to many
calumnies, when we say that men&#8217;s salvation depends on his will, so that
he rejects some and chooses others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as to general election, there is the same
difficulty to satisfy the judgment of men: for as we have already said, there is
no difference between men but what arises from hidden election. They indeed
imagine in this case a foreknowledge as the mother of election: but the notion
is extremely foolish and puerile. They then say, that some are elected by God
and some are rejected, because God, to whom nothing is hid, foresees what every
one will be. But I now ask, Whence is it that one is virtuous, while another is
vicious? If they say, from free-will, doubtless creation is anterior to
free-will: this is one thing. Then we know that in Adam all men were created
alike; for how is it that we are all exposed to eternal death, and that the
vengeance of God extends over us all, and at this day prevails through the whole
world? How is this, except that the condition of us all originally is one and
the same? It follows then, that if Adam stood upright, all men would be alike in
their integrity. I do not now speak of special gifts: for there would have been,
I allow, a difference of endowments had nature remained perfect; but as to
eternal life the condition of all would have been the same. Now after the fall
of Adam we are all lost. What can then be more foolish and absurd than to
imagine that there is some virtue in man by which he excels others, since we are
all equally accursed in the person of Adam? For who hath made thee to excel,
saith Paul? He proves that there is no excellency in man, except what proceeds
from the bounty of God only, and as I have stated, the reason is quite
manifest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For either original sin does not belong to all men,
or God cannot foresee that this man will be just and that man unjust. Why? All
are naturally reprobate in Adam and liable to eternal death, and the reason is
evident, for nothing is found in men but sin. The foreknowledge of God then
cannot be the cause of our election, for by looking on the whole race of man, he
finds them all under a curse from the least to the greatest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see then how foolishly do they talk and prattle
who ascribe to mere and naked prescience what ought to be ascribed to the good
pleasure of God. That God made himself known to the race of Abraham, that he
designed to deposit his law with the Israelites &#8212; all this was his
peculiar favor, and no other reason can be assigned for it except gratuitous
adoption. God then favored the children of Abraham with this privilege, because
it so pleased him: for if we say that they were worthy, and by their virtue
rendered themselves deserving, the Holy Spirit does in the first place
everywhere speak against us, and in the second place experience and facts, for
the obstinacy of that people was extraordinary. But we ought to be satisfied
with the authority of Scripture, since God makes known and illustrates his favor
by this instance &#8212; that he loved Abraham and his children, that is, that
he was favorable to the Jews through his own goodness only, and this is what we
shall hereafter see still more clearly. Let this then remain as a fixed
principle &#8212; that the cause of our election is nothing else but the mere
favor of God. If we seek a cause apart from God, when we enquire about our
election, we shall wander in a labyrinth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That the same principle holds as to individuals, I
have already proved. It ought indeed to be sufficient for us, that Paul passes
from the person of Jacob to individuals among his posterity. For he adduces as
it wet e an instance in the two brothers, in order to convince us that no one is
chosen on account of his own virtue, but according to the good pleasure of God:
nor was it necessary to state these circumstances &#8212; that one was chosen
when the brothers were not yet born, and when they had not done either good or
evils that it was not through works but through him who called, except he meant
to prove this, that it is in God&#8217;s power to choose whom he wills and to
reject whom he wills. But as Augustine reminds us, nothing can be imagined more
absurd than that notion, with which many are pleased, that God has foreknown
what men will be, for Paul excludes such foreknowledge as the cause which he
infers, that it was not owing to works but to him who called, that God preferred
the one to the other, for neither of them, while in their mother&#8217;s womb,
had done either good or evil.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul brings also a confirmation from another
declaration of Moses, &#8220;I will pity whom I will pity, and mercy will I show
to whom I will be merciful. &#8220;By these words God clearly declares that it
was in his power to reject whom he pleased of the seed of Jacob, and to choose
whom he pleased. What then he had before said respecting one man, God now
applies to the whole seed, for he speaks not there of foreign nations, but of
that holy and chosen people. When God threatened with ruin all the children of
Abraham, Moses humbly deprecated this, lest he should annul his own covenant:
God answered him, &#8220;I will pity whom I will pity,&#8221; &#8212; what does
this mean? that there is no other cause why God retains some for himself and
rejects others, than his own will. The repetition may seem superfluous and
frigid, &#8220;I will pity whom I will pity,&#8221; but it is very emphatical;
as though he had said, &#8220;I might have chosen for myself another from the
world and not Abraham, but I have according to my own good pleasure adopted him;
and Ishmael might have been as dear to me as Isaac, but it has been my will that
the blessing should rest on Isaac; when he also had begotten two children, I
repudiated the first born and choose Jacob, and now from the posterity of Jacob
I will choose for myself whom I please, for there is to be found no other cause
but my will, &#8216;I will then pity whom I will pity, and mercy will I show to
whom I will be merciful.&#8217;&#8221; If then in this case men will contend
with God, and would know why he chooses this rather than that man, the answer he
gives is, that the cause is to be found in his mercy alone, for he is bound to
no one.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see how the folly of those vanishes away who
would have foreknowledge to be the cause of election; and also that they who
murmur against God, are sufficiently refuted by this reason, that it is in his
power either to choose or to reject, inasmuch as he is under obligations to
none.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to reprobation, the cause of it is sufficiently
manifest in the fall of Adam, for, as we have said, we all fell with him. It
must still be observed, that the election of God is anterior to Adam&#8217;s
fall; and that hence all we who are rescued from the common ruin have been
chosen in Christ before the creation of the world, but that others justly perish
though they had not been lost in Adam; because God appointed Christ the head of
his Church, in order that we might be saved in him, not all, but those who have
been chosen.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And with regard to the proof, it is not necessary
here to bring together the mass of passages found in scripture, for this would
be endless. But there are, however, some remarkable passages, by which it is
sufficiently evident that some are chosen from the whole world as well as from
the race of Abraham, according to God&#8217;s good pleasure only, and that
others are rejected, and that there is no other cause to be found but his will;
for our election is hid in the eternal and secret counsel of God, and founded on
Christ, and reprobation is also hid in the judgment of God. Now if we wish to
penetrate into this mystery, we must know that it is a great and unfathomable
abyss: here all our ideas vanish away. In the meantime, however, God does not
lose his liberty to choose and reject whom he pleases.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to election, the ninth chapter to the
Romans
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:1) ought to be sufficient, or rather the three chapters, for Paul pursues the
same argument to the end of the eleventh chapter, and then exclaims that the
riches of God&#8217;s wisdom and goodness are incomprehensible, and that his
judgments are untraceable. He speaks also of the elect in the first chapter to
the Ephesians;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:1 and the sum of what he says is, that all the faithful had been chosen in
Christ before the creation of the world, and through the good pleasure of God
only, in order that he might show in them the glory of his
goodness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By no refinements can they escape who attempt to
darken this truth; for Paul very clearly and briefly declares that the whole
world has not been chosen, but the faithful, who are afterwards favored with the
Spirit of adoption: and thus sufficiently is that fancy refuted, that the
election of God ought to be connected with his promises. I wonder that men of
learning, endued with judgment and versed in scripture, so frigidly pass over
the subject, and that they are not at least moved when they see that they give
to many the occasion of foolishly going astray, and that some take hence the
opportunity to calumniate. We must, however, declare what this passage requires
&#8212; that those are very unwise who seek to subvert or overthrow the eternal
election of God by this contrivance &#8212; that God addresses all men
generally, &#8220;Come unto me&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;I am your Father.&#8221;
Since God then offers his grace to all by the external preaching of his word,
they will have it that all are elected: but Paul says, that we are believers,
because we have been elected. If then it be asked, why some obstinately reject
the grace of God, and others embrace it in the spirit of meekness, Paul assigns
the reason, and it is this &#8212; because God illuminates those who believe,
inasmuch as he has chosen them before the creation of the world. It then follows
that God so speaks generally, as that the efficacy of the doctrine still depends
on his secret good pleasure; for whence is faith, but from his peculiar favor?
and why does he not communicate his grace to all? even because he has not chosen
all. We see that Paul thus proceeds step b,y step, that he might teach us that
faith emanates from the fountain of free election; and he raises up election
into the highest eminence to show that it is not right to inquire into its
cause. Thus much about election.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to reprobation, I know that many greatly dislike
this doctrine &#8212; that some are rejected, and that yet no cause can be found
in themselves why they thus remain disapproved by God. But there is here need of
docility and of a meek spirit, to which Paul also exhorts us, when he
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;O man, who art
thou who answerest against
God?&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450920&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
9:20.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For were it lawful to investigate the cause, surely
Paul, who had been taken up to the third heaven, might have showed us the way;
but he is here silent and drives us away from the indulgence of a bold and an
over curious spirit. Since the Holy Spirit by the mouth of Paul restrains the
presumption of men, that they may not dare to go beyond this step &#8212; that
God hardens whom he wills and rejects whom he wills, why do men leap beyond
this, except they wilfully seek to carry on war with God? and yet they pretend
modesty, and under this pretext they seek to bury the doctrine of election; we
ought, they say, to speak soberly of mysteries. This last sentence I allow
fully; but what is our sobriety but our docility? that is, when we embrace what
God declares in his word, and never allow ourselves to investigate more than
what he teaches us. But they would extinguish God&#8217;s word; nay, they dare
openly to pronounce blasphemies against God, and to find fault with the Spirit,
who has spoken by the prophets and the apostles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We indeed see that there are many devils who preach
modesty, when their object is to suppress the light and this chief doctrine, the
main basis of our salvation; and they extort wicked edicts from the ignorant and
the slumbering, as though it were in the power of men, by babbling about things
unknown, and by barbarously mixing all things together, to thrust God as it were
from his celestial throne. This is horribly monstrous, and ought to be detested
by all; for it would be better that all the empires of the world should be
swallowed up in the lowest depths, than that mortal creatures should raise
themselves up as it were into heaven, and attempt to penetrate into the secret
things of God. But, however, when the whole world either assail this doctrine by
barking, or seek to subvert it by threats and terrors, or when all in various
ways manifest their rage, and when they roll thunders who seem to themselves to
be very powerful, it behoves us to hold fast this doctrine, that God alone is
the author of our salvation, because he has been pleased freely to elect us, and
also that he possesses power over all the human race, so that some, according to
his will, are elected and some are rejected, and that he ever acts justly, and
holds secret the cause both of election and of reprobation. But it is no wonder
that we are so blind, for we are stupid by nature, nay, blind altogether; and
were we angels, it would be still our duty reverently to regard the manifold
wisdom of God, which no human minds, no, not even angelic minds, can fully
comprehend. Other things we must defer.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">GOD as already proved that he had by many favors been
a Father to the Jews. They must have felt that he had indeed bound them to
himself, provided they possessed any religion or gratitude. He now then
concludes his address to them, as though he had said, that he had very ill
bestowed all the blessings he had given them; and he adopts two similitudes; he
first compares himself to a father, and then to a master. He says, that in these
two respects he had a just cause to complain of the Jews; for he had been a
father to them, but they did not in their turn conduct themselves as children,
in a submissive and obedient manner, as they ought to have done. And farther, he
became their master, but they shook off the yoke, and allowed not themselves to
be ruled by his authority.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the word, Father, we have already shown that
the Jews were not only in common with others the children of God, but had been
also chosen as his peculiar people. Their adoption then made them God&#8217;s
children above all other nations; for when they differed nothing from the rest
of the world, God adopted them. With regard to the right and power of a master,
God, in the first place, held them bound to him as the Creator and former of the
whole world; but he also, as it is well known, attained the right by redemption.
That he might then enhance their crime, he not only expostulates with them for
having abused his favors, but he charges them also with obstinacy, because they
disobeyed his authority, while yet he was their Lord.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, that a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>son who honors his father, and a
servant </i></font><font face="Palatino">his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>master</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
He applies the same verb to both clauses; but he afterwards makes a difference,
ascribing honor to a father and fear to a master. As to the first clause, we
know that whenever there is authority, there ought to be honor; and when masters
are over servants, they ought to be honored. But in a subsequent clause he
speaks more distinctly, and says, that a master ought to be feared by a servant,
while honor is due to a father from a son. For servants do not love their
masters; not being able to escape from their power, they fear them: but the
reverence which sons have for their fathers, is more generous and more
voluntary. But God shows here, that the Jews could by no means be kept to their
duty, though so many favors ought to have made it their sweet delight. God had
indeed conciliated them as much as possible to himself, but all was without any
benefit. The majesty also of God ought to have struck them with fear. It was
then the same, as though he had said, that they were of so perverse a nature,
that they could not be led to obedience either by a kind and gracious
invitation, or by an authoritative command.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Lord then complains that he ass deprived by the
Jews of the honor which sons owe to their fathers, as well as of the fear which
servants ought to have for their masters; and thus he shows that they were like
untameable wild beasts, which cannot be tamed by any kind treatment, nor subdued
by scourges, or by any kind of castigation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To you, O
priests</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is certain that this complaint
ought not to be confined to the priests alone, since God, as we have seen,
speaks generally of the whole race of Abraham: for he had said that Levi was
advanced to the sacerdotal honor, while the other brethren were passed by; but
he had said also, that Jacob was chosen when Esau was rejected; and this
belonged in common to the twelve tribes. Now it ought not, and it could not, be
confined to the tribe of Levi, that God was their father or their master. Why
then does he now expressly address the priests? They ought indeed to have been
leaders and teachers to the rest of the people, but he does not on this account
exempt the whole people from blame or guilt, though he directs his discourse to
the priests; for his object was to show that all things had become so corrupt
among the people, that the priests were become as it were the chief in contempt
of religion and in sacrileges, and in every kind of pollution. It hence follows
that there was nothing sound and right in the community; for when the eyes
themselves are without light, they cannot discharge their duty to the body, and
what at length will follow?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God then no doubt shows that great corruptions
prevailed and had spread so much among the people, that they who ought to have
been examples to others, had especially shaken off the yoke and given way to
unbridled licentiousness. This then is the reason why the Prophet condemns the
priests, though at the beginning he included the whole people, as it is evident
from the context.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must at the same time bear in mind what we have
elsewhere said -that the fault of the people was not lessened because the sin of
the priest was the most grievous; but that all were involved in the same ruin;
for God in this case did not absolve the common people, inasmuch as they were
guilty of the same sins; but he shows that the most grievous fault belonged to
the teachers, who had not reproved the people, but on the contrary increased
licentiousness by their dissimulation, as we shall presently find
again.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>despised his
name</i></font><font face="Palatino">; not that the fear of God prevailed in
others, but that it was the duty of the priests to reprove the impiety of the
whole people. As then they allowed to others so much liberty, it appeared quite
evident that the name of God was but little esteemed by them; for had they
possessed true zeal, they would not have suffered the worship of God to be
trodden under foot or profaned, as we shall presently find to have been the
case.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have said, In what have we
despised thy name?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As the Prophet at the
beginning indirectly touched on the hypocrisy and perverseness of the people, so
he now no doubt repeats the same thing by using a similar language: for how was
it that the priests as well as the people asked a question on a plain matter, as
though it were obscure, except that they were blind to their own vices? Now the
cause of blindness is hypocrisy, and then, as it is wont to do, it brings with
it perverseness; for all who deceive themselves, dare even to raise their horns
against God, and petulantly to clamor that he too severely treats them; for the
Prophet doubtless does not here relate their words, except for the purpose of
showing that they had such a brazen front and so hard a neck, that they boldly
repelled all reproofs. We see at this day in the world the same sottishness; for
though the crimes reproved are sufficiently known, yet they, even the most
wicked, immediately object and say that wrong is done to them; and they will not
acknowledge a fault except they be a hundred times convicted, and even then they
will make some pretense. And truly were there not daily proofs to teach us how
refractory men are towards God, the thing would be incredible. The Prophet then
did no doubt by this cutting expression goad and also wound the people as well
as the priests, intimating that so gross was their hypocrisy, that they dared to
make shifts, when their crimes were openly known to all.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have said then, by what have we
despised thy name?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> They inquired as though they
had rubbed their forehead, and then gained boldness, &#8220;What does this mean?
for thou accuses us here of being wicked and sacrilegious, but we are not
conscious of any wrong.&#8221; Then the answer is given in God&#8217;s name,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye offer on mine altar polluted
bread</i></font><font face="Palatino">. A question may be here asked,
&#8220;Ought this to have been imputed to the priests as a crime; for had
victims been offered, such as God in his law commanded, it would have been to
the advantage and benefit of the priests; and had fine corn been brought, it
would have been advantageous to the priests?&#8221; But it seems to me probable,
that the priests are condemned because like hungry and famished men they seized
indiscriminately on all things around them. Some think that the priests grossly
and fraudulently violated the law by changing the victims &#8212; that when a
fat ram was offered, the priests, as they suppose, took it away, and put in its
place a ram that was lean, or lame, or mutilated. But this view appears not to
me suitable to the passage. Let us then regard the meaning to be what I have
stated &#8212; that God here contends with the whole people, but that he directs
his reproofs to the priests, because they were in two ways guilty, for they
formed a part of the people, and they also suffered God to be dishonored; for
what could have been more disgraceful than to offer polluted victims and
polluted bread?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If it be now asked, whether this ought to have been
ascribed as a fault to the priests, the answer is this &#8212; that the people
then were not very wealthy; for they had but lately returned from exile, and
they had not brought with them much wealth, and the land was desolate and
uncultivated: as, then, there was so much want among the people, and they were
intent, each on his advantage, according to what we have seen in the Prophet
Haggai,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;370104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Haggai
1:4,) and neglected the temple of God and their sacrifices, there is no doubt
but that they wished anyhow to discharge their duty towards God, and therefore
brought beasts which were either lame or blind; and hence the whole worship of
God was vitiated, their sacrifices being polluted. The priests ought to have
rejected all these, and to have closed up God&#8217;s temple, rather than to
have received indiscriminately what God had prohibited. As then this
indifference of the people was nothing but a profanation of divine worship, the
priests ought to have firmly opposed it. But as they themselves were hungry,
they thought it better to lay hold on everything around them &#8212;
&#8220;What,&#8221; they said, &#8220;will become of us? for if we reject these
sacrifices, however vicious they may be, they will offer nothing; and thus we
shall starve, and there will be no advantage; and we shall be forced in this
case to open and to close the temple, and to offer sacrifices at our own
expense, and we are not equal to this burden.&#8221; Since then the priests
spared the people for private gain, our Prophet justly reproves them, and says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye offer polluted
bread</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was indeed the office of the priests to place
bread daily on the table; but whence could bread be obtained except some were
offered? Now nothing was lost to the priests, when they daily set bread before
God, for they presently received it; and thus they preferred, as it was more to
their advantage, to offer bread well approved, made of fine flour: but as I have
said, their own convenience interposed, for they thought that they could not
prevail with the people &#8212; &#8220;If we irritate these men, they will deny
that they have anything to offer; and thus the temple will be empty, and our own
houses will be empty; it is then better to take coarse bread from them than
nothing; we shall at least feed our families and servants with this bread, after
having offered it to the Lord.&#8221; We hence see how the fault belonged to the
priests, when the people offered polluted bread, and unapproved
victims.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have hitherto explained the Prophet&#8217;s words
with reference chiefly to the shew-bread; not that they ought to be so strictly
taken as many interpreters have considered them; for under the name of bread is
included, we know, every kind of eatables; so it seems probable to me that the
word ought to be extended to all the sacrifices; but one kind is here mentioned
as an example; and it seems also that what immediately follows is added as an
explanation &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye offer the
lame and the blind and the mutilated</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Since
these things are connected together, I have no doubt but that God means by bread
here every kind of offering, and we know that the shew-bread was not offered on
the altar; but there was a table by itself appointed for this purpose near the
altar. And why God designates by bread all the sacrifices may be easily
explained; for God would have sacrifices offered to him as though he had his
habitation and table among the Jews; it was not indeed his purpose to fill their
minds with gross imaginations, as though he did eat or drink, as we know that
heathens have been deluded with such notions; but his design was only to remind
the Jews of that domestic habitation which he had chosen for himself among them.
But more on this subject shall presently be said; I shall now proceed to
consider the words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Ye offer on my altar polluted bread; and ye have
said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In what have we polluted
thee?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The priests again answer as though God
unjustly accused them; for they allege their innocency, as the question is to be
regarded here as a denial: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In
what </i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have we polluted thee?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">They deny that they were rightly condemned,
inasmuch as they had duly served God. But we may hence conclude, according to
what has been before stated, that the people were under the influence of gross
hypocrisy, and had become hardened in their obstinacy. It is the same at this
day; though there be such a mass of crimes, which everywhere prevails in the
world, and even overflows the earth, yet no one will bear to be condemned; for
every one looks on others, and thus when no less grievous sins appear in others,
every one absolves himself. This is then the sottishness which the Prophet again
goads &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have said, In
what have we polluted thee?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He and other
Prophets no doubt charged the Jews with this sacrilege &#8212; that they
polluted the name of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it deserves to be known, that few think that they
pollute God and his name when they worship him superstitiously or formally, as
though they had to do with a child: but we see that God himself declares, that
the whole of religion is profaned, and that his name is shamefully polluted when
men thus trifle with him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He answers,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when ye
said</i></font><font face="Palatino">, literally, in your saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The table of Jehovah, it is
contemptible</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here the Prophet discovers the
fountain of their sin; and he shows as it were by the finger, that they had
despised those rites which belonged to the worship of God. The reason follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If ye offer the
blind</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for sacrifice, it is no
evil</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some read the last clause as a question,
&#8220;is it not evil?&#8221; but he, the mark of a question, is not here; and
we may easily gather from the context that the Prophet as yet relates how
presumptuously both the priests and the whole people thought they could be
acquitted and obtain pardon for themselves, &#8220;It is no evil thing if the
lame be offered, if the blind be offered, if the maimed be offered; there is
nothing evil in all this.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn3</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We now
then understand what the Prophet means.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the subject would have been obscure had not a
fuller explanation been given in these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The table of Jehovah, it is
contemptible</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn4</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> God does
here show, as I have before stated, why he was so much displeased with the Jews.
Nothing is indeed so precious as his worship; and he had instituted under the
law sacrifices and other rites, that the children of Abraham might exercise
themselves in worshipping him spiritually. It was then the same as though he had
said, that he cared nothing for sheep and calves, and for any thing of that
kind, but that their impiety was sufficiently manifested, inasmuch as they did
not think that the whole of religion was despised when they despised the
external acts of worship according to the law. God then brings back the
attention of the Jews from brute animals to himself, as though he had said,
&#8220;Ye offer to me lame and blind animals, which I have forbidden to be
offered; that you act unfaithfully towards me is sufficiently apparent; and if
ye say that these are small things and of no moment, I answer, that you ought to
have regarded the end for which I designed that sacrifices should be offered to
me, and ordered bread to be laid on my table in the sanctuary; for by these
tokens you ought to have known that I live in the midst of you, and that
whatever ye eat or drink is sacred to me, and that all you possess comes to you
through my bounty. As then this end for which sacrifices have been appointed has
been neglected by you, it is quite evident that ye have no care nor concern for
true religion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive why the Prophet objects to the
priests, that they had called the table of Jehovah contemptible; not that they
had spoken thus expressly, but because they had regarded it almost as nothing to
pervert and adulterate the whole of divine worship according to the law, which
was an evidence of religion when there was any.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now it may seem strange, that God one while so
strictly requires pure sacrifices and urges the observance of them, when yet at
another time he says that he does not seek sacrifices, &#8220;Sacrifice I desire
not, but mercy,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;280606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
6:6;) and again, &#8220; Have I commanded your fathers when I delivered them
from Egypt, to offer victims to me? With this alone was I content, that they
should obey my voice.&#8221; He says afterwards in Micah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Shall I be
propitious to you if ye offer me all your flocks? but rather, O man, humble
thyself before thy
God.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;330606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Micah
6:6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The same is said in the fiftieth Psalm, in the first
and the last chapters of Isaiah, and in many other places. Since then God
elsewhere depreciates sacrifices, and shows that they are not so highly esteemed
by him, why does he now so rigidly expostulate with the Jews, because they
offered lame and maimed animals? I answer, that there was a reason why God
should by this reproof discover the impiety of the people. Had all their victims
been fat or well fed, our Prophet would have spoken as we find that others have
done; but since their faithlessness had gone so far that they showed even to
children that they had no regard for the worship of God &#8212; since they had
advanced so far in shamelessness, it was necessary that they should be thus
convicted of impiety; and hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye offer to me polluted
bread</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as though he had said, &#8220;I supply
you with food, it was your duty to offer to me the first-fruits, the tenths, and
the shew-bread; and the design of these external performances is, that they may
regard themselves as fed by me daily, and also that they may feed moderately and
temperately on the bread and flesh and other things given them, as though they
were sitting at my table: for when they see that bread made from the same corn
is before the presence of God, this ought to come to their minds, &#8216;it is
God&#8217;s will, as though he lived with us, that a portion of the same bread
should ever be set on the holy table:&#8217; and then when they offer victims,
they are not only to be thus stirred up to repentance and faith, but they ought
also to acknowledge that all these are sacred to God, for when they set before
the altar either a calf, or an ox, or a lamb, and then see the animal
sacrificed, (a part of which remains for the priests,) and the altar sprinkled
with blood, they ought to think thus within themselves, &#8216;Behold, we have
all these things in common with God, as though clothed in a human form he dwelt
with us and took the same food and the same drink.&#8217; They ought then to
have performed in this manner their outward rites.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God now justly complains, that his table was
contemptible, as though he had said, that his favor was rejected, because the
people, as it were in contempt, brought coarse bread, as though they wished to
feed some swineherd, &#8212; a conduct similar to that mentioned in Zechariah,
when God said, that a reward was offered for him as though he were some
worthless hireling,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;380212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
2:12) &#8212; &#8220;I have carefully fed you,&#8221; he says,&#8221; and I now
demand my reward: ye give for me thirty silverings, a mean and disgraceful
price.&#8221; So also in this place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have said, the table of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">, it is polluted. There is an emphasis
in the pronoun; for God shows that he by no means deserved such a reproach:
&#8220; Who am I, that ye should thus despise my table? I have consecrated it,
that ye might have a near access to me, as though I dwelt in the visible
sanctuary; but ye have despised my table as though I were
nothing.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Offer this now to thy governor;
will he be pleased with thee? </i></font><font face="Palatino">God here
complains that less honor is given to him than to mortals; for he adduces this
comparison, &#8220;When any one owes a tribute or tax to a governor, and brings
any thing maimed or defective, he will not receive it.&#8221; Hence he draws
this inference, that he was extremely insulted, for the Jews dared to offer him
what every mortal would reject. He thus reasons from the less to the greater,
that this was not a sacrilege that could be borne, as the Jews had so
presumptuously abused his kindness; and hence he subjoins</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He wounds here the priests more grievously, &#8212;
because they had so degenerated as to be wholly unworthy of their honorable
office and title; &#8220;Go,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>entreat the face of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">.&#8221; All this is ironical; for
interpreters are much mistaken who think that the Prophet here exhorts the
priests humbly to ask pardon from God, both for themselves and for the people.
On the contrary, he addresses them, as I have said, ironically, while telling
them to be intercessors and mediators between God and the people; and yet they
were profane men, who on their part polluted the whole worship of God, and thus
subverted the whole of religion: go thou and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>entreat</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the face of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This duty, we know, was enjoined on the
priests; they were to draw nigh to the sanctuary and present themselves before
God as though they were advocates pleading the cause of the people, or at least
intercessors to pacify God. Since then they were in this respect the types of
Christ, it behoved them to strive themselves to be holy; and though the people
abandoned themselves to all kinds of wickedness, it yet became the priests to
devote themselves with all reverence to the duties of their calling; and as God
had preferred them to their brethren, they ought especially to have consecrated
themselves to him with all fear; for the more excellent their condition was, the
more eminent ought to have been their piety and holiness. Justly then does the
Prophet here inveigh so severely against them, because they did not consider
that they were honored with the priesthood, that they might entreat God, and
thus pacify his wrath, and reconcile to him miserable men: Go, he says, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>entreat the face of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">; forsooth!
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he will accept your
face</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We now understand the real meaning of the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
now</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he will have mercy on
us</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here also the Prophet derides them, because
they boasted that they could prevail through their own high dignity to render
God propitious; forsooth! he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he will have mercy on
us</i></font><font face="Palatino">. But
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this is done by your
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino">, <i>i.e., by you.</i> &#8220;Do ye raise
up your hands to God? and will he on seeing you be pacified towards you? As then
ye are polluted, ye are unworthy of the honor and office, in which ye so proudly
glory.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He does not however, as we have already said,
extenuate the fault of the people, and much less does he exempt them from guilt
who were implicated in the same crimes; but he shows that the state of things
was wholly desperate; for the common people disregarded God, and the priests,
neglecting to make any distinctions, received every sort of victims, only that
they might not be in want: he shows them that the state of the people was
extremely bad, as there was no one who could, according to what his office
required, pacify God. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Will he
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>receive your
face</i></font><font face="Palatino">? The Prophet seems to allude to the person
of the Mediator; for as Christ had not as yet appeared, when the priest
presented himself before the altar, it was the same as though God looked on the
face of one, and became thus propitious to all. On this account he says, that
the priests were not worthy that God should look on them, since they had
polluted his sanctuary and corrupted his whole service.

<div><font face="Palatino">He goes on with the same subject, &#8212; that the
priests conducted themselves very shamefully in their office, and that the
people had become hardened through their example, so that the whole of religion
was disregarded. Hence he says, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>doors</i></font><font face="Palatino">
were not closed by them. Some interpreters connect the two things together
&#8212; that they closed not the doors of the temple, nor kindled the altar for
nothing; and thus they apply the adverb,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;nj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chenam</i>, to both clauses; as though he had said, that they were hirelings,
who did not freely devote themselves to serve God, but looked for profit and
gain in everything: and this is the commonly received explanation. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn6</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But it
seems better to me to take them separately and to say, Who does even shut the
doors? not however for nothing, and the copulative,

fixed your works; ye are then to me as hired servants; and now since I have
ordered a reward to be given to you whenever ye stand at my altar, why do ye not
close my door?&#8221; Some render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;nj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chenam</i>, in vain, and give this explanation &#8220;Who closes the doors?
then kindle not afterwards in vain my altar;&#8221; as though God rejected the
whole service, which had been corrupted by the avarice or the sloth of the
priests, and by the presumption of the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is indeed certain that it is better to separate
the two clauses so that the adverb,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;nj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chenam</i>, may be confined to the letter; but there may yet, as I have said,
be a two-fold meaning. If we render,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;nj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chenam</i>, in vain the import is that the Prophet declares that they labored
to no purpose while they thus sacrificed to God contrary to his law for they
ought to have attended especially to the rule prescribed to them: as then they
despised this, he justly says, &#8220;Offer not to me in vain;&#8221; and thus
the future tense is to be taken for the imperative, as we know is the case
sometimes in Hebrew.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But no interpreter seems to have sufficiently
considered the reason why the Prophet speaks of not closing the doors of the
temple. The priests, we know were set over the temple for this reason &#8212;
that nothing polluted might be admitted; for there were of the Levites some
doorkeepers, and others stood at the entrance; in short, all had their stations:
and then when they had brought in the victim it was the office of the priests to
examine it and to see that it was such as the law of God required. As then it
was their special office to see that nothing polluted should be received into
the temple of God, he justly complains here that they indiscriminately received
what was faulty and profane: hence he rightly declares (for this seems to me to
be the true exposition) &#8220;Offer not in vain.&#8221; He then draws the
conclusion, that the priests lost all their labor in thus sacrificing, because
God would not have his name profaned, and justly preferred obedience to all
sacrifices. He therefore denies that they did any good in slaying victims,
because they ought in the first place to have attended to this &#8212; not to
change anything in God&#8217;s word and not to deviate from it in the least. But
I cannot now proceed farther.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">I COULD not yesterday finish the complaint which God
made against the priests &#8212; that no one of them closed the doors of the
temple, so that it might continue pure from all defilements; for as their
avarice was insatiable, they indiscriminately admitted all sorts of
profanations: hence he comes to this conclusion &#8212; &#8220;Offer not
hereafter in vain;&#8221; for by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Kindle not my
altar</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he means that they spent their toil to
no purpose in offering sacrifices, because God required his worship to be
performed according to the prescription of his law. I omit now the two other
expositions I mentioned yesterday; for it seems to me that the Prophet meant,
that the priests wearied themselves in vain while daily offering victims,
because the Lord repudiated their service as impure and
vicious.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am not pleased with

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and an offering I will not accept

that they were not approved by God, or did not please him; and then he adds,
that their offerings were rejected; for where there is no pure heart, there we
know all works are impure. For we must remember what Moses says &#8212; that
Abel pleased God together with his sacrifices,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis

and truth,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;370215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Haggai

<div><font face="Palatino">Here God shows that he no longer cared for the Jews,
for he would bid altars to be reared for him everywhere and through all parts of
the world, that he might be purely worshipped by all nations. It is indeed a
remarkable prophecy as to the calling of the Gentiles; but we must especially
remember this, &#8212; that whenever the Prophets speak of this calling, they
promise the spread of God&#8217;s worship as a favor to the Jews, or as a
punishment and reproach.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophets then promised to the Jews that the
Gentiles would become allied to them; so does Zechariah,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;In that day lay hold shall ten
men on the skirt of the garment, and will say to a Jew, Be thou our leader; for
the same God with thee will we worship.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;380823&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Zechariah
8:23.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It would have been then the highest honor to the Jews
had they become teachers to all nations, so as to instruct them in true
religion. So also Isaiah says, that is, that those who were before aliens would
become the disciples of the chosen people, so that they would willingly submit
to their teaching. But as the Jews have fallen from their place, the Gentiles
have succeeded and occupied their position. Hence it is that the Prophets when
speaking of the calling of the Gentiles, often denounce it as a punishment on
the Jews; as though they had said, that when they were repudiated there would be
other children of God, whom he would substitute in their place, according to
what Christ threatened to the men of his age,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Taken away from
you shall be the kingdom of God, and shall be given to another nation.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402143&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
21:43.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Such is this prophecy: for our Prophet does not
simply open to the Gentiles the temple of God, to connect them with the Jews and
to unite them in true religion; but he first excludes the Jews, and shows that
the worship of God would be exercised in common by the Gentiles, for the
doctrine of salvation would be propagated to the utmost extremities of the
earth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This difference ought to be noticed, which
interpreters have not observed, and yet it is what is very necessary to be
known; and for want of knowing this has it happened that passages wholly
different have been indiscriminately blended together. The Prophet then does not
here promise, as we have often stated in other places, that the whole world
would be subject to God, so that true religion would everywhere prevail, but he
brands the Jews with reproach, as though he had said, &#8220;God has repudiated
you, but he will find other sons for himself, who will occupy your place.&#8221;
He had repudiated in the last verse their sacrifices, and we know how haughtily
the Jews gloried in the holiness of their race. As then they were inflated with
so much pride, they thought that God would be no God except he had them as his
holy Church. The Prophet here answers them, and anticipates their objection by
saying, that God&#8217;s name would be celebrated through the whole world:
&#8220;Ye are a few people, all the nations will unite in one body to worship
God together; God then will not stand in need of you, and after he rejects you
his kingdom will not decay. Ye indeed think that his kingdom cannot be safe, and
that his glory will perish except he is worshipped by you; but I now declare to
you, that the worship of God will flourish everywhere, even after he shall cast
you out of his family.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see what the Prophet means when he says,
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Great will be the name of
God from the rising to the setting of the sun</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn8</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is
simply said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19B303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
113:3</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;From the rising to
the setting of the sun wonderful shall be the name of
God.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There indeed it is only a promise, but here the
Prophet includes the punishment which the Jews had deserved, as though he had
said, that after they were rejected by God on account of their ingratitude, the
Gentiles would become holy to God, because he would adopt them instead of that
wicked and ungodly people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But I have said, that the calling of the Gentiles is
here clearly proved, or may with certainty be elicited from this prophecy, for
this reason, because the name of God cannot be great without the teaching of the
truth. It is therefore the same thing as though the Prophet had said, that the
law which had been given to the Jews would be proclaimed among all nations, so
that true religion might spread everywhere: for the basis of true religion is to
know how he is to be worshipped by us, inasmuch as obedience is better than all
sacrifices. And it is necessary always to begin with this principle &#8212; to
know the God whom we worship: and hence Christ himself, in the fourth chapter of
John, condemns all the religions which then prevailed in the world, because men
presumptuously worshipped gods devised by themselves. Since then it is necessary
that the worship of God should be based on the truth, then God declares that his
name would become renowned in every place, he doubtless shows that his law would
be known to all nations, so that his will might be known everywhere, which is,
as we have said, the only rule of true religion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Everywhere shall be offered
incense to my name, and a clean offering</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Why?
Because </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>my name shall be
great</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The repetition is not useless; for it
was a thing then incredible, inasmuch as God had not in vain separated the Jews
from the rest of the world; nor was it an ordinary commendation, when Moses said
in the fourth chapter of Deuteronomy &#8212; &#8220;Show me a nation to whom God
draws nigh as lie does to you: this then is your nobility and your excellency,
to have a God nigh and friendly to you.&#8221; Hence also it is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19E720&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
147:20 &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He has not done
thus to other nations; his judgments has he not made known to
them.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was then the peculiar privilege of the race of
Abraham that God was known and worshipped by them. The very novelty, then, of
what is here said might have closed the door against this prophecy; and this is
the reason why the Prophet repeatedly confirms what it was then difficult to
believe &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the name of God,
he says, shall be great in every
place</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must also bear in mind that God cannot be rightly
worshipped except he is known, which Paul confirms when he says &#8212;
&#8220;How shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?&#8221; for
except the truth shines forth, we shall grope like the blind, and wander through
devious ways. There is therefore no religion approved by God except what is
based on his word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover the Prophet, by
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hjnm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>meneche</i>, offering, and by incense, means the worship of God; and this
mode of speaking is common in the Scriptures, for the Prophets who were under
the law accommodated their expressions to the comprehension of the people.
Whenever then they intend to show that the whole world would come to the faith
and true religion &#8212; &#8220;An altar,&#8221; they say, &#8220;shall be
built to God;&#8221; and by altar they no doubt meant spiritual worship, and not
that after Christ&#8217;s coming sacrifices ought to be offered. For now there
is no altar for us; and whosoever builds an altar for himself subverts the cross
of Christ, on which he offered the only true and perpetual
sacrifice.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then follows that this mode of speaking ought to
be so taken, that we may understand the analogy between the legal rites, and the
spiritual manner of worshipping God now prescribed in the gospel. Though then
the words of the Prophet are metaphorical, yet their meaning is plain enough
&#8212; that God will be worshipped and adored everywhere. But what are the
sacrifices of the New Testament? They are prayers and thanksgivings, according
to what the Apostle says in the last chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews.
There was also under the law the spiritual worship of God, as it is especially
stated in the fiftieth psalm; but there were then shadows connected with it, as
it is intimated in these words of Christ &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Now is come the
hour when the Father shall be worshipped in spirit and in truth.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430413&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
4:13.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He does not indeed deny that God was worshipped in
spirit by the fathers; but as that worship was concealed under outward rites, he
says that now under the gospel the simple, and, so to speak, the naked truth is
taught. What then the Prophet says of offering and incense availed under the
law; but we must now see what God commands in his gospel, and how he would have
us to worship him. We do not find there any incense or
sacrifices.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage contains nothing else than that the time
would come when the pure and spiritual worship of God would prevail in all
places.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And thus it appears how absurd are the Papists, when
they hence infer that God cannot be worshipped without some kind of sacrifice;
and on this ground they defend the impiety of their mass, as though it were the
sacrifice of which the Prophet speaks. But nothing can be more foolish and
puerile; for the Prophet, as we have said, adopts a mode of speaking common in
Scripture. And were we to allow offering and incense to be taken here literally,
how could,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hjnm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>meneche</i>, offering, be the body and blood of Christ? &#8220;Oh!&#8221;
they say, &#8220;it is a sacrifice made of bread, and wine was added. Oh! Christ
has thus commanded.&#8221; But where has he said &#8220; sacrifice?&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn9</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> They
again deny that it is bread? for they say that it is transubstantiated into the
body of Christ: now then it is not a sacrifice of bread, nor of fine flour; for
the form only, visible to the eyes, and without substance, remains, as they
imagine. There is in the meantime no reason for us carefully to discuss a
subject so clear; for as we have seen in Joel &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;In the last days I will pour my
Spirit on all flesh, and prophesy shall your sons and your daughters; your old
men dreams shall dream, and your young men visions shall see.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;290228&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Joel
2:28.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So also we find what is similar in this place; for
the Apostles, though not taught by visions, were yet we know illuminated; and
then visions were not given commonly at the commencement of the gospel, nor
dreams; they were indeed very rare things. What then does Paul mean? For he
speaks of the whole body of the Church, as though he had said that all, from the
least to the greatest, would be Prophets. Did they become Prophets by visions
and dreams, whom God illuminated by the doctrine of the gospel? By no means. But
Joel, as I have said, accommodated what he said to the time of the law. So also
in this place the Prophet, by offering and incense, designates the spiritual
worship of God. Let us now proceed-</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse may be confined to the priests, or it may
be extended to the whole people; for both views are appropriate. As to my own
view, I doubt not but that the Prophet here reproves with additional severity
the priests, and that at the same time he extends his reproof to the people in
general. We saw in our yesterday&#8217;s lecture how religion had been polluted
by the priests, and how impiously they had profaned the worship of God: but this
was the general sin of the whole people, as we shall presently see. Let us then
know that the whole people, as well as the priests, are here reproved: but as a
crime in the priests was more grievous, they being the occasion of sacrilege to
others, the Prophet assails them in an especial manner,

their guilt: for they might have complained, that God not only put them on a
level with the Gentiles, but also rejected them, and substituted aliens in their
place. He shows that God had a just cause for disinheriting them, and for
adopting the Gentiles as his children, for they had polluted God&#8217;s name.
He at the same time amplifies their sin, when he says, &#8220;The Gentiles, by
whom I have been hitherto despised, and to whom my name was not made known, will
soon come to the faith; thus my name shall be great, it shall be reverently
worshipped by all nations; but ye have polluted it.&#8221; It was certainly very
strange, that the Jews, peculiarly chosen and illuminated by the doctrine of the
Law, so presumptuously polluted God&#8217;s worship, as though they despised
him, and that the Gentiles, being novices, rendered obedience to God as soon as
they tasted of the truth of religion, so that his glory became through them
illustrious.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards shows how the name of Gog was polluted,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye say, The table of Jehovah is
polluted</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, ye distinguish not between
what is sacred and profane: for he repeats what we noticed yesterday, &#8212;
that the Jews thought it a frivolous matter, when the Prophets taught them that
God was to be worshipped with all reverence. It is not however probable, that
they openly uttered such a blasphemy as that the table of God was polluted; but
it is easy to conclude from what is said, that God&#8217;s table was profaned by
them, for they made no account of it. The holiness of the table ought to have
been so regarded by the Jews, as not to approach the sanctuary without true
repentance and faith; they ought to have known that they had to do with God, and
that his majesty ought to have deeply touched them. When therefore they came to
the temple, and brought with them their uncleanness like swine, it was quite
evident that they had no reverence for the temple, or the altar, or the table.
According to this sense then are the words of the Prophet to be understood,
&#8212; not that the Jews openly mocked God, but that the holiness of the temple
was with them of no account.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Table</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
we stated yesterday, that when God ordered sacrifices to be offered to him, it
was the same as though he familiarly dwelt among the Jews, and became as it were
their companion. It was the highest honor and an instance of God&#8217;s
ineffable goodness, that he thus condescended, so that the people might know
that he was not to be sought afar off. And for this reason the less excusable
was their impiety, as they did not consider that sacrifices were celebrated on
earth, that their minds might be raised up above the heavens: for it is to this
purpose that God descends to us, even to raise us above, as we have elsewhere
stated. It was then an extremely base and shameful senselessness and stupidity
in the Jews, that they did not consider that God&#8217;s table was set among
them, that they might by faith penetrate into heaven, and know it to be even
before their eyes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Its fruit is his contemptible
food</i></font><font face="Palatino">, we must observe, that some render,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">byn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nib</i>, word, and bring this passage from Isaiah, &#8220;I have created the
fruit of the lips, peace, peace,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235719&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
57:19.) The verb,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bwn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nub</i>, means to fructify; hence,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">byn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nib</i>, is fruit or produce. Were we to grant that it is metaphorically
taken for word, yet I see no reason why we should depart from its simple and
real meaning. For first there will be a relative without an antecedent,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wbyn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nibu</i>, his word; and then there will be a change of number; for they apply
it to the priests, his word, that is, the word of them &#8212; of whom? of the
priests. It is common, I know, in Hebrew, to put a relative without an
antecedent; but as I have said, nothing requires this here. The most suitable
rendering then is, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Its
provision</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, of the altar,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is the contemptible food
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of God. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn10</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I take
then the words to mean this, that a speech of this kind was often in the mouth
of the people as well as of the priests, &#8212; &#8220;Oh! the provision for
the altar is any kind of meat; be not so anxious in your choice, so as to offer
the best animals; for God is satisfied even with the lean and the
maimed.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And here again God reproves the impiety and contempt
of the people; and at the same time he condemns their avarice, because they took
the worst of their animals to offer in the temple, as though they lost
everything they consecrated to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Why he calls the sacrifices the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>meat</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or food of God, we now sufficiently understand. Only this ought to be observed,
that the impiety of the people was evident, as they were so unconcerned in their
duties; for God had not in vain instituted sacrifices and other rites. The
contempt then of the signs openly showed not only the negligence of the people,
but also their contempt of all religion. Were any one at this day to regard as
nothing outward teaching and the sacraments, would he not prove himself to be an
impious despiser of God? Yet religion, I allow, does not consist in these
things; for though hypocrites pretend the most ardent zeal, they yet profane the
name of God, whenever the truth sounds in their ears and the heart is not
touched, and when they come to the Lord&#8217;s table and are at the same time
alienated from Christ. These things I allow; but as no true servant of God can
despise these ordinances, which on account of our common infirmity are useful to
us, and without which we cannot be as long as we sojourn in this world,
whosoever derides our simplicity in frequenting God&#8217;s house, or if silent
abstains from doing so, and regards such a practice as nothing or as
unimportant, he is thus, as I have said, proved guilty of impiety. This is the
reason why the Prophet so sharply reproves the Jews, because they said that the
provision for the altar was God&#8217;s contemptible food. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">He pursues the same subject &#8212; that the worship
of God was despised by them and regarded as almost worthless. We must bear in
mind what I have before stated &#8212; that the Jews are not reprehended here as
though they had openly and avowedly spoken reproachfully of God&#8217;s worship;
but that this was sufficiently evident from their conduct; for they allowed
themselves so much licentiousness, that it was quite manifest that they were
trifling with God, inasmuch as they had cast off every fear of him and all
reverence towards him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have said, Behold,
labor</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This may apply to the whole people, or
to the priests alone. It is commonly explained of the priests &#8212; that they
complained that they had a hard office, because they were continually in the
temple and constantly watched there, and were much occupied in cleaning the
vessels.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The monks at this day under the Papacy, and the
priests, boasting of themselves, say, &#8220;While all others sleep, we are
watching; for we are constant in prayers.&#8221; Forsooth! they howl at midnight
in their temples; and then by massing and by doing other strange things they
imagine that they are seriously engaged in pacifying God. In this sense do some
understand this passage, as though the priests, in order to commend their work,
alleged that they labored much in God&#8217;s service, and as though God had
enjoined on them many and difficult things. But I prefer applying this to the
whole people, and yet I do not exclude the priests; for the Prophet here
condemns both, and shows that it was wearisome to them to spend labor in
worshipping God, that they considered it weariness, as we commonly say, <i>Tu le
fais par courvee</i>. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn11</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the import of what follows is the same,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have snuffed at
it</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, through disdain. Some give this
rendering, &#8220;With sorrow have ye moved him;&#8221; and the verb is in
Hiphil, and is often taken in this sense. The verb,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jpn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nephech</i>, is properly to snuff; and it is here in another conjugation; but
even in Hiphil it has this meaning, and cannot be taken otherwise. Now they who
render it, to move or touch with sorrow, are under the necessity of turning the
words of the Prophet to a sense the most foreign and remote, even that the
priests, extremely greedy of gain, compelled the common people to bring
sacrifices, and thus extorted sacrifices, but not without sorrow and
lamentation. We see how forced this is: I therefore wholly reject it. Some have
hammered out a very refined sense, which is by no means suitable, &#8220;Ye have
snuffed at it,&#8221; that is, Ye have said indeed that the victims are good and
sufficiently fat; and yet ye may by breath blow them into the air. Others render
it, to cast down, because they threw the sacrifices on the ground. But what need
there is of departing from the common meaning of the word, since it is easy to
conclude that both the priests and the people are here condemned, because the
worship of God was a weariness to them, as we snuff at a thing when it
displeases us. The behavior then of the fastidious is what the Prophet meant
here to express. The passage will thus be very appropriate, Ye have said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold weariness! Ye have snuffed
at it</i></font><font face="Palatino">: then he adds, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have offered the torn, and the
lame, and the weak</i></font><font face="Palatino">. These words prove the same
thing &#8212; that they performed their duty towards God in a trifling manner by
offering improper victims: when they had anything defective or diseased, they
said that it was sacred to God, as we find it stated in the next verse. Some
improperly render,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lwzg</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gazul</i>, a prey, what had been unjustly procured, as though he had said,
that they offered victims obtained by plunder: but I wonder how they could thus
distort the words of the Prophet without any pretense. He mentions here three
kinds &#8212; the torn, the lame, and the maimed or the feeble. Who then does
not see that the torn was an animal which had been torn by wild beasts? When
therefore they had an animal half dead, having been torn by wolves, they thought
that they had a suitable victim: &#8220;I am constrained to offer a sacrifice to
God, this lamb is very suitable, for the wolf has devoured a part of it, and it
has hardly escaped: as then it is maimed, I will bring it.&#8221; The Prophet
then calls those torn victims which had been lacerated by the teeth of wild
beasts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand the import of the words; but we
must remember what I have said &#8212; that God required not the performance of
external rites, because he had need of meat and drink, or because he set a great
value on these sacrifices, but on account of their design. The sacrifices then
which God demanded from his ancient people had in themselves nothing that
promoted true religion; nor could the odour of sacrifices of itself delight God;
but the end was to be regarded. As then God ordered and commanded sacrifices to
be offered to him, that he might exercise his people in penitence and faith, it
was for this reason that he valued them. But when the people had fallen into
gross contempt of them, that they brought to God, as it were to insult him, the
maimed and the lame, their extremely base and intolerable impiety, as I have
already said, was made fully evident. This is the reason why the Prophet now so
vehemently chides the priests and the whole people; they offered to God such
sacrifices as man would have rejected, according to what we noticed yesterday.

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THIRD</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I REPEATED yesterday the last verse of the first
chapter, but I did not explain it. The Prophet declares here, that all who dealt
deceitfully and unfaithfully with God were under a curse; and at the same time
he specifies the kind of fraud practiced; they chose from the flock such as were
diseased or defective to offer as sacrifices to God. It was indeed a proof of
extreme dishonesty thus perversely to mock God: for as we have seen no man would
bear such an insult. Then the Prophet, in order at once to complete what he had
begun, distinctly says, that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all
accursed</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The verb,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lkn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>necal</i>, means in Hebrew, to think; but it is taken almost at all times in
a bad sense: hence interpreters have not improperly rendered it here, deceitful;
but the deceit the Prophet meant to express is of this kind &#8212; when men
craftily contrive for themselves vain pretences; for when they can cover their
baseness before the world, they think that they are at the same time absolved in
heaven. The Prophet then says, that they who think that they can escape
God&#8217;s judgment by such artifices are under a curse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I come now to the kind of fraud they practiced,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If there be, he says, in his
flock a male, that is, a lamb or a ram, when he vows, then what is corrupt he
offers to Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He then means, that though
they pretended some religion, yet nothing was done by them with a sincere and
honest heart; for they immediately repented of the vow made to God; they thought
that they might be reduced to poverty, if they were too bountiful in their
sacrifices. Hence then the Prophet proves that they offered to God with a double
mind, and that whatever they thus offered was polluted, because it did not
proceed from a right motive.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We said yesterday, that the Prophet did not require
fat or lean beasts, because God valued either the blood or flesh of animals on
its own account, but for the end in view; for these were the performances of
religion by which God designed to train up the Jews for the end contemplated,
and in the duty of repentance. As then they were so sordid as to these
sacrifices, it was easy to conclude, that they were gross and profane despisers
of God, and had no concern for religion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The reason follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For a great king am I, saith
Jehovah, and my name is terrible</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn12</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
among the nations</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God declares here that his
majesty was of no account among the Jews, as though he had said, &#8220;With
whom do you think that you have to do?&#8221; And this is what we ought
carefully to consider when engaged in God&#8217;s service. We indeed know that
it is a vice which has prevailed in all ages, that all nations and individuals
thought that they worshipped God, when they devised foolish and frivolous rites
according to their own fancies. If then we have a desire to worship God aright,
we must remember how great he is; for his majesty will raise us up above the
whole world, and cease will that audacity which possesses almost all mankind;
for they think that their own will is a law, when they presumptuously obtrude
anything on God. The greatness of God then ought to humble us, that we may not
worship him according to the perceptions of our flesh, but offer him only what
is worthy of his celestial glory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He again repeats what we have before observed, though
it was disregarded by the Jews, &#8212; that he was a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>great king
</i></font><font face="Palatino">through the whole world. As then the Jews
thought that sacrifices could not be offered to God, such as he would accept, in
any other place but at Jerusalem, and in the temple on Mount Sion, he testifies
that he is a great king even in the farthest parts of the world. It hence
follows, that God&#8217;s worship would not be confined to Judea, or to any
other particular part of the world; for by the gospel the Lord would receive to
himself all nations, and come into the possession of his kingdom. Now

without reason, as we have said, that they were regarded as the first in
wickedness; for it was their office to correct what the people did amiss. Their
dissimulation had the effect of encouraging the common people to sin: hence the
Prophet accuses them especially as the authors of impiety; and this is what the
words intimate, if they are rightly considered.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O
priests</i></font><font face="Palatino">. They might have indeed exonerated
themselves, or at least transferred a part of their guilt to others: &#8220;Oh!
what can we do? for we see that the people are growing cold in God&#8217;s
worship; it is better that imperfect sacrifices should be offered than none at
all.&#8221; As then they might by evasion have somewhat extenuated their guilt,
the Prophet the more sharply reproves them and says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To you
</i></font><font face="Palatino">especially
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is addressed this
command</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as they ought to have shown to others
the right way; for when they dissembled, their connivance was nothing else but a
consent; and thus they divested the people of God&#8217;s fear, and allowed them
to corrupt the whole of religion by offering spurious sacrifices.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To you
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then, he says, that is, &#8220;Though the whole
people is guilty before God, think not that ye are on this account excused; for
it behoves you to check this wickedness, for God has set you over the people as
their teachers and guides: as then ye have neglected your duty, whatever others
have done amiss, falls justly on your heads. For how has it happened that the
people have dared to proceed so far in impiety? even because you have no concern
for religion; for God has promoted you to the priesthood for this end &#8212; to
preserve in integrity the worship of his name; but ye know of all the prevailing
profanations, and ye hold your peace:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To you
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is this
command</i></font><font face="Palatino">.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If ye will not hear nor lay it to
heart to give glory to my name</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. He seems
here to threaten the priests alone; and yet if any one carefully considers the
whole passage, he will easily perceive that this address extends to the whole
people, in such a way however that it is in the first place directed to the
priests; for as I have said the greater portion of the guilt belonged to them.
God then denounces a heavy punishment on the whole people as well as on the
priests, even that he would </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>send
a curse</i></font><font face="Palatino">. But that they might not object and say
that they were too severely dealt with, God shows how justly he was displeased
with them, because they hearkened not nor attended to his warnings. What indeed
is less tolerable than not to hear God speaking? But as many thought it enough
to stretch the ear, and then immediately to forget what had been spoken, it is
added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If ye lay it not to
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, If ye attend not and seriously
apply your hearts to what is said. We see then that the Prophet shows how that
God had a just cause for severely punishing them; for it was an impiety not to
be borne, when he could obtain no hearing from men. But the Prophet shows at the
same time what it is to hear God; he therefore adds the latter clause as a
definition or an explanation of the former: for God is not heard, if we receive
with levity his words, so that they soon vanish away; but we hear them when we
lay them on the heart, or, as the Latins say, when we apply the mind to them.
There is then required a serious attention, otherwise it will be the same as
though the ears were closed against God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us further learn from this passage that obedience
is of so much account with God, that he bears nothing less than a contempt of
his word or a careless attention to it, as though we regarded not its authority.
We must also notice that our guilt before God is increased and enhanced, when he
recalls us to the right way, and seeks to promote our welfare by warning and
exhorting us. When therefore God is thus kindly careful for our salvation, we
are doubly inexcusable, if we perversely reject his teaching, warnings,
counsels, and other remedies which he may apply.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will send on you a
curse</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and this curse he immediately explains,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will curse your
blessings</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn13</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
word blessing, we know, means everywhere in Scripture the beneficence or
kindness of God. God then is said to bless us when he bountifully supports us
and supplies whatever is necessary for us. And hence seems to have arisen the
expression, that God by his nod alone can satisfy us with all abundance of good
things. By blessings then he means a large and an abundant provision, and also
rest from enemies, a healthy air, and everything of this kind. Some think that
those prayers are intended, by which the priest blessed the people; but there is
no reason for this. God then had manifested his favor to the Jews; he now
declares that he will deprive them of all his benefits, that they might know
that he is not propitious to them. Blessings then are evidences of God&#8217;s
bounty and paternal favor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he immediately adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yea, I have
cursed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By which words he proves their
senselessness: for they were not even taught by their evils, which yet produce
some effect even on fools, who, according to the common proverb, begin to be
wise when they are chastised. God then here reproves the stupidity of the Jews;
for they had already been deprived of his benefits, and they might have known by
experience that he was not propitious to them, but on the contrary an angry
judge; and yet they were touched by no penitence, according to what we have seen
in the other Prophets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand the import of the words, and at the
same time the object of the Prophet:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>curse your blessings, and what is
more</i></font><font face="Palatino">, (so I explain,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;gw</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ugam</i>,) </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have already
cursed </i></font><font face="Palatino">them: but ye are like blocks of wood or
stones; for the very scourges avail nothing with you. He again repeats,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because ye lay it not on your
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino">, in order to show that he could not bear
the contempt of his word, for it was, as we have said, a sign of extreme
impiety. It follows</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms here again what he had said in the last
verse, &#8212; that they would perceive God&#8217;s curse in want and poverty.
The curse of God is any kind of calamity; for as God declares especially his
favor by a liberal support, so the sterility of the land and defective produce
most clearly evidence the curse of God. The Prophet then shows, by mentioning
one thing, what sort of curse was nigh the Jews, &#8212; that God would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>destroy</i></font><font face="Palatino">
their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seed</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
Some read, but improperly, &#8220;I will destroy you and the seed.&#8221; I
wonder how learned men make such puerile mistakes, when there is nothing
ambiguous in the Prophet&#8217;s words.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will destroy
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for you the
seed</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, &#8220;Sow as much as you
please, I will yet destroy your seed, so that it shall produce no fruit.&#8221;
In short, he threatens the Jews with want and famine; for the land would produce
nothing when cursed by God. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn14</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as the Jews flattered themselves on account of
their descent, and ever boasted of their fathers, and as that preeminence with
which God had favored them proved to them an occasion of haughtiness and pride,
the Prophet here ridicules this foolish confidence,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will scatter
dung</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on your
faces</i></font><font face="Palatino">: &#8220;Ye are a holy nation, ye are the
chosen seed of Abraham, ye are a royal priesthood; these are your boastings; but
the Lord will render your faces filthy with dung; this will be your nobility and
preeminence! there is then no reason for you to think yourselves exempt from
punishments because God has adopted you; for as ye have abused his benefits and
profaned his name, so ye shall also find in your turn, that he will cover you
with everything disgraceful and ignominious, so as to make you wholly filthy: ye
shall then be covered all over with dung, and shall not be the holy seed of
Abraham.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as they might have again raised a clamor and say,
&#8220; Have we then in vain so diligently served God? why has he bidden a
temple to be built for him by us and promised to dwell there? God then has
deceived us, or at least his promises avail nothing, &#8212; &#8220;the Prophet
gives this answer, &#8220; God will overwhelm you with disgrace and also your
sacrifices.&#8221; But he calls them the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dung of
solemnities</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as though he had said, &#8220; I
will cover you with reproach on account of your impiety, which is seen in your
sacrifices.&#8221; Had the Jews any holiness they derived it from their
sacrifices, by which they expiated their sins and reconciled themselves to God:
but the Prophet says that it was their special ill-savor which offended God, and
which he abominated, because they vitiated their sacrifices. Nor is that to be
disapproved which some of the rabbins have said, that the Prophet alludes to the
oxen, calves, and rams; for when the Jews from various places brought their
sacrifices, there must have been much dung from all that vast number. There is
then here a striking allusion to the victims themselves, as though he had said,
&#8220;Ye think that I can be pacified by your sacrifices, as though loads of
dung were pleasing to me; for when ye bring such a vast number, even the place
itself, the area before the temple, throws an ill-savor on account of the dung
that is there. Ye are then, forsooth! holy, and all your filth is cleansed away
by means of this dung. Begone then together with the dung of your solemnities;
for I will cast this very dung on your heads.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive what the Prophet means: and
emphatical are the words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold
I</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for God by these single words cuts off all
those pretences by which the Jews deceived themselves, and thought that their
vices were concealed from God: &#8220;I myself,&#8221; he says, &#8220;am
present, to whom ye think your sacrifices to be acceptable;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will destroy your seed, and
I will </i></font><font face="Palatino">also
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cast dung on your
faces</i></font><font face="Palatino">; all the dignity which ye pretend shall
be abolished, for ye think that ye are defended by a sort of privilege, when ye
boast yourselves to be the seed of Abraham: it is dung, it is dung,&#8221; he
says. He afterwards shows what was especially the dung and the filth: for when
they objected and said, &#8220; What! have our sacrifices availed
nothing?&#8221; he answers, &#8220;Nay, I will cast that dung upon you, because
the chief pollution is in your sacrifices, for ye vitiate and adulterate my
service: and what else is your sacrifice but profanation only? ye are
sacrilegious in all your empty pomps. Since then all your victims have an
ill-savor and displease me, and as I nauseate them, (as it is also said in the
first and last chapter of Isaiah,) I will heap the dung on your own heads,
because ye think it to be your chief expiation.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds at last,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It shall take you to
itself</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, &#8220; Ye shall be dung
altogether; and thus all your boastings, that ye are descended from the holy
Patriarch Abraham, shall be wholly useless; though I made a covenant and
promised that you should be to me a royal priesthood, yet the dung shall
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>take you to
itself</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and thus whatever dignity I have
hitherto conferred on you shall be taken away.&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino">Here he addresses in particular the priests; for
though the whole people with great haughtiness resisted God, yet the priests
surpassed them. And we know how ready men are to turn to evil whatever benefits
God may bestow on them. It has been then a common evil in men from the beginning
of the world, to exalt themselves and to raise their crests against God, when
they found themselves adorned with his benefits: but we know that the more any
one is bound to God the more thankful he ought to be, for our gifts are not our
own, but the benefits by which God binds us to himself.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;What best thou as
thine own?&#8221; says Paul, &#8220;thou best then no reason to glory.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 4:7)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This evil however has ever prevailed among men
&#8212; that they have defrauded God of his glory, and have turned to an
occasion of pride the favors received from him. But it is an evil which is very
commonly seen in all governors; for they who are raised to a high dignity, think
no more that they are men, but take to themselves very great liberty when they
find themselves so much exalted above others. Thus kings and those in authority
seem to themselves to be above the common order of men, and presumptuously
disregard all laws; they think that everything is lawful for them, as no one
opposes their willfulness. The same thing is also to be seen in teachers. For
when God favored the priests with the highest honor, they became blinded, as it
will hereafter be seen, by that favor of God, that they thought themselves to be
as it were semi-gods; and the same thing has taken place in the kingdom of
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For how have arisen so great impieties under the
Papacy, except that pastors have exercised tyranny and not just government? For
they have not regarded the purpose for which they have been called into their
office, but as the name of pastor is in itself honorable, they have dared to
raise themselves above the clouds, and to assume to themselves the authority of
God himself. Hence it has been, that they have dared to bind consciences by
their own laws, to change the whole truth, and to corrupt the whole worship of
God: and hence also followed the scandalous sale of justice. How have these
things happened? Because priests were counted as angels come down from heaven;
and this same danger is ever to be feared by us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This then is the vice which the Prophet now refers
to; and he shows that the priests had no reason to think that they could shake
off the yoke, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall
know</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that to you belongs this
command</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We indeed see what they objected to
Jeremiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The law shall not
depart from the priests nor counsel and wisdom from the elders.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;241818&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
18:18.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These are the weapons by which the Papists at this
day defend themselves. When we allege against them plain proofs from Scripture,
they find themselves clearly reproved and convicted by God&#8217;s word; but
here is their Ajax&#8217;s shield, under which they hide all their wickedness,
retailing as it were from the ungodly and wicked priests what is related by
Jeremiah, &#8220;&#8216;The law shall not depart from the priests;&#8217; we are
the Church, can it err? is not the Holy Spirit dwelling in the midst of us?
&#8216;I am with you always to the end of the world,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402820&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
28:20;) did Christ intend to deceive his Church when he said this to his
Apostles? and we are their successors.&#8221; The Prophet now gives the answer,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall
know</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that to you, belongs this
cornmand</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he adds, not without severity,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that my covenant may be with
Levi</i></font><font face="Palatino">; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn16</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as
though he had said, &#8220;On what account are ye thus elated? for God cannot
get a hearing for himself, yet ye say that the covenant with Levi is not to be
void, as though God had put Levi in his own place, and divested himself of all
authority when he appointed that tribe, and made you ministers of the temple and
teachers of the people; is he nothing? What was God&#8217;s purpose when he
honored you with that dignity? He certainly did not mean to reduce himself to
nothing, but, on the contrary, his will was, that his own right should remain
entire and complete. When therefore I reprove your vices, and show that ye are
become vile, and as it were dung, that ye are defiled by everything disgraceful,
&#8212; when I make these things openly known, I do not violate the covenant
made with Levi. God then justly summons you before his tribunal, and strips you
of your honor, in order that the covenant he made with Levi may be confirmed and
ratified.&#8221; This is, as I have said, a severe derision.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we may hence learn a useful truth. The Prophet
briefly teaches us that the priestly office takes away nothing from God&#8217;s
authority, who requires a pure and holy worship, and that it lessens in nothing
the authority of the law, for sound doctrine ought ever to prevail. So at this
day, when we resist the Papal priests, we do not violate God&#8217;s covenant,
that is, it is no departure from the order of the Church, which ought ever to
remain sacred and inviolable. We do not then on account of men&#8217;s vices,
subvert the pastoral office, and the preaching of the word; but we assail the
men themselves, so that due order may be restored, that sound doctrine may
obtain a hearing among men, that the worship of God may be pure, which these
unprincipled men have violated. We therefore boldly attempt to subvert the whole
of the Papacy, with this full confidence, that we lessen nothing from the
authority of teaching, nor in any way defraud the pastoral office; nay, order in
the Church, the preaching of the truth, and the very dignity of pastors, cannot
exist, except the Church be purged from its defilements, and its filth removed.
Thus must we say also of those unprincipled men, who are too nearly connected
with us, or too near us, and I wish they were wholly extinct in the world: but
how many pests conceal themselves under this covering, or under this mask
&#8212; &#8220;What! are we not the ministers of the word?&#8221; So say you who
are without any principle; I wish ye were in your dung, or in your cells, where
formerly ye too much corrupted the world; but now the devil has brought you
forth into the Church of God, that ye may corrupt whatever had hitherto remained
sound. As then there are many at this day who boast of this honor &#8212; that
they are ministers of the word, and pastors, and that they teach the gospel,
they ought to be checked by this answer of the Prophet &#8212; that when all
their corruptions are fully and really cleansed away, then confirmed and
ratified will be the compact which God would have to be valid with his Church
and with the ministers of his word. He then adds an explanation

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now proves more clearly how God violates
not his covenant, when he freely rebukes the priests, and exposes also their
false attempts in absurdly applying to themselves the covenant of God, like the
Papal priests at this day, who say that they are the Church. How? because they
have in a regular order succeeded the apostles; but this is a foolish and
ridiculous definition; for he who occupies the place of another ought not on
that account only to be deemed a successor. Were a thief to kill the master of a
family, and to occupy his place, and to take possession of all his goods, is he
to be accounted his legitimate successor? So these dishonest men, to show that
they are to be regarded as apostles, only allege a continued course of
succession; but the likeness between them ought rather to be the subject of
inquiry. We must see first whether they have been called, and then whether they
answer to their calling; neither of which can they prove. Then their definition
is altogether frivolous.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So also our Prophet here shows, that the priests made
pretences and deceived the common people, while they sought to prove themselves
heirs of the covenant which God had made with Levi their father, that is, with
the tribe itself. &#8220;I shall be faithful,&#8221; says God, &#8220;and my
faithfulness will be evident from the compact itself;

that there is, according to what is commonly said, a reciprocal obligation: but
I on my part promised to your father to be his father, and I also stipulated
with him that he was to obey me, to obey my word, and whatever I might
afterwards require. Now ye will have me to be bound to you, and yourselves to be
free from every obligation. What equity is this &#8212; that I should owe

may we be thus more and more confirmed in the hope of those promises by which
thou not only guides us through the course of this earthly life, but also

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-FOURTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE began in the last lecture to explain what the
Prophet says here of the priesthood, and we have said that the sum of the whole
is &#8212; that wicked priests in vain lay claim to the title of honor, who do
not faithfully perform their office; for the compact between God and them is
mutual, inasmuch as God did not institute priests under the law in order to
allow them unbridled liberty, or to deprive himself of every power; but, on the
contrary, he set them over the Church in order to retain the people in true
religion. As then the obligation is, as they say, reciprocal, there is no reason
for the priests to arrogate supreme power and to deprive God of it. The Prophet
then had said, that God&#8217;s compact with Levi was that of life and peace,
because God, who is faithful in his promises, had promised to be propitious to
the Levites. Our Prophet therefore calls it the compact of life and peace,
because the Levites had found that God was in every respect kind and bountiful,
whenever they performed their parts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I gave to him fear, and he feared
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The interpreters who consider the
preposition <i>for</i>, or, on account of (<i>propter</i>), to be understood,
pervert the whole sense; for fear here is to be taken for the rule of
worshipping God, as though he had said, &#8220;I have prescribed how he is
rightly to perform his office.&#8221; He means then that God gave to the Levites
a knowledge of the way in which he was to be served, because he would not have
them to wander according to their own notions, but he prescribed to them the
duties of their office, as though he had said, &#8220;Ye are indeed endued with
no common honor, for ye are the teachers of the Church; but yet I have laid a
restraint upon you, as I have commanded the people to obey you, so have I
commanded you what to do. Since then I have given my fear to Levi, since I have
prescribed how he is to worship me, is it not now most shameless and most
impious, to boast of the honorable name of priesthood, and at the same time to
be no priests? for what is it to be God&#8217;s priest, except to govern the
Church as God has commanded? </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I

<div><font face="Palatino">He explains mote fully how Levi responded to
God&#8217;s command, &#8212; that he had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the law of truth in his
mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The chief duty of a priest is to show
the right way of living to the people; for however upright and holy one may be
through his whole life, he is not on that account to be deemed a priest. Hence
our Prophet dwells especially on this point &#8212; that Levi taught the people.
He does not speak of Levi himself; for we know that Levi was dead when Aaron was
made a priest. For God does not here speak of individuals, but of the tribe; as
though he had said, &#8220;Aaron and Eleazar, and those who followed them, knew
for what end they were honored with the priesthood, and they faithfully
performed their duties.&#8221; The Prophet now explains what God mainly requires
from priests &#8212; to show to the people, as I have already said, the way of
living a pious and holy life; but he adopts different words, which yet mean the
same thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The law of
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was in his
mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Why does he not commend the integrity of
his heart rather than his words? Had he spoken of an individual, the Prophet
might have justly said, that he who sought to be an approved servant of God, had
conducted himself harmless towards men; but he speaks of a public office, when
he says, that the law of truth was in his mouth; for he is not worthy of that
honor who is mute: and nothing is more preposterous, or even more ridiculous,
than that those should be counted priests who are no teachers. These two things
are, as they say, inseparable &#8212; the office of the priesthood and
teaching.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And that he might more clearly show that he speaks
not of an ordinary matter, he repeats the same thing in other words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Iniquity was not found in his
lips</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We hence see that all this belongs
peculiarly to the sacerdotal office. He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In peace and rectitude he walked
before me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet here commends also the
sincere concern for religion which the first priests manifested, for they walked
with God in peace and uprightness; they not only carried signals in their lips
and mouth, by which they might have been justly deemed the ministers of God and
the pastors of his Church; but they also executed faithfully their office. And
he alludes to the peace of which he had spoken: as God then had promised peace
to the Levites, so also he says, that the Levites had lived themselves peaceably
before God; for they did not break the covenant which he had made with them. As
then they had responded to the stipulation of God, he says that they had walked
in peace: but he also mentions how this was; it was, because they had walked in
uprightness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the phrase,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yta</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ati</i>, with me, ought to be observed; for it confirms what I have stated,
&#8212; that the honor of the priesthood in no way lessens God&#8217;s
authority, for he keeps the priests devoted to himself. He intimates then that
they were not elevated to such a height, that their dignity took away anything
from God&#8217;s authority: for the obligation, which has been mentioned, ought
to be mutual: God is faithful; the priests also must be faithful in their
office, and show themselves to be the legitimate ministers of God. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn19</font></sup><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">What the Prophet has said of the first priests he
extends now to the whole Levitical tribe, and shows that it was a perpetual and
unchangeable law as to the priesthood. He had said that Levi had been set over
the Church, not to apply to himself the honor due to God, but to stand in his
own place as the minister of God, and the teacher of the chosen people. The same
thing he now confirms, declaring it as a general truth that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the lips of the priest ought to
retain knowledge</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as though he had said, that
they were to be the store-house from which the food of the Church was to be
drawn. God then did appoint the priests over his chosen people, that the people
might seek their food from them as from a store-room, according to what we find
to be the case with a master of a family, who has his store of wine and his
store of provisions. As then the food of a whole family is usually drawn out
from places where provisions are laid up, so the Prophet makes use of this
similitude, &#8212; that God has deposited knowledge with the priests, so that
the mouth of every priest might be a kind of store-house, so to speak, from
which the people are to seek knowledge and the rule of a religious life:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Keep knowledge
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall the lips of the priest, and
the law shall they seek from his mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn20</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He shows how it is to be kept; the priests are not to
withhold it, but the whole Church is to enjoy the knowledge of which they are
the keepers. They shall then seek or demand the law from his
mouth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Law may be taken simply for truth; but the Prophet no
doubt alludes here to the doctrine of Moses, the only true fountain of all
knowledge. We indeed know that God included in his law whatever was necessary
for the welfare of his Church; nor was there anything added by the Prophets. Our
Prophet then so includes every truth in the word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrwt</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ture</i>, law, that he might at the same time show that it was laid up in
what Moses has taught.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says in the last place, that the priest is the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>messenger of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He briefly defines here what the
priesthood is, even an embassy which God commits to men, that they may be his
interpreters in teaching and ruling the Church. What then is a priest? A
messenger of God, and his interpreter. It hence follows that the office of
teaching cannot be separated from the priesthood; for it is a monstrous thing
when any one boasts himself to be a priest, when he is no teacher. The Prophet
then draws an argument from the definition itself, when he says that a priest is
a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>messenger</i></font><font face="Palatino">
of God. Then follows the contrast when he says</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He shows here how far were the priests of his time
from fulfilling that compact which he had mentioned. He hence concludes that
they were unworthy of the honor of which they were so confidently proud, and
under the shadow of which they sought to cover their vices, as though they were
not bound to God, and were at liberty to tread the Church under foot with
impunity. He then shows that it was an extremely foolish arrogance in them to
seek to be exempt from all law, and yet to regard God and the whole Church bound

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet draws this conclusion &#8212; that the
priests in vain gloried in the honor of their office, for they had ceased to be
the priests of God. We may now return to the main point.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We perceive what the subject is which the Prophet
handles here: as the priests sought by a peculiar privilege to exempt themselves
from all reproof, he assails them in particular; for teaching would have been
useless as to the common people, except the priests themselves were brought to
order. The priests no doubt flattered the people, and thus attempted to deprive
the Prophets of every respect, in order that their doctrine might produce no
effect. This is the reason why our Prophet so sharply reproves them. But we must
consider the state of the case. The priests said that they had been set, by
divine authority, over the whole Church, and that they could not be deprived of
that honor which they had received from God. They however took only but one part
of the covenant, and yet sought to deprive God of his right. The Prophet here
answers them &#8212; that God had indeed favored them with no common honor in
appointing them the priests of his Church, but that the compact, which included
a mutual stipulation, was at the same time to be considered; for God had not
simply appointed them the guides of his Church, but had also added a
condition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that the hinge of the matter was, that
the priests presumptuously and absurdly laid hold on what favored only their own
cause, and at the same time passed by and cunningly overlooked the chief thing
&#8212; that the priesthood was connected with the worship of God. Now had they
attained what they wished, there would have been no God in the Church, but they
would have exercised over it a tyrannical power. But it has ever been, and is
still the will of God, to retain the supreme power over mortals in his own
hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Having now seen the design of the Prophet, we may
easily perceive the import of the whole subject. But before we proceed farther,
we must first observe, that we have here described to us the character of true
and legitimate priests; for the Prophet not only speaks of the office of
priests, but sets before us a living image in which we cannot be deceived: and
hence all who are engaged in the pastoral office may know what God requires from
them. I will only just mention what he first says &#8212; that God gave fear to
priests; for I have already given a sufficient explanation of this by saying,
that priests are not to abuse their right, as though the highest power were
granted to them; for God will not have his Church subject to tyranny, but his
will is to reign alone in it through the ministry of men. The main thing then to
be borne in mind is this &#8212; that a rule is prescribed to priests, that
though they preside and possess the first rank of honor among the people, it is
yet under certain conditions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We shall now consider only this which the Prophet
says &#8212; that Levi faithfully and sincerely performed his office, because
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the law of truth was in his
mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>no iniquity was found in his
lips</i></font><font face="Palatino">; to which we ought yet to add the general
truth which immediately follows &#8212; that the priest&#8217;s lips ought to
keep knowledge. It is then a law which cannot be abolished, that those who are
priests or pastors in the Church are to be teachers. And not unwisely does
Gregory apply a custom under the law to this subject; for we know that appended
to the priest&#8217;s dress were bells; and it is distinctly commanded by Moses,
that the priest should not go forth without this sound,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;022835&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
28:35.) Gregory, as I have said, accommodated this to teaching &#8212;
&#8220;Woe,&#8221; he says, &#8220;to us, if we go forth without sound, that is,
if we boast that we are pastors, and in the meantime are dumb dogs; for nothing
is less tolerable than that he who speaks not in the Church and whose voice is
not clearly heard to the edification of the people, should be deemed a
pastor.&#8221; This is what a Roman Pope has said. Let those who now proudly and
confidently boast themselves to be his successors, at least give the sound, and
let us hear what they teach: but as their whole power is exercised in cruelty,
it is evident how faithfully they keep God&#8217;s covenant! But I now return to
the words of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, that this law has been fixed by God, and
that it cannot be nullified by any decrees or customs of men, &#8212; that the
priest is to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>keep knowledge
</i></font><font face="Palatino">in his lips. He farther explains himself by
showing that the priest is to be the keeper of knowledge, not that he may
reserve it for himself, but that he may teach the whole people:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall
seek</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the law from his
mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and afterwards he confines knowledge to
true doctrine, as it was to flow from the law of God, the only true fountain of
truth; for he had said, that the law of truth was in the mouth of Levi. It would
not then be enough for one to have his mouth open and to be prepared to teach
others, except purity of doctrine be retained. We hence see, that not only
teaching is required from priests, but pure teaching, derived from the very
mouth of God, according to what is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;260317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
3:17,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Thou shalt receive
from my mouth the word, and shalt declare it to them from
me.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God shows there that the Prophets had no such
authority as that they could bring forth anything they pleased, or what they
thought would be right, but that they were so far faithful teachers as they were
his disciples alone: hence he bids him to seek the word from his mouth; and then
he adds, &#8220;Thou shalt declare it to them from my mouth.&#8221; So also it
is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242328&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
23:28,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;What is the chaff to the wheat?
The Prophet who has a dream, let him declare his dream; but he who has my word,
let him declare my word faithfully.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here God limits and defines the prophetic right, as
though he had said, that the Prophets were not appointed, that they might bring
anything indiscriminately, but that each, according to the measure of what was
revealed to him, might faithfully dispense, or deliver, as it were from hand to
hand, what he had received from heaven: for by mentioning two things, it was
God&#8217;s design to show that no doctrine is to be allowed, except what he
himself has revealed; and he compares to chaff whatever men devise themselves,
while the pure doctrine of the law is to be regarded as the wheat. This is then
the second thing to be noticed in what the Prophet says in this passage: but we
must also consider the last thing &#8212; that the priest is the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>messenger</i></font><font face="Palatino">
of the God of hosts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This seems to have been said in honor of the
priesthood; but the Prophet means that priests have nothing of their own or
separate from God, and that whatever reverence is due to them ought to be
referred to God himself, whose ministers they are. I have said that he reasons
from the definition itself, as though he had said, that every one who would be a
priest must also be a teacher. But we must also observe, that there is an
implied comparison between God and priests, as though he had said,
&#8220;Priests can claim nothing for themselves, but as interpreters of
God.&#8221; Hence, the plain conclusion is, that the priesthood takes away
nothing from God&#8217;s authority.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see that the Prophet includes in these few
words two things of great importance &#8212; that there is no priesthood without
doctrine or teaching, and no priest except he who faithfully performs his office
as a teacher: and secondly, that God resigns not his own right and power when
priests are set over the Church; for God commits to them the ministration only,
and on this condition, that the authority remains in himself alone; for
otherwise the priest would not be the messenger of the God of hosts. Among other
things the Prophet requires also this of the priests &#8212; that they sincerely
perform their duties. We indeed know that many apparently discharge their
office, and excel in teaching, and carefully apply to their duties; but ambition
stimulates some and avarice others. Hence the Prophet lays down another
condition &#8212; that they are to walk in uprightness before God; that is, that
they are not only to satisfy men, or to catch at the applause of the world, but
to discharge their office with a pure conscience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus have I shown that there is here set before our
eyes a pattern by which we may know what God requires from us when he makes us
pastors over his Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows a reprobation of their conduct, for the
Prophet says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have departed
from the way</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Since he so boldly chastises the
priests, we hence learn that they were subject to reproof; and nothing is more
unreasonable than that the Papal clergy should seek to be exempt from every law
and discipline, for the priests are here called to order, that they might know
their own faults: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have
departed</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the
way</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye have made many to err in the
law</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This second thing being added, the priests
ought by no means to be spared. When they sin only privately, though they may by
bad examples corrupt the Church, yet this may somehow be borne with; but when
they corrupt and deprave sound doctrine, when they subvert the order laid down
in the law, they deserve no indulgence. This is the reason why Malachi so
severely and so boldly reproves them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at last adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have therefore violated the
covenant</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This third clause may indeed be
explained in two ways, &#8212; that the Prophet proceeds with his reproof, or
that he draws a conclusion from the preceding clauses, &#8212; that they were
deservedly stripped of all honor, because they stood not to the covenant. Now
this latter exposition is the most suitable, according to what I have already
stated. He then as I have said, draws this conclusion, that their boasting was
foolish, that they in vain said that they were a holy tribe whom God had chosen
to be a peculiar possession to himself, for he says that the covenant of Levi
had been violated by them; and this clause is set in opposition to the former,
in which he says, ye shall know that my covenant was with Levi. We said then
that the unfaithful ever contrive some disguise when they are reproved, as
though they would deprive God of his right: so the Levitical priests said, that
what God had once established could not be made void. Under this pretext, that
they were of the holy tribe, they sought to be deemed holy; the Prophet then
said to them, ye shall know that God&#8217;s covenant is holy, and that ye are
not holy. So also in this place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have
violated</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn22</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
the covenant of Levi</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, &#8220;ye in
vain pretend that you have been chosen by God, and that the honor of your
priesthood has been confirmed to you; for God intended that his law, laid down
by himself, should be kept. As then ye have violated the covenant of Levi, ye
are no more Levites; as ye are become degenerated children, your inheritance is
rightly taken away from you, and ye are deprived of the honor of the
priesthood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And corresponding with this view is what follows,

the body of thy only-begotten Son; and as he is the chief and the only true and
perpetual priest, may we become partakers of that priesthood with which thou

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-FIFTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE said yesterday, that the priests of the ancient
Church were made its guides on the condition that they faithfully discharged
their office, and further, that when wicked priests who acted perfidiously in
their office boasted of their dignity, this false pretense was to be deemed as
nothing, the title being claimed without the reality. These two things we have
explained.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must now see whether this applies to the state and
discipline of the Christian Church. The Papists deny this, for they wish to rule
freely and with unbridled license, and to perform nothing to God, as though
their very dignity nullified his authority; but they cannot shake off the yoke,
except they deprive God of all his right. Nor is it a wonder that they act in
this way; for even under the law the Prophet had a hard contest with ungodly
priests, who had fallen away from the duties of their office, their calling
being ever in their mouths, though they very far departed from the law which God
had prescribed to them. There is therefore nothing new in the case of the
Papists, who seek to be free from every law, that they may do whatever they
please and despise all reproofs; for they indeed possess power, and that
tyrannical and barbarous. But what they say we ought to disregard, for God
declares from above what we here read in the Prophet&#8217;s words, &#8212; that
he so rules the Church, that he is supreme above all mortals. It was not
God&#8217;s will, most surely, after Christ&#8217;s coming in the flesh, to
abandon the care and government of his Church, nor was it his will to be forced
to submit as a private individual. If then the authority of God remains at this
day safe and secure, it follows that nothing is changed in this respect as to
his right over the priesthood. Whatever authority they pretend, who would be
deemed pastors of the Church, they must necessarily so continue in their station
as faithfully to perform the office which has been committed to them from above;
for as God has raised them to that great honor, so he has also stipulated with
them, that they should faithfully rule the Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But if the Papal clergy compare themselves with the
Levitical priests, they will find that the latter had the advantage; for God, as
it is well known, instituted an hereditary priesthood under the law. His purpose
was, that after the coming of Christ pastors should be made by the suffrages of
the Church; but the Levitical tribe claimed this honor as their own right under
the law; for God had deposited the right and honor of the priesthood in that
tribe. If then the Papists contend that more is due to them than to the
Levitical priests, their claim is absurd; for there is no hereditary right, so
that sons succeed their fathers in the ministry or pastoral office. We hence see
that if a comparison be in this respect made, the priesthood under the law was
as to succession far more important. And we know also what God had promised to
Aaron and to his successors. From Aaron the dignity passed to the posterity of
Phinehas, and he seems to have been favored, and also his descendants, with an
unalienable right. But God here expostulates with the priests, because they had
violated the compact; and hence he says that he was no longer bound to them,
because they had become covenant-breakers and apostates. Let now the Pope, with
all his party, pretend what they please, most certain it is, that all they can
allege vanish into nothing compared with the lofty claims which the Levitical
priests might have apparently made.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Pope says that the apostolic seat was fixed at
Rome, because it was said to Peter, &#8220;Thou art Peter,&#8221; etc.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401618&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
16:18.) I will not stop here to refute trifles of this kind; for there is no
need of many words in discussing this point &#8212; whether this ought to be
confined to the person of Peter, or whether it is to be extended to others; as
it is not there stated. He says that Peter was a Roman bishop. Though this be
conceded, (which yet can be easily disproved by history,) it does not follow
that the primacy by a sort of hereditary right was transferred to all Roman
bishops. Hence the succession, of which they proudly boast, is a mere fume. But
were we to grant all they require, we must make this exception, &#8212; that the
priesthood was not fixed to the place, so that every one called the bishop of
the Roman Church should at the same time obtain the primacy, and be reputed head
of the whole Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must also in the second place see what sort of
thing is the Papal priesthood; for though that beast appoints his own priests,
it follows not that it is the ordination of Christ: nor is it anything like it.
For what is a priest under the Papacy? even one who sacrifices Christ, that is,
who robs Christ of that honor which the heavenly Father has confirmed to him by
a solemn oath. Christ was called a priest; and this honor, as I have just said,
was confirmed to him by an oath. All the Papal priests are inaugurated into
their office, it at they may sacrifice: &#8220;We give to thee power to offer
appeasing sacrifices;&#8221; for thus they inaugurate them: and such words are
suitable to the Papists; for those magical superstitions, which the Romans
formerly used, continue still under the Papacy. We hence see, that when we
examine the Papal priesthood according to the rule of Christ, it is altogether
profane, nay, wholly sacrilegious.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But were their calling lawful, were we to grant that
they are pastors of the Church, by a continued succession from the apostles, we
must yet deny that they are to be allowed to claim all kinds of liberty and to
tyrannize over the Church without being reproved; for whence do they derive such
a privilege?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We therefore in short draw this conclusion &#8212;
that what we read here of the Levitical priests not only applies to the Papal
priests, but also bears with much more force against them; for they have no
hereditary honor, their calling is not true nor legitimate, and they cannot be
counted the pastors of the Church; on the other hand, they deprive Christ of his
honor, yea, they daily sacrifice and slay him. We hence conclude, that they
ought by no means to be suffered in the Church, for the covenant of God ought to
remain inviolable; and what is it? that they keep the law of God in their mouth,
and be his messengers and interpreters. When we see that these are dumb idols,
yea, when we see that they turn the whole truth of God into falsehood, how can
this barbarity be suffered? God is excluded, and the devil himself in the
persons of men adulterates the whole worship of God, perverts, demolishes, and
even reduces to nothing the whole of religion! and he also fills with lies the
Church, which ought to be the sanctuary of truth!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These things might have been more fully handled; but
it is enough briefly to show how foolishly the Papal clergy boast that they
possess the honor of the priesthood, when yet it is evident that there is no
right, no authority, when faith is not kept with God and with his Church. Let us
now proceeds</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet accuses the Jews here of another crime
&#8212; that they were perfidious towards God and their own brethren, and
departed from that pre-eminence into which God had raised them, when they were
chosen in preference to other nations to be a holy and peculiar people. This
ingratitude the Prophet now condemns by saying, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all had one father, and that they
had been all created by one
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Father</i></font><font face="Palatino">
may be applied to God as well as to Abraham, and some interpreters will have it
repeated, which is no uncommon thing in Hebrew: they say then that all had God
as their Father, because he created them all; so that the latter clause is taken
as an explanation. But it is better, as I think, to apply the word to Abraham,
and the passage requires this; for it follows at the end of the verse, that the
covenant which the Lord had made with their fathers had been violated; and this
will appear still more certain, when we bear in mind the design of the Prophet. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn25</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Presently a reproof follows, because they had taken many wives; but the Prophet
seems not as yet to mention this vice, but speaks generally, that they did not
preserve that purity to which they had been called, for they indiscriminately
married heathen wives. As then they mingled without distinction with unbelievers
and the despisers of God, the Prophet complains that they were unmindful of that
dignity to which they had been elevated, when God deigned to adopt them as his
holy people. For thus it happened, that the pre-eminence which Moses celebrates
in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;050408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
4:8, disappeared, &#8220;What nation is so renowned, to whom God draws nigh, as
thou seest that he is nigh to thee?&#8221; When therefore the Jews rendered
themselves vile, the Prophet condemns them for ingratitude. He, at the same
time, shows that they were become inhuman towards their brethren, with whom they
had been united by a most sacred bond. It then seems probable to me, that God
and Abraham are mentioned here, because God had chosen the race of Abraham and
adopted them as his people, and also, because he had deposited his covenant with
Abraham and the fathers: thus Abraham became, as it were, the mediator of the
covenant which God made with his whole race. By thus understanding the subject
of the Prophet, it is easier for us to see why he mentions Abraham as well as
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is there not one
father</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to us
all?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, &#8220;Did not God select us from
the rest of the world, when he promised to our father Abraham to be a God to him
and to his seed? Since then God&#8217;s favor has flowed to us from that
fountain, what sottishness it is to break that sacred bond by which God has
joined us to himself in the person of Abraham?&#8221; For when the Jews did not
consider that they derived their origin from the holy patriarch, the consequence
was, that the covenant of God with them became void and of no effect. This then
is the reason why he says, that one God was to them all a Father. And as other
nations might have claimed the same privilege, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Has not one God created us?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He shows that the Jews had descended in no
common or ordinary way from their holy father Abraham, but that God was the
maker of his race, that he created them. Did not he also create the rest of the
world? Not in the same manner; for this creation ought to be confined especially
to the Church. God has created the whole human race; but he created also the
race of Abraham: and hence the Church is often called in Isaiah the work and the
formation of God,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;236621&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
66:21,) and Paul also adopts the same mode of speaking,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:10.) Our Prophet then does not mean that the Jews had been created by God when
born into this world, but that they had become his holy and peculiar people. As
then God had thus created the Jews, and had given to them one father, that being
mindful of their origin they might remain united in true religion, the Prophet
here reprobates their sottishness in casting away from themselves this
invaluable favor of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every one dealt falsely with his
brother</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and thus they violated the covenant of
the fathers. As to the verb,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dgkn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nubegad</i>, it has been variously explained by grammarians; but as to what
is meant it is agreed, that the Jews are here condemned, because they were not
only perfidious to God, but also fraudulent as to their neighbors: and thus they
doubled their perfidy, the proof which was manifest, because they did not act
with sincerity towards their brethren. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn26</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then, he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>do we deal falsely
with man, that is, every one with his own brother, so that we pollute the
covenant of our fathers? </i></font><font face="Palatino">Here the covenant of
the fathers is to be taken for that separation or laying apart which we have
mentioned, by which God had adopted Abraham and his posterity, that they might
be separated from all the nations of the world. Hence under this covenant of the
fathers is God himself included; and as this has not been perceived, it is no
wonder that this passage has been so frigidly explained, and that Malachi has
been as it were wholly buried in darkness; though interpreters have tried to
bring light, yet the effect has been to pervert the real meaning of the Prophet.
But it appears now plain, I think, that the Jews are here said to be guilty of a
twofold perfidy &#8212; because they rejected the honor offered to them by
God&#8217;s gratuitous election, and also because they acted fraudulently
towards their own brethren. It hence followed that the covenant of the fathers,
that is, what God had deposited with the patriarchs, that it might come from
hand to hand to their posterity, had been violated and made void by their
wickedness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must yet notice what I have already referred to
&#8212; that the priests are so reproved that the whole people are also
included; and this we shall again presently see, and I add also, that the
Prophet connects God with Abraham, in order to show that we shall fail to seek
God effectually, if we seek him apart from his covenant, and also that our minds
ought not to be fixed on men. There are indeed two vices against which we ought
carefully to guard. Some, passing by all means, seek to fly upward to God; and
so they entertain many vain thoughts and devise for themselves many labyrinths,
from which they never emerge. We see how many fanatics there are at this day,
who proudly speak against God&#8217;s word, and yet touch neither heaven nor
earth; and why? because they would be superior to angels, and do not acknowledge
that they need any helps by which they might by degrees, according to their
weakness, ascend up to God himself. Now this is to seek God without the covenant
or without the word. This is the reason why the Prophet here unites father
Abraham to God himself; it was done that the Jews might know that they were
confined by certain limits, in order that they might in humility make progress
in God&#8217;s school, and be carried by degrees into heaven: for God, as it has
been said, had deposited his covenant with Abraham. But yet as they might have
depended on a mortal man, the Prophet adds a corrective &#8212; that they had
been </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>created by
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for they were not to separate their father
Abraham from the very author of the covenant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage then is worthy of special notice; for
men from the beginning and in all ages have been inclined to the two vices which
I have mentioned; and at this day we see that some indulge their dreams and
despise the outward preaching of the word; for many fanatics say, that there is
no need of rudiments or of the first elements, since God has promised that the
sons of the Church would be spiritual. Hence Satan by such delusions strives to
draw us away from pure simplicity of doctrine. It is therefore necessary to set
up this shield &#8212; that God is not exhibited to us without Abraham, that is,
without a Prophet and an interpreter. The Papists are also sunk in the same mud;
for they have always the fathers in their mouths, but make no account of God.
This is also very preposterous. Let us then remember that God is not to be
separated from his word, and that the authority of men is of no account, when
they depart from it. And the Prophet confirms the same thing at the end of the
verse, when he speaks of the covenant of the fathers; for he does not here
simply commend the covenant of the fathers, as the Turks might do, or as it is
done by Papists and Jews; but he means the covenant which God had given, and
which the holy patriarchs faithfully handed down to their posterity, according
to what Paul says in the twenty-second chapter of the Acts, when speaking of his
father&#8217;s religion; he did not speak of it as heathens might do of their
religion, but he took it as granted that the law promulgated by Moses was not
his invention, but had God as its author. It now follows-</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dgbn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nubegad</i>, &#8220;Why do we deal perfidiously every one with his
brother?&#8221; I doubt not but that it is repeated here in the same sense. But
as I have already stated, he shows the crime to be detestable, and says that it
existed in </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judah and in
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God had indeed, as it is well known,
preferred that tribe to others; and it was not a common favor that the Jews
almost alone returned to their own country, while others nearly all remained in
their dispersions. He adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
not for honor&#8217;s sake, but for greater reproach, as though he had said,
that not only some of the race of Abraham were subject to this condemnation, but
that even the Jews were so, who had been allowed to return to their own country,
and that even the holy city rendered itself subject to this reproof, in which
the temple was, the sanctuary of God, which was then alone the true one in the
whole world. By these circumstances then does the Prophet enhance their
crime.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he immediately comes to particulars:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Polluted</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has Judah the holiness
of Jehovah, which he loved</i></font><font face="Palatino">;

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;dq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kodash</i>, for the sanctuary or the temple; others for the keeping of the
law; but I prefer to apply it to the covenant itself; and we might suitably take
it in a collective sense, except the simpler meaning be more approved &#8212;
that Judah polluted his separation. As to the Prophet&#8217;s object and the
subject itself, he charges them here, I have no doubt, with profanation, because
the Jews rendered themselves vile, though God had consecrated them to himself.
They had then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>polluted
holiness</i></font><font face="Palatino">, even when they had been separated
from the world; for they had disregarded so great an honor, by which they might
have been pre-eminent, had they continued in their integrity. It may be also
taken collectively, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they have
polluted holiness</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, they have polluted
that nation which has been separated from other nations: but as this exposition
may seem hard and somewhat strained, I am inclined to think that what is here
meant is that separation by which the Jews were known from other nations. But
yet what I have stated may serve to remove whatever obscurity there may be. And
that this holiness ought to be referred to that gratuitous election by which God
had adopted the Jews as his peculiar people, is evident from what the Prophet
says, that they married foreign wives. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn29</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We then see the purpose of this passage, which is to
show, &#8212; that the Jews were ungrateful to God, because they mingled with
heathen nations, and knowingly and wilfully cast aside that glory by which God
had adorned them by choosing them, as Moses says, to be to him a royal
priesthood.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;021906&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
19:6.) Holiness, we know, was much recommended to the Jews, in order that they
might not abandon themselves to any of the pollutions of the heathens. Hence God
had forbidden them under the law to take foreign wives, except they were first
purified, as we find in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;052111&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
21:11,12; if any one wished to marry a captive, she was to have her head shaven
and her nails pared; by which it was intimated, that such women were impure, and
that their husbands would be contaminated, except they were first purified. And,
yet it was not wholly a blameless thing, when one observed the law as to a
captive: but it was a lust abominable to God, when they were not content with
their own nation, and burnt in love with strange women. As however the Jews,
like all mortals without exception, were inclined to corruptions, God purposed
to keep them together as one people, lest the wife by her flatteries should draw
the husband away from the pure and legitimate worship of God. And Moses tells
us, that there was a crafty counsel given by Balsam when he saw that the people
could not be conquered in open war; he at length invented this artifice, that
the heathens should offer to them their wives and their daughters. It hence
happened that the people provoked God&#8217;s wrath, as we find it recorded in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;042504&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
25:4.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As then the Jews after their return had again lapsed
into this corruption, it is not without reason that the Prophet so severely
reproves them, and that he says, that by marrying strange women they had
polluted holiness, or that separation, which was their great honor, as God had
adopted them alone as his people; and he calls it a holiness which God loved.
Thus their crime was doubled, because God had not only bound them to himself,
but he had also embraced them gratuitously. For if the cause of the separation
be enquired, whether they excelled other nations, or whether they had any
worthiness or merit? the answer is, No; but God loved them freely. For by the
word love, the Prophet means the mere kindness and bounty of God, with which he
favored Abraham and his race, without regard to any worthiness or excellency. He
therefore condemns them for this ingratitude, because they had not only departed
from the covenant which the Lord had made with their fathers, but had also
neglected and despised that gratuitous love, which ought to have softened even
their iron hearts. For if God had found anything in them as a reason why he
preferred them to other nations, they might have been more excusable, at least
they might have extenuated their fault; but since God had adopted them as his
peculiar people, though they were unworthy and wholly undeserving, they must
surely have been extremely brutish, to have thus despised the gratuitous favor
of God. Their baseness then is increased, as I have said, by this circumstance,
&#8212; that so great a kindness of God did not turn their hearts to
obedience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the end of the verse the Prophet makes known, as I
have already stated, their profanation; they had married the daughters
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of another
god</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By way of reproach he calls them the
daughters of a strange god. He might have simply said foreign daughters; but he
intended here to imply a comparison between the God of Israel and idols: as
though he had said, &#8220;Whence have these wives come to you? from idols. Ye
ought then to have hated them as monsters: had you any religion in your heart,
what but detestable to you must have been everything which may have come from
idols? but your hearts have become attached to the daughters of false
gods.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And we find that this vice had been condemned by
Moses, and branded with reproach, before the giving of the Law, when he said,
that the human race had been corrupted, because the sons of God married the
daughters of men,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
6:2,) even because the posterity of Seth, who were born of the holy family,
degraded themselves and polluted that small portion, which was holy and
consecrated to God, by mixing with the world; for the whole world had at that
time departed from God, except the descendants of Seth. The Lord then had before
the Law marked this lust with perpetual disgrace; but when the Law itself which
ought to have been like a rampart, again condemned it, was it not a perverseness
wholly inexcusable, when the wantonness of the people broke through all
restraints? He then adds &#8212;</font><br></div>

to the dead; but by the mover, I have no doubt, he understands every one who was
in power, and could command others, and by the respondent the man who was
subject to the authority of his master. The masters then prompted or roused, for
it belonged to them to command; and the servants responded, for it was their
duty to receive orders and to obey them. It is the same as though the Prophet
had said, that God would punish this perfidy, without passing by any, so that he
would spare neither the common people nor the chief men: and he also adds the
priests, intimating, that the priests themselves would not be
excepted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, he denounces punishment on the Jews
universally, and shows that however prevalent had this impiety become
everywhere, and that though every one thought that whatever was commonly
practiced was lawful, yet God would become an avenger, and would include in the
same punishment both the masters and the servants, and would not exempt the
priests, who considered themselves safe by peculiar privilege. The rest

<div><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet amplifies again the fault of the priests,
because the people, when they perceived that God was adverse to them, found no
means of pacifying him. And when men have an idea that God is inexorable to
them, every zeal for religion must necessarily decay; and hence it is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
130:4 &#8212; &#8220;With thee is propitiation, that thou mayest be
feared.&#8221; As the people then gained nothing by sacrificing, they had now
nearly fallen off from divine worship. This evil, a most grievous one, the
Prophet says, was to be justly ascribed to the priests; for as they were become
polluted, how could their persons have been accepted by God, that they might be
mediators to expiate sins and to pacify God?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the real meaning of the Prophet, which none
of the interpreters have perceived. The Rabbins think that the priests are here
reproved, because their wives filled the altar in the sanctuary with weeping,
because they saw that their husbands did not faithfully treat them, according to
the law of marriage; and almost all have agreed with them. Thus then they
explain the verse &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have
in the second place done this</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is,
&#8220;That sin was of itself sufficiently grievous, when ye suffered lean
victims to be sacrificed to me, as it were in mockery; but in addition to this
comes your sin against your wives, who continually complain and deplore their
condition before the altar of God, even because they are not loved by you, as
the right of marriage requires.&#8221; They thus refer the tears, the weeping,
and lamentation, to the wives of the priests, which were so cruelly treated by
their husbands: they were not able to do anything else than to fill God&#8217;s
sanctuary with their constant complaints. Hence they render,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twnp dw[
&#710;yam</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>main oud penut</i>, &#8220;I will not
therefore regard,&#8221; or, &#8220;no one regards;&#8221; but both versions are
not only obscure, but wholly pervert the sense of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what I have already stated is the most suitable
&#8212; that it was to be ascribed to the priests that no one could from the
heart worship God, at least with a cheerful and willing mind; for God was
implacable to the people, because the only way of obtaining favor under the law
was when the priests, who represented the Mediator, humbly entreated pardon in
the name of the whole people. But how could God attend to the prayers of the
priests when they had polluted his altar by the filth of wickedness? We then see
the object of this amplification &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye cover the altar of Jehovah
with tears, with weeping and wailing</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The
praises of God ought to have resounded in the temple, according to what is said
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Praise, O God,
waits for thee in Zion.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;196501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
65:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the principal sacrifice was, that the people
exercised themselves in contemplating the blessings of God, and in thanksgiving.
But he says that none went forth before the altar with a cheerful mind, but all
were sad and sorrowful, because they found that God was severe and
rigid.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the reason is added &#8212;
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twnp dw[
&#710;yam</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>main oud penut</i>, literally,
&#8220;Is it not any more by regarding,&#8221; etc.? It is easy to see how far
they depart from the meaning of the Prophet who read &#8212; &#8220;They shall
therefore offer no more;&#8221; for is this to be applied to God? Others also,
who give this rendering &#8212; &#8220;I shall not therefore accept,&#8221;
pervert also the very letter of the text. But the most appropriate meaning is
this &#8212; that all wept and groaned before the altar, because they saw that
they came there without any advantage, that their sacrifices did not please God,
and that the whole worship was in vain, inasmuch as God did not answer their
prayers. The Prophet ascribes the fault to the priests, that God did not turn to
mercy, so as to forgive the people when they sacrificed. With weeping, then, he
says, was the altar filled or covered, because God received not <i>what pleased
him from their hand</i>; that is, because no victims pleased him which were
offered by polluted and impure hands.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet tells us here as before how prone the
priests were to make a clamor, and it is a very common thing with hypocrites
immediately to set up a shield to cover their vices whenever they are reproved;
and hence it appears, that men are in a manner fascinated by Satan, when they
attain such hardness as to dare to answer God, and with obstreperous words to
repel all warnings. Malachi has several times already used this mode of
speaking; we may hence conclude, that the people had become then so hardened
that warnings were of no account with them. But he mentions one particular, by
which it seems evident that they had lapsed into vices which were not to be
borne. There is indeed no doubt but that he points out one of the many vices
which prevailed. There is then in this verse an instance of stating one thing
for the whole, as though he had said, &#8220;Your hypocrisy is extremely gross;
but, to omit other things, by what pretext can you excuse this perfidy &#8212;
that there is no conjugal fidelity among you? Were there any integrity and a
sense of religion in men, they would surely appear in their conjugal connection;
but ye have cast away all shame, and have taken to yourselves many wives. There
is then no ground for you to think that you can escape by evasions, because this
one glaring vice sufficiently proves your guilt.&#8221; This is the import of
the Prophet&#8217;s answer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have indeed seen that the priests were implicated
in other vices; the Prophet then does not now charge them with perfidy as though
they were free from other sins, but he meant to show, as I have already said, by
one thing, how wickedly and shamelessly they sought to evade God&#8217;s
judgment, though they had violated the marriage pledge, which was wholly to
destroy the very order of nature; for there can be, as it has been already said,
no chastity in social life except the bond of marriage be preserved, for
marriage, so to speak, is the fountain of mankind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But in order to press the matter more on the priests,
he calls their attention to the fact that God is the founder of marriage.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Testified has
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>between thee and thy
wife</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn32</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
intimates in these words, that when a marriage takes place between a man and a
woman, God presides and requires a mutual pledge from both. Hence Solomon, in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;200217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
2:17, calls marriage the covenant of God, for it is superior to all human
contracts. So also Malachi declares, that God is as it were the stipulator, who
by his authority joins the man to the woman, and sanctions the alliance: God
then has </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>testified between thee
and thy wife</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as though he had said,
&#8220;Thou hast violated not only all human laws, but also the compact which
God himself has consecrated, and which ought justly to be deemed more sacred
than all other compacts: as then God has testified between thee and thy wife,
and thou now deceivest her, how darest thou to come to the altar? and how canst
thou think that God will be pleased with thy sacrifices or regard thy
oblations?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls her
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wife of his
youth</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because the more filthy is the lust when
husbands cast away conjugal love as to those wives whom they have married in
their youth. The bond of marriage is indeed in all cases inviolable, even
between the old, but it is a circumstance which increases the turpitude of the
deed, when any one alienates himself from a wife whom he married when a girl and
in the flower of her age: for youth conciliates love; and we also see that when
a husband and his wife have lived together for many years, mutual love prevails
between them to extreme old age, because their hearts were united together in
their youth. It is not then without reason that this circumstance is mentioned,
for the lust of the priests was the more filthy and as it were the more
monstrous, because they forsook wives whom they ought to have regarded with the
tenderest love, as they had married them when they were young:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast dealt unfaithfully with
her, he says, though she was thy consort and the wife of thy
covenant</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls her a consort, or companion, or associate, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because
marriage, we know, is contracted on this condition &#8212; that the wife is to
become as it were the half part of the man. As then the bond of marriage is
inseparable, the Prophet here goads the priests, yea, touches them to the quick,
when he reproves them for being unmindful of what was natural, inasmuch as they
had blotted out of their minds the memory of a most sacred covenant. The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wife of thy
covenant</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is to be taken for a covenanted wife,
that is, &#8220;The wife who has been united to thee by God&#8217;s authority,
that there might be no separation; but all integrity is violated, and as it were
abolished.&#8221; He then adds</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">There is in this verse some obscurity, and hence it
has been that no interpreter has come to the meaning of the Prophet. The Rabbins
almost all agree that Abraham is spoken of here. Were we to receive this view a
two-fold meaning might be given. It may be an objection, &#8212; &#8220;Has not
one done this?&#8221; that is, has not Abraham, who is the one father of the
nations, given us an example? for he married many wives: and thus many explain
the passage, as though the priests raised an objection and defended the
corruption just condemned by the example of Abraham, &#8212; &#8220;Has not one
done this while yet an excellency of spirit was in him?&#8221; We indeed know
how prone men are to pretend the authority of fathers when they wish to cover
their own vices.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Others prefer regarding the words as spoken by the
Prophet himself, and at the same time say that there is here an anticipation of
an objection, and think that an occasion for an excuse is here cut off, as
though the Prophet had said, &#8220;Did not Abraham, when he was one alone, do
this?&#8221; For as the Jews might have adduced the example of Abraham, the
interpreters, whose opinion I now refer to, think that a difference is here
stated, as though he had said, &#8220;Ye reason badly, for every one of you is
led to polygamy by the lust of your flesh; but it was far otherwise with
Abraham, for he was one, that is, alone;&#8221; and in Isaiah Abraham is called
one on account of his having no children. The meaning then they think is this,
&#8220;Was not Abraham forced by necessity to take another wife? even because he
had no child and no hope of the promised seed. Lust then did not stimulate your
father Abraham, as it does you, but a desire of having an offspring.&#8221; And
they think, that this view is confirmed by what follows, &#8220;And why alone
seeking the seed of God?&#8221; that is, the object of holy Abraham was far
otherwise than to indulge his lust; for he sought that holy seed, the hope of
which was taken away from him on account of the barrenness of his wife, and of
her great age. When therefore Abraham saw that his wife was barren, and that she
could no more conceive on account of her old age, he had recourse to the last
remedy: hence the mistake of Abraham might have been excused, since his object
was right; for he sought the seed of God, the seed in which all nations were to
be blessed. Thus far have I told you what others think.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I thought twelve years ago that this passage ought to
have been otherwise rendered in the French Bibles, and that,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dja</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ached</i>, ought to be read in the objective case; &#8220;Has he not made
one?&#8221; <i>Jerome</i> seems to me to have had a better notion of what the
Prophet means than what others have taught; but he could not attain the real
meaning, and therefore stopped as it were in the middle of his course. He read
the word in the nominative case, &#8220;Has not one,&#8221; that is, God,
&#8220;made them? &#8220;and then he added, &#8220;And in him alone,&#8221; that
is, Abraham, &#8220;was an exuberant spirit.&#8221; We see how he dared not to
assert anything, nor did he explain what was necessary. The sense is indeed
suspended, and is even frigid, if we say, &#8220;Has not one made them?&#8221;
but if we read, &#8220;Has he not made one?&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn34</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> there
is no ambiguity. It is a common thing in Hebrew, we know, that the name of God
is often not expressed, when he is referred to; for so great is He, that his
name may be easily understood, though not expressed. It ought not therefore to
confuse us, that the Prophet withholds the name of God, and mentions a verb
without its subject, for such is the usage, as I have said, of the Hebrew
language.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I proceed now to explain the meaning of the Prophet.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Has he not made one?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">that is, Was not God content with one man, when
he instituted marriage? and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yet
the residue of the Spirit was in him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The
Rabbins take,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ra&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shar</i>, as meaning excellence; but I know not what reason have induced
them, except that they ventured to change the sense of the word, because they
could not otherwise extricate themselves; for the mistake, that Abraham is
spoken of here, had wholly possessed their minds. What then is,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jwr
ra&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>shar</i> <i>ruch</i>? Excellence of
Spirit, say they; but,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ra&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shar</i>, we know, is residue or remnant: what then remains of anything is
called,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ra&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shar</i>; for the verb means to remain and to lean. Here then the Prophet
takes the residue of the Spirit, so to speak, for overflowing power; for God
could have given to one man two or three wives; inasmuch as the Spirit failed
him not in forming one woman: as he inspired Eve with life, so also he might
have created other women and imparted to them his Spirit. He might then have
given two or four or ten women to one man; for there was a spirit remaining in
him. We now then understand what the Prophet means at the beginning of this
verse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But before we proceed farther, we must bear in mind
his object, which was, to break down all those frivolous pretences by which the
Jews sought to cover their perfidy. He says, that in marriage we ought to
recognize an ordinance divinely appointed, or, to speak more distinctly, that
the institution of marriage is a perpetual law, which it is not right to
violate: there is therefore no cause for men to devise for themselves various
laws, for God&#8217;s authority is here to be regarded alone; and this is more
clearly explained in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401908&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
19:8; where Christ, refuting the objection of the Jews as to divorce, says,
&#8220;From the beginning it was not so.&#8221; Though the law allowed a bill of
divorce to be given to wives, yet Christ denies this to be right, &#8212; by
what argument? even because the institution was not of that kind; for it was, as
it has been said, an inviolable bond. So now our Prophet reasons,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Has not God made one?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">that is, &#8220;consider within yourselves
whether God, when he created man and instituted marriage, gave many wives to one
man? By no means. Ye see then that spurious and contrary to the character of a
true and pure marriage is everything, that does not harmonize with its first
institution.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But some one may ask here, why the Prophet says that
God made one? for this seems to refer to the man and not to the woman: to this I
answer, that man with the woman is called one, according to what Moses
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;God created man;
male and female created he
them,&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
1:17.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">After having said that man was created, he adds by
way of explanation, that man, both male and female, was created. Hence when he
speaks of man, the male makes as it were one-half, and the female the other; for
when we speak of the whole human race, one-half doubtless consists of men, and
the other half of women. So also when we come to individuals, the husband is as
it were the half of the man, and the woman is the other half. I speak of the
ordinary state of things; for if any one objects and says, that bachelors are
not then complete or perfect men, the objection is frivolous: but as men were
created, that every one should have his own wife, I say, that husband and wife
make but one whole man. This then is the reason why the Prophet says, that one
man was made by God; for he united the man to the woman, and intended that they
should be partners, so to speak, under one yoke. And in this explanation there
is nothing strained; for it is evident that the Prophet here calls the attention
of the Jews to the true character of marriage; and this could not have been
otherwise known than from the very institution of God, which is, as we have
said, a perpetual and inviolable law; for God created man, even male and female:
and Christ also has repeated this sentence, and carefully explained it in the
passage which we have quoted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And here the Prophet sharply goads the Jews, as
though they wished to overcome God, or to be more wise than he;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Had he not, he says, an
exuberance of spirit?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He takes spirit not for
wisdom, but for that hidden influence by which God vivifies men. Could not God,
he says, have put forth his spirit to create many wives for one man? but his
purpose was to create one pair; to make man a husband and a wife: as God then
was not without a remaining Spirit, and yet did not exceed this measure; it
hence follows, that the law of marriage is violated, when man seeks for himself
many wives. The meaning of the Prophet is now, I think, sufficiently
clear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And wherefore
one</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">djah
hmw</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>vame, eached</i>? The interrogatory
particle,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>me</i>, refers to the cause, end, form, or manner; we may therefore properly
render it, For
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>what</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
or wherefore, has God made
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one</i></font><font face="Palatino">?
even to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seek the seed of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The seed of God is to be taken for what is
legitimate; for what is excellent is often called God in Hebrew, and also what
is free from all vice and blemish. He sought then the seed of God, that is, he
instituted marriage, that legitimate and pure offspring might be brought forth.
Hence then the Prophet indirectly shows, that all are spurious who proceed from
polygamy, because they cannot be deemed legitimate children; nor ought any to be
so counted but those who are born according to God&#8217;s institution. When a
husband violates his pledged faith to his wife, and takes another; as he
subverts the ordinance of marriage, so he cannot be a legitimate father. We now
perceive why the Prophet says, that it was God&#8217;s purpose to unite only one
wife to one man, in order that they might beget legitimate offspring, for he
shows by the effect how frivolous were the evasions which the Jews had recourse
to; for however they might contend, their very offspring would prove them liars,
as it would be spurious.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then draws this conclusion, Therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>watch ye over your
spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, &#8220; Take heed lest any
should deceive the wife of his covenant.&#8221; After having shown how
perversely they violated the marriage vow who rushed into polygamy, he here
counsels and exhorts them; and this is the best mode of teaching, to show first
what is right and lawful, and then to add exhortations. The Prophet then
endeavored first to convince the Jews that they were guilty of a nefarious
crime: for otherwise his exhortation would not have been received, as they would
have always a ready objection, &#8220;It is lawful for us to do so, for we
follow the example of our father Abraham; and further, this has been permitted
for a long time, and God would have never suffered it, were it wrong, to prevail
for so many ages among the people: it hence follows, that thou condemnest what
is lawful.&#8221; It was necessary, in the first place, to remove all these
false pretences: then follows the exhortation in its proper order, Watch over
your spirit; for he speaks of what has been, as it were, sufficiently proved.

<div><font face="Palatino">Here again the Prophet exaggerates the crime which
the priests regarded as nothing; for he says, that they sinned more grievously
than if they had repudiated their wives. We indeed know that repudiation,
properly speaking, had never been allowed by God; for though it was not punished
under the law, yet it was not permitted. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn36</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It was
the same as with a magistrate, who is constrained to bear many things which he
does not approve; for we cannot so deal with mankind as to restrain all vices.
It is indeed desirable, that no vice should be tolerated; but we must have a
regard to what is possible. Hence Moses has specified no punishment, according
to the heinousness of the crime, if one repudiated his wife; and yet it was
never permitted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But if a comparison be made, Malachi says, that it is
a lighter crime to dismiss a wife than to marry many wives. We hence learn how
abominable polygamy is in the sight of God. I do not consider polygamy to be
what the foolish Papists have made it, who call not those polygamists who have
many wives at the same time, but those who marry another when the former one is
dead. This is gross ignorance. Polygamy, properly so called, is when a person
takes many wives, as it was commonly done in the East: and those nations, we
know, have always been libidinous, and never observe the marriage vow. As then
their lasciviousness was so great that they were like brute beasts, every one
married several wives; and this abuse continues at this day among the Turks and
the Persian and other nations. Here, however, where God compares polygamy with
divorce, he says that polygamy is the worse and more detestable crime; for the
husband impurely connects himself with another woman, and then, not only deals
unfaithfully with his wife to whom he is bound, but also forcibly detains her:
thus his crime is doubled. For if he replies and says that he keeps the wife to
whom he is bound, he is yet an adulterer as to the second wife: thus he blends,
as they say, holy with profane things; and then to adultery and lasciviousness
he adds cruelty, for he holds under his authority a miserable woman, who would
prefer death to such a condition; for we know what power jealousy has over
women. And when any one introduces a harlot, how can a lawful wife bear such an
indignity without being miserably tormented?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This then is the reason why the Prophet now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If thou hatest,
dismiss</i></font><font face="Palatino">; not that he grants indulgence to
divorce, as we have said, but that he might by this circumstance enhance the
crime; and hence he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he
covers by a cloak his violence</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some
interpreters take violence here for spoil or prey, and think that the wife is
thus called who is tyrannically compelled to remain with an adulterer, when yet
she sees a harlot in her house, by whom she is driven from her conjugal bed: but
this is too strained and too remote from the letter of the text. The Prophet
here, I doubt not, shakes off from the Jews their false mask, because they
thought that they could cover over their vice by retaining their first wives.
&#8220;What else is this,&#8221; he says, &#8220;but to cover by a cloak your
violence, or at least to excuse it? for ye do not openly manifest it: but God is
not deceived, nor can his eye be dazzled by such a disguise: though then your
iniquity is covered by a cloak, it is not yet hid from God; nay, it is thus
doubled, because ye exercise your cruelty at home; for it would be better for
robbers to remain in the wood and there to kill strangers, than to entice guests
to their houses and to kill them there and to plunder them under the pretext of
hospitality. This is the way in which you act; for ye destroy the bond of
marriage, and ye afterwards deceive your miserable wives, and yet ye force them
by your tyranny to continue at your houses, and thus ye torment your miserable
wives, who might have enjoyed their freedom, if divorce had been granted
them.&#8221;  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn37</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He concludes again with these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Watch over your

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here reproves the Jews who expostulated
with God in their adversity, as though he had undeservedly forsaken them, and
had not brought them immediate help. Thus are hypocrites wont to do; unless God
immediately assists them, they not only indirectly complain, but also break out
into open blasphemies; for they think that God is bound to them, and hence they
assail him more boldly, and even with greater freedom and insolence. It is
indeed a proof of true piety when we patiently submit to the judgments of God,
and when, as Jeremiah teaches us by his own example,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;we sustain his
wrath, because we know that we have sinned.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240314&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
3:14.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as hypocrites are conscious of nothing wrong,
(for they flatter themselves, and stupify their own consciences,) because they
examine not themselves, they think that God acts unjustly towards them when he
does not immediately bring them aid. Such was the dishonesty of the people of
whom the Prophet now speaks.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that they had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wearied</i></font><font face="Palatino">
God, that is, that they had been troublesome to him by their clamorous
complaints; for the verb,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[gy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>igo</i>, means to be weary; he says then that they unreasonably complained of
God&#8217;s slowness. It is indeed a mode of speaking taken from men, for we
know that no passions belong to God; but as elsewhere God reproves them because
they saddened his Spirit,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19A633&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
106:33,) so he says here that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wearied</i></font><font face="Palatino">
him. We now perceive the Prophet&#8217;s meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there is a dilemma presented in the words; for
the Jews thought that God favored the wicked, inasmuch as he did not immediately
punish them, or that he was now unlike himself, and forgot his own nature. The
difficulty or the dilemma appears not at the first view, as they seemed to have
repeated the same thing. But in the first clause they accuse God of injustice;
and in the second they intimate that there is no God, for he cannot exist
without exercising judgment. Then the passages contains two clauses differing
from each other &#8212; &#8220;God has either changed his nature, and so is no
God, or he favors our enemies; for he does not immediately execute
vengeance.&#8221; We see then that they concluded that God either acted
unjustly, or that there was no God. But we have mentioned the cause of this
blasphemy &#8212; the Jews did not examine themselves, and therefore did not
confess that they deserved these chastisements. They were like vicious horses,
who kick and fling, though gently treated by their riders.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But such insolence is now seen in all masked men, who
vauntingly profess religion when they are treated according to their own wishes;
but when God deals more sharply with them, they not only murmur, but vomit
forth, as I have already said, impious slanders against him, as though he did
not render to them the reward due to their just dealings. Admonished by this
example, let us learn that it is true wisdom to humble ourselves under the
mighty hand of God,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 5:6;) and that though he may suspend the granting of our prayers, we ought
still to bear, not impatiently, what is hard and severe, and also to subdue our
feelings, and to seek from them the Spirit of meekness, to retain us in a
tranquil submission.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that they still replied &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In what have we wearied
thee?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn38</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Here he strongly reproves their hardness,
because they did not become wise through the rebuke given them, but regarded
with scorn the words of the Prophet, by which we clearly see that they must have
been convinced of their guilt, had they not been doubly stupid. It was an
intolerable reproach cast on God, to say that he favored the ungodly, and was
pleased with their crimes; for God would thus not only rule as a tyrant, but
also subvert all order. But nothing is more contrary to his nature than to hold
forth his hand to the ungodly as though he had an alliance with them. As this
then was an evident impiety, it was a monstrous stupidity to ask in what they
wearied God; they ought indeed to have known that he regards nothing as precious
as his own honor; and yet, as though Malachi had unjustly reproved them, they
opposed him with an iron front, according to similar instances which we have
before observed; for though they were covenant-breakers as to marriage, though
they defrauded God in the tenths, though they cunningly evaded the Prophets,
they yet as it were wiped their mouths and asked, In what had they sinned? The
Prophet shows that they were become so hardened in their contumacy that they
daringly rejected all admonitions; for they did not ask this as though it was a
doubtful thing, nor can it be concluded from their words that they were
teachable; but it was the same as if they were armed, ready for a contest, yea,
armed with effrontery and perverseness; for they no doubt despised and ridiculed
the Prophet&#8217;s reproof.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then answers them &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When ye say, Whosoever doeth evil
is acceptable in the eyes of Jehovah, and in them he
delights</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The word rendered
&#8220;acceptable&#8221; is
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bwf</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>thub</i>; but such is its meaning often in Hebrew. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn39</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> What
they said was, that the ungodly and the wicked pleased God, even because they
covered by false colors their sins, so that they were not convinced of anything
wrong. They then imputed whatever was evil to their enemies; they did not
commonly expostulate with God because he left sins unpunished, but because they
received not his aid. We hence see that the Jews here did not clamor and contend
with God through hatred of wickedness, but had only a regard to their own
advantages; nor did they condemn the sins of others, except those by which they
received some harm or loss, and that they considered none wicked except those by
whom they were injured. We hence learn that they did not complain through zeal
for what was right, but because they would have God bound to them to undertake
their cause like earthly patrons.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We indeed know that even the godly are sometimes
wearied, and their faith is ready to fail, when things in the world are in a
disturbed and confused state: and this was the case with David, as it is
recorded in the seventy-third Psalm; but there is in the servants and sincere
worshipers of God some concern for what is just and right, whenever they have
such grief and trouble of mind, according to the case of Habakkuk, when he
said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;How long, O
Lord!&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;350102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Habakkuk
1:2;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">for no doubt his complaint arose from a right
principle, because his desire was that God should be truly served in the world.
But there was nothing of this kind in the Jews, with whom our Prophet contends
here; for as we have said, there was no hatred of wickedness, but only a care
for their own advantage; they hence said, that the ungodly pleased God, because
God did not immediately interpose when they apprehended some trouble from their
enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The repetition is a proof of greater bitterness; for
they were not content with one clamorous expression, but added, that God took
delight in them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then follows the other clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>or where is the God of
judgment?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn40</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">They seem not here to reason amiss, that is,
from the nature of God. Men may change their counsel and their design, and
remain men still, for they are subject to inconstancy and fickleness; but to God
there belongs no change. There seems not then to be an impropriety in this
&#8212; that there is no God, except he be the judge of the world; for he cannot
divest himself of his office without denying himself. But they malignantly
impeached God; nay, they now insinuate that there is none, because he had
abdicated his judgment; for they took it as granted, that God had ceased to be
the punisher of wickedness, which was most false; but yet they thought that
according to facts it was certain and clear. Hence they concluded that there was
no God, as his divinity must have been abolished together with his judgment. We
hence see to what extent of insolence they burst forth in their complaints, so
that they either charged God with injustice, or alleged that his divinity was
annihilated. Now follows</font><br></div>

office it was to intercede, that God might not in his just wrath destroy the
whole people; for as then the majesty of God was more than could be borne
without an intercessor, so that the people through fear cried out &#8220;Speak
thou to us lest we die,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;022019&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
20:19,) so also now does Malachi teach us, that there is need of an intercessor,
by whom God&#8217;s wrath might be mitigated, which the Jews had extremely
provoked. This office John the Baptist undertook, who prepared the Jews to hear
the voice of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying that he would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>send a messenger to clear his
way</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he indirectly reproved the Jews, by whom
many hindrances were thrown as it were in the way; as though he had said,
&#8220;They prevent by the obstacles they raise up the redemption and the
promised salvation to be revealed: there will therefore be the need of a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>messenger to clear the
way</i></font><font face="Palatino">.&#8221; For the Jews had introduced
impediments, as though they designedly wished to resist the favor which had been
prepared and promised to them. But how the Baptist performed his work by
clearing the way, is evident from the fortieth chapter of Isaiah, as well as
from the Gospels; and hence may be gathered what I have already said &#8212;
that God by his fidelity and mercy struggled with those obstacles which the Jews
had raised up to prevent the coming of Christ.

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn43</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
come to his temple the Lord, whom ye seek</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
After having said that he would open a way for his favor, he now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>come shall the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He introduces here, not Jehovah, but the
Lord,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wda</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Adun</i>; and hence he speaks distinctly of Christ, who is afterwards called
the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Angel</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or Messenger </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the
covenant</i></font><font face="Palatino">. But the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wda</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Adun</i>, commonly used for a Mediator, as in Psalm 110, and also in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;270917&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
9:17; where it is expressly said, &#8220;Hear, O Jehovah, for the sake of the
Lord,&#8221; </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ynwda
&#710;[ml</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>lamon Aduni</i>; the word is the same
as here,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>come</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The reason for this mode of speaking was,
because Christ was shown to them under the type which re presented him. As then
the kingdom of David was a representation of the kingdom of Christ our Lord, it
is no wonder that the Prophets designate him by this title, especially those who
were the nearest to the time of Christ&#8217;s manifestation. But he is promised
by another title, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the angel
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or messenger
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the
covenant</i></font><font face="Palatino">; but it means not the same here as in
the first clause. He called John the Baptist at the beginning of this verse a
messenger, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the messenger
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of Jehovah; and now he calls Christ a
messenger, but he is the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>messenger of the
covenant</i></font><font face="Palatino">; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn44</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for it
was necessary that the covenant should be confirmed by him. The title of John
the Baptist was then inferior to that of Christ; for though he was God
manifested in the flesh, yet this did not prevent him from being God&#8217;s
minister and interpreter in order to confirm his covenant; and we know that the
office of Christ consists in confirming and sealing to us the covenant of God,
not only by his doctrine, but also by his blood and the sacrifice of his
cross.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Malachi then promises here to the Jews both a king
and a reconciler, &#8212; a king under tee title of Lord, &#8212; and a
reconciler under the title of the messenger of the covenant: and we know it was
the main thing in the whole doctrine of the law, that a Redeemer was to come, to
reconcile the Church to Cod and to rule it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says that the Mediator was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sought</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>expected</i></font><font face="Palatino">
by the Jews; and through him God was to be propitious to them: but this was not
said but ironically. The faithful indeed at this day have all their desires
fixed on Christ, after he has been revealed in the flesh, until they shall
partake at his last coming of the fruit of his death and resurrection; and under
the law we know that the groaning and the sighings of the godly were towards
Christ: but Malachi here, by way of contempt, checks these unreasonable charges,
by which the Jews accused God, as though he had disappointed their hope and
their prayers. For we have said, and the fact is evident, that God had been
presumptuously and shamefully impeached by them, as though he meant not to
fulfill his promises: hence the Prophet says ironically, and sharply too, that
Christ was expected by the Jews, for they murmured, because God had too long
deferred his coming: &#8220;O! where is the Redeemer? when will he be revealed
to us?&#8221; Since then they thus pretended that they earnestly expected the
coming of Christ, the Prophet upbraids them with this, and justly too, for they
had expressly manifested their unbelief.</font><br></div>

the majesty of God, he makes him the author of this prophecy. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet in this verse contends more sharply with
the Jews, and shows that it was a mere presence that they so much expected the
coming of the Mediator, for they were far different from him through the whole
course of their life. And when he says that the coming of Christ would be
intolerable, what is said is to be confined to the ungodly; for we know that
nothing is more delightful and sweeter to us than when Christ is nigh us: though
now we are pilgrims and at a distance from him, yet his invisible presence is
our chief joy and happiness.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450822&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:22, 23.) Besides, were not the expectation of his coming to sustain our minds,
how miserable would be our condition! It is therefore by this mark that the
faithful are to be distinguished, &#8212; that they expect his coming; and Paul
does not in vain exhort us, by the example of heaven and earth, to be like those
in travail, until Christ appears to us as our Redeemer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet here directs his discourse to the
ungodly, who though they seem to burn with desire for God&#8217;s presence, do
not yet wish him to be nigh them, but they flee from him as much as they can. We
have met with a similar passage in Amos,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Wo to those who desire the day of
the Lord! What will it be to you? for it will be darkness, yea darkness and not
light, a day of sorrow and not of joy.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;300518&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Amos
5:18.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Amos in this passage spoke on the same subject; for
the Jews, inflated with false confidence, thought that God could not forsake
them, as he had pledged his faith to them; but he reminded them that God had
been so provoked by their sins, that he was become their professed and sworn
enemy. So also in this place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
the Prophet says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>come shall the
Redeemer</i></font><font face="Palatino">; but this will avail you nothing; on
the contrary, his coming will be dreadful to you. We indeed know that Christ
appeared not for salvation to all, but only to the remnant, and to those of
Jacob who repented, according to what Isaiah says.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;231021&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
10:21, 22.) But since they obstinately rejected the favor of God, it is no
wonder that the Prophet excluded them from the blessings of the
Redeemer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who</i></font><font face="Palatino">
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will endure his
coming?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn46</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and who shall stand at his
appearance?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> as though he had said, &#8220;In
vain do ye flatter yourselves, and even upbraid God, that he retains the
promised Redeemer as it were hidden in his own bosom; for he will come in due
time, but without any advantage to you; nor will it be given you to enjoy his
favor; but on the contrary he will bring to you nothing but terrors; for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he will be like a purifying fire,
and as the herb of the fullers</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn47</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
latter clause may be taken in a good or a bad sense, as it is evident from the
next verse. The power of the fire, we know, is twofold; for it burns and it
purifies; it burns what is corrupt; but it purifies gold and silver from their
dross. The Prophet no doubt meant to include both, for in the next verse he
says, that Christ will be as fire to purify and to refine the sons of Levi as
gold and silver. With regard then to the people of whom he has been hitherto
speaking, he shows that Christ will be like fire, to burn and consume their
filth; for though they boasted with their mouth of their religion, yet we know
that the Church of God had many defilements and pollutions; they were therefore
to perish by fire. But Malachi teaches us at the same time, that the whole
Church was not to perish, for the Lord would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>purify the sons of
Levi</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is here a part stated for the whole; for the
promise belongs to the whole Church. The sons of Levi were the first-fruits, and
the whole people were in the name of that tribe consecrated to God. This is the
reason why he mentions the sons of Levi rather than the whole people; as though
he had said, that though the Church was corrupt and polluted, there would yet be
a residue which God would save, having purified them. The words which I had
omitted are these -</font><br></div>

were, and the purity of the Church, they had yet contracted some contagion from
the corruption which prevailed. Such then was the contagion, that not only the
common people became corrupt, but even the Levites themselves, who ought to have
been guides to others, and who were to be in the Church as it were the pattern
of holiness. God however promises that such would be the purifying which Christ
would effect, and so regulated, that it would consume the whole people, and yet
purify the elect, and purify them like silver, that they may be saved. He tells
us afterwards that the Levites themselves would need a trial to cleanse them;
for they themselves would not be without filth, because they had mixed with a
perverse people, who had wholly departed from the law, and from the fear and the
worship of God.</font><br></div>

HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-EIGHTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">IN our last lecture the Prophet delineated the office
of Christ, that hypocrites might know that they in vain complained of the
tardiness of God, as though he had deserted them at the very time of their
extremity. He further said, that there was need of purifying, not only as to the
people, but as to the priests also; and hence it appears how corrupt the state
of things had become among all classes. At the same time he seems indirectly to
reprove hypocrisy, not only in the common people, but also in the Levites, for
there is a contrast to be understood between the sacrifices they then offered,
and those offered by their fathers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying then that they would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>offer to Jehovah an oblation in
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hqdxb
hjnm</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>meneche</i> <i>betsadke</i>, he intimates
that their sacrifices had not been legitimate, for they had become polluted, and
hence could not rightly minister to God. We hence see that the Levites are here
reproved because they had polluted God&#8217;s service in not offering the right
sacrifices such as he had prescribed in his law. This is not to be applied to
the outward acts only, but also to the feelings and motives, because they did
come to God&#8217;s altars with minds well prepared.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To offer in righteousness is a mode of speaking
common in Hebrew, and means to offer in a right way, so that there should be
nothing wrong or worthy of blame. By the verb

<i>isheb</i>, to sit, is intimated continuance; as though the Prophet had said,
that corruption was so deeply fixed in the Levites that it could not in one day
or by light means be purged away: in short, he meant by this one word to
exaggerate the corrupt state of the people, for had only a slight washing been
sufficient, he would have simply said, &#8220;he will purify, he will cleanse,
he will cast,&#8221; or melt, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn48</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for he
uses these three words: but he says, as I have stated, that he will sit to do

easily healed. We now understand what the Prophet means. He afterwards adds

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse shows, that though he had just spoken of

to the elect what ought not to have been extended to all, for there were among
the people, as we have seen and shall again presently see, many who were
reprobates, nay, the greater part had fallen away; and this is the reason why
the Prophet especially addresses the few remaining who had not fallen
away.</font><br></div>

splendor of ancient times, the state of things having become much deteriorated
among those miserable exiles. Hence the Prophet, that he might encourage the
faithful, says, that though the temple was then mean, and the worship of God as
then performed was unadorned and abject, yet there was no reason for the Levites

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet retorts the complaints which the
Jews had previously made. There is here then a counter-movement when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will draw nigh to
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for they provoked God by this slander
&#8212; that he hid himself from them and looked at a distance on what was
taking place in the world, as though the people he had chosen were not the
objects of his care. They expected God to be to them like a hired soldier, ready
at hand to help them in any adversity, and to come armed at their nod or
pleasure to fight with their enemies: this they expected; but God declares what
is of a contrary character, &#8212; that he would come for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
and he alludes to that impious slander, when they denied that he was the God of
judgement, because he did not immediately, or soon enough, resist their enemies:
&#8220;Oh! God has now divested himself of his own nature! for his judgement
does not appear.&#8221; His answer is, &#8220;I will not forget nay judgement
when I come to you, but I shall come in a way contrary to what you
expect&#8221;. They indeed wished God to put on arms for their advantage, but
God declares, that he would be an enemy to them, according to what he also says
by the mouth of Isaiah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He further says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will be a swift
witness</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He sets swiftness here in opposition
to their calumny, for they said that God was slow and tardy, because he had not
immediately, as they had wished, come forth to exercise vengeance on foreign
nations: he, on the other hand, says, that he would be sufficiently swift when
the time came.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And as there are the like blasphemies prevailing in
the world at this day, this passage may be accommodated to our circumstances.
Let us then know, that though God may delay and connive at things for a time, he
yet knows his own opportunities, so as to appear as the avenger of wickedness as
soon as it will be necessary. But let us ever fear lest our haste should prove
our ruin, for he has no respect of persons, so as to favor our unfaithfulness
and to be rigid towards those who are hostile to us. Let us take heed that while
we look for the presence of God, we present ourselves before his tribunal with a
pure and upright conscience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then mentions several kinds of evils, in which he
includes the sins in which the Jews implicated themselves. He first names

was one; but as the word is found here by itself, the Prophet no doubt meant to
include all kinds of diviners, soothsayers, false prophets, and all such
deceivers: and so there is here again another instance of stating a part for the
whole; for he includes all those corruptions which are contrary to the true
worship of God. We indeed know that God formerly had by his word put a restraint
on the Jews, that they were not to turn aside to incantations and magical arts,
or to anything of this kind; but he intimates here, that they were then so given
up to gross abominations, that they abandoned themselves to magic arts, and to
incantations, and the juggleries of the devil. He mentions, in the second place,

<div><font face="Palatino">The design of the Prophet is by no means ambiguous;
for he intended to show how perversely they expostulated with God; for they
ought to have been destroyed a hundred times, inasmuch as they were apostates,
were given to obscene lusts, were cruel, avaricious, and
perfidious.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this reproof ought to be a warning to us in the
present day, that we may not call forth God&#8217;s judgement on others, while
we flatter ourselves as being innocent. Whenever then we flee to God for help,
and ask him to succor us, let us remember that he is a just judge who has no
respect of persons. Let then every one, who implores God&#8217;s judgement, be
his own judge, and anticipate the correction which he has reason to fear. That
God therefore may not be armed for our destruction, let us carefully examine our
own life, and follow the rule prescribed here by the Prophet; let us begin with
the worship of God, then let us come to fornications and adulteries, and
whatever is contrary to a chaste conduct, and afterwards let us pass to frauds
and plunder; for if we are free from all superstition, if we keep ourselves
chaste and pure, and if we also abstain from all plunders and all cruelty, our
life is doubtless approved by God. And hence it is that the Prophet adds at the
end of the verse, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They feared not
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for when lusts, and plunder, and frauds and
the corruptions which vitiate God&#8217;s worship, prevail, it is evident that
there is no fear of God, but that men, having shaken off the yoke, as it were
run mad, though they may a thousand times profess the name of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By mentioning the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>orphan, the
widow</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
stranger</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he amplifies the atrocity of their
crimes; for the orphans, widows, and strangers, we know, are under the
guardianship and protection of God, inasmuch as they are exposed to the wrongs
of men. Hence every one who plunders orphans, or harasses widows, or oppresses
strangers, seems to carry on open war, as it were, with God himself, who has
promised that these should be safe under the shadow of his hand. With regard to
the expressions, it seems not suitable to say that the hire of the widow and of
the orphan is suppressed; there may therefore be an inversion of the words

they oppressed the widows, the orphans, strangers. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet more clearly reproves and checks the
impious waywardness of the people; for God, after having said that he would come
and send a Redeemer, though not such as would satisfy the Jews, now claims to
himself what justly belongs to him, and says that he changes not, because he is
God. Under the name Jehovah, God reasons from his own nature; for he sets
himself, as we have observed in our last lecture, in opposition to mortals; nor
is it a wonder that God here disclaims all inconsistency, since the impostor
Balaam was constrained to celebrate God&#8217;s immutable constancy
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;For he is not
God,&#8221; he says, &#8220;who changes,&#8221; or varies, &#8220;like
man.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;042319&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Numbers
23:19.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand the force of the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. But he adds as an explanation,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I change
not</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or, I am not changed; for if we do not
take the verb actively, the meaning is the same, &#8212; that God continues in
his purpose, and is not turned here and there like men who repent of a purpose
they have formed, because what they had not thought of comes to their mind, or
because they wish undone what they have performed, and seek new ways by which
they may retrace their steps. God denies that anything of this kind can take
place in him, for he is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>changes
not</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or is not changed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The latter clause is variously explained. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cale</i>, means, in the first conjugation, to be consumed; but in Piel, to
complete, or to make an end; and this sense would be very suitable; but a
grammatical reason interferes, for it is in the first conjugation. Did grammar
allow, this meaning would be appropriate, &#8220;Ye children of Israel have not
made an end:&#8221; Why? &#8220;From the days of your fathers,&#8221; etc.: then
the verse which follows would be connected with this. But we must be content
with the present reading; and a twofold view may be taken of it: the copulative
&#8220;waw&#8221; may be taken as an adversative, &#8220;Though ye are not
consumed, I yet am not changed:&#8221; as though it was said, &#8220;Think not
that you have escaped, though I have long spared you and your sins: though then
ye are not yet consumed, as I have borne with you in your great wickedness, I
yet continue to be Jehovah, nor do I change my nature, and ye shall at length
find that I am a just Judge; though I shall not soon execute my vengeance,
punishment being held suspended, or as it were buried, yet the end will show
that I am not changed.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn51</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet seems rather to accuse the Jews of
ingratitude in charging God with cruelty or with negligence, because he did not
immediately assist them; and at the same time they did not consider within
themselves that they remained alive because God had a reason derived from his
own nature for sparing them, and for not rendering to them what they had
deserved. The meaning then is this, &#8220;I am God, and I change not; and ought
ye not to have acknowledged that wonderful forbearance through which I have
spared you? for how has it been that you have not perished, and that innumerable
deaths have not swallowed you up? How is it that you are yet alive? Is it
because you have dealt faithfully faith me, so that it behaved me to exercise
care over you? Nay, it is indeed a wonder that I had not fulminated against you
so as to destroy you long ago.&#8221; We hence see that he upbraids them with
ingratitude for accusing him, because he did not immediately come forth in their
defense: For he answers them and says, that had he been rigid and vehement in
his displeasure, they could not have continued, for they had not ceased for many
successive ages to seek their own ruin, as we find in what follows, for he says

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet expands more fully what he had referred
to &#8212; that it was a wonder that the Jews had not perished, because they had
never ceased to provoke God against themselves. He then sets this fact before
them more clearly, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the days
</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn52</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of your
fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye have turned aside from my
statutes</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He increases their condemnation by
this circumstance &#8212; that they had not lately begun to depart from the
right way, but had continued their contumacy for many ages, according to what
the apostles, as well as the Prophets in various places, have
testified:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Ye uncircumcised
in heart, ye have ceased not to resist the Holy Spirit like your fathers.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440706&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Acts
7:61.)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Harden not your
hearts as your fathers did; in the righteousness of your fathers walk
not.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;199508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
95:8.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But I will not multiply proofs, which very often are
to be met with, and must be well known.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand the Prophet&#8217;s intention
&#8212; that the Jews for many ages had been notorious for their impiety and
wickedness, and that they had not been dealt with by God as they had deserved,
because he had according to his ineffable goodness and forbearance suspended his
rigour, so as not to visit them according to their demerits. It hence appears
how unreasonable they were, not only in being morose and proud, but especially
in being furious against God, when they accused him of tardiness, while yet he
had proved himself to be really a God towards them by his continued
forbearance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye have not kept
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">, are added for amplification; for he
expresses more fully their contempt of his law, as though he had said, that they
were not only transgressors, but had also with gross wilfulness so departed from
the law as to regard it as nothing to tread God&#8217;s precepts under their
feet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then exhorts then to repentance, and kindly
addresses them, and declares that he would be propitious and reconcilable to
them, if they repented. He has hitherto sharply reproved them, because their
necks being hard they had need of such correction; for had the Prophet gently
and kindly exhorted them, they would either have kicked or have set on him with
their horns; be now mitigates his sharpness, not indeed with respect to all, but
if there were any healable among the people he meant to try them; and hence he
offers them reconciliation with God, as though he had said, &#8220;Though God
has been in various ways wantonly offended by you, and though you have
repudiated his favor, and have become wholly unworthy of being regarded by him,
yet return, and he will meet you.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have said elsewhere that all exhortations would be
in vain without a hope of pardon; for when God commands us to return to the
right way, our hearts would never be touched, nay, they would on the contrary
turn away, had we no hope that he would be reconciled to us. This course the
Prophet now pursues, when in the person of God himself he promises pardon,
provided the Jews repented.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God is said to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>return</i></font><font face="Palatino">
to us, when he ceases to demand the punishment of our sins, and when he lays
aside the character of a judge, and makes himself known to us as a Father. We
indeed know that God neither returns nor departs; for he who fills all places
never moves here and there; and we also know that we exist and live in him, but
he shows by outward evidences that he is alienated from us, and by the same he
shows that he is propitious to us; for when he favors us with fruitful seasons,
with peace and with other blessings, he is said to be near us; but when he lets
loose the reins of his wrath, or exposes us to the assaults of Satan and to the
wanton power of men, he is said to be far removed from us. But this is so well
known that I need not dwell longer on the point.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The promise which the Prophet states serves to show,
that God would manifest tokens of his paternal favor to the Jews, provided only
they were submissive; but that it would be their own fault, if they did not find
through his blessings that he was their Father. It would be on account of their
sins, which, as Isaiah says, hinder the course of that beneficence to which he
is of his own self inclined,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235902&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
59:2.) And he bids them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>return</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
Hence the Papists very foolishly conclude, that repentance is in the power of
man&#8217;s free-will. But God requires what is above our strength; and yet
there is no reason why we should complain that there is a too heavy burden laid
on us; for he regards not what we can, or what our ability admits, but what we
owe to him and what our duty requires. Though then no one can of his own self
turn to God, he is not on this account excusable, because we must consider
whence comes the defect; and how much soever, as I have already said, a man may
pretend his own impotency, he cannot yet escape from being bound to God, though
more is required of him than he of himself can perform. But this subject has
often been discussed elsewhere. The import of what is said here is, &#8212; that
men are not miserable through the unjust rigour of God, but always through their
own sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have said, In what shall we
return?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is an evidence of perverseness, when
men answer that they see not that they have erred, and that hence conversion is
to no purpose required of them; for this is the meaning of these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whereby shall we
return?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, &#8220;What dost thou require
from us? for we are not conscious of any defection; we worship God as we ought:
now if our duties are repudiated by him, we see not why he should so expressly
blame us; let him show in what we have offended; for conversion to him is
superfluous, until we be proved guilty of apostasy, or of those sins which God
determines to punish in us.&#8221; To this the Prophet answers
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Will a man defraud the
gods?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some give this version, &#8220;Will a man
defraud God?&#8221; But it is strained and remote from the Prophet&#8217;s
design; and they pervert the meaning. For I do not see what can be elicited from
this rendering, &#8220;Will a man defraud God?&#8221; But there are other two
meanings which may be taken. The first is, &#8220;Will a man defraud his
gods?&#8221; The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yhla</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Aleim</i>, though it be in the plural number, is applied, as it is well
known, to the true God; but it is applied also to idols; and in this place the
Prophet seems to me to compare the Jews to the Gentiles, that their impiety
might be made more evident. The same is the object of Jeremiah, when he
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Go, and survey the
islands, is there a nation which has changed its gods, while yet they are no
gods.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
2:10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since their blindness and obstinacy held fast the
Gentiles in darkness, that they continued to worship the gods to whom they had
been accustomed, it was an abominable wickedness in the Jews, that having been
taught to worship the true God, they were yet continually influenced by ungodly
levity, and sought new modes of worship, as though they wished to devise another
god for themselves. So also in this place the Prophet seems to bring forward the
Gentiles as an example to the Jews; for they discharged their duty towards their
gods; but the Jews despised the supreme and the only true God:
&#8220;Behold,&#8221; he says, &#8220;go round the world, and ye shall not find
among the nations so unbridled a liberty as prevails among you; for they render
obedience to their gods, and sacrilege is abominable to them; but ye defraud me.
Am I inferior to idols? or is my state worse than
theirs?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some take the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yhla</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Aleim</i>, for judges, as judges are sometimes so named; but this meaning
seems not suitable on account of the word, Adam. As then this word generally
means man, the Prophet, I have no doubt, intimates what I have stated, &#8212;
that unbelievers, though sunk in darkness, are yet restrained by reverence and
fear from changing their deity, and that they dare not to show levity when the
name only of their god is pronounced. Since then such humility prevailed among
unbelievers, could the impiety of that people, who had been trained up in the
law, be excusable? a people too, upon whom God had ever made the doctrine of the
law to shine.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn53</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because ye have defrauded me; and
ye have said, Thereby have we defrauded thee? In tenths and in
oblations</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn54</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Here
the Prophet again proves the people guilty of perverseness: it was indeed
hypocrisy, and though gross, it was yet surpassed by impudence; for they asked,
whereby they had defrauded God? and yet this was evident even to children: for
we know, and we have seen elsewhere, that avarice so ruled among them, that
every one, bent on their own profit, neglected the temple and the priests. Since
then they were openly sacrilegious, how shameless they must have been to ask
whereby they had defrauded God! The thing itself was indeed manifest and
commonly known, so that children could see it. God however deemed it enough to
convict them by one sentence, &#8212; that they defrauded him in the tenths and
in the first-fruits; not that any advantage accrued to him from oblations, as he
had no need of any such things; but he rightly calls and counts that his own
which he had appointed for his own service. Since then he had instituted that
order among the Jews, that they might by the tenths support the priests, and a
part also was required for the poor, since God designed the firstfruits and
other things to be offered to him, that men might thereby be continually
reminded, that all things were his, and that whatever they received from his
hand was sacred to him, he had previously called the bread laid on the table his
own, and had called the sacrifices his own food, as though he did eat and drink.
But as I have already said, we ought to regard the object in view, because his
will was to be thus worshipped, and at the same time to keep as his own whatever
belonged to his service. This then is the reason why he now complains of being
defrauded of the tenths.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we know that other sacrifices are now prescribed
to us; and after prayer and praises, he bids us to relieve the poor and needy.
God then, no doubt, is deprived by us of his right, when we are unkind to the
poor, and refuse them aid in their necessity. We indeed thereby wrong men, and
are cruel; but our crime is still more heinous, inasmuch as we are unfaithful
stewards; for God deals more liberally with us than with others, for this end
&#8212; that some portion of our abundance may come to the poor; and as he
consecrates to their use what we abound in, we become guilty of sacrilege
whenever we give not to our brethren what God commands us; for we know that he
engages to repay, according to what is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;201917&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
19:17, &#8220;He who gives to the poor lends to God.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that since thou
hast been pleased to choose us as priests to thyself, not that we may offer
beasts to thee, but consecrate to thee ourselves, and all that we have, &#8212;
O grant, that we may with an readiness strive to depart from every kind of
uncleanness, and to purify ourselves from all defilements, so that we may duly
perform the sacred office of priesthood, and thus conduct ourselves towards thee
with chasteness and purity; may we also abstain from every evil work, from all
fraud and all cruelty towards our brethren, and so to deal with one another as
to prove through our whole life that thou art really our Father, ruling us by
thy Spirit, and that true and holy brotherhood exists between us; and may we
live justly towards one another, so as to render to each his own right, and thus
show that we are members of thy only-begotten Son, so as to be owned by him when
he shall appear for the redemption of his people, and shell gather us into his
celestial kingdom. &#8212; Amen.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">MALACHI pursues the same subject; for he answers the
Jews in the name of God &#8212; that they unjustly complained of his rigour as
being immoderate, since they themselves were the cause of all their evils. He
says that they were cursed, but he adds that this happened to them deservedly,
as though he had said &#8212; &#8220;Be that granted what you say, (for
lamentations were continually made,) why is it that God afflicts us without end
or limits?&#8221; God seems to grant what they were wont reproachfully to
declare; but he says in answer to this &#8212;
&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But ye have defrauded
Me</i></font><font face="Palatino">; what wonder then that my curse consumes

ought to have been searched out. They indeed wished their rapines and sacrileges
to be forgiven, by which they defrauded God; but God declares that he punished
them justly in consuming them with poverty and want, since they so sparingly
rendered to him what they owed.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He at length declares that they profited nothing by
contending with God, but that a better way was open to them, that is, to return
into favor with him. After having then repelled their unjust accusations, he
again points out the remedy which he had already referred to &#8212; that if
they dealt faithfully with God, he would be bountiful to them, and that his
blessing would be promptly extended to them. This is the sum of the passage.
They had been sufficiently proved guilty of rapacity in withholding the tenths
and the oblations; as then the sacrilege was well known, the Prophet now passes
judgement, as they say, according to what is usually done when the criminal is
condemned, and the cause is decided, so that he who has been defrauded recovers
his right.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So also now God deals with the Jews.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Bring</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the
repository</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn56</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">(for this is the same as the house of the
treasury, or of provisions) </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all
the tenths</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or the whole tenths. We hence learn
that they had not withholden the whole of the tenths from the priests, but that
they fraudulently brought the half, or retained as much as they could; for it
was not without reason that he said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Bring
all</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or the whole. They then so paid the tenths
as to supply the priests with a part only, and thus they trifled with God,
according to what hypocrites do, who ever claim to themselves high honor, and
try to perform their duty in such a way as not to discover their own perfidy,
and yet they are not ashamed of the liberty they take to illude God; and of this
we have here a remarkable example. We then see that it is no new or unusual
thing for men to pretend to do the duties they owe to God, and at the same time
to take away from him what is his own, and to transfer it to themselves, and
that manifestly, so that their impiety is evident, though it be covered by the
veil of dissimulation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let there be meat in my
house</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We have elsewhere explained this form of
speaking, and in the last lecture the Prophet spoke also of the meat of God, not
that God needs meat and drink, but that whatever he has given us ought to be
deemed his. We have already stated, that it has been recorded for our sake, that
the Jews offered bread, and victims, and things of this kind, and that they
feasted at Jerusalem in the presence of God: for what is more desirable than
that God should dwell in the midst of us? and this is often repeated in the law.
But this could not have been set forth to us in a way so familiar, as when God
is represented as in a manner sitting at table with us, as though he were our
guest, eating of the same bread and of the other provisions: and hence it is
said in the law, &#8220;Thou shalt feast and rejoice before thy God.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;050218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
2:18.) Now as God needs not meat and drink, as it has been said, and as men in
their grossness are ever prone to superstitions, he substituted the priests and
the poor in his own place, to prevent the Jews from entertaining earthly notions
respecting him. And this kind of modification or correction deserves to be
noticed: for the Lord on the one hand intended to draw men in a kind manner to
himself; but, on the other hand, he proposed to raise their minds upward to
heaven, lest they should ascribe to him anything unworthy of himself, as is wont
to be done, and is very common.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But, at the same time, he again accuses them of
sacrilege, for he complains that he was deprived of meat;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let there then be meat in my
house; and prove me by this, saith Jehovah, if I wily not
open</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. He confirms what he said before, and
yet proceeds with his promise, for by subjecting himself to a proof, he boldly
repels their calumny in saying that they were without cause consumed with want,
and that God had changed his nature, because he had not given a large supply of
provisions. God then briefly shows, that wrong had been done to him, for he
admits of a proof or a trial, as though he had said, &#8220;If you choose to
contest the point, I will soon settle it, for if you bring to me the tenths and
them entire, there will immediately come to you a great abundance of all
provisions: it will hence be evident, that I am not the cause of barrenness, but
that it is your wickedness, because ye have sacrilegiously defrauded
me.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If I will not open to you the
windows of heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is the first thing as to
fertility that the heavens should water the earth, according to what Scripture
declares: and hence God threatens in the law that the heaven would be iron and
the earth brass,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;052823&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
28:23,) for there is a mutual connection between the heaven and the earth, and
he says elsewhere by a Prophet,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The heaven will
hear the earth, and the earth will hear the corn and wine, and the corn and wine
will hear
men.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;280209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hosea
2:99.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For when famine urges us, we cry for bread and wine,
as our life seems in a manner to be dependent on these supplies. When there is
no wine nor corn, we meet with a denial; but the wine and the corn cry to the
earth, and why? because according to the order fixed by God, they seek as it
were to break forth; for when the bowels of the earth are closed, neither the
corn nor the vine can come forth, and then they in vain call on the earth. The
sense is the case with the earth; for when it is dry and as it were famished, it
calls on the heavens, but if rain be denied, the heavens seem to reject its
prayer. Then God in this place shows that the earth could not produce a single
ear of corn, except the heavens supplied moisture or rain. God indeed could from
the beginning have watered the earth without rain, as Moses relates he did at
first, for a vapor then supplied the want of rain. Though then rain descends
naturally, we are yet reminded here that God sends it. This is the first
thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as rain itself would not suffice, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
unsheath</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc.; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rek</i>, means properly to unsheath; but as this metaphor seems unnatural,
some have more correctly rendered it, &#8220;I will draw out&#8221; Unnatural
also is this version, &#8220;I will empty out a blessing,&#8221; and it perverts
the meaning. Let us then follow what I have stated as the first &#8212; that a
blessing is drawn out from God when the earth discharges its office, and becomes
fertile or fruitful. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn57</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We
hence see that God is not only in one way bountiful to us, but he also intends
by various processes to render us sensible of his kindness: he rains from heaven
to soften the earth, that it may in its bosom nourish the corn, and then send it
forth from its bowels, as though it extended its breast to us; and further, God
adds his blessing, so as to render the rain useful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He subjoins the words
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ydAylbAd[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>od-beli-di</i>, which some render, &#8220;that there may not be a
sufficiency,&#8221; that is, that granaries and cellars might not be capable of
containing such abundance. They then elicit this meaning &#8212; that so great
would be the fruitfulness of the earth, and so large would be its produce, that
their repositories would not be sufficiently capacious. But others give this
version, &#8220;Beyond the measure of sufficiency.&#8221; The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yd</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>di</i>, means properly sufficiency, or what is needful, as by inverting the

<i>id</i>. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn58</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> With
regard to the general meaning there is but little difference. Suitable also is
this version, &#8220;Beyond sufficiency;&#8221; that is, I will not regard what
is needful for you, as though it were measured, but the abundance shall be
overflowing. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">God now again confirms the truth, that he would not
in one way only be bountiful to them. He might indeed distribute to us daily our
food, as we know that he thus fed his people in the wilderness; but his will is
that the seed should rot in the earth, that it should then germinate, and in
course of time grow, until it shoots into ears of corn; but it is still in no
small danger, nay the corn is subject to many evils before it be gathered into
the garner; for the locusts, the worms, the mildew, and other things may destroy
it. God therefore, in order to set forth his kindness to men, enumerates here
the ways and the means by which food is preserved; for it would not be enough
that the seed should germinate, and that there should appear evidences of a
great produce, the ears being fine and abundant, but it is necessary that the
ears of corn themselves, before they become ripe, should be preserved from
above; for on the one hand the chafers, the locusts, the worms, and other grubs,
may suddenly creep in and devour the corn while in the field, and on the other
hand, storms, and hail, and mildew, and oilier pestilential things, as I have
said, may prove ruinous to the corn.</font><br></div>

of their impious and wicked blasphemy in saying, that he disappointed his

kind to the unfaithful and the faithful indiscriminately, and also that he
overlooked the obedience rendered to him.</font><br></div>

Jews that it could not by any means be checked; they were like men whom we see,
who when once seized by rage and madness, become so vociferous that they will
not listen to any admonitions or sane counsels. At first they murmur and are
only heard to whisper; but when they have attained full liberty, they then send
forth, as I have said, their furious clamours against heaven. This is the sin
which the Prophet now condemns by saying, that the Jews grew strong in crying
against God. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn60</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> They

appears from these so many repetitions that the hypocrisy, which was united with
great effrontery, could not be easily corrected in a people so refractory: it
ought indeed to have come to their minds that they had wickedly accused God. But
they acknowledge here no fault, &#8220;What meanest thou?&#8221; as though they
wished to arraign the Prophet for having falsely charged them, inasmuch as they
were conscious of no wrong.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then gives the reason why he said, that their
words grew strong against God, that is, that they daringly and furiously spoke
evil of God; and the reason was, because they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>said, that God was worshipped in
vain</i></font><font face="Palatino">. They thought that they worshipped God
perfectly; and this was their false principle; for hypocrites ever lay claim to
complete holiness, and cannot bear to confess their own evils; even when their
conscience goads them, they deceive themselves with vain flatteries, and always
endeavor to draw over them some veil that their disgrace may not appear before
men. Hence hypocrites seek to deceive themselves, God, angels, and men; and when
they are inflated with the confidence that they worship God purely, rightly, and
without any defect, and that they are without any blame, they will betray the
virulence which lies within, whenever God does not help them as they wish,
whenever he submits not to their will: for when they are prosperous, God is
hauntingly blessed by them; but as soon as he withdraws his hand and begins to
prove their patience, they will then show, as I have said, what sort of
worshippers of God they are. But in the service of God the chief thing is this
&#8212; that men deny themselves and give themselves up to be ruled by God, and
never raise a clamor when he humbles them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see how it was that the Jews found fault
with God; for they were persuaded that they fully performed their duty, which
was yet most false; and then, they were not willing to submit to God, and to
undertake his yoke, because they did not consider in how many ways they had
provoked God&#8217;s wrath, and what just and multiplied reasons he has for
chastising his people, even when they do nothing wrong. As then they did not
seriously consider any of these things, they thought that he was unjust to them,
In vain then do we serve God. These thoughts, as we have said, sometimes come
across the minds of the faithful; but they, as it becomes them, resist such
thoughts: the Jews, on the contrary, as though they were victorious, vomited
forth these blasphemies against God.</font><br></div>

Here they bring a twofold accusation against God, that they received no reward
for their piety when they faithfully discharged their duty towards God, &#8212;
and also that it was better with the ungodly and the despisers of God than with
them. We hence see how reproachfully they exaggerated what they deemed the
injustice of God, at least how they themselves imagined that he disappointed the
just of their deserved reward, and that he favored the ungodly and the wicked as
though he was pleased with them, as though he intended the more to exasperate
the sorrow of his own servants, who, though they faithfully worshipped, yet saw
that they did so in vain, as God concealed himself and did not regard their
services.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That the good also are tempted, as we have said, by
thoughts of this kind, is no wonder, when the state of things in the world is in
greater confusion. Even Solomon says,</font><br></div>

There is then an occasion for indignation and envy offered to us; but as God
designedly tries our faith by such confusions, we must remember that we must
exercise patience. It is not at the same time enough for us to submit to
God&#8217;s judgement, except we also consider that we are justly distressed;
and that though we may be attentive to what is just and upright, many vices
still cleave to us, and that we are sprinkled with many spots, which provoke
God&#8217;s wrath against us. Let us then learn to form a right judgement as to
what our life is, and then let us bear in mind how many are the reasons why God
should sometimes deal roughly with us. Thus all our envying will cease, and our
minds will be prepared calmly to obey. In short, these considerations will check
whatever perverseness there may be in us, so that neither our wicked thoughts
nor our words will be so strong as to rise in rebellion against
God.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that since we
continue to afford many and various reasons to induce thee to withdraw thy
blessing, and to show thyself displeased with us, &#8212; O grant, that we may
patiently bear thy scourges, by which thou chastises us, and also profit under
them, and so contend with all our depraved affections and the corruptions of the
flesh, that we may become partakers of thy paternal kindness, which thou
offerest to us, and also so taste of thy goodness, which in innumerable ways is
manifested towards us, that it may keep us in the pursuit of true religion;
finally, may our tongues be consecrated to magnify thy judgement and to
celebrate thy justice, that whatever happens to us, we may always serve thee
through our whole life as our Father, and declare also thy goodness towards us,
and confess that we are justly punished whenever thou visitest us with severity,
until we shall at length reach that blessed rest, which is to be the end of all

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND EIGHTIETH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE saw in our last lecture that the Jews were
indignant, because God did not treat them with more kindness, as they thought
that they rightly performed their duty towards Him. We said that such an
expostulation can never be justly made by men; for though they may find God
rigid, there are yet always many reasons why he should by various troubles
exercise them; but hypocrites seem to themselves to be of all men the most
perfect, though they have only the guise or mask of religion. They indeed say
that they have kept the Law, but when we come to the test, their emptiness is
found out; for the main thing in the Law is wanting, that is, integrity of
heart; nay, in the outward life they are found to be
transgressors.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">However this may be, they boasted that they kept the
law, as we find in this passage,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have kept his
charge</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The doctrine of the law is here by a
metaphor called a charge or keeping (<i>custodia</i>,) because it rules us, it
confines us also within limits that we may not wander in uncertainty, it
restrains our corrupt desires; in short, it keeps us under the fear of God and
in the best order. Had the Jews considered this, they could never have dared to
ascribe so much to themselves. Now this word, then commonly used, is adopted by
the Prophet, and thus he shows how little attention they gave to the
consideration of God&#8217;s law; for they thought that their whole life was
conformable to all the commandments, and. yet they conformed hardly to the
thousandth part of them. They add,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have walked with a dark face
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or dress. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn63</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There
is here also a metaphor, for they meant that they had been humble and lowly
before God. It is indeed no ordinary thing in God&#8217;s service to lay aside
all pride and vain confidence, and to walk humbly with him: but hypocrites, like
apes, imitate what God requires and approves; and at the same time they say
nothing of changing the heart. Fear and sorrow are required, according to what
we have seen in the Prophet Micah; but hypocrites think that a dejected
countenance is enough; and hence they often pretend sorrow, while they inwardly
please and flatter themselves: and on this account we find in Isaiah, the
fifty-eighth chapter, as well as in this place, that they bring a charge against
God, that he did not regard them, when they walked with a sad countenance, when
they macerated themselves with fastings: in short, when by various other
performances they showed great holiness, they brought an accusation against God,
because he disregarded all these things, or made not that account of them which
they expected.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then remember, that the Jews were guilty of
two errors; first, they presented to God an empty appearance for true humility,
for they were no doubt swollen with false confidence though they pretended to be
abject and low before God; secondly, they claimed for themselves more than what
was just, for though there may have been some apparent modesty and
submissiveness in them, yet they exceeded due limits; for we always swell with
presumption, at least we are never thoroughly freed from it. They then falsely
pretended, that they walked lowly and dejectedly before God. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse is connected with the last, for the force
of these words, &#8220;We have walked sorrowfully before God and have carefully
kept his precepts,&#8221; does not fully appear, except this clause be added
&#8212; that they saw in the meantime that the proud flourished and had their
delights, as though they said, &#8220;We strive to deserve well of God by our
services; he overlooks all our religious acts, and pours as it were all his
bounty on our enemies, who are yet ungodly and profane.&#8221; We now see how
these verses are connected together, for God disappointed the Jews of the reward
they thought due to them, and in the meantime bestowed on the impious and
undeserving his kindness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To call any one blessed, as we have before seen, is
to acknowledge that God&#8217;s blessing is upon him, according to what God had
promised, &#8220;Behold, all nations shall call thee blessed.&#8221; So a
changed state of things is here set forth, for the Jews, when they were
miserable, called others blessed; not that they willingly declared this, but
envy forced them to complain of the cheerful and hamper state of the Gentiles,
who were yet ungodly. And by the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>proud</i></font><font face="Palatino">
they meant all the despisers of God, a part being mentioned for the whole; and
they were so called, because faith alone humbles us. Many unbelievers are indeed
lauded for their humility, but no one becomes really humble without being first
emptied of every conceit as to his own virtues. Some rise up against God, and
rob him of what is his own, and then it is no wonder that they act insolently
towards their neighbors, since they dare even to raise up their horns against
God himself. And in many parts of Scripture the unbelieving are called proud, in
order that we may know that we cannot be formed and habituated to humility until
we submit to the yoke of God, so that he may turn us wherever he wishes, and
until we cast aside every confidence in ourselves.

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;g</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gam</i>, is here repeated, and must be rendered &#8220;as well as,&#8221;
that is, &#8220;All who do iniquity as well as all who tempt God,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>are built up
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>are
delivered</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In the first place what is general
is stated, and then what is particular, and yet the Prophet speaks of the same
persons, for he first calls God&#8217;s despisers iniquitous, and he afterwards
says, that the same tempted God, which is more special. The sum of the whole is,
&#8212; that God&#8217;s favor was conspicuous towards the despisers of the law,
for they lived prosperously, and were also delivered, and found God their helper
in adversity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The verb, to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>build</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
is taken in Hebrew in the sense of prospering, and is applied to many things.
When therefore any one grows and increases in honors or in riches, when he
accumulates wealth, or when he is raised as it were by degrees to a higher
condition, he is said to be built up. It is also added that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>delivered</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
for it would not be enough to acquire much wealth, except aid from God comes in
adversity, for no one, even the most fortunate, is exempt from every evil. Hence
to building up the Prophet adds this second clause, &#8212; that God delivered
the wicked from all evils, as though he covered them under his shadow, and as
though they were his clients. With regard to the second verb, when he says that
the ungodly
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tempted</i></font><font face="Palatino">
God, it is, we know, the work of unbelief to contend with God. The Prophet used
the same word shortly before, when he said, &#8220;Prove me in this:&#8221; but
God then, after the manner of men, submitted to a trial; here, on the contrary,
the Prophet condemns that insolence which very commonly prevails in the world,
when men seek to confine God, and to impose on him a law, and to inquire into
his judgements: it is in short as though they had a right to prescribe to him
according to their own caprice, so that he should not do this or that, and which
if he did, to call on him to plead his own cause. We now then perceive what it
is to prove or tempt God. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In this verse the Prophet tells us that his doctrine
had not been without fruit, for the faithful had been stimulated, so that they
animated one another, and thus restored each other to a right course. They who
explain the words &#8212; that the faithful spoke, indefinitely, pervert the
meaning of the Prophet, and they also suppress the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">za</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>az</i>, then. The very subject proves that a certain time is denoted, as
though the Prophet had said, that before he addressed the people and vehemently
reproved their vices, there was much indifference among them, but that at length
the faithful were awakened.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We are hence taught that we are by nature slothful
and tardy, until God as it were plucks our ears; there is therefore need of
warnings and stimulants. But let us also learn to attend to what is taught, lest
it should become frigid to us. We ought at the same time to observe, that all
were not moved by the Prophet&#8217;s exhortations to repent, but those who
feared God: the greater part no doubt securely went on in their vices, and even
openly derided the Prophet&#8217;s teaching. As then the truth profited only
those who feared God, let us not wonder that it is despised at this day by the
people in general; for it is given but to a few to obey God&#8217;s word; and
the conversion of the heart is the peculiar gift of the Holy Spirit. There is
therefore no reason for pious teachers to despond, when they do not see their
doctrine received everywhere and by all, of when they see that but a few make
any progress in it; but let them be content, when the Lord blesses their labor
and renders it profitable and fruitful to some, however small their number may
be.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet not only says that individuals were
Touched with repentance, but also that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spoke among
themselves</i></font><font face="Palatino">; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn65</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by
which he intimates, that our efforts ought to be extended to our brethren: and
it is an evidence of true repentance, when each one endeavors as much as he can
to unite to himself as many friends as possible, so that they may with one
consent return to the way from which they had departed, yea, that they may
return to God whom they had forsaken. This then is what we are to understand by
the words spoken mutually by God&#8217;s servants, which the Prophet does not
express.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that Jehovah
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>attended</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heard</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
and that a </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>book of remembrance
was written before him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He proves here that the
faithful had not in vain repented, for God became a witness and a spectator: and
this part is especially worthy of being noticed; for we lose not our labor when
we turn to God, because he will receive us as it were with open
arms.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Our Prophet wished especially to show, that God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>attended</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
and hence he uses three forms of speaking. One word would have been enough, but
he adds two more; and this is particularly emphatical, that there was a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>book of remembrance
written</i></font><font face="Palatino">. His purpose then was by this
multiplicity of words to give greater encouragement to the faithful, that they
might be convinced that their reward would be certain as soon as they devoted
themselves to God, for God would not be blind to their piety.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet at the same time seems to point it out as
something miraculous, that there were found then among the people any who were
yet capable of being healed, since so much wickedness had prevailed among the
people, nay, had become hardened, as we have seen, to an extreme obstinacy; for
there was nothing sound or upright either among the priests or the common
people. As then they had long indulged with loose reins in all kinds of
wickedness, it was incredible, that any could be converted, or that any piety
and fear of God could be found remaining among them. This then is the reason why
the Prophet says, that God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>attended</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heard</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
and that a </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>book was
written</i></font><font face="Palatino">; he speaks as though of a thing
unusual, which could not but appear as a miracle in a state of things so
confused and almost past hope. The design of the whole is to show, that the
faithful ought not to doubt, but that their repentance is ever regarded by God,
and especially when the utmost despair lays hold on their minds; for it often
distresses the godly, when they see no remedy to be hoped for; then they think
that their repentance will be useless: hence it is that the Prophet dwells so
much on this point, in order that they might feel assured, that though no hope
appeared, yet repentance availed for their salvation before God; and for this
reason he adds, that this </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>book
was written for those who feared God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn66</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the participle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yb&ccedil;j</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cheshebim</i>, the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b&ccedil;j</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chesheb</i>, means to reckon or to count, and also to think; and so some
render it here, &#8220;Who think of his name.&#8221; And doubtless this is a
rare virtue; for we see that forgetfulness easily creeps over us, which
extinguishes the fear of God, so that we take such a liberty, as though they who
forget God can sin with impunity: and hence it is said often in the Psalms, that
the fear of God is before the eyes of the godly. This seems frigid at the first
view; but he who remembers God has made much progress in his religious course;
and we also find by experience that the mere remembrance of God, when real, is a
bridle to us sufficiently strong to restrain all our depraved lusts. But as the
price of a thing is attained by reckoning, the other version is appropriate,
&#8212; that the faithful value or esteem the name of God.

<div><font face="Palatino">He shows by the issue itself why a book of
remembrance was written &#8212; that God in due time would again undertake to
defend and cherish his Church. Though then for a time many troubles were to be
sustained by the godly, yet the Prophet shows that they did not in vain serve
God; for facts would at length prove that their obedience has not been
overlooked. But the two things which he mentions ought to be noticed; for a book
of remembrance is first written before God, and then God executes what is
written in the book. When therefore we seem to serve God in vain, let us know
that the obedience we render to him will come to an account, and that he is a
just Judge, though he may not immediately stretch forth his hand to
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the first place then the Prophet testifies that
God knows what is done by every one; and in the second place he adds that he
will in his own time perform what he has decreed. So also in judgements, he
preserves the same order in knowing and in executing. For when he said to
Abraham that the cry of Sodom came up to heaven,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011820&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
18:20,) how great and how supine was the security of the city. How wantonly and
how savagely they despised every authority to the very last moment! But God had
long before ascended his tribunal, and had taken an account of their wickedness.
So also in the case of the godly, though he seems to overlook their obedience,
yet he has not his eyes closed, or his ears closed, for there is a book of
memorial written before him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall be in the day I
make</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The verb is put by itself, but we may
easily learn from the context that it refers to the restoration of the Church.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"> then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in which I shall
make</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, complete what I have already
said; for he had before promised to restore the Church. As then he speaks of a
known thing, he says shortly, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In
the day I shall make</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or complete my work,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall be to me a peculiar
treasure</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn68</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
phrase confirms what I have already stated &#8212; that God has his season and
opportunity, in order that there may be no presumption in us to prescribe to him
the time when he is to do this or that. In the day then when he shall gather his
Church, it will then appear that we are his peculiar treasure.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus the Prophet in these words exhorts us to
patience, lest it should be grievous to us to groan under our burden, and not to
find God&#8217;s help according to our wishes, and lest also it should be
grievous to us to bear troubles in common with the whole Church. Were one or two
of us subject to the cross, and doomed to sorrow and grief in this world, our
condition might seem hard; but since the godly, from the first to the last, are
made to be our associates in bearing the cross of Christ, and to be conformed to
his example, there is no reason for any one of us to shun his lot; for we are
not better than the holy patriarchs, apostles, and so many of the faithful whom
God has exercised with the cross. Since then the common restoration of the
Church is here set before us, let us know that a reason is here given for
constancy and fortitude; for it would be disgraceful for us to faint, when we
have so many leaders in this warfare, who by their examples stretch forth as it
were their hands to us; for as Abraham, David, and other Patriarchs and
Prophets, as well as Apostles, have suffered so many and so grievous troubles,
ought not this fact to raise up our spirits? and if at any time our feet and our
legs tremble, ought it not to be sufficient to strengthen us, that so many
excellent chiefs and leaders invite us to persevere by their example? We then
see that this has not been laid down for nothing,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when I shall
make</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or complete my work.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the words
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peculiar
treasure</i></font><font face="Palatino">, God intimates that the lot of the
godly will be different from that of the world; as though he had said, &#8220;Ye
are now so mixed together, that they who serve me seem not to be peculiar any
more than strangers; but they shall then be my peculiar treasure.&#8221; This is
to be taken, as I have already mentioned, for the outward appearance; for we
know that we have been chosen by God, before the foundation of the world, for
this end &#8212; that we might be to him a peculiar treasure. But when we are
afflicted in common with the wicked, or when we seem to be even rejected, and
the ungodly, on the other hand, seem to have God propitious to them, then
nothing seems less true than this promise. I therefore said that this ought to
be referred to the outward appearance &#8212; that the faithful are God&#8217;s
peculiar treasure, that they are valued by him, and that he shows to them
peculiar love, as to his own inheritance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this mode of speaking occurs in many parts of
scripture; for God is often said to repudiate his people; the word separation,
or divorce, is often mentioned; he is said to have destroyed his inheritance.
Grievous is the trial, when God cherishes as it were in his bosom the ungodly,
and we at the same time are exposed to every kind of miser; but we see what
happened to the ancient Church: let us then arm ourselves for this contest, and
be satisfied with the inward testimony of the Spirit, though outward things do
not prosper.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He
adds,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> And I will spare them as a
man spares</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. He states here a promise which
ought especially to be observed: it contains two clauses; the first is, that the
Jews who remained alive would render obedience to God, by which they would prove
themselves to be children indeed, and not in name only: and the second is, that
God would forgive them, that is, that he would exercise pardon in receiving
their services, which could not otherwise please him. And there is no doubt but
that the Spirit of regeneration is included in the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the son who serves
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">; not that the faithful addressed here were
wholly destitute of the fear of God; but God promises an increase of grace, as
though he had said, &#8220;I will gather to myself the people who faithfully and
sincerely worship me.&#8221; Though then he speaks not here of the beginning of
a religious and holy life, it is yet the same as though he had said, that the
faithful would be under his government, that they might denote themselves to his
service.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The second promise refers to another grace, &#8212;
that God in his mercy would approve of the obedience of the godly, though in
itself unworthy to come to his presence. How necessary this indulgence is to Us,
they who are really and truly acquainted with the fear of God, fully know. The
sophists daringly prattle about merits, and fill themselves and others with
empty pride; but they who understand that no man can stand before God&#8217;s
tribunal, do not dream of any merits, nor do they believe that they can bring
anything before God, by which they can conciliate his favor. Hence their only
refuge is what the Prophet here teaches us, that God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spares</i></font><font face="Palatino">
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And it must be observed, that the Prophet does not
speak simply of the remission of sins: our salvation, we know, consists of two
things &#8212; that God rules us by his Spirit, and forms us anew in his own
image through the whole course of our life, &#8212; and also that he buries our
sins. But the Prophet refers here to the remission of sins, of which we have
need as to our good works; for it is certain, that even when we devote ourselves
with all possible effort and zeal to God&#8217;s service there is yet something
always wanting. Hence it is that no work, however right and perfect before men,
deserves this distinction and honor before God. It is therefore necessary, even
when we strive our utmost to serve God, to confess that without his forgiveness
whatever we bring deserves rejection rather than his favor. Hence the Prophet
says, that when God is reconciled to us, there is no reason to fear that he will
reject us, because we are not perfect; for though our works be sprinkled with
many spots, they will yet be acceptable to him, and though we labor under many
defects, we shall yet be approved by him. How so? Because he will spare us: for
a father is indulgent to his children, and though he may see a blemish in the
body of his son, he will not yet cast him out of his house; nay, though he may
have a son lame, or squint-eyed, or singular for any other defect, he will yet
pity him, and will not cease to love him: so also is the case with respect to
God, who, when he adopts us as his children, will forgive our sins. And as a
father is pleased with every small attention when he sees his son submissive,
and does not require from him what he requires from a servant; so God acts; he
repudiates not our obedience, however defective it may be. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn69</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see the design and meaning of the Prophet,
&#8212; that he promises pardon from God to the faithful, after having been
reconciled to him, because they serve God as children willingly, &#8212; and
that God also, though their works are unworthy of his favor, will yet count them
as acceptable, even through pardon, and not on the ground of merit or
worthiness.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as Satan
strives to draw us away from every attention to true religion, when things in
the world are in a state of disorder and confusion, &#8212; O grant, that we may
know that thou caress for us; and if we perceive not this by what we find in the
world, may we rely on thy word, and doubt not but that thou ever watches over
our safety; and being supported by this confidence, may we ever go on in the
course of our calling: and as thou hast deigned to make us partakers of that
evidence of thy favor, by which we know that we are reconciled to thee in thine
only-begotten Son; and being thus made his members, may we never hesitate
cheerfully to offer to thee our services, however defective they may he, since
thou hast once promised to be a propitious Father to us, so as not rigidly to
try what we offer to thee, but so graciously to accept it, that we may know that
not only our sins, which justly deserve condemnation, are forgiven and remitted
to us, but that thou also so bearest with our infirmities and our defects in our
imperfect works, that we shall at length receive the reward which thou hast
promised, and which we cannot attain through our merits, but through the
sanctification of thy Spirit, and through the sprinkling of the blood of our
Lord Jesus Christ. &#8212; Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-FIRST</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE saw in the last lecture that no works of the
faithful please God, except through a gratuitous acceptance: it hence follows,
that nothing can be ascribed to merits without derogating from the grace of
Christ; for if the value of works depends on this, that God is our Father and is
reconciled to us in Christ, nothing can be more absurd than to set up works,
which ought to be subordinated to this paternal favor of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see how these two things harmonize &#8212;
that reward is promised to works, and that works themselves deserve nothing
before God; for though God can justly reject them, he yet regards them as
acceptable, because he forgives all their defects. Thus have we brief stated the
reason why our works are approved by God; they are not so on account of any
worthiness, but through his favor alone; for there is no work which would not on
account of its imperfection be displeasing to God, were he to require that it
should be according to the rule of his law. Hence God departs from his own law
and turns to mercy, that he may regard works as acceptable, which otherwise
could not, being defective, stand before his presence. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse at the first view seems to be addressed to
the faithful; for there never has been a turning as to the reprobate: but as the
word has a wide meaning, the passage may be suitably applied to the whole
people, according to what we find in Zechariah, &#8220;They shall see him whom
they have pierced;&#8221; for we have said that this might be understood both of
the good and of the bad. So also the whole people might be viewed as addressed
in these words. But when we more minutely examine all circumstances, it seems
that Malachi more particularly addressed the ungodly, and checked again their
furious blasphemies; for we find almost the same sentiment expressed here, as
when he said, &#8220;The Lord whom ye expect shall come to his temple, and the
angel of the covenant whom ye seek;&#8221; and at the same time he showed that
the coming of Christ, which they said was advancing too slowly, would not be
such as they desired or looked for. &#8220;Let not this delay,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;be grievous to you; for everything terrible which his majesty possesses
will be turned on your heads; for he will come as an angry judge and an avenger:
ye therefore in vain hope for any comfort or alleviation from his
presence.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So also he says in this place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall see this difference
between the just and the unjust</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is,
&#8220;Ye shall find that God does not sleep in heaven, when the ungodly grow
wanton on the earth and abandon themselves to every kind of wickedness:
experience then will at length teach you, that men shall not thus with impunity
become insolent against God, but that all your wickedness must come to a
reckoning.&#8221; When therefore he says, that they would find the difference
between the godly and the ungodly, he means that they would find by the
punishments which God would inflict, that men are not permitted to indulge their
own depraved desires, as though God slept in heaven, forgetful of his office.
Their blasphemy was, &#8220;In vain is God worshipped; what is the benefit? for
we have kept his charge, and yet the proud are more happy than we are.&#8221; As
then they accused God of such a connivance, as though he disregarded and cast
away his own servants, and showed favor to the wicked, Malachi returns them an
answer and says, &#8220;Ye shall see how much the good differ from the evil; God
indeed spares the wicked, but he will at length rise to judgement, and come
armed suddenly upon them, and then ye shall know that all the deeds of men are
noticed by him, and that wickedness shall not go unpunished, though God for a
time delays his vengeance.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the Prophet&#8217;s meaning
&#8212; that the ungodly who clamor against God, as though he made no account
either of the just or of the unjust, shall find, even to their own loss, that he
is one who punishes wickedness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the verb
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>turn</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
I have already said that it has a wide meaning, and does not always mean
repentance or the renovation of man: it may therefore be taken as signifying
only a different state of things; as though he had said, &#8220;The dice shall
be turned, and such will be your condition when God shall begin to execute his
judgement, that he will then manifestly show that he has not forgotten his
office, though he does not immediately hasten to execute his judgements.&#8221;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall return
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and
see</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Yet if any one prefers to regard returning
as the feeling of God&#8217;s judgements, by which even the ungodly shall be
touched, though without repentance, the view will not be unsuitable, and I am
disposed to embrace it, that is, that the Lord will shake off the stupidity in
which they were sunk, and will correct their madness, so that they will not dare
to vomit forth so insolently their blasphemies, as they had been wont to do: Ye
then shall return; that is, &#8220;I will make my judgement known to you, and ye
shall not rush on headlong as wild beasts, for being taught by facts, ye shall
learn the difference between the good and the bad.&#8221;

God, mean the same person. We hence learn that there is no justice where there
is no obedience rendered to God. The first thing then in a good and an upright
life, is to serve God; for it would be but of little benefit to be harmless
towards men, when his right is denied: and we know that God is not rightly
served but according to what his law prescribes. We must then always come to
this, &#8212; that men must obey God, if they desire to form their life aright.

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms the previous verse, for he denounces ruin
on all the reprobate and the despisers of God; and he also confirms what I have
mentioned, &#8212; that he sets this threatening in opposition to the slanders
which they commonly uttered against God, as though he had ceased to discharge
his office as a Judge. Though indeed he speaks in the third person, yet he is
not deficient in force when he says,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, come shall the day, which
shed consume all the ungodly, as a hernia oven the
stubble</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The comparison is very common which
the Prophet uses, when he says, that the ungodly shall be like stubble: I trill
not therefore quote passages which must be well known, and they are so many that
there is no need to adduce here either two or three of them. The vengeance of
God is also often compared to fire and to a flame; and we know how fierce and
how dreadful an element is fire, when it lays hold on wood or some other dry
material. Hence according to the common usage of Scripture, the Prophet says,
that the day of the Lord would be like an oven, and that the ungodly would be
like stubble. The demonstrative particle,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
shows certainty, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I
come</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The present time is put here for the
future, a common thing in Hebrew. But the Prophet called the attention of the
Jews as it were to what was present, that his prophecy might not appear
doubtful, and that they might understand that God&#8217;s vengeance was not far
distant, but already suspended over their heads.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is however a question as to the day which he
points out. The greater part think that the Prophet speaks of the last coming of
Christ, which seems not to me probably. It is indeed true that these and similar
expressions, which everywhere occur in Scripture, have not their full
accomplishment in this world; but God so suspends his judgements, as yet never
to withhold from giving evidences of them that the godly may have some props to
their faith: for if God gave no specimen or proof of his providence, it would
immediately occur to our minds, that there is to be no judgement; but he sets
before us some examples, that we may learn that he will some time be the judge
of the world. It seems then to me more probable, that the Prophet speaks here of
the renovation of the Church: for the wrath of God was then at length more
kindled against the Jews, when they had alienated themselves from Christ; for
their last hope and their last remedy in their evils was the aid of the
Redeemer, and it was for the rejection of his favor that the Jews had to feel
the dreadful punishment of their ingratitude. No sin could have been more
atrocious than to have rejected the offered favor, in which their happiness and
that of the whole world consisted. When the Prophet then says, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>day would
come</i></font><font face="Palatino">, be refers I think to the first coming of
Christ; for the Jews made a confident boast of the coming of a Redeemer, and he
gives them this answer &#8212; that the day of the Lord would come, such as they
did not imagine, but a day which would wholly consume them, according to a
quotation we have made from another Prophet,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;What will be the
day of the Lord to you? that day will not be light, but darkness, a thick
darkness and not brightness.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;300518&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Amos
5:18.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The day of the Lord will be an unhappy event to you,
as though one escaped from the jaws of a lion, and fell at home on a serpent. So
in this place he says that the day would come, which would consume them like an
oven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all the proud and the workers of
iniquity </i></font><font face="Palatino">would be like
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stubble</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
He repeats their words, but somewhat ironically; for when they had said before
that the proud were happy, they regarded themselves as being far from being such
characters. Isaiah also in like manner condemned hypocrites, because they
exposed to contempt their own brethren; for the worshippers of God were at that
time in great reproach among the Jews; yea, hypocrites disdainfully treated the
godly and the upright, as though they were the dregs and filth of the people. So
also they said, &#8220;Behold, we are constrained, not without great sorrow, to
look on the happiness of the ungodly; for the proud and the despisers of God
enjoy prosperity, they live in pleasures.&#8221; The Prophet now answers them
ironically and says, &#8220;Ye shall see the difference which ye so much wish;
for God will consume the proud and the ungodly.&#8221; He says this of them; but
it is, as I have stated, as though he had said, &#8220;When your mask is taken
away, Ye shall see where impiety is, that it is even in you; and therefore ye
shall suffer the punishment which you have deserved.&#8221; This is the return
which he had before mentioned: for though the ungodly do not seriously and
sincerely return to God, yet they are forced, willing or unwilling, to
acknowledge their impiety when God constrains them. Hence after they had been
constrained to examine their own life, God visited them with the punishment they
most justly deserved, though judgement had been invoked by
themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it will leave neither root
nor branch</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He means here that their ruin would
be complete, as though he had said, that no residue of them would be found. As
he had made them like stubble, so he mentions root and stalk; for branch is
improper here, as he speaks of stubble, and branches belong to trees. The
meaning, however, is not obscure, which is &#8212; that such would be the
consumption that nothing would remain. This, indeed, properly belongs to the
last judgement; but, as I have said, this is no reason why God should not set
before our eyes some evidences of that vengeance which awaits the ungodly, by
which our faith may be more and more confirmed daily. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn71</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to God&#8217;s name, which is mentioned
twice, he reminds us that God does not execute his judgements in an even or a
continued course, but that he has a fixed time, now for forbearance, then for
vengeance, as it seems good to him. Whenever then the day of the Lord is
mentioned in Scripture, let us know that God is bound by no laws, that he should
hasten his work according to our hasty wishes; but the specific time is in his
own power, and at his own will. On this subject I lightly touch only, because I
have explained it more fully elsewhere. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now turns his discourse to the godly; and
hence it appears more clearly that he has been hitherto threatening those gross
hypocrites who arrogated sanctity to themselves alone, while yet they were
continuing to provoke God&#8217;s wrath; for he evidently addresses some
different from those previously spoken of, when he says, Arise to you, etc.; he
separates those who feared God, or the true servants of God, from that multitude
with whom he has been hitherto contending.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Arise</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to you who fear my
name</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is to be noticed here a contrast; for the body
of the people were infected as it were with a general contagion, but God had
preserved a few uncontaminated. As then he had been hitherto contending with the
greatest part of the people, so he now gathers as it were apart the chosen few,
and promises to them Christ as the author of salvation. For the godly, we know,
trembled at threatenings, and would have almost fainted, had not God mitigated
them. Whenever he denounced vengeance on sinners, the greater part either
mocked, or became angry, at least were not duly impressed. Thus it happens that
while God is thundering, the ungodly go on securely in their sinful courses; but
the godly tremble at a word, and would be altogether cast down, were not God to
apply a remedy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence our Prophet softens the severity of the
threatening which we have observed; as though he had said, that he had not
announced the coming of Christ as terrible for the purpose of filling pious
souls with fear, (for it was not spoken to them,) but only of terrifying the
ungodly. The sum of the whole is briefly this &#8212; &#8220;Hearken ye,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;who fear God; for I have a different word for you, and that is,
that the Sun of righteousness shall arise, which will bring healing in its
wings. Let those despisers of God then perish, who, though they carry on war
with him, yet seek to have him as it were bound to them; but raise ye up your
heads, and patiently look for that day, and with the hope of it calmly bear your
troubles.&#8221; We now understand the import of this verse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is indeed no doubt but that Malachi calls
Christ the Sun of righteousness; and a most suitable term it is, when we
consider how the condition of the fathers differed from ours. God has always
given light to his Church, but Christ brought the full light, according to what
Isaiah teaches us,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;On thee shall
Jehovah arise,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and the glory of God
shall be seen in thee.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;236001&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
60:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This can be applied to none but to Christ. Again he
says, &#8220;Behold darkness shall cover the earth,&#8221; etc.; &#8220;shine on
thee shall Jehovah;&#8221; and farther,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;There shall be now
no sun by day nor moon by night; but God alone shall give thee light.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;236019&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
60:19.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">All these words show that Sun is a name appropriate
to Christ; for God the Father has given a much clearer light in the person of
Christ than formerly by the law, and by all the appendages of the law. And for
this reason also is Christ called the light of the world; not that the fathers
wandered as the blind in darkness, but that they were content with the dawn
only, or with the moon and stars. We indeed know how obscure was the doctrine of
the law, so that it may truly be said to be shadowy. When therefore the heavens
became at length opened and clear by means of the gospel, it was through the
rising of the Sun, which brought the full day; and hence it is the peculiar
office of Christ to illuminate. And on this account it is said in the first
chapter of John, that he was from the beginning the true light, which
illuminates every man that cometh into the world, and yet that it was a light
shining in darkness; for some sparks of reason continue in men, however blinded
they are become through the fall of Adam and the corruption of nature. But
Christ is peculiarly called light with regard to the faithful, whom he delivers
from the blindness in which all are involved by nature, and whom he undertakes
to guide by his Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning then of the word sun, when metaphorically
applied to Christ, is this, &#8212; that he is called a sun, because without him
we cannot but wander and go astray, but that by his guidance we shall keep in
the right way; and hence he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He who follows me
walks not in darkness.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430812&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
8:12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must observe that this is not to be confined
to the person of Christ, but extended to the gospel. Hence Paul
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Awake thou who
sleepest, and rise from
darkness,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and Christ shall
illuminate thee.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ephesians
5:14)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Christ then daily illuminates us by his doctrine and
his Spirit; and though we see him not with our eyes, yet we find by experience
that he is a sun.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He is called the sun of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
either because of his perfect rectitude, in whom there is nothing defective, or
because the righteousness of God is conspicuous in him: and yet, that we may
know the light, derived from him, which proceeds from him to us and irradiates
us, we are not to regard the transient concerns of this life, but what belongs
to the spiritual life. The first thing is, that Christ performs towards us the
office of a sun, not to guide our feet and hands as to what is earthly, but that
he brings light to us, to show the way to heaven, and that by its means we may
come to the enjoyment of a blessed and eternal life. We must secondly observe,
that this spiritual light cannot be separated from righteousness; for how does
Christ become our sun? It is by regenerating us by his Spirit into
righteousness, by delivering us from the pollutions of the world, by renewing us
after the image of God. We now then see the import of the word righteousness. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn72</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And healing in its
wings</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He gives the name of wings to the rays
of the sun; and this comparison has much beauty, for it is taken from nature,
and most fitly applied to Christ. There is nothing, we know, more cheering and
healing than the rays of the sun; for ill-savor would soon overwhelm us, even
within a day, were not the sun to purge the earth from its dregs; and without
the sun there would be no respiration. We also feel a sort of relief at the
rising of the sun; for the night is a kind of burden. When the sun sets, we feel
as it were a heaviness in all our members; and the sick are exhilarated in the
morning and experience a change from the influence of the sun; for it brings to
us healing in its wing. But the Prophet has expressed what is still more,
&#8212; that a clear sun in a serene sky brings healing; for there is an implied
opposition between a cloudy or stormy time and a clear and bright season. During
time of serenity we are far more cheerful, whether we be in health or in
sickness; and there is no one who does not derive some cheerfulness from the
serenity of the heavens: but when it is cloudy, even the most healthy feels some
inconvenience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">According to this view Malachi now says, that there
would be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>healing in the wings
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of Christ, inasmuch as many evils were to be
borne by the true servants of God; for if we consider the history of those
times, it will appear that the condition of that people was most grievous. He
now promises a change to them; for the restoration of the Church would bring
them joy. See then in what way he meant there would be healing in the wings of
Christ; for the darkness would be dissipated, and the heavens would be free from
clouds, so as to exhilarate the minds of the godly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By calling the godly those who
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fear
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he adopts the common language of
Scripture; for we have said that the chief part of righteousness and holiness
consists in the true worship of God: but something new is here expressed; for
this fear is what peculiarly belongs to true religion, so that men submit to
God, though he is invisible, though he does not address them face to face,
though he does not openly show his hand armed with scourges. When therefore men
of their own accord reverence the glory of God, and acknowledge that the world
is governed by him, and that they are under his authority, this is a real
evidence of true religion: and this is what the Prophet means by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>name</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
Hence they who fear the name of God, desire not to draw him down from heaven,
nor seek manifest signs of his presence, but suffer their faith to be thus
tried, so that they adore and worship God, though they see him not face to face,
but only through a mirror and that darkly, and also through the displays of his
power, justice, and other attributes, which are evident before our
eyes.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast
appointed thine only-begotten Son to be like a sun to us, we may not be blind,
so as not to see his brightness; and that since he is pleased to guide us daily
into the way of salvation, may we follow him and never be detained by any of the
impediments of this world, so as not to pursue after that celestial life to
which thou invitest us; and that as thou hast promised that he is to come and
gather us into the eternal inheritance, may we not in the meantime grow wanton,
but on the contrary watch with diligence and be ever attentively looking for
him; and my we not reject the favor which thou hast been pleased to offer us in
him, and thus grow torpid in our dregs, but on the contrary be stimulated to
fear thy none and truly to worship thee, until we shall at length obtain the
fruit of our faith and piety, when he shall appear again for our final
redemption, even that sun which has already appeared to us, in order that we
might not remain involved in darkness, but hold on our way in the midst of
darkness, even the way which leads us to heaven. &#8212; Amen.</font><br></div>

HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-SECOND</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">MALACHI, after having said that the Sun of
righteousness would arise on the Jews, now adds that it would be for their joy,
for as sorrow lays hold on the faithful when they are without Christ, or when
they think him far removed from them, so his favor is their chief happiness and
real joy. Hence the angel when he made known to the shepherds that Christ was
born, thus introduces his message,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Now though the comparison might seem rather
unnatural, yet it was not without reason that the Prophet said that the Jews
would be like </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fattened

incredible; hence it was necessary that the subject should be stated in a very

then openly declare our joy to one another, and we seek as it were a wide place
for giving vent to our feelings. We now see why the Prophet says that the Jews
would </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>go

<div><font face="Palatino">When God promises redemption to his Church, he
usually mentions what is of an opposite character, even the destruction and ruin
of his enemies, and he does this on purpose lest envy should annoy or harass the
faithful, while seeing the ungodly prosperous and happy. So also in this place
Malachi says, that the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ungodly
would be trodden under foot by the faithful like the
dust</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and he says this lest the elect, while
lying prostrate under the feet of their enemies and proudly trampled upon by
them, should succumb under their troubles; but they were to look for what the
Prophet declares here, for they were not only to be raised up by the hand of
God, but were also to be superior to their enemies, and be enabled in their turn
to suppress their pride: in short, he means that they were to be raised above
all the height of the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time, God does not allow his children
cruelly to seek vengeance, for he would have them to be endued with meekness, so
as not to cease to do good to the wicked and to pray for them, though they may
have been unjustly treated by them. But, as I have already said, he meant here
to obviate an evil which is natural to us all, for we are apt to despond when
our enemies exult over us, and rage against us. Lest then their temporary
success and prosperity should deject our minds, God brings a remedy, and
strengthens our patience by this consideration, &#8212; that the state of things
will shortly be changed, so that we shall triumph over the ungodly, who thought
us to have been undone a hundred times; God will indeed visit them with extreme
shame, because they not only fatuitously boast of their unjust deeds, but also
raise up their horns against him.</font><br></div>

the importunity of men as to their wishes, and how ardently they seek their
accomplishment unless God checks them. Whenever then we speak of the destruction
of our enemies, let us remember that we ought to regard the day of the Lord, in
which he purposes to execute his judgement. Some, as I have said, give a
different version, but the one I have given is the most probable, and is also
more generally approved. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage has not been clearly and fully
explained, because interpreters did not understand the design of Malachi nor
consider the time. We know that before the coming of Christ there was a kind of
silence on the part of God, for by not sending Prophets for a time, he designed
to stimulate as it were the Jews, so that they might with greater ardor seek
Christ. Our Prophet was amongst the very last. As then the Jews were without
Prophets, they ought more diligently to have attended to the law, and to have
taken a more careful heed to the doctrine of religion contained in it. This is
the reason why he now bids them to remember the law of Moses; as though he had
said, &#8220;Hereafter shall come the time when ye shall be without Prophets,
but your remedy shall be the law; attend then carefully to it, and beware lest
you should forget it.&#8221; For men, as soon as God ceases to speak to them
even for the shortest time, are carried away after their own inventions, and are
ever inclined to vanity, as we abundantly find by experience. Hence Malachi, in
order to keep the Jews from wandering, and from thus departing from the pure
doctrine of the law, reminds them that they were faithfully and constantly to
remember it until the Redeemer came.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If it be asked why he mentions the law only, the
answer is obvious, because that saying of Christ is true, that the law and the
Prophets were until John.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400313&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
3:13.) It must yet be observed, that the prophetic office was not separated from
the law, for all the prophecies which followed the law were as it were its
appendages; so that they included nothing new, but were given that the people
might be more fully retained in their obedience to the law. Hence as the
Prophets were the interpreters of Moses, it is no wonder that their doctrine was
subjected, or as they commonly say, subordinated to the law. The object of the
Prophet was to make the Jews attentive to that doctrine which had been delivered
to them from above by Moses and the Prophets, so as not to depart from it even
in the least degree; as though he had said, &#8220;God will not now send to you
different teachers in succession; there is enough for your instruction in the
law: there is no reason on this account that you should change anything in the
discipline of the Church. Though God by ceasing to speak to you, may seem to let
loose the reins, so as to allow every one to stray and wander in uncertainty
after his own imaginations, it is yet not so; for the law is sufficient to guide
us, provided we shake not off its yoke, nor through our ingratitude bury the
light by which it directs us.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls it the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>law of
Moses</i></font><font face="Palatino">, not because he was its author, but its
minister, as also Paul calls the gospel &#8220;my gospel,&#8221; because he was
its minister and preacher. At the same time God claims to himself the whole
authority, by adding that Moses was his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>savant</i></font><font face="Palatino">:
we hence conclude that he brought nothing of himself; for the word servant is
not to be confined to his vocation only, but also to his fidelity in executing
his office. God then honored Moses with this title, not so much for his own
sake, as in order to give sanction to his law, that no one might think that it
was a doctrine invented by man. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn75</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
expresses the same thing still more clearly by saying, that he had committed the
law to him on
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Horeb</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
for this clause clearly asserts that Moses had faithfully discharged his office
of a servant; for he brought nothing but what had been committed to him from
above, and he delivered it, as they say, from hand to hand. Many give this
version, &#8220;To whom I committed, in the valley of Horeb, statutes and
judgements;&#8221; but I approve of the other rendering &#8212; that God makes
himself here the author of the law, that all the godly might reverently receive
it as coming from him. Horeb is Sinai; but they who describe these places say,
that a part of the mountain towards the east is called Horeb, and that the other
towards the west is called Sinai; but it is still the same
mountain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To all
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or to the whole of Israel, he confirms
what I have already said &#8212; that he had committed to them the law: that the
Jews might be the more touched, he expressly says, that the law was given to
them, and that this was a singular privilege with which God had favored them,
according to what is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19E720&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
147:20,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He has not done so
to other nations, nor has he manifested to them his
judgements.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For the nations had not been laid under such
obligations as the Jews, to whom God had given his law as a peculiar treasure to
his own children. And that no one might claim an exemption, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the whole of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as though he had said, &#8220;Neither
the learned nor the unlearned, neither the rulers nor the common people, can
have any excuse, except they all with the greatest care attend to the law, yea,
all from the least to the greatest.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What follows may admit of two explanations: for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yqwj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chukim</i>, and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yfp&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>meshephethim</i>, may be referred to the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wrkz</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>zacaru</i>, remember; but as he says Which I have committed, we may take
statutes and judgements as explanatory. As to the subject itself, it signifies
but little which view we may adopt. There is no doubt but that God by these
terms commends his law for its benefits; as though he had said, &#8220;The law
includes what the Jews ought rightly to observe, even statutes and
judgements.&#8221; We know that other terms are used in Scripture, such as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ydwqp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>pekudim</i>, precepts;
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ytwxm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>metsutim</i>, commandments; and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ytwd[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>odutim</i>, testimonies; but here the Prophet is content brief to remind the
Jews that their ingratitude would be less excusable if they departed from the
law of God, for this would be openly to reject statutes and judgements; and this
is what I have stated, that they were here taught by the Prophet that the
doctrine of the law is profitable, in order that they might attend to it more
willingly.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet continues the same subject; for having
testified to the Jews, that though God would for a time suspend the course of
prophetic teaching, they yet had in the law what was sufficient for salvation,
he now promises the renovation of the Church; as though he had said, &#8220;The
Lord will again unexpectedly utter his voice after a long silence.&#8221; Isaiah
speaks on the same subject, prophesying of the return of the people, when he
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Comfort ye,
comfort my people, will our God say.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234011&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
40:11)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is an emphatic import in the use of the future
tense. So also in this passage, the Prophet declares that prophetic teaching
would be again renewed, that when God showed mercy to his people, he would open
his mouth, and show that he had been silent, not because he intended to forsake
his people, but as we have said, for another end. At the same time he shows that
the time would come, when his purpose was to confirm and seal all the prophecies
by his only-begotten Son.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage has fascinated the Jews so as to think
that men rise again; and their resurrection is, &#8212; that the souls of men
pass into various bodies three or four times. There is indeed such a delirious
notion as this held by that nation! We hence see how great is the sottishness of
men, when they become alienated from Christ, who is the light of the world and
the Sun of Righteousness, as we have lately seen. There is no need to disprove
an error so palpable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Christ himself took away all doubt on this point,
when he said, that John the Baptist was the Elijah, who had been promised;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
11:10:) and the thing itself proves this, had not Christ spoken on the subject.
And why John the Baptist is called Elijah, I shall explain in a few words. What
some say of zeal, I shall say nothing of; and many have sought other likenesses,
whom I shall neither follow nor blame. But this likeness seems to me the most
suitable of all, &#8212; that God intended to raise up John the Baptist for the
purpose of restoring his worship, as formerly he had raised up Elijah: for at
the time of Elijah, we know, that not only the truth was corrupted and the
worship of God vitiated, but that also all religion was almost extinct, so that
nothing pure and sound remained. At the coming of Christ, though the Jews did
not worship idols, but retained some outward form of religion, yet the whole of
their religion was spurious, so that that time may truly be compared, on account
of its multiplied pollutions, to the age of Elijah. John then was a true
successor of Elijah, nor were any of the Prophets so much like John as Elijah:
hence justly might his name be transferred to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But someone may object and say, that he is here
called a prophet, while he yet denied that he was a prophet: to this the answer
is obvious, &#8212; that John renounced the title of a prophet, that he might
not hinder the progress of Christ&#8217;s teaching: hence he means not in those
words that he ran presumptuously without a call, but that he was content to be
counted the herald of Christ, so that his teaching might not prevent Christ from
being heard alone. Yet Christ declares that he was a prophet, and more than a
prophet, and that because his ministry was more excellent than that of a
prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before shall come the day, great
and terrible</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Prophet seems not here to
speak very suitably of Christ&#8217;s coming; but he now addresses the whole
people; and as there were many slothful and tardy, who even despised the favor
of God, and others insolent and profane, he speaks not so kindly, but mixes
these threatenings. We hence perceive why the Prophet describes the coming of
Christ as terrible; he does this, not because Christ was to come to terrify men,
but on the contrary, according to what Isaiah says,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The smoking flax he will not
extinguish, the shaken reed he will not break; not heard will his voice be in
the streets, nor will he raise a clamor.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
42:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though then Christ calmly presents himself, as we
have before observed, and as soon as he appears to us, he brings an abundant
reason for joy; yet the perverseness of that people was such as to constrain the
Prophet to use a severe language, according to the manner in which God deals
daily with us; when he sees that we have a tasteless palate, he gives us some
bitter medicine, so that we may have some relish for his favor. Whenever then we
meet with any thing in Scripture tending to fill us with terror, let us remember
that such thing is announced, because we are either deaf or slothful, or even
rebellious, when God kindly invites us to himself. It follows

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse may be viewed as containing a simple
promise; but I prefer to regard it as including what is between an exhortation
and a promise. The first thing is, that God reminds the Jews for what purpose he
would send John, even to turn the hearts of men and to restore them to a holy
unity of faith. It must therefore be noticed, that not only the Redeemer would
come, but that after some intermission, as it has been said, had taken place,
the doctrine of salvation would again have its own course, and would be
commenced by John.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet the Prophet seems here to concede to men more
than what is right, for the turning of the heart is God&#8217;s peculiar work,
and still more, it is more peculiarly his than his other works; and if no one
can change a hair on the head of his brother, how can he renew his heart, so as
to make him a new man? It is at the same time of more consequence to be
regenerated than to be created and to be made only the inhabitants of this
world. John then seems to be here too highly extolled, when the turning of the
heart is ascribed to him. The solution of this difficulty may be easily given:
when God thus speaks highly of his ministers, the power of his Spirit is not
excluded; and he shows how great is the power of truth when he works through it
by the secret influence of his Spirit. God sometimes connects himself with his
servants, and sometimes separates himself from them: when he connects himself
with them, he transfers to them what never ceases to dwell in him; for he never
resigns to them his own office, but makes them partakers of it only. And this is
the import of such expressions as these,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">or when Paul says, that he had begotten the
Corinthians,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 2:15,) he did not claim for himself what he knew only belonged to
God, but rather extolled the favor of God as manifested in his ministry,
according to what he declares in another place,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Not I, but the
grace of God which was with
me.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461510&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 15:10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But when God separates himself from his ministers,
nothing remains in them: &#8220;He who plants is nothing,&#8221; says Paul in
another place,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;And he who waters
is nothing, but God who gives the increase.&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino">When then is it that teachers are co-workers with
God? Even when God, ruling them by his Spirit, at the same time blesses their
labor, so that it brings forth its fruit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see that this mode of speaking derogates
nothing from God, that is, when the minister is said to turn the hearts of men;
for as he implants nothing by his own influence, so God supplies what is
necessary that he may fulfill his office.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying that he would turn the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hearts of fathers to sons and of
sons to fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino">, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fn77</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
points out not a simple union or consent, for men often unite together, and yet
God reprobates and hates their union; but the Prophet here has in view the
origin of the people, even Abraham and other holy patriarchs. Had he spoken of
the Egyptians or the Assyrians, or some other nations, this turning would not
have been so wonderful; but when he speaks of the holy and chosen race, it is no
wonder that he mentions it as an instance of the ineffable kindness of God, that
they were all to be gathered and restored from discord to unity, so as to become
united in one faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since their mutual consent is the subject, we must
come to the fountain; for Malachi takes it for granted, that there was formerly
true religion in that people, that the true worship of God prevailed among them,
and that they were bound together by a sacred bond; but since in course of time
various notions rose among them, yea, monstrous dotages, since sincerity had
become wholly corrupted, he now recalls them to their first condition, so that
sons might unite in sentiment with their fathers, and fathers also with their
sons, and become one in that faith which had been delivered in the
law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Were any to object and say, that it was not
reasonable that fathers should join themselves to their apostate sons, for this
would be to approve of their defection, I answer, that there have been some
converted young men who have shown the right way to their fathers, and have
carried light before them. We indeed know that old men, as their are morose, not
only reject what they hear from the young, but are rendered more obstinate,
because they are ashamed to learn. Such a dispute the Prophet bids to be
dismissed, so that all might in their heart think only the same thing in the
Lord.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest I come and smite the land with
a curse</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here again the Prophet threatens the
Jews, and indeed vehemently. He was constrained, as we have said, by necessity,
for the torpor of that people was very great, and many of them were hardened in
their perverseness. This is the reason why God now declares, that the Jews would
not escape unpunished for despising the coming of Christ. And we are at the same
time reminded how abominable in the sight of God is the ingratitude of not
receiving his Son whom he sends to us. If we wish to derive benefit from what
the Prophet teaches us, we ought especially to welcome Christ, while he so
kindly calls us, yea, allures us to himself. But if the sloth of our flesh keeps
us back, let even this threatening stimulate us; and as we learn that the sin of
not embracing Christ when he offers himself to us, shall not go unpunished, let
us struggle against our tardiness. At all events, let us take heed to kiss the
Son, as in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;190212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as nothing is
omitted by thee to help us onward in the course of our faith, and as our sloth
is such that we hardly advance one step though stimulated by thee, &#8212; O
grant, that we may strive to profit more by the various helps which thou hast
provided for us, so that the Law, the Prophets, the voice of John the Baptist,
and especially the doctrine of thine only-begotten Son, may more fully awaken
us, that we may not only hasten to him, but also proceed constantly in our
course, and persevere in it until we shall at length obtain the victory and the
crown of our calling, as thou hast promised an eternal inherence in heaven to
all who faint not but wait for the coming of the great Redeemer. &#8212;

ascribed the words to JEREMIAH, in order to show that Zechariah's prediction was
but a repetition of what Jeremiah had foretold in Jeremiah 18, and 19., and to
intimate that it would be followed by a similar judgment. But this sort of
reasoning is too abstruse and artificial to be admitted.</font><br></div>

not Ido, was a prophet. It is a name give, as <i>Cocceius</i> observes, not only
to him who announces future things, but to every one who as God&#8217;s minister
proclaims his words, explains spiritual things, and applies them to the
conscience. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>

&#8220;return,&#8221; as it intimates a departure, which was the case in both
instances, with respect to the people, and also with respect to God. They had
departed from God, and God had departed from them; they had also departed from
God&#8217;s ways. &#8220;Return&#8221; therefore is the most appropriate term.

The word means what is defined or appointed, as an order or a course, or a

judgments denounced on them, which had been executed. They were God&#8217;s
defined and allotted portions, what he had exactly described and defined by his
Prophets. He says first, &#8220;my words,&#8221; a general term, and then, to

indignant, but now his pity is solicited. He is asked to show pity to a people
to whom he had manifested extreme displeasure. &#8220;Compassionate&#8221; and
&#8220;angry&#8221; are the two words used by <i>Henderson</i>; and &#8220;have

viewed here as signifying skillful men, fitted to do the work assigned to them.
The terms used to designate what they were to do, would lead us to this
supposition; they were to &#8220;drive away&#8221; and to &#8220;thrust

the most common meaning of the first verb, so that it may be rendered,

person. It is omitted in the Septuagint, (except in the comp. ed., where it is
in the third person,) but the sentence is continued as the words of the angel.
<i>Jerome</i> has <i>et dixit</i>, and he said, that is, the angel. It appears
taht the <i>Targum</i>, the <i>Syriac</i>, and the <i>Vulgate</i> retain the
third person; and <i>Dathius</i>, <i>Newcome</i>, and <i>Henderson</i> so render
the verb, &#8220;And he said,&#8221; that is, the angel; and this seems more
consistent with the general tenor of the passage; for it is more reasonable to
suppose that the words which follow are those of the angel than the words of the
Prophet, and that the command to put on the mitre issued from the same as the
command to clothe the high priest with holy garments. &#8212;

been used by former Prophets. <i>Vitringa</i>, <i>Blayney</i>, and others have
rendered &#8220;eyes&#8221; fountains, and the following line thus,
&#8220;Behold I open its opening,&#8221; that is, the orifice through which the
fountains were to flow; they conceived the allusion to be to the rock smitten by
Moses in the wilderness. The main objection to this, as observed by
<i>Marckius</i> and <i>Henderson</i>, is, that the word rendered
&#8220;eyes&#8221; is masculine, and means &#8220;fountains&#8221; only when in
the feminine gender. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>

<i>Septuagint</i> nor <i>Vulgate</i>. Others, as <i>Newcome</i>, receive it, and
place it before lamps &#8212; &#8220;to the seven lamps.&#8221; If &#8220;seven
and seven&#8221; be taken as a form to express fourteen, then there were two
pipes to convey the oil from the bowl to each lamp, answerable to the two
olive-trees which supplied the oil; and it may be that this was expressed in
order to intimate with more distinctness that the oil proceeded equally to each
lamp from the two olive-trees. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>

&#8220;These seven,&#8221; according to <i>Dathius</i>, were &#8220;the
lamps,&#8221; and not the &#8220;eyes&#8221; on the stone mentioned in chapter
3:9, as some think; for the explanation belongs to the present vision, and not
the former. Here is the direct answer to the question asked in verse 4. The two

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>These seven, they

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm48</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
second questions, which seems to be a modification of the first, has been
variously explained. The word
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ylb&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">],
except in the feminine gender, has not the meaning attached to it by<i>
Calvin</i>. It is rendered, &#8220;branches,&#8221;
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kladoi</font><font face="Palatino">,
by the <i>Septuagint</i>, <i>Piscator</i>, <i>Newcome</i>, <i>Henderson</i>, and
by our own version; &#8220;berries,&#8221; by <i>Jun.</i> and <i>Trem</i>.,
<i>Drusius</i> and <i>Pemble</i>; and &#8220;tubes&#8221; by <i>Grotius</i>. As
it is a repetition of the former question, it is probable that the branches in
immediate connection with the candlestick are intended: the oil proceeded from
them by means of tubes or pipes to the bowl or the reservoir at the top of the
candlestick, and hence by means of seven tubes, or pourers to the seven lamps.
The question now is respecting the olive-trees or the branches from which the
oil proceeded; and the answer is, that they are &#8220;the sons of
oil.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What is said of these &#8220;sons of oil,&#8221; that
they &#8220;stand with (or before) the Lord,&#8221; can hardly comport with the
explanation given by <i>Calvin</i>: but it is more suitable to regard them as
persons annointed, as rendered in our version, and by <i>Kimchi</i>,
<i>Drusiu</i>s, <i>Dathius</i>, <i>Newcome</i>, and <i>Henderson</i>. They are
considered here to mean Zerubbabel and Joshua; but yet as types of Christ in his
twofold character of a king and priest. <i>Blayney</i> takes another view; he
renders
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ylb&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">],
&#8220;orderers,&#8221; deriving it from the Syriac, in which language the verb
signifies to direct, to guide in the way. He conceives them to be two persons,
guiding the oil to the channels or tubes which conveyed it to the lamps, and
that they were types of Moses and of Christ, the authors of the two
dispensations. The preceding view seems the most probable. &#8212;

is used here adverbally, which is sometimes the case, and render the sentence,
&#8220;And I lifted up mine eyes again.&#8221; The <i>Septuagint</i>,
<i>Jerome</i>, and our version, have rendered it, &#8220;I turned,&#8221; that

curse,&#8221; <i>Henderson</i> makes the remark, that it is a similar phrase to
&#8220;this is my body,&#8221; that is, signifies my body; which is a mode of
speaking quite common in Scripture, and it is very strange that any should
attach to the phrase any other meaning.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>

<i>Leigh</i> renders the adjective &#8220;Ungodly, lewd, turbelent, wavering,
irreligious towards God, debauched in morals, turbelent in the commonwealth,
unsettled in all things.&#8221; So the noun here may be regarded as including
<i>sin</i> universally, as committed against God and man. But <i>Henderson</i>
thinks, and perhaps not without reason, that idolatry is what is especially
intended, as the article
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h</font><font face="Palatino">]
is prefixed; and this had been the chief sin or wickedness of the people, the
mother of many other sins: and this was certainly removed from the people after

<i>Henry</i>, <i>Marckius</i>, and <i>Scott</i>, and also <i>Newcome</i>, take a
different view of this vision, and consider it as symbolizing the final
destruction of the Jews by the Romans. The woman, according to them, represents
the apostate people, the two women who carried the measure the Roman armies, the
land of Shinar the land of their dispersion, so called on account of their first
captivity. <i>Henderson</i> regards the vision as symbolic of the banishment of
the sin of idolatry from the land of Israel. &#8220;In this striking
hieroglyphic,&#8221; he says, &#8220;we are taught how idolatry, with all its
accompanying atrocities, was removed from the land of the Hebrews, which it had
desecrated, to a country devoted to it, and where it was to commingle with its
native elements, never to be reimported into Canaan. How exactly has the
prediction been fulfilled! From the time of the captivity to the present, a
period of more than 2000 years, the Hebrewpeople have never once lapsed into
idolatry!&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This seems to be the most satisfactory view; and I

may be taken of the chariots, as <i>Marckius</i> justly observes, must be the

spotted, and by <i>Henderson</i>, &#8220;piebald:&#8221; and the second word is
translated &#8220;bay&#8221; in our version and by <i>Newcome</i>;
&#8220;grey,&#8221; by <i>Henderson</i>; and &#8220;strong&#8221; in the
<i>Vulgate</i>, and by <i>Jerome</i>, <i>Dathius</i>, and <i>Blayney</i>.
Strong, vigorous, robust, is its common meaning, and in no other instance it is
found to designate a color. The Septuagint and the Targum have given it this
sense; and it is rendered by the former,
&#8220;particolored&#8212;[</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">yarouv</font><font face="Palatino">],&#8221;
the color of a starling, and by the latter,
&#8220;ash-color&#8212;cinereos.&#8221; But there is no need in this case to
depart from the ordinary meaning of the word, strong, robust; these horses being
different from the others not only in color, but also in strength. The rendering
of Aquila is
&#8220;[</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">krataioi&gt;</font><font face="Palatino">]&#8212;strong.&#8221;
<i>Marckius</i> would apply this term to all the horses, as it stands without a
conjunction; but this cannot be, for in verse 7th &#8220;the strong ones&#8221;
are evidently the same with the speckled or &#8220;the grisled ones&#8221; at
the end of the 6th verse.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>

interpretation of <i>Vitringa</i>, <i>Cocceius</i>, <i>Henry</i>,
<i>M&#8216;Caul</i>, and <i>Adam Clarke</i>. The objection of <i>Dathius</i> to
the last view, that is, that Jehovah is the speaker, and therefore cannot be
understood here as the third person is used, seems not to be valid, for the
third person is used before in the words, &#8220;the temple of Jehovah.&#8221;

would be, &#8220;Shall we weep.&#8221; That the inhabitants of Judea are

<div><font face="Palatino">It is a metaphor taken, as some say, from refractory
children or servants, who being admonished, despise and reject what is commanded
them, as <i>Drusius </i>observes, by turning their backs. This is the most
suitable view according to the context. Non-attendance to God&#8217;s word, and
not insubordination, is the subject. They refused to hear, turned their backs,
and pretended deafness, or conducted themselves as though they were deaf. Then
the source of this conduct is mentioned; the heart was made as hard as adamant,
so that they would not <i>hear </i>the law and the words sent by the Prophets.
The want of attention is throughout the subject; and the evident fact is first
referred to, in the various ways in which it displayed itself; and then it is
traced up to an adamantine heart. This is often the way in which things are
stated by the Prophets&#8212;the most palpable acts are first stated, then the
most hidden participles.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>

both instances are in the same tense, the perfect, which often includes the
present, that is, the perfect up to the present time; as the future in Hebrew,

such is the rendering of <i>Drusius</i>, <i>Marckius</i>, <i>Dathius</i>, and

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">10. For before those days, The hire of
man, it was nothing; And the hire of beast, not any; And to the goer and the

neighbor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rx</font><font face="Palatino">]
is perhaps more strictly an oppressor than an enemy, though it be often rendered
by the latter word. The verb means to straiten, to confine, and thus to
distress, to afflict, or to oppress. Not a foreign but a domestic enemy is here
meant, as intimated in the two last lines. The &#8220;sending forth&#8221; shows
that these enemies were robbers; and this is also evident from the statement
that &#8220;goers&#8221; and &#8220;comers&#8221; were not safe. Hence our
version and that of <i>Newcome</i> are wrong, in which &#8220;I set&#8221; is
found instead of &#8220;I sent forth,&#8221; the proper meaning of the verb used
here. &#8220;I sent&#8221; of <i>Henderson</i> is not quite correct, for the
idea is not fully expressed.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm80</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is
not easy to know the precise meaning of this phrase, capable as it is of various

seed, &#8220;For the seed <i>shall </i>be peace,&#8221; or peacable, instead of
being rebellious as before. The verse, as stated by <i>Marckius</i>, may be thus

to be, in its ordinary sense, as signifying peace or peacable. It was said
before, in verse 10, that there was no peace to goers and comers, such as went
forth to labor in the field: but now there was to be a different state of
things. Then the version would be,&#8212;</font><br></div>

days,&#8221; (that is, a sower of discord, as verse 10,) &#8220;but a sower of

easier.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm81</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>Calvin</i> takes no notice of the words &#8220;House of Judah, and house of
Israel.&#8221; This has occasioned difficulty to some interpreters. But
<i>Newcome</i> thinks that &#8220;many of the ten tribes&#8221; returned with
&#8220;the house of Judah&#8221; from captivity, and are here addressed.
<i>Henderson</i> is of the same opinion, and adds these
remarks&#8212;&#8220;They also (that is the hosue of Israel) returned to
Palestine, [</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlah
&#181;ymyb</font><font face="Palatino">], in the very days (verse 15) to which
it (the prophecy) refers. All attempts to discover them at more recent periods
have proved utterly fruitless; and the idea that they must still exist somewhere
in the world, and are still to be restored in their tribal state, has arisen
from misconstruction of those prophecies which refer to the return from
Babylon.&#8221;&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm82</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some, as
<i>Drusius</i>, <i>Newcome</i>, and <i>Henderson</i>, as well as our own
translators, have regarded this verb &#8220;turned&#8221; as used here
adverbially, as it is evidently in some places, &#8220;So again have I
thought,&#8221; or purposed: but the construction here is not the same as when
it occurs in that sense; and it is to be taken here in contrast to the not
repenting in the preceding verse. God in the former instance did not turn, or
change, or repent; but now he is said to have turned. I render the two verse
thus,&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">14. For thus saith Jehovah of

the verb often means to decide, to determine, to declare a thing as a judge, or
to pronounce sentence in a cause. What they were required here was to pronounce
what was true and right according to the law, an dto give such a judgment as was
calculated to promote peace and concord, &#8220;by deterring the
litigious,&#8221; as <i>Newcome</i> observes, &#8220;and punishing the evil

<i>Henderson</i> agrees with Calvin, and renders it &#8220;sound
judgment.&#8221; The former view is most to be approved, as the latter is less
distinct, for &#8220;true&#8221; and &#8220;sound&#8221; are nearly the same.
&#8220;Let the judges,&#8221; observes <i>Henry</i>, &#8220;that sit in the
gates, in all their judicial proceedings have regard both to truth and to peace;
let them take care to do justice, and to accommodate differences, and prevent
vexatious suits. It must be a judgment of truth in order to peace; and a
judgment of peace as far as is consistent with truth, and no
further.&#8221;</font><br></div>

by <i>Calvin</i> and <i>Blayney</i>; &#8220;but&#8221; by <i>Newcome</i> and
<i>Henderson</i>. But there is no need of all this. Let the whole passage be
rendered in a perceptive form, and it may have its usual meaning as a
copulative, as in the following manner,&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Thus saith Jehovah of hosts,&#8212; Let
the fast of the fourth, and the fast of the fifth, And the fast of the seventh,

<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Exultation,&#8221;
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">zw&ccedil;&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">],
is the outward expression of joy; the most obvious thing is mentioned first, as
often is the case in Scripture, and then the source from which it proceeds, even
joy. &#8220;Cheerful&#8221; is literally &#8220;good,&#8221;&#8212;good seasons,
or festivals, or solemnities. &#8220;The Hebrews,&#8221; says <i>Grotius</i>,
&#8220;were wont to call those days <i>good</i> which were appointed for
rejoicing.&#8221; This passage contains the answer to the inquiry mentioned in
chapter 7:3; but the answer refers not only to one fast but to all the fasts
which the Jews had instituted.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm85</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There is
a difficulty in the construction here. The best solution is that of our version,

be,</font><br></div>

I.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The verb rendered &#8220;implore,&#8221; means to
solicit with importunity, or earnestness. &#8220;To conciliate the regard of
Jehovah,&#8221; as rendered by <i>Henderson</i>, is too much in the style of
modern phraseology; nor is the meaning conveyed. <i>Blayney&#8217;s </i>version
is better, &#8220;To supplicate the favor of Jehovah.&#8221; It seems more
suitable to connect the words &#8220;to seek Jehovah,&#8221; with the last
sentence. We find the two clauses in the next verse, but in an inverted
order&#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm87</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There
seems to be no good reason for considering the two adjectives as describing the
same thing. On the contrary, the reverse is most probable. Their number as well
as their character is evidently here set forth; they were &#8220;many,&#8221;
and &#8220;strong,&#8221; or mighty or powerful. The <i>Septuagint</i> and
<i>Jerome</i> render the word &#8220;many,&#8221; and so do most
interpreters.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm88</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>Blayney</i> thinks it to be the name of a Syrian king, and so does
<i>Henderson</i>. The former quotes <i>Josephus</i>, who calls Rehob, in

Samuel 8:3,

This prince reigned over a part of Syria called Zobah. If this be admitted, then
the three chief kingdoms of Syria are here named&#8212;Zobah, Damascus, and
Hamath. But <i>Henderson </i>is disposed to think that it is a corruption of the
word
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rrj</font><font face="Palatino">],
the common name of the kings of Syria.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm89</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
sentence is one of some difficulty. The <i>Septuagint</i>, the <i>Targum</i>,
the <i>Syriac</i>, and the <i>Arabic </i>versions, give this meaning,&#8212;that
Jehovah sees, <i>i.e.</i>, observes, and therefore judges, all men, as well as
the ten tribes of Israel: and this is the view taken by <i>Grotius</i>,
<i>Piscator</i>, <i>Marckius</i>, <i>Dathius</i>, and <i>Newcome</i>. The
version of the last is,&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>For the eye of

<b><i>man,</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>And

<div><font face="Palatino">The &#8220;eye&#8221; here is supposed to be put for
the capacity of seeing, and is rendered by some &#8220;spectator&#8212;the

beholder or the eyer of man,&#8221; or of mankind, &#8220;and of all the tribes
of Israel.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But <i>Kimchi</i>, <i>Blayney</i>, and
<i>Henderson</i> agree in the view of <i>Calvin</i> and of our version. The
former meaning seems most suitable to the context, as a reason is given for
God&#8217;s judgments on the surrounding Gentiles, for he observes the conduct
of man in general as well as of the tribes of Israel: it is a declaration that
his providence extends over all mankind. The paraphrase of <i>Dathius</i> is,
&#8220;For Jehovah by his providence governs all men as well as the tribes of
Israel.&#8221;&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm90</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And also
<i>on</i> Hamath, <i>which </i>bordereth thereby.&#8212;<i>Newcome</i>. The
construction of the whole passage, as given in our version by <i>Newcome</i> and
<i>Henderson</i>, is not satisfactory. The resting-place of the burdens was to
be Damascus, Hamath, Tyre, and Sidon. The following then would be its
grammatical rendering&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1. The burden of the word of Jehovah on
the land of Hadrach; And Damascus <i>shall </i>be its resting-place, (For
Jehovah has an eye to see men And all the tribes of Israel,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2. And also Hamath, <i>which</i> borders
on it, Tyre and Zidon <i>also</i>: for she is very wise;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">3. And built hath Tyre a fortress for
herself, And has heaped up silver as dust, And fine gold as the mire of the
streets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">4. Behold, the Lord will disposess her,
And smite in the sea her strength, And with fire shall she be
devoured.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to &#8220;Tyre and Zidon,&#8221; the expression
&#8220;very wise&#8221; belongs to the latter, and not to the former, as
<i>Henderson</i> suggests; and then the character or state of Tyre is described
in the following lines. This exactly corresponds with the usual style of the
Prophets; when two things are mentioned, the last is first explained, and then
the first. The boast of wisdom was the character of Zidon; confidence in its
strength and riches is what is ascribed to
Tyre.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm91</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
verb is here confounded with
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;r</font><font face="Palatino">],
which means to impoverish in Hiphil. But the Hiphil of
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;wy</font><font face="Palatino">]
has the idea of expelling or driving out; it means literally to cause one to be
inherited or heired, that is, by making another to succeed in his place. To
dispossess, according to <i>Henderson</i>, rather than to cast out, according to
our version and <i>Newcome</i>, is the idea of the original. The explanation
here disapproved by <i>Calvin</i>, which is wholly inconsistent with the whole
passage, has been derived from the <i>Septuagint</i>, who have rendered the verb
as though it were in Kal,
[</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">klhronomhsei</font><font face="Palatino">].
The <i>Targum</i> gives it the idea of driving or casting out. The Greek
fathers, <i>Theodoret</i> and <i>Cyril</i>, not knowing Hebrew, could give no
other explanation. Similar has been the source of not a few interpretations
given by the fathers.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm92</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> That
this is its meaning is generally admitted, as given by the <i>Septuagint</i>,
the <i>Targum</i>, and the <i>Syriac</i> version, and adopted by <i>Grotius</i>,
<i>Newcome</i>, <i>Blayney</i>, and <i>Henderson.</i> <i>Lee </i>accounts for
the double
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">m</font><font face="Palatino">]
by deriving the word from
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;m</font><font face="Palatino">],

people, and
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rz</font><font face="Palatino">],
a foreigner, or stranger. The poetical singular is used for the plural, as is
the case in the following verse. The whole passage may be thus
rendered&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">6. And dwell shall a stranger in Ashdod;
(For I will cut off the pride of the Philistines;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">7. And I will remove his blood from his
mouth, And his abominations from between his teeth, And left shall he be, even
he, for our God; So that he shall be as a chief in Judah, And Ekron as a
Jebusite.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The &#8220;his&#8221; and &#8220;he&#8221; in this
last verse is the &#8220;stranger&#8221; in verse 6; and that is used in a
collective sense, properly rendered strangers, or foreigners,
[</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajllogeneiv</font><font face="Palatino">]
by the Septuagint; so that the plural, in all these instances, might suitably be
adopted in a translation&#8212;The &#8220;pride of the Philistines&#8221; was
cut off by introducing strangers into their cities; and this line may be
<i>considered</i> as parenthetic.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm93</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>Kimchi</i>, <i>Drusius</i>, <i>Grotius</i>, and others, have given the same
view; but <i>Jerome</i>, <i>Marckius</i>, <i>Newcome</i>, <i>Blayney</i>,
<i>Henderson</i>, and <i>Hengstenberg</i>, regard idolatry as intended here, the
&#8220;blood&#8221; being that of the victims which the heathens drank, and the
&#8220;abominations&#8221; being the things sacrificed to idols. What seems
strongly to favor the view taken by <i>Calvin</i> is the phraseology; the
metaphor being that of a wild beast devouring his prey, and of the prey being
taken from him: this certainly ill comports with the notion of putting an end to
idolatrous practices.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm94</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
explanation of this clause, though countenanced by some others, cannot yet be
admitted. There is nothing in the text to justify the translation from the
&#8220;stranger&#8221; in verse 6, and who is spoken of in this verse, to the
Jewish nation. The foreigners or strangers inhabiting Ashdod are no doubt
intended. So thought <i>Theodoret</i>, <i>Drusius</i>, <i>Grotius</i>,
<i>Blayney</i>, and <i>Newcome</i>; and such is the view of <i>Henderson</i>,
only that he applies the passage to the Philistines generally, and not to the
strangers in Ashdod. To consider the foreigner or stranger as a
&#8220;ruler,&#8221; seems not right. This prophecy was fulfilled, says
<i>Grotius</i>, in the time of the Maccabees, and he refers to <i>Josephus</i>,
12:12, and to 1 Maccabees 5:66; and also in the time of Alexander, when many of
the cities of the Philistines, especially Ashdod and Gaza, were conquered by the
Jews, when many of them became proselytes to Judaism.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The explanation of <i>Blayney</i> as to the latter
part of the verse is as follows: that the stranger or strangers in Ashdod should
be on the same footing as a privileged citizen in Judah, but that the Ekronite,
the natural born Philistine should be as a Jebusite in Jerusalem, deprived of
the privileges which he had when the country was his own. This would be to

<i>Grotius</i> says that one hundred and twenty thousand were restored from
Egypt [a larger number than what was restored from Babylon] by Ptolemy
Philadelphus, and that many were restored from Assyria by Alexander, the son of
Antiochus Epiphanes, and by Demetrius; and he refers to Josephus&#8217;s of the
Fathers, and some moderns, such as <i>Marckius</i> and <i>Henry</i>, viewed the
prophecy as fulfilled in a spiritual sense, that is, in the spiritual
restoration of the Jews, the language being taken from what belonged to a
temporal restoration. But <i>Scott </i>and <i>Adam Clarke</i> seemed disposed to

version&#8212;&#8220;And he shall pass through the narrow sea,&#8221; or,
&#8220;through the straits of the sea;&#8221; and this is the obvious meaning of
the Hebrew, which is literally, &#8220;and he shall pass through the sea of
straitness,&#8221; or narrowness, <i>i.e.</i>, through the (or a) narrow sea;
the allusion is evidently to the Red Sea, which is narrow. <i>Henderson</i>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>He shall cleave and

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm123</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Both to
Jewish and Christian expounders for the most part have regarded the temple as
meant by Libanon; with whom <i>Blayney</i> and <i>Henderson</i> agree. But the
whole context clearly favors the opinion of <i>Calvin</i>, which has been
followed by <i>Marckius</i> and <i>Henry</i>. There is in what follows no
allusion to the temple, but the &#8220;land,&#8221; verse 6, is expressly
mentioned. The &#8220;cedars&#8221; evidently represented the chief men in the
state, not in the temple, called in the second verse &#8220;the might&#8221;
ones. Indeed the whole of what follows countenances this idea, that the Jewish
state or land is what is intended. What has chiefly led to the notion, that the
temple is intended, is the fact that it was built by cedars from Libanon: but
the burning of the cedars mentioned here does not represent the burning of the
temple, but the destruction of the chief men in the land of Judah; and this
consideration alone is fatal to the notion.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm124</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm125</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The

shepherds! Because wasted is their magnificence; The voice of the roaring of
lions! For wasted is the pride of Jordan.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is a correspondence between
&#8220;consume&#8221; and &#8220;wasted.&#8221; The Jewish rulers were called
&#8220;shepherds&#8221; with regard to their office, and &#8220;lions&#8221; on
account of their rapidity. Their &#8220;magnificence&#8221; was wasted, like
that of the cedars when consumed by fire. The &#8220;pride of Jordan&#8221; were
the trees growing on its borders, which afforded shelter for lions. These became
wasted or destroyed, so that the lions could find there no receptacle. All these
things intimate the entire destruction of the Jewish
state.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm126</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
&#8220;slaughter&#8221; has reference to the ruin and destruction denounced in

The <i>Septuagint</i> have departed from the meaning of the verb, though the
general import is retained, &#8220;and they repented not;&#8221; and the same
may be said of <i>Jerome</i>, &#8220;and they grieved not.&#8221; The version of

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm128</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There

the singular, and the nouns, &#8220;possessors,&#8221; &#8220;sellers,&#8221;
and &#8220;shepherds,&#8221; are in the plural number, and the pronoun affixed
to &#8220;shepherds&#8221; is masculine, while that which is affixed to each of
the two preceding words is feminine, referring to the antecedent,
&#8220;sheep.&#8221; There are MSS. and early versions in which these anomalies
are rectified; and it is but reasonable to adopt such corrections. The meaning
of the verse is evident; and it may be that some of these anomalies are
idiomatic. A plural noun in Welsh has commonly a verb in the singular number
when placed <i>after</i> it, which is often the
case.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm129</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There

<i>Drusius</i>,&#8212;&#8220;Caesar,&#8221; says <i>Henderson. </i>But no
particular king seems intended, but a state of things is set forth, signifying
the tyranny and oppression of the ruling power, which was verified in the
condition of the Jews during a considerable period, until at last they were
destroyed by one of the Caesars, the emperor of Rome. Inward discord, and the
tyranny of those who ruled over them, characterised their history from the time
of Antiochus Epiphanes until they were demolished as a nation by Titus and
Vespasian. This seems to be the import of this prophecy. The singular number is
used poetically: and this appears evident from the words which follow,
&#8220;And they shall smite,&#8221; or rather pound to pieces, &#8220;the
land.&#8221; The &#8220;king&#8221; is spoken of here as

passages. The quotation is clearly, like many others, one of accommodation, or
of likeness. The &#8220;price&#8221; here is evidently that for labor; but the
&#8220;price&#8221; in Matthew is for blood. There is a similarity, and not
identity, in the two cases: and the general meaning, and not the words are to be
regarded. For &#8220;Prophesies,&#8221; as <i>Marckius</i> observes, are often
quoted in the New Testament, not according to the expressions,

breaking of the second, which happened after the contemptuous price or reward

instead of the union before preserved. The breaking of the brotherhood between
Judah and Israel has been variously understood. <i>Grotius</i> and
<i>Newcome</i> refer to past history, the separation of the ten tribes from that
of Judah; but this cannot be understood here. <i>Marckius</i>, <i>Henry</i>,
<i>Scott</i>, and <i>Henderson</i> agree in the main with <i>Calvin</i>, and
consider that the interal discords are meant which prevailed among the Jews, who
became united after their return from Babylon under one government, though many
of them were descendants of the ten tribes. &#8220;When the staff of

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm142</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
part determines the character of the whole vision; for the whole chapter is a
vision, the first part being a denunciation of judgment executed in the final
overthrow of the nation, and the remainder, from verse 4th to the end, being a
<i>symbolical</i> vision, representing the dealings of God with the Jews in the
interval, from the time referred to in the last chapter to the coming of the
Messiah, or to the destruction of the Jewish polity by the Romans.
<i>Henderson</i> seems disposed to regard Herod as &#8220;the foolish
shepherd;&#8221; in that case the vision extends only to the advent of Christ;
but if we regard this shepherd, as <i>Blayney </i>does, as denoting a succession
of tyrannical rulers, then the vision extends to the very overthrow predicted in
the three first verses of the chapter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This view, which is that of <i>Calvin</i>, removes
all difficulties, and affords a proof of the falsity of the opinion advanced by
<i>Mede</i>&#8212;that this portion of Zechariah belongs to Jeremiah. That the
Prophet personates God here, or the Messiah, as the ruler of the Jewish nation,
previous to his appearance in the flesh, is evident from the fact that God
identifies, as it were, himself with the Prophet. (verse 8 and 10.) God&#8217;s
dealings with the Jews are symbolized in this vision in a way similar to what is
done, as to the history of the Church, in the visions granted to John; the
sticks, the breaking of them, the cutting off of three shepherds, the price or
reward, and the foolish shepherd, are symbolical, setting forth the various
dealings of God with their people, and their conduct towards him. As to the
price, the very symbol was afterwards strikingly exemplified in the history of
the Messiah. The Prohet is made to represent God in his two characters&#8212;as
a beneficial ruler, producing order and unity, and as a judicial ruler,
employing wicked and cruel tyrants to punish a refractory and rebellious
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;God commanded him (the Prophet) to perform a

contracts, it shrinks, and this corresponds with the

date of this prophecy in our Bibles is 587, fifty-one years after the first
return, and twenty-eight years before the second. Nehemiah, through whose
influence the walls of Jerusalem were built and a great reform produced,
returned about eleven years after Ezra.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm146</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is

necessary to confine the word &#8220;Israel&#8221; to the ten tribes, for it is
often used in a general sense, denoting the descendants of Israel generally,
when the word &#8220;Judah&#8221; is not introduced. The persons referred to
were, it may be, those who continued in exile, many of whom returned afterwards
with Ezra, though I think they were the people of the land. We ought to remember
that Zechariah prophesied between the two returns, and that though the temple
was built at this time, yet Jerusalem was not protected by walls, and continued
so till the time of Nehemiah, about 90 years after the first
return.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm157</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
principle of interpretation, which <i>Calvin</i> has elsewhere mentioned, is a
very important one. What was metaphorically applied to God, or rather to the
Messiah as the king and shepherd or Israel, before his appearance in the flesh,
became afterwards literally true of him in his incarnate state. The people of
Israel or the Jews, &#8220;pierced&#8221; him by their provocations while he was
their king before his incarnation; they afterwards literally
&#8220;pierced&#8221; him on Calvary. The same view may be taken, and is taken
by<i> Calvin</i>, of many similar expressions borrowed from the Prophets and
applied to Christ.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>

The same view was taken by <i>Theodoret </i>and <i>Cyril</i>. It was thought by
<i>Marckius</i> that Nathan the son of David is meant, who represented, not the
royal line, but his other descendants, and that Shimei belonged to the tribe of

<div><font face="Palatino">Was not this prophecy literally fulfilled in the time

state of things similar to what is here described. See especially chapters
9:1-4; 10:1,9,14; and the names of those who had transgressed, 20-44. The
priestly line of Levi and those of inferior order are mentioned, and also those
&#8220;of Israel,&#8221; denominated &#8220;princes and rulers&#8221; in chapter

<i>Jerome </i>and <i>Cyril</i> say that the &#8220;fountain&#8221; is baptism;

of the Redeemer, and applied for justification and sanctification. The word

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftm166</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> From
the tenor of the preceding and the following remarks, it appears evident that
<i>Calvin</i>, in common with almost all the Reformers, considered that heretics
are worthy of death, and that it is the duty of the Christian public to inflict
on them this punishment. The defence then which has been unwisely set up for
him, is without foundation. Toleration was no understood in his day. The Papists
certainly can throw no stone at him, for he only adhered to a principle which he
had derived from them, and defended it with arguments which have been often used
by themselves. Nor is it a right for Protestants in the present day to fall foul
on Calvin <i>alone</i>, since he held a principle which nearly all the Reformers
maintained.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see by what is here said how the principle was
defended, that is, by borrowing what was peculiar to the old dispensation, and
adding it to the New, forgetting, at the same time, the character of the gospel,
that its weapons are not carnal, are not human force or power, but such as are
mighty only through God to the pulling down of strongholds. &#8220;The Son of

is one of the same nature with ourselves, but he is also a member of the same

<i>Dathius</i> truly says, that interpreters have toiled much in the explanation
of this chapter, some taking the words in a spiritual sense, others maintaining
that what is here said was fulfilled before the coming of Christ, and a third
party holding that all is as yet unfulfilled. He was disposed on the whole to
assent to the opinion of <i>Grotius</i>, the same in part with that of<i>
Calvin</i>&#8212;that this prophecy, as well as some in the preceding chapters,
were fulfilled in the times of the Maccabees. See 1 Maccabees 6:26, etc. He
indeed admits that this theory does not remove all the difficulties, but leaves
less than any other.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Marckius</i> doubted not but that the beginning of
this chapter is a prophecy concerning the destruction of Jerusalem by the
Romans, and he quotes <i>Jerome</i>, <i>Cyril</i>, and <i>Theodoret</i> as
having expressed the same opinion. <i>Lowth</i>, <i>Scott</i>, <i>Adam
Clarke</i>, and <i>Henderson</i> take the same view. But the sequel of this
chapter may be better explained by the events which followed the attacks of the
Greco-Syrian kings on Jerusalem, (see 2 Maccabees 4,) than by the events which
followed the ruin of that city by the Romans. <i>Blayney</i> viewed the contents
of this chapter, and much of what is found in the preceding chapters, as yet
unfulfilled: and so does <i>Newcome</i> in part.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Henry</i> is doubtful whether this chapter and the
preceding are to be understood of the whole period from the Prophet&#8217;s days
to the days of the Messiah, or to some events during that time, or to
Christ&#8217;s coming and the setting up of his kingdom upon the ruins of the

&#8220;This sign,&#8221; [God&#8217;s feet standing on the mount,] says
<i>Kimchi</i>, &#8220;is a type of the clearing of the Gentiles who came against
Jerusalem, and who shall fall scattered about.&#8221; The <i>Targum</i> gives
this paraphrase, &#8220;He shall be revealed in his power.&#8221; &#8220;The
rending,&#8221; says <i>Drusius</i>, &#8220;signifies the flight of the nations,
who, on finding God fighting against them, shall flee away in all directions: so
that the mountain on which the besiegers fixed their camp shall seem as though
divided into parts.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Theodoret&#8217;s</i> language is to the same

<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Marckius&#8217;</i>s view of the text is as
follows: This mountain rendered access on the east to the city and temple
difficult, and intercepted the morning light and the flowing of waters in that
direction, both which are referred to afterwards in verse 7 and 8. God&#8217;s
descent on this mountain was a sign of his great displeasure with that nation,
and the rending of the mountain was emblematic of a way being made open for the
gospel to spread throughout the world. And he regarded the Lord&#8217;s coming
in the next verse as his coming in the ministration of the gospel to render it
successful through the world by means of his saints, his apostles, and
ministers.&#8212;<i>Ed</i>.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">5. And closed up shall be the valley of

from the presence of,&#8221; or from, the earthquake, is an appropriate

<i>Septuagint</i>. The word here and everywhere in this chapter, in verses
2,3,14,16, and 19, is in my view improperly rendered &#8220;nations,&#8221;
viewed as heathen nations. It has no doubt this meaning in many places, but it
means also people or peoples, <i>i.e.</i>, the people of Israel. See

and elsewhere in this chapter it means the whole community of the Jews, whether
residing in the land of Canaan or in other parts of the world, especially in
Egypt. Intestine broils, and not wars with heathens, are referred to in this
chapter. Hence we clearly see the reason why &#8220;the feast of
tabernacles&#8221; is mentioned, and why a curse is denounced on those who

sake of ornament, and making a tinkling noise by striking against each other
like cymbals.&#8221; The notion of <i>Blayney</i>, that the horses and their
bells were trophies taken from enemies and dedicated to God, seems not
consistent with the tenor of the passage: for the things employed by the Jews

<i>Drusius</i>, <i>Grotius</i>, and some others, take another view, thinking
what the <i>number</i> of vessels required for sacrifices would be very great,
so that pots would be used, the bowls belonging to the altar being not
sufficient. <i>Grotius</i> says that Antiochus the Great sent 20 thousand pieces
of silver (20 mille nummos argenteos) to be spent in sacrifices in the temple,
and that Demetrius sent 150 thousand annually; and he refers to Josephus, 12:3
and 13:5. But <i>Marckius</i> justly says, that there is no reference here to
number, but to consecration, and agrees in the view given here by <i>Calvin</i>.

about ninety years after the first return under Zerubbabel. After Nehemiah, and
for nearly <i>three </i>centuries, the state of the Jews was very flourishing

offerings, as declared by the Prophet; and this seems enough to confirm
<i>Calvin&#8217;s </i>view.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The priests and people had been denounced for their
wickedness, especially for marrying strange wives. After this denunciation they
&#8220;again&#8221; went to the altar and wept because God would not receive
their sacrifices; and they did this without amending their ways. Then in the

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftn35</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This is
the most lucid and satisfactory explanation of a text which has been deemed, and
is still deemed by some, difficult. Some moderns have gone back to the track of
the ancients, but needlessly. <i>Newcome</i>&#8217;s attempt at a revision of
the text is wholly useless, and renders the passage more
abstruse.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftn36</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This is
not strictly correct, see
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;052402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftn37</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
interpretation given of the first clause of this verse is according to the
<i>Septuagint</i> and the <i>Targum</i>, and has been adopted by <i>Cyril</i>,
<i>Jerome</i>, <i>Theodoret</i>, <i>Drusius</i>, <i>Grotius</i>, <i>Dathius</i>,
and others. Our version is derived from <i>Jun</i>. and <i>Trem.,</i> and
<i>Piscator</i>, and has been followed by <i>Marckius</i>, <i>Lowth</i>,
<i>Scott</i>, <i>Adam Clarke</i>, <i>Newcome</i>, and <i>Henderson</i>. The
second clause has been variously interpreted both by the ancients and the
moderns. The <i>Septuagint</i> make &#8220;violence,&#8221; or wrong, the
nominative to &#8220;cover,&#8221; and the <i>Targum</i> the accusative.
&#8220;Iniquity shall cover his garment,&#8221; is the version of <i>Jerome</i>.
&#8220;For he covers violence <i>as </i>with his garments,&#8221; has been the
version of others; which corresponds with the <i>Targum</i>, as the former does
with the <i>Septuagint</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The most natural construction of the first part is no
doubt what our version exhibits; the meaning of the second is less obvious: but
they seem connected. What seems to be said is,&#8212;that God hates the
divorcer, and him also who maltreats his wife without divorcing her. Then we may
give this literal rendering,&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">For he hates the divorcer, (or him who
puts away,) Saith Jehovah, the God of Israel; And the coverer of outrage on his
own garment, Saith Jehovah of hosts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To speak of God here in the third person is in
accordance with the preceding verses. &#8220;His own garment,&#8221; according
to <i>Venema</i>, <i>Dathius</i>, and <i>Henderson</i>, is a figurative
designation of a wife. See

So that not left to them shall be a root or a branch.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Very many MS., have &#8220;workers&#8221; instead of
&#8220;worker;&#8221; but it is of no consequence, as the singular is often used
poetically for the plural. &#8220;Root&#8221; and &#8220;branch&#8221; is no
doubt a proverbial phrase, including every
thing.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Ftn72</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There is
something incongruous in the expression, &#8220;the Sun of righteousness.&#8221;
Hence some have considered that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hqdx</font><font face="Palatino">
means here benignity or beneficence. &#8220;Righteousness,&#8221; says
<i>Leigh</i>, &#8220;in a special sense, in the Hebrew and the Oriental tongues,
signifieth <i>beneficence </i>or <i>bounty</i>;&#8221; and he refers to
<i>Mede</i> on
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19B206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
112:6. It is evidently added as descriptive of what the sun is, and used as the
case often is in Hebrew, instead of an adjective. Now a righteous sun would not
be proper, but a benignant or a beneficient sun would convey a suitable idea.
The real meaning would then be conveyed by such a vision as the
following,&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">But arise for you, who fear my name,
Shall a beneficient sun, With healing in its beams, And ye shall go forth and
leap Like calves freed from the stall.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Understand,&#8221; says <i>Marckius</i>,
&#8220;by righteousness either benignity and beneficence, or truth, or complete
constancy, or the manifold righteousness of God, which shone in him, or
incontaminated uprightness and rectitude which appeared in him both as God and
man, or as Mediator, which so shines, that he diffuses it to all the faithful in
the gifts of justification and sanctification.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Jerome</i>&#8217;s exposition is, that Christ is
called the Sun of righteousness, because he determines all things justly, and
reveals, discovers what is good and what is evil, what is virtuous and what is
vicious.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The pronoun affixed to &#8220;wings,&#8221; or beams,

but &#8220;its&#8221; is the most appropriate rendering. He or she is everything
in Hebrew, and it is in so Welsh.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>

forth and thrive as bullocks of the stall.</i></b></font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>And ye shall go
forth and leap as calves of the stall.</i></b></font><br></div>

&#8220;Ye shall leap (or
frisk&#8212;</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">skirth&gt;sete</font><font face="Palatino">)
like calves let loose from bonds.&#8221; This conveys the idea, for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h&ccedil;p</font><font face="Palatino">,
means first to spread, to be diffused, and then to range at large, to leap, to
frisk. The context favors this view: they would go forth ,that is, from
confinement to the fields, and leap like calves of the stall, or from the stall,
which are tied up during the night but are let loose when the sun arises, and
allowed to range at large in the field.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To apply this as a prophecy to the escape of the
Christians from Jerusalem when destroyed by the Romans, has nothing in the
context to justify it, but everything to the contrary. The effect here produced
is ascribed to the influence of the Sun of righteousness, and it is exhilarating
and joyful, and followed, as it appears from the next verse, by the subjugation
of the wicked. <i>Calvin</i>&#8217;s view is consistent with the whole tenor of
the passage.&#8212;<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
